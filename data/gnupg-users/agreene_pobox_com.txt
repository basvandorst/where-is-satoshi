@_subject: Signature, fingerprint or public key? 
I suspect you mean "What is the commonly used means of authentication?" This
is not a simple subject, but I will attempt to answer only the question that
I think you are asking.
To associate an electronic object (email message, web page, other electronic
document) with a person, that person should sign the object using PGP/GPG.
A public key is just a means of checking the signature. A fingerprint is
just a way to identify a public key.
You do not need to include your public key in email messages, just include
your keyid. The keyid can be used to retrieve your key from key servers.

And if I did that to you with a paper letter, would that indicate a
problem with envelopes or the postal mail system? No. Fixing this is as
simple as identifying the recipient within the message itself... as is
typical in paper mail, but not in electronic mail.
This is not a cryptography problem, it is a human communications problem.

I think he means the From, To, Date, and Subject headers, all of which are
known to the mail client at the time of composition. If mail clients
inserted this data into the message before calling PGP, that would be an
automated solution to the problem, assuming these headers had enough
specific information to be of any help.

It is better not to sign ambiguous messages.
The From header would not have to match the signing key. That header, and
the others, would be added to the text of the message itself to reduce the

We won't advance the cause by being religious about it. Sometimes GNU

The freeware versions of PGP are still the most functional choice for
personal use on Windows. If I had realized that 6.5.8 was unmaintained, I
would have recommended the 7.x series instead, especially if 7.x includes
a plug-in for her mail client.
I will not recommend an encryption tool that does not include a plug-in
over one that does for a non-technical email user on Windows. It just does
not make sense, no matter what license they have. As long as the data they
produce is OpenPGP compliant, it makes no difference.

It's called S/MIME and it's in the IETF process just like OpenPGP. S/MIME
started with the support of large mail client vendors, including Microsoft,
Lotus, and Netscape. At the time, PGP just did not have the necessary
feature set, and was owned by a single company.
Times have changed, but Netscape and Outlook still support S/MIME. To sign
message with S/MIME you'll have to get a certificate from an S/MIME
Certificate Authority (CA), most of whom charge for the service.

Actually, the linefeed is a known control character in Linux, so it is not
displayed. Ctrl-M (^M) is a carriage return. In fact, if *every* line has a
carriage return and linefeed, vi/vim would ignore both and note in the
status line that the file is in DOS format. But if some lines have both and
some only linefeeds, then the carriage returns will be displayed in vi/vim
as ^M (Ctrl-M). Some GNOME/Gtk editors will only show an extra space at the
end of the line. Each editor may handle this situation differently.

compares this decrypted hash with a hash it generates itself. If they match,
the signature is verified. But it needs the signer's public key to decrypt

@_subject: PRZ Marks PGP's 10th Anniversary 
As received on the PGP Users Mailing List
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
Today marks the 10th anniversary of the release of PGP 1.0.
It was on this day in 1991 that I sent the first release of PGP to a
couple of my friends for uploading to the Internet.  First, I sent it
to Allan Hoeltje, who posted it to Peacenet, an ISP that specialized
in grassroots political organizations, mainly in the peace movement.
Peacenet was accessible to political activists all over the world.
Then, I uploaded it to Kelly Goen, who proceeded to upload it to a
Usenet newsgroup that specialized in distributing source code.  At my
request, he marked the Usenet posting as "US only".  Kelly also
uploaded it to many BBS systems around the country.  I don't recall
if the postings to the Internet began on June 5th or 6th.
It may be surprising to some that back in 1991, I did not yet know
enough about Usenet newsgroups to realize that a "US only" tag was
merely an advisory tag that had little real effect on how Usenet
propagated newsgroup postings.  I thought it actually controlled how
Usenet routed the posting.  But back then, I had no clue how to post
anything on a newsgroup, and didn't even have a clear idea what a
newsgroup was.
It was a hard road to get to the release of PGP.  I missed five
mortgage payments developing the software in the first half of 1991.
To add to the stress, a week before PGP's first release, I discovered
the existence of another email encryption standard called Privacy
Enhanced Mail (PEM), which was backed by several big companies, as
well as RSA Data Security.  I didn't like PEM's design, for several
reasons.  PEM used 56-bit DES to encrypt messages, which I did not
regards as strong cryptography.  Also, PEM absolutely required every
message to be signed, and revealed the signature outside the
encryption envelope, so that the message did not have to be decrypted
to reveal who signed it.  Nonetheless, I was distressed to learn of
the existence of PEM only one week before PGP's release.  How could I
be so out of touch to fail to notice something as important as PEM?
I guess I just had my head down too long, writing code.  I fully
expected PEM to crush PGP, and even briefly considered not releasing
PGP, since it might be futile in the face of PEM and its powerful
backers.  But I decided to press ahead, since I had come this far
already, and besides, I knew that my design was better aligned with
protecting the privacy of users.
After releasing PGP, I immediately diverted my attention back to
consulting work, to try to get caught up on my mortgage payments.  I
thought I could just release PGP 1.0 for MSDOS, and leave it alone
for awhile, and let people play with it.  I thought I could get back
to it later, at my leisure.  Little did I realize what a feeding
frenzy PGP would set off.  Apparently, there was a lot of pent-up
demand for a tool like this.  Volunteers from around the world were
clamoring to help me port it to other platforms, add enhancements,
and generally promote it.  I did have to go back to work on paying
gigs, but PGP continued to demand my time, pulled along by public
I assembled a team of volunteer engineers from around the world.
They ported PGP to almost every platform (except for the Mac, which
turned out to be harder).  They translated PGP into foreign
languages.  And I started designing the PGP trust model, which I did
not have time to finish in the first release.  Fifteen months later,
in September 1992, we released PGP 2.0, for MSDOS, several flavors of
Unix, Commodore Amiga, Atari, and maybe a few other platforms, and in
about ten foreign languages.  PGP 2.0 had the now-famous PGP trust
model, essentially in its present form.
It was shortly after PGP 2.0's release that US Customs took an
interest in the case.  Little did they realize that they would help
propel PGP's popularity, helping to ignite a controversy that would
eventually lead to the demise of the US export restrictions on strong
Today, PGP remains just about the only way anyone encrypts their
email.  And now there are a dozen companies developing products that
use the OpenPGP standard, all members of the OpenPGP Alliance, at

True, but sometimes people feel it's needed for automated signing. They may
as well use a key that does not have a passphrase. That's fine if you just
need to verify the origin of the message.
If the issue is making sure the message was not mangled by some mail server
or other software along the way, then the CRC that is automatically done
should be sufficient. The last line of text in an armored message is a 32bit
CRC. If the armor is damaged in transit, the CRC fails and the message will
not be decrypted.

important to the subject program. So you should be able to find info on the
options file using:
  man gpg
  /FILES
The search is case-sensitive so those two strings are not equivalent. Use
"q" to quit. Viewing a man page using less is more functional than viewing
it using the GUI viewers I've seen.=20
That still does not give gpg any data to process. You need to specify a file
or redirect a file using:
  gpg < encrypted_input.asc > plaintext_result.txt
  gpg -sea -r recipient_keyid < plaintext_input.txt > encrypted_result.asc
That command is for importing keys.
It would take days of back and forth on this list to figure this out. I
recommend a review of the man page and some practice at the command line
using the included examples:

encrypted messages is a waste of time. If you want to trust the data the app
produces, you just have to safeguard the machine. A GPG sig doesn't add any

Hash: SHA1
[excerpt of a paper by Don Davis]
Charlie sees that the message was not signed by Alice and contacts her to
verify the status of their deal. Unsigned messages are worthless in this
context, encrypted or not.
When verifying authorship, the presence or absence of a valid signature is
relevant, the presence or absence of encryption is not.
Perhaps a different example would make it clear. Suppose banks had the
means to routinely and positively verify the signatures on checks, and
that they in fact routinely did so. If I sent you an unsigned check, do
you think the bank would just assume I wrote it and cash it for you
without my signature? Given that the bank could readily identify
forgeries, it would also be pointless for you to sign my name (in fact,
since forgery is a crime, it would be counterproductive for you to sign my
name). Therefore an unsigned check would be worthless to you. It would not
matter whether you received the check in an envelope (encrypted) or
attached to a postcard. When determining authorship, only signatures
matter, not encryption.
The headers aren't signed, so possessing the body of the message proves
Charlie may as well present a paper letter and envelope that has Alice's
return address typed on it. Anyone could have sent it.
For example, I could acquire a paper document and mail it to myself with
the author's return address on the envelope. According to Mr. Davis'
premise, the return address would "prove" that the author sent me the
document. Supposedly that would represent a flaw in the use of pen and ink
signatures, when it's actually a flaw in the thinking of whoever believes
return addresses on envelopes constitute proof of sender.
That's why analogous court cases usually revolve around issues of
fingerprints, signatures, access to the stationery, and other physical
links between the document and the purported sender. No one with any
knowledge of postal systems would assume proof of sender based on the
return address typed on the envelope, which could in fact be omitted.
Would an ommitted return address mean the letter sent itself?
Granted, email headers cannot be ommitted, but they're so easy to forge
that it would be laughable if it weren't for the number of spammers who
forge headers. Email headers are worthless, and the fact that they can be
forged has no bearing on the worth of public key digital signature
Either the posted summary leaves out some important details, or this paper
is seriously flawed.

In the Web of Trust model you essentially have to pick your own trusted

I have found that my preferred method of handling clearsigning with my

setting is hardcoded somewhere in the approx 8MB of uncompresed source code

That's a limitation of English. In Latin, there are two words: libre and
When the FSF says "free" they mean "libre". As implemented by the GPL,
that also implies "gratis".
Windows programmers usually use non-libre tools when creating software, so
they can almost never use a libre license for distribution. So Windows
users generally have no firsthand experience with libre software. Linux
and BSD users use libre software every day. I'd expect that most of us
understood immediately when Werner used the word "free".
I manage Windesktops at work, even though I use Linux as my primary
desktop at work and at home. Often I have to install, re-install, or
upgrade Winboxes and I get so tired of managing licenses and not being
able to truly diagnose problems that I sometimes want to scream. Libre
software has less problems in this area, primarily because it's also
gratis, and because the programmers make it relatively easy to see what's
going on. Providing support costs them time, so they make it easy to
figure out what's wrong. I'm only an novice programmer, but I've had
occasion to go in and fix things or change the default behavior of a
program by editing the code.
The point of all that is that even though Winusers tend to focus on the
gratis nature of Free Software, it's the libre nature that really makes
the difference. It's unfortunate that the FSF is so inflexible about the
terms it uses and that the choices in English are so limited.

has multiple meanings in English. I doubt if the first President Bush was

monetary price when it offers "buy one, get one free" deals.

adequate. It's fast, configurable, and stable. In combination with
fetchmail, and procmail, it enables me to quickly handle hundreds of
messages daily.
I'm a keyboard type, so I find it a lot faster to use shortcut keys than
to keep reaching for the mouse. Mutt also has these advantages, but pine
has an easier learning curve for newbies, so I learned it first. It may
not be as powerful as mutt, but it's Good Enough.
I found pgp4pine  to be a really good way to
use GnuPG or PGP with pine.

presumably be able to run from a floppy. A reasonably sized set of
keyrings, trustdb, and a random_seed file should fit too. It would not
make a good permanent setup, but you could carry it to a client's office

the registry setting by specifying "--homedir a:/" on the command line.

Try being a Linux user and calling a hardware vendor for assistance. Then
let's continue this discussion about users on a secondary platform being

That may be so in the Windows world as long as PGPFreeware is available,
but things change. I take sad satisfaction in the fact that I saw the
reduction in source code availabilty coming more than a year ago when I
first started using GnuPG. I started thinking about the dynamics of
commercial software and knew it was only a matter of time before there
were additioal restrictions put in place. There may come a time when
PGPFreeware is no longer available. Then what?
Nobody here responded like that to a user requesting assistance. You
started this with your rude rhetorical question asking "Why does *she*
have a choice?" That was followed by what sounded awfully like a demand
that the GPG Team do something about this.
The user that requested assistance never got a rude response; you did. If

No problem.
This paragraph is so Windows-centric that I'm not sure how to respond. The
whole mindset is different.
Okay, here goes.
The comment "instead of the end Users having to write their own
code" implies that the end users are somehow different from the
developers. That may be true as a practical matter, but really, who is it
that you think contributes code? The contributors are end users who also
know how to write code and took an interest in this project. Anyone who
knows how and has an interest can contribute. This implied dichotomy
between users and developers is a false one, no doubt based on the fact
that developers of proprietary software are the only ones who have access
to the code and the legal right to make changes to it. In the proprietary
world, there is a real dichotomy between users and developers, but in the
Free Software world, that just isn't true.
That's why suggestions that people who find problems attempt to fix them
themselves (ie; "write your own code") may only be half-facetious and
could actually be meant as a real suggestion. Often the developers have a
day job or are otherwise very busy. A useful patch may be very
I'm not a C/C++ guy myself, but I've written HTML for years and I have a
fair grasp of English. So when I have a few hours, I do some work on the
Linux Documentation Project. I don't program for a living. I'm just a guy
who has an interest in Linux and has found a way to contribute. Do my
contributions to the LDP make me somehow different from those who use the
documents? No, but if they're from Windows World, they may not realize
that getting a HOWTO updated may be as easy as typing up the changes and
sending them to the maintainer, or directly to the LDP if the maintainer
is not responsive. If the person is sufficiently interested, they can take
over maintenance of the document. I've seen that happen several times. The
database that tracks document status documents many cases where documents
have changed hands over the years.  Each time the new maintainer was an
"end user" who saw a need to fix the documentation and had the will and
skill to "write their own code." In the Free Software world, the end users
and the developers are often the same people.
Hmmm... I looked on the download page, and all I saw listed were versions

no doubt you're correct. If so, then any Win2k users who has a problem
should, at a minimum, try to repeat it and send a good description of the
problem to the maintainers.

That's what clearsigning is for.
If you want to sign file that's not plain text and leave the file
unchanged, then you will need to use a detached sig. But you cannot embed
the detached sig into the file, because that changes the file and
invalidates the sig.
My recommendation is that the signer make a detached sig and archive it
along with the document. A copy of the sig would be posted on a web server
that's accessible to anyone who might need to verify the document and the
sig's URL would be included in the document.

I like signing everything because it establishes a track record.
I only did it occasionally when I stopped using a mail client that made it
easy. Then I setup pgp4pine and the whole process takes barely more time
than sending unsigned. Incoming messages are decrypted/verified
transparently. Pine only displays the GPG output, so I never see the armor
headers or signature block. All I see is 2-8 lines of GPG status messages
at the end of the message. With tools like pgp4pine or a correctly
configured GUI plug-in, it's easy to sign and verify mail.
Another reason I sign everything is to spread knowledge of PGP/GnuPG.
Imagine that PGP and/or GnuPG were regularly being used by just 25% of
U.S. Internet users. There would be little support in Congress for

I read mail in a mailer that does not natively support HTML, although I
can view HTML if I like by lauching a browser as a viewer. But if there is
no plain text message part and I have to choose between launching a

Hash: SHA1
I get a total of over 200 messages a day from friends, mailing lists, and
spammers. I respond to a dozen or two each day. I'm a fairly good typist
for a non-clerical worker, so I find using the keyboard exclusively to be
faster than alternating between the keyboard and a mouse.
So I use fetchmail, procmail, and mutt/vim, and sendmail to handle mail.
Fetchmail is relatively easy to configure and I only have to setup my
accounts once, no matter how many times I change mail clients.
Procmail is the best mail filter utility I've ever seen. It's fast,
configurable, and extensible. It's easy to setup for basic filtering using
the examples in the procmailex man page.
Mutt is so configurable that you basically need to copy someone else's
~/.muttrc to get started. That presents something of a learning curve, but
the payoff in power is worth it. I put it off for a while and continued to
use Pine (which is also no slouch in the power department). Then one day I
got tired of listening to mutt users talk about how great it is. I got a
muttrc file of the 'net and got started. Now I'll never go back. You can
makeup key combinations and macros to do just about anything. It has good
support for PGP/MIME using either PGP or GnuPG and can handle in-line PGP
messages if you use procmail to change the MIME type so that mutt thinks
it's PGP/MIME instead of text/plain. I use procmail for that task. Another
way to view in-line PGP messages is to tell mutt to pipe the message to
GPG and 'less'. It's not as functional as the PGP/MIME hack, but it works.
I use vim as my editor because I use it for everything else anyway. I just
setup a vimrc file that includes macros for clearsign, encrypt, and
sign+encrypt. After editing, I use a macro like ":cs" to clearsign, enter
my password, save (ZZ), and send (y).
This may not be for everyone, but I've found that it works really well for
me and lets me handle a lot of mail each day without getting swamped. And
I never have a problem with GPG that is related to the mailer.

Hash: SHA1
This is exactly what would happen if the data were changed after it was
signed. The hashed data is all there and readily interpreted by GPG. It
can get the keyid, and probably the date/time of signing. It's just that
the signed data does not match the hash.
This is also what would happen if the verifying app used a different hash
algorithm than the originating app.
I seem to remember that OpenPGP says that clearsigned messages must either
specify the hash algorithm, or use the MD5 hash. This allows
interoperatbility with PGP 2.6x, which used MD5 and did not specify a hash
algorithm in the clearsigned header. The header of the test message does
not specify a hash, so it should be using MD5.
But when I tried to verify the message, GPG output:
gpg: Signature made Wed 31 Jul 2002 09:49:03 AM EDT using DSA key ID
gpg: BAD signature from "Konrad Podloucky "
Note the "DSA key". That probably means it used the SHA1 hash, but failed
to say so in the header.
So I edited the message to add the hash header and low and behold:
gpg: Signature made Wed 31 Jul 2002 09:49:03 AM EDT using DSA key ID
gpg: Good signature from "Konrad Podloucky "
The app that generated this message is not OpenPGP compliant. Apparently
NAI PGP allows for this kind of broken input, but GPG does not.

It might be a useful header if it was part of the spec and could therefore
become reliably supported by mail clients. But it's not and it isn't.
On a discussion list where the answers to questions are an integral part
of the list's function, setting Reply-To to the list address is entirely
appropriate. I've heard all the arguments and on a list where the majority
of the replies will be intended for the list, the list software should set
the Reply-To.
But I've gotten tired of debating this, so I set my procmail filters to
set a Reply-To for those lists where I think it's appropriate. So I just
use the Reply function of whatever mailer I'm using and the reply goes to
the list, as I almost always intend. On the exceptional occasion when I
want to reply off-list, I copy/paste the author's address. That's the

Mutt is a great mailer that does a lot of things correctly, but we have to
exchange mail with people using broken and limited mailers. In that
environment, advocating the use of a header that's not even part of the

I'm assuming you're taling about a GUI front end for GPG.
I used tkpgp for a while, but it was not worth the trouble. I generally use GPG for email. I run pine and used it display/send filter functions to pipe the text through GPG. It sounds harder than it is. The bottom line is that after setting it up, Pine calls GPG automatically to handle in incoming signed and/or encrypted messages and I get an offer to sign or sign/encrypt each outgoing message. It just doesn't get much easier.
If you use KMail or Evolution, GPG support is included.
If you need to process files, the command line is simple:
  gpg --encrypt filename --recipient [userid substring OR keyid]
  gpg --sign filename
  gpg --clearsign textfile
  gpg --decrypt filename (automatically checks signature too)
  gpg --verify filename (automatically retrieves key if necessary)
I spent some time looking for GUI front ends, but the commands are simple enough that I eventually concluded that it was a waste of time to spend hours fooling around with GUIs.

I think you misunderstood the answer. The "corporate key" is not used by
everyone. It is used by a sysadmin to sign employees' individual keys.
Employees' GnuPG would be setup to trust the corporate key-signing key so
that any individual key signed by the corporate key would automatically be
valid to all employees.
There is no built-in limitation on what keys could be verified. Internal
as well as external keys could be verified. The corporate *key-signing*
key could have very limited access and need not even be exposed to the
network. Keys could be signed on a standalone machine and transferred via
CDROM to the keyserver.
The corporation might have other keys, but having one just for keysigning
would allow for strong and simple security measures to be applied.

The first two lines set some reasonable formatting options for email. The
last three lines give me a decent set of colors for my dark-background
terminal window. The three lines in the middle specify key combinations
for GPG actions. The es and ee (encrypt/sign, encrypt) macros require me
to type or paste in the recipient's email address or keyid.

 - Built-in support for the big two encryption schemes (OpenPGP, S/MIME)

 - Automatic generation or import of keys during mail client setup.
 - Establishment of non-commercial CAs that issue cost-free certs that
   are accepted by most encryption implementations in their default
   configuration. Govt agencies could issue certs along with other
   identity documents.
 - Message is automatically encrypted if all recipients are able and
   willing to process encrypted mail.
 - Mail client encrypts replies to encrypted messages.
 - Mail client can cache decryption password if allowed by user. This
   allows auto-decrypt when recipient attempts to view the message.
 - Different authentication token (password) for signature and decryption

Have you taken a look at the GnuPG manual lately? GnuPG can do lots of
things that PGP cannot do. There is no way to reproduce all those options
in a GUI and still have an easy to use interface. In the last 24 hours two
options were added in reponse to a user with a lost public key. If that
kind of responsiveness had to be put on hold because it would take too
long to put it into an GUI, then GnuPG would not be as good as it is.
In any case, the features you are referring to will not be used by 90%+ of
users. They will not care about trust values or key management. They won't
know anything about their keyrings and won't care. Nor should they. This
stuff does not need a good interface. It needs to drop out of sight. It
needs to become as transparent and automatic as SSL.
People don't care about the interface for managing SSL keys and certs and
they shouldn't have to care about the interface for managing OpenPGP keys
and certs. This stuff should be built into mail software the same way SSL
is built into browsers. Until it is, it just won't be widely used.

If the GUI is just a wrapper, then that's true. If the GUI is part of the
program, then it should prevent certain combinations of input, provide
warnings, and otherwise behave as an integral part of GnuPG. That is not
nearly so simple. Designing wizards to ask the right questions and process
input is tedious, and often complicated.
Tcl/Tk and java make usable cross platform GUIs. There is at least one
person who is willing to work on this kind of project, but it's not me. I
have built just enough end user apps to know very well that there is a
significant PITA factor in designing apps that must reliably process input
from potentially clueless users.
It wasn't a matter of answering a question. The application code was
updated to add a feature in response to a post on this list. The interface
change was a relatively simple matter of allowing another command line
option. Fitting those same options into a GUI is not necessarily so

I am going to respond on the assumption that you mean the gnupg-users
list, since that is where this thread started (you put gnupg-users in
the Cc header). Your comments support this assumption (you commented
about the list, not the web site).
Your first assumption is faulty. OpenPGP (and GnuPG) only help to
provide a tamper-evident function for data. In other words, a
clearsigned statement that "Up is the same as Down" will validate just
as well as a clearsigned statement that "Up is the opposite of Down".
The use of GnuPG only ensures that it is clear that the data has or has
not been tampered with since the time that the signer signed it. It has
no function in verifying the correctness or reliability of the

This assumption is at least unprovable. For one thing, the terms are not
defined well enough (How much error is allowed before information is
"unreliable"? How do you measure error?).
Besides that, you are still talking about information, when GnuPG deals
with data, not information.
(To convert data into information, you must apply interpretation and
derive meaning. Data can be accurate, but meaningless until it is turned
into information. In this context, GnuPG can provide confidence that
data is unchanged, but it has nothing to say about the information
 >then discussions about modern war are not off topic.
A conclusion based on faulty assumptions.
If you oppose the war, fine. Just please do not pretend that discussions
of the war are on-topic for the gnupg-users mailing list. They're not.
I have my own position on the war, and on many other issues. I express
those opinions in forums where those opinions are relevant. In this
forum, I express opinions about GnuPG, OpenPGP, and some related
security and privacy issues. Those issues are "on-topic".
My (sometimes very strong) opinions about other topics are expressed
elsewhere. I respectfully request that you, and others who feel like
you, respect the purpose of this particular forum, and stay on-topic.
If you would like to debate the war, I will join you in some other
forum, prefereably private email, but probably in any forum appropriate
to discussions about the war. Whatever, you decide about issuing that
invitation, this is really not the place for that debate, no matter how
strongly people feel about it.
Strong feelings do not convert an off-topic issue into an on-topic

Setup a filter for "List-Id:" header contains "gnupg-users.gnupg.org". The devel list will be similar.
If you have an older version of Outlook, you may not be able to specify the "List-Id:" header. You may have to setup a filter that looks for "gnupg-users.gnupg.org" anywhere in the header.

you really want to make it clear exactly what's in the file:
"OpenPGP-Key-0x6C94239D.asc". Using the keyID also dramatically reduces
the chances of filename collision. The 8.3 days are long gone. We may as
well take advantage of modern file systems and use informative file names.

In your example, the OpenPGP MIME message part headers are outside the

that includes the appropriate email headers as signed and/or encrypted

I stand corrected.
I expect that signing the MIME headers is a PITA for PGP/MIME
implementers. You pretty much have to write PGP/MIME into the mail client.
The level of integration needed for it to work properly would be difficult
with a plugin.

--sign outputs data which is not human-readable, and may be in binary or ASCII armored form.

Not quite. Both options create a file that contains both the signed data and the signature. You may be thinking of --detach-sign.
The only difference between --sign and --clearsign is whether the output is human-readable.

@_subject: Q. about difference between -sign and -clearsign 
No.  --sign creates data+signature that is not human readable. The output may be binary, or it may be ASCII armor (--armor or -a option). In either case, you cannot read the data until it is processed by OpenPGP. The data is not human-redable.
--clearsign create data+signature where the data remains human readable. You need OpenPGP to verify the sig, but if you just need to read the text, you do not need any special software. The data is human-readable.
Both calculate the signature the same way. The difference is in the *output format*.

@_subject: encryption 
Yes. What it actually does is generate a one time key for use with this
session (session key). The session key is relatively small (128 bits --
about 16 alphanumeric characters worth of data). The message is encrypted
once using this session key. Then the session key is encrypted once for
each recipient (using that recipient's public key) and added to the
encrypted message. So the total size of the encrypted data gets larger
with each additional recipient, but only a little -- enough for an
encrypted session key.
Each recipient is able to decrypt the session key using their private key,
then use the session key to decrypt the message.
It means that your key is added to the list of recipient keys each time
you choose to encrypt a message.

@_subject: signing header required? 
Yes, it is required. OpenPGP applications have to know where the signed
data starts and where it ends. There is no garuntee that the entire
message body will be signed. For instance, suppose I forward your message
to someone else, or I send you an archived copy of a signed message. Or
suppose and email app sends the entire message, mail headers and all, to
an OpenPGP app for processing. In these cases, the OpenPGP data needs to
be marked.

Hash: SHA1
Mr. Zimmermann,
I have been a PGP user and privacy advocate for years. I am bothered by
the omission of a link to GnuPG on the Download page of the OpenPGP.org
web site.  GnuPG is the second most widely used OpenPGP application, and
the only one that ships with an operating system (actually, I believe it
ships with more than one OS). There are email clients that are designed
specifically to include support for GnuPG. GnuPG, as implied by it's name,
is part of the GNU Project, and is not going to go away anytime soon.
The omission of GnuPG may indeed be a simple human omission on an old
seldom-updated site, but the situation has endured for too long. The
omission now appears to be deliberate, whatever the truth may be.
GnuPG is significant. There should be a link to it on the Download page of
the OpenPGP web site.

I saw that, but that is a member's site, not a direct reference to GnuPG as an implementation of OpenPGP.
Also not a direct reference from the OpenPGP Alliance.
My objection is that the OpenPGP Alliance seems to only care about supporting and promoting "PGP", not OpenPGP compliant software.

This following an Iraqi invasion of a sovereign country. Iraqi soldiers
were looting Kuwait City and the protesters were criticizing the U.S. for
threatening to kick them back into Iraq. Puleeez.
I would give more credibility to these protests if there were ever a time

U.S. is *always* wrong.
Never mind that the Kuwaitis had just lost their country.

the protesters had not protested against, had been removed and destroyed,
along with the U.S. missiles they'd been protesting. They were protesting
the very missiles that played a critical part in making them safer. Not
that you'd ever get them to admit it.
These people have demonstrated only one thing; they are not to be taken

Keyservers make casual use of cryptography between strangers easier. They

There are much easier ways to get email addresses (which also implies much
easier ways to get usernames). In the early days of PGP, cryptography was
so geeky and spam so against the prevailing attitude, that spammers would
have been inviting retaliation by targeting PGP users. These days there
are too many easy/cheap/fast ways to get hundreds of thousands of email
addresses to worry about harvesting keyservers.
