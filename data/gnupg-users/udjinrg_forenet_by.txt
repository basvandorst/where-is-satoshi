@_subject: gnupg.mo 
I'm use russian .mo and I have problem.
Windows console is cp866, but all winwdows programs is cp1251.
I see all right in console and adracadabra in all win apps :(
May be use --charset for displaing GnuPG messages in future versions?
Do you add additional codepages (cp866,cp1251, etc.) in future version?

It usefull only for Linux. Russian is: utf-8 and koi8-r
win32 uses cp866 and cp1251 for Russian.
=> Only koi8-r or You have to patch gnupg and add support 866/1251 and
   use cp1251 under Linux (best for compatibility (afaik))
   I think I can send you it.
GnuPG doesn't encode content of messages. You shoult look at your mutt (imho)

I created new chat room on jabber.ru:
room: gnupg-ru server: conference.jabber.ru
There is gnupg also.
For use it, you should have XMPP / Jabber account and client with conference support.
Clients is: tkabber, psi, gaim, iChat and many others.
Public servers is: jabber.org, jabber.ru, gtalk.google.com and many others.

I not used gajim yet. I prefer tkabber and psi at the moment.
Tkabber can sign messages with gnupg.
PSI/Tkabber can encrypt messages with gnupg.
