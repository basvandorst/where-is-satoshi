I believe most PGP Keyservers are set to strip photos off when the receive
the key.

I have a public key which includes an image (like the copy of Phil
Zimmerman's key which is distributed with PGP).  The key was made with GnuPG
1.0.4.  I have no trouble using it under PGP 7.0.3 or GnuPG 1.0.4, and if I
hand or email the *.asc file to someone, they get the picture as well.
The problem is that when I 'send' to a server, or cut and paste, the server
takes the key without complaint,  but then when I download the key later, it
appears without the image. I've tried this from PGP's GUI, GPG's command
line, Geheimnis's GUI, cut and paste, and to four or five servers.
If you download Zimmerman's key, you get one WITHOUT an image. So it is not
clear if the OpenPGP protocol supports it.
Is there a way to put keys on a server so that people get them with the
picture?  If the protocol allows it, then what am I doing wrong?

If there was discussion of Packet 17 (the one NAI uses for Photo IDs) you
would want to look for it in the OpenPGP mail archives.  I looked for a
short bit and didn't see anything obvious.
The OpenPGP group at the IETF can be found here:
Because the name of the mailing list changed due to spam, you should use
this link to get to the archive.  The link listed at the OpenPGP (IETF) home
page has an extra hyphen in it and shouldn't be used.

Thanks for the clarification. The public keys returned by the server do not
have any invalid signatures in them, so far as I can tell.
Is there any discussion of Photo ID or Biometric ID becoming part of a

    I can import the X509 cert into PGP6.5.8 on windows. Can I import it
into GPG on Linux?
    I have tried to export it again from PGP6.5.8, make a pgp form .asc
file, and transfer it to Linux, then run gpg --import key.file, it failed:
    gpg: signature packet without keyid
    gpg: key DA326647: no valid user IDs
    gpg: this may be caused by a missing self-signature
    gpg: Total number processed: 1
    gpg:           w/o user IDs: 1
    Then, how can I import the x509 cert into gpg?
