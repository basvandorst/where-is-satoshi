@_subject: Supported Cards 
Hello all,
Firstly, I'd like to apologize for my lack of understanding in all  things related to SmartCards.
Just recently (having finally managed to keep my key for a year - I  usually forget to back them up when rebuilding my PC) I've decided  it's time to invest in a SmartCard system.
I've come across the OpenPGP [0] card which is supported in gnupg  1.4.0 and above, however when trying to contact them didn't hear back.  SmartcardFoucus seems to be a fairly comprehensive site [1], so I was  wondering if someone on the list would be kind enough to point me at  which cards I'll be able to use to store my key ?
