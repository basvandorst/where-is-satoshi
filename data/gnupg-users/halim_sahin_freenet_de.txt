Hi Folks,
I am currently testing to setup my new card for gpg.
First I have installed pcscd and the card seems working
gpg --card-status shows some data :-).
I was able to change Name and sex but not the pin/adminpin.
Admin commands are allowed
Command> passwd
gpg: OpenPGP card no. D2760001240102000005000004750000 detected

Unfortunately I have a new problem!
I have changed my towitoko cardreader with an usb version of reiner
Installed the drivers from gentoo.
gpg is at version 2.0.14
User added to cyberjack group.
The testprrogramm cyberjack reports no errors.
pcscd is running as well.
gpg --cardstatus works but I can not change anything on the card.
gpg --card-edit
