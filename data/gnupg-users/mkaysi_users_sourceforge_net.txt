Have you set the charset to use in Thunderbird? "charset UTF-8" in
gpg.conf doesn't affect emails, which you send, but I am still using
it in addition to Icedove charset.
Edit --> Preferences --> Display --> Advanced (on right of Default
font) --> Character encodings. Set both outgoing and incoming to UTF-8
and select "When possible, use the default character encoding in replies".
I am using Icedove (Debian version of Thunderbird) and as far as I can
know, my emails can be verified and they are written with UTF-8. Also
my ??? should work (they are also Finnish chars, not only

Laurent, Enigmail says
gpg -komento ja -tuloste:
gpg: malformed CRC
gpg: quoted printable character in armor - probably a buggy MTA has
been used
for your email and fails to verify your signature. I think that the
problem is spaces before your KeyID.
gpg2 directly gives same error.

I don't know about crypto sticks nor smart cards, but you cannot
change email address in key, nor remove it (or if you do, keyservers
will still contain the old uid).
You can use gpg --edit-key KEYID and then select the uid with correct
number and give command "revuid", so the uid appears as revoked to
people who get your key.

There is APG (Android Privacy Guard) in Google Play Store, which can
be used by e.g. K9 Mail, which can sign, decrypt and encrypt messages.
I am not sure can it generate keys, by itself, but it accepts keys
created in gnupg.
More information at [APG home page] and [K9 Mail Google Code page].
