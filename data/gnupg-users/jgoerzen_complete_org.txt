@_subject: Setting default UID 
Where does one find this RFC2440bis2?  I've never heard of such a
naming scheme for RFCs...

@_subject: Setting default UID 
I recently added a new UID to my public key but now GPG wants it to be
the default for everything.  I want one of my existing UIDs to be the
default, but I cannot find any documentation ANYWHERE on how to find
this.  With gpg --edit, gpg seems to put a dot next to the default
uid, but there is not even any mention of this in the manual.  Ideas?

@_subject: Selecting signing key 
I have a key with two subkeys that are available for signing.  I wish
occasionally to select a specific key to use for signing -- either my
"master" key (a 1024D key) or one of the subkeys.  I cannot figure out
how to force it to use a master key for signing files or keys.  Hints?
Anytime I specify 8A1D9A1F as the key to use with signing (ie with
-u), it will use one of the subkeys.

@_subject: Win32 passphrase proposal 
AFAIK nobody is seriously advocating using it for that.  This is just
so that other programs can read the passphrase from the user and pass
it directly to gpg in a hopefully secure fashion.
The environment is insecure also.
Still gpg will have to have an automated way to figure it out from the
mangle.  So if gpg can figure it out, so can anyone else.  You have
gained nothing.

@_subject: Win32 passphrase proposal 
I see no difference.  What you are proposing is the functional
equivolent of rot-13.  The fact that minimal effort is required to
find the cleartext does not to me seem an impediment to someone intent
on finding the cleartext.

@_subject: error sending key : eof 
Because it only occurs with that server, it's safe to assume that
server is at fault.  It's complaining of a closed socket -- the other
serverclosed the network connection prematurely.

@_subject: Key rejected by keyservers 
Hello everyone,
I have GPG public key (id 8A1D9A1F, included below) that is being at
least partially rejected by wwwkeys.us.pgp.net and
keyring.debian.org.  Over the past two days, I have added three new
subkeys to the key and updated the expiration on an existing subkey.
However, the keyserver refuses to import it, complaining:
Key block in add request contained no new
keys, userid's, or signatures.
Your key block contained 3 format errors,
which were treated as if the erroneous elements
hadn't been part of your submission.
The last error was on key 0x1c558d87:
Key block corrupt: more than one signature on subkey
This has me entirely baffled.  I cannot find anything in any FAQ,
manual, or manpage about it.  Help would be immensely appreciated!

Thanks guys.  I've contacted the mailing list for pksd and have
discovered that this bug has been known since 1999 apparently.  What
hapens is the code literally concatenates the binary data for all your
subkey signatures together into a single one and ignores all but one
subkey (they assume that each keypair has exactly one subkey and
exactly one subkey signature).  This results in, of course, major
I've found the problem in the code but fixing it is beyond my skill
level at the moment, unfortunately.  And alas, gnupg
--{send,recv}-keys doesn't work with keyserver.pgp.com.  In the
meantime, all the pgp.net servers have corrupted my key on them to the
point where it it useless for encryption!

@_subject: Keyservers (was: Re: Dumb Question) 
Unfortunately, I have run into trouble.  If you have multiple subkeys, esp.
with revokations on some, that server can mangle them beyond recognition.

Right tool for the job.  PGP is not really good for this.  Most modern mail
servers have TLS support, which should do what you want.  Postfix, for
instance, has a robust implementation.

@_subject: E-Mail Encryption: Why Isn't Everyone Doing It? 
[replying to Ed Suominen]
I really see no difference in ease of use between this and e-mailing people,
other than the fact that you downplay key verification and provide no
coverage for web of trust while likely insecurely passing passphrases
between processes and providing no support for cross-platform communication.
Either way, you still have to set up a public key.  In fact, I maintain that
e-mailing is easier because you don't have to obtain an FTP account

In my opinion, MORE problems come about by making false claims of security,
giving people a false sense of security and then having bad consequences. This is a situation in which you have to be paranoid.
Hopefully the person expecting desert has not been told that there is an
entire cake available :-)
It's not a bad thing per se; it's just a bad thing if done insecurely.
On a Unix machine, any user can view the command line of any program you
run.  The root user can view the environment of any process and generally
its memory space as well.  This does not require a trojan or more than
"first week Unix 101" knowledge.  Unix applications passing sensitive data
should use things like pipes or other socketed items.
Likewise, Windows has its own set of ways to not pass data between
processes.  Instruct a user, and they will be able to do some of it.
Enlighten a user, and they will be yours forever :-)
If you teach them why they need encryption and how it works, it's not that
hard to grasp.
Make them paranoid and there ya are.

@_subject: have gnupg 1.0.7 gonna publish my key. 
However, the storage of keys is mostly unreliable, and continues to have
problems with mangling keys with multiple subkeys.  GnuPG even recently
added a workaround to *partially* work around that bug; but as the actual
keys are mangled, it's hard for GnuPG to completely work around it.  Try
requesting my key (8A1D9A1F) from that network and try to import it.  It's
not going to work.
My own opinion is that most anything is better than a network that can't
even store a key reliably.
