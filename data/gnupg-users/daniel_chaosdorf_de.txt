@_subject: pgp4pine 1.75 and gpg 1.0.1 - "no key fund" - damm! 
(please use the cc cause im not on ya list! thanks a lot!)
i installed gpg, pgp4 and when i want to send a message with
pine/pgp4 it says
"daniel ... no key found"
I create a new keypair today and gpg lists them correctly!
on the pgp4pine page i dont find any hint or a mailinglist
or something
and the faq etc is a shame ;-)
do you have any hints ?
thank you very much for ya time and help!

i tried to send the mail to my own address and wanted to
encrypt it / sign it!
to test the whole thing!
so their was this " daniel  no key found"
