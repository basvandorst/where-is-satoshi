Hash: SHA1
installed the egd, idea, and rsa modules. When I ran gpg --import to move
my PGP 5.0 keys to gpg I got the following errors. It appears that most of
the keys got moved but I'm at a loss to figure out what the problem is
with the additional modules. I also changed my option file to point to the
rndunix module and got a similar complaint about it. Any help would be
greatly appreciated.

dynamically loaded modules under Solaris 2.5 no matter how hard you try.
when I moved rndegd from a loaded module to a static internal, that part
at least started to work. I wonder if there is anyway to make the rsa and
idea modules static? It sure would be nice to have them.

My Makefiles now reflect the correct switches. I have to leave for work
now so I'll compile it later and see what happens.

The new compile log shows that at link time the new switches were put into
effect but nothing has changed when I run the new executable. I still get
the same errors as before. Any other suggestions? I would really like to
get this to work.

That's exactly what I'm getting! I thought it was specific to Solaris 2.5,
but I see you're running Solaris 7. I've reported this already but haven't
had any sucess on finding a solution. If you find one, please please,
please let me know. I've been spending many hours and pulling my hair out
trying to get this problem solved.

I used -Wl -dy on your suggestion when I was trying to fix it before. It
had no effect on solving the errors.

Yes. It will work if I comment out the options or compile GPG statically.
I was using -Wl -dy.
So what's the difference? We have one report of it NOT working under
Solaris 7. Mine doesn't work under 2.5. Yet you seem to be ok. What
options did you use?

Here are some differences though. I don't have zlib.h or libz.a in
version included with GPG 1.0.0 itself. Where did you get yours? I wonder
if the lack of the prescribed library and header file is causing the
problem? I have been using --with-included-zlib during the configure.
is one rev newer than mine. Could this be suspect also?

Hello Everyone!
in GPG 1.0.0 for Solaris! It was a matter of pathing. It turns out that my
path looked in /usr/local/bin for ld before it looked in /usr/ccs/bin.
configure always found the GNU ld before it found the stock ld and used it
first. By renaming the GNU ld to something else configure was forced to
find the Solaris version of ld. This fixed everything. I'm now able to
load dynamic modules without errors. It only took me 2 weeks to find the
simple fix. :) So anyone having problems getting dynamic modules to work
under Solaris needs to make sure that the /usr/ccs/bin/ld loader is used.
I hope this report will get the configure script fixed in future releases.

I saw that. My problem was that configure was selecting it without my
knowledge. Oh well... Live and learn! :)
