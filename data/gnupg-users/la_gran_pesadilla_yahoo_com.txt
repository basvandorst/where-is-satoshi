Hello! i have the need to export my secret key in
order to use in other system. Well, when i do ./gpg -a --export it works fine for the public key, but when i to
./gpg -a --export-secret-keys my_name
it says:
gpg: my_name: user not found: secret key not available
gpg: WARNING: nothing exported
Well... i tried using my complete name, my coment, my
mail... where can i find my username?????
A ./gpg --fingerprint command shows this data:
"Ivan Hernandez (El inbatible)
where is my username???
thanks in advance.
