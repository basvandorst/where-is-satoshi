@_subject: Problem with PassPhrase in Batch. 
Sent: Thursday, February 26, 2015 1:17 PM
I have a pass phrase that contains an exclamation mark (!). I can decrypt fine manually, however when I try to put this into a batch file, and pipe the the pass phrase to the gpg command to decrypt the file, it doesn't work. Could the exclamation mark be causing the problem? Also, is there a way, in a batch file to escape this character?
Thanks in advance,

@_subject: What am I doing wrong?  
Hello all.
I'm having issues with encrypt and decrypt and I know it's something I'm doing wrong. I created a key with Kelopatra. Imported it into GNU Privacy Assistant. It shows up as Fully Valid.
Next, to test, I created the text file test.txt and used the following command to encrypt it.
gpg -e -u myuser at domain.net -r myuser at domain.net test.txt
The file test.txt.gpg showed up in my folder.
Next, I tried to decrypt it using the following syntax.
gpg -d test.txt.gpg
And I get the following error.
Gpg decryption failed: No secret key
Not sure what I'm doing wrong here. This used to not be an issue.
This is Windows Server 2012.
Thanks in advance

No, Only the Private keys show up. What I tried to create and test was a public key to give to a partner for encrypting files sent to us.

the -u myuser at domain.net is not doing anything here, because this is doing encryption and not signing.  so no secret key material is used in this step.
It sounds to me like you imported your public key but not your secret key.
Does your key show up in the output of "gpg --list-secret-keys"  ?

So you created a private and public key - then encrypted a file and you entered your passphrase (password you created when generating your keys)?
