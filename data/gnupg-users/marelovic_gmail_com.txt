@_subject: I am sure I did not forget my passphrase 
What I know is simple. I created a key today and tried it signing one file
and it worked. Now, few hours later, I cannot do anything, and a message is
wrong passphrase. I checked mod.time of secret keyring and it looks like was
not modified in meanwhile.
I am really confused, sure not have modified my passphrase, nor forget it,
but it simply does not work anymore.
Is there a way to check if secret key info was modified?

I made sure, both when creating keys and trying to use it, to be US keyboard
and CAPS LOCK off. After failures, I tried to turn on CAPS and change layout
with no success.
But I found errors in /var/log/messages regarding sda/hda. sda is HDD and
hda is DVD.

Nov  8 14:44:00 main kernel: [    6.384317]  sda:hda: packet command error:
tatus=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
Second error is probably after the key got corrupted. Is there significant
probability the key got corrupted since it is only one error?
