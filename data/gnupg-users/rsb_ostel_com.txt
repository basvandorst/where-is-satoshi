@_subject: How does trust work? 
I don't know if this is the right forum for this but I would like to
start off by thanking the contributors to GNUPG.  This program has
been much easier to understand and use than PGP for me.
I have read the documentation for GNUPG and experimented with it a
bit, and I have a good system established for using it as long as I
make sure that no more than one key exists for a given user and I
fully trust those keys.  I am trying to make the next step in the learning process, using the
trust database to simplify the acceptance of new keys.  My first
experiment went as follows:
I received a public key from Jim, which he told me was his "auth
key".  I verified the fingerprint over the phone, added it to my
keyring, signed it, marked it as fully trusted, and updated the trust
database.  The auth key does not expire.
Jim periodically sends me a new "communications key", with the same
UID, and, of course, a different key id.  These communications keys
regularly expire, before which time I will receive a new
communications key from Jim.  I am to encrypt all messages to Jim with
the current communications key he has sent me.  Supposedly, I need
only add his communications key to my keyring and it will be trusted. As I understand the trust database, a trust path should exist between
my secret key and all of Jim's communications keys, since I have
signed a fully trusted key of his UID.  However, when I attempt to
encrypt a message to Jim's communications key, I am always told by GPG
that, in fact, a valid trust path to this key does not exist.  This
causes me to take the extra(disconcerting) step of telling GPG that I
know what I'm doing before it will encrypt the key.
Well, I don't know what I'm doing because I obviously don't understand
how to complete a trust path.  I know I could sign his communications
keys and manually mark them trusted, but that would be cheating. Can
someone straighten me out here?  Is this even a valid application of
the trust database?
TIA - Rich

Thanks for the reply.  I really did all the things I said (sign, add,
trust, update. add, update, etc.).  I think the path of trust should
be complete as well, although I think my logic in my last e-mail was
flawed.  I assumed that who owns a key matters, and now I think it doesn't.
All that matters is that there is a "path of signatures" leading back
to my key.  I think the path of signatures here is complete, but gpg
claims there is not enough info to evaluate trust of my friend's comm-key. This is what --check-sigs and --edit-key reveal.  ID1 is his auth-key,
ID2 is his comm-key, ID3 is his comm-sub-key, and ID4 is my key ID.
The ID's 0, -1 and -2 are older keys used by the same individual.

(1)  Rich Bodo The two things that look suspicious here are that I have an old key of
his, and my own keys have no ownertrust assigned.  I don't think the
old key should matter whatsoever.  That my own key has no ownertrust
assigned is a surprise. O.K.  I guess having the secret key in my
secret keyring doesn't mean that I trust the owner.  I'm sure there is a
good reason for that, I just can't fathom it right now.  Let's see
what happens when I mark my own public key as full/ultimate
trust...NOPE :(.  GPG still tells me there is no path when I try to encrypt.
Here is the command I use:
gpg -o gpgfile -se -r ID2 clearfile
And here is the error I get:
No path leading to one of our keys found.

If you *really* know what you are doing, you may answer
the next question with yes
So I answer no.  Well, some new info, if no new solution.  If anyone
sees an obvious mistake, please let me know.

That was gpg output that I edited to shorten the key id's and change
the names.  The dates I did not change.  The key ID's refer to the
following keys:
ID4 - My key
ID3 - Subkey of Jim's comm-key
ID2 - Jim's comm-key
ID1 - Jim's auth-key
ID0 - Old key of Jim's
ID-1 - Old key of Jim's
ID-2 - Subkey of Jim's key with ID0
Note from the last message that I specify the key ID when I
encrypt, rather than an e-mail address.  Since those two keys (ID1
and ID-1) are different, can you recommend a solution, or a reason
this is not working?
Thanks -Rich
