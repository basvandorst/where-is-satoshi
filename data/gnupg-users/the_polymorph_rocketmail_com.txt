Hi all.
I have several questions about gnupg...
1). If someone sends an encrypted email to my yahoo mail acct., how do
I extract it? Do I have to copy and paste ( win32 ) it into a file with
( for example ) notepad?
2). If someone sends me their public key, how do I extract it yahoo
mail? Since I am using a service ( no commmand line ) I am not sure.
3). I have often seen digital signatures appended to email messages or
posted on personal web sites. What do I do with these? Extract to a
I am using a win32 machine for all encryption / decryption.
Thanks, Caitlin.
 And now for something really spectacular...?              Do You Yahoo!?

@_subject: GnuPG neophyte inquiries. 
Hi all.
Ok. I'm quite interested in GnuPG but I felt compelled to ask a few
questions. Ready?
1). My roommate and I share a WinXP box. If I install GnuPG 1.4.5 on
it, would this represent a potential security concern?
2). Would I have to copy and paste encrypted messages received via
email to a disk (for example) then transport them to the machine
mentioned in  for decryption?
3). If a security issue arises with the version of GnuPG I'm using,
what happens to my keyring, private key, etc. when I upgrade? I'm
assuming I would have to send my friends/associates a newly generated
public key so we could resume communication?
4). How secure (generally speaking) is installing GnuPG on a flash
drive and using it for all GnuPG related activity? I'm a college
student and security on the campus network is clearly of paramount
Thanks all,
