@_subject: partition encryption? 
Do you guys have any suggestion as to how to go about encrypting a
partition that can be available both to linux and win32?

Hi guys,
Some of this is quite OT -- apologies in advance.
Do you have any suggestions as to what security measures can be
implemented in the following conditions:
1. key management
purposes (one for email and one for local file encryption, signing,
2. frequency of changing passphrases
A link of good/reliable secure computing practices would be much appreciated.
Thanks much,

@_subject: GPG Passphrase on the command line 
it will show on ps and on your .bash_history and on casual
shoulder-surfing -- that's why it's insecure.
plus it's not good security practice typing in your passphrase in the
open, readable form. it's just as if you handed the world your secring
and your key.
on the subject of piping, you might try to get a win32 port of unix's
echo command (echo.exe). win32's echo command sometimes have that ugly
\n attached and will mess up your passphrase. with unix's echo, you
can do an echo -n.

@_subject: Fwd: hard-copy backups 
Going back to basics, IMHO, the best way to keep a backup of your
secret key is by splitting it first and giving parts of it to a number
of different persons/entities whom you trust to keep it safely.
Another requirement is to make sure those entities don't know each
other at all... you can do the same with the passphrase... or you can
tattoo it on top of your head... but if you have a long one... ouch.
