@_subject: Decrypt file using a shell script 
I am trying to write a shell script to allow us to automate the decryption
of a file on an AIX 4.3.3 system using GNUPG.  I do not seem to be able to
accomplish this with hard codeing the key in the shell script.  I know this
is not recommenced for security purposes but it is necessary in our
situation.  Can anyone offer any help.  I can accomplish this using EXPECT
but do not want to add EXPECT and TCL to the system if at all possible.
