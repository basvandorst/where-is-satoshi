@_subject: Creation of encrypted virtual drives - Linux 
Hash: SHA1
Hi List
I was wondering if there is way to do create an encrypted "virtual
drive" in Linux, similar to what PGP Desktop does in Windows, using my
private key?
The only options i hav seen so far involve mountloop (oh no not another
long password to remember) or recompiling the kernel (and I am way too
much of a Linux newbie to do that.
Any help would be appreciated.
