Deja Dup on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS: Default GPG Encryption Algorithm
(symmetric cipher) is?
I am using Deja Dup  to create encrypted
backups before uploading online. It uses GPG's default Symmetric Cipher
(Encryption Algorithm) to encrypt data. Does anyone know exactly which default symmetric Cipher (Encryption
Algorithm) is used by GPG? Apparently it is CAST-128, but I cannot find
any citation online that confirms this is the case for the version of
GPG integrated into Ubuntu 10.04 LTS OS.
I am a newbie to Ubuntu/Linux. so struggle to get my head around command
line/Terminal techniques, as such does anyone know if a GUI has been
created that enable the settings and options to be viewed or changed on
Ubuntu 10.04 LTS?

As mentioned I am a Linux newbie (command line adverse) and like many
users of Ubuntu they would not know how access details of what the
default symmetric cipher is.
Use of the term "default" was provided to mean the one GPG uses without
any user intervention IE: Default
So at risk of sounding silly, what is the Default symmetric cipher used
in GPG under Unbuntu 10.04 LTS?

Forgive what may seem like a silly answer, but "whatever you told GnuPG
to use as a default."  If you want CAST5-128, 3DES, AES256 or whatever,
just add:
default-cipher-preferences [algo name]
... to your ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf file.
To get a list of algorithm names, type "gpg --version" at a command

Thanks to everyone for providing tips, I found the answer at:
"The default symmetric cipher used is CAST5"
and used the Ubuntu Terminal to list the ciphers used:
Home: ~/.gnupg
Supported algorithms:
Pubkey: RSA, RSA-E, RSA-S, ELG-E, DSA
Cipher: 3DES (S2), CAST5 (S3), BLOWFISH (S4), AES (S7), AES192 (S8),         AES256 (S9), TWOFISH (S10), CAMELLIA128 (S11), CAMELLIA192
        (S12),         CAMELLIA256 (S13)

It will respect default-cipher-preference.  Certificate prefs are not
used during symmetric encryption, since certs themselves are not used at
