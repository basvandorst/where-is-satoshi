@_subject: Subkey Generation / SmartCard 
I am trying to batch provision yubikeys.
Using the --batch, I can generate the initial key, but I am unable to add
more than a single subkey.
Is there a way to batch provision subkeys, specifying the usage (signing,
encryption, auth) without having to go into --edit-key / interactive mode?
On the same topic, is there a way to do 'keytocard', again without having
to do --edit-key --> toggle --> keytocard interactively?
Any insight on this would be most helpful. Thanks!
