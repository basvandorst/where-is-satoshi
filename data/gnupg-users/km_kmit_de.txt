@_subject: Equivalent to option -f ? 
my name is Konrad and I am completely new to this list. I have to adapt a shell script to work with GPG instead of PGP and it contains the -f option for acting like a filter. Actually,
the full command is: pgp -f -ea rvsdata How do I make gpg behave exactly the same?
Thanks and cheers,
