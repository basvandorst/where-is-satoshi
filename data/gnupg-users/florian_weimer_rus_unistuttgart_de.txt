If a messages is encrypted to multiple subscribers, and secret keys
are present for all subscribers, but not all secret keys can be
decrypted (i.e. because of a missing or wrong passphrase), GnuPG 1.0.1
exits with status 2 even if the messages was successfully decrypted
because a usable secret key was found in the end.

Yes, but status-fd is remarkably terse when it's creating some OpenPGP

So in fact, the 2.6.x situation is quite similar to the post-2.6.x
situation (modulo s/ViaCrypt/NAI/, of course).

For PGP 2.6.3, the standard license from MIT covers only
non-commercial use.  In addition, the PGP documentation clearly states
that in order to use PGP commercially, you have to obtain a version
from ViaCrypt.
So in fact, the 2.6.x situation is quite similar to the post-2.6.x
situation (modulo s/ViaCrypt/NAI/, of course).

Yes, it's normal.  After all, you can just copy the secret key ring to
another machine, and you won't have to enter a passphrase either.

The University of Stuttgart has been experimenting with an
PGP-2.6.x-based PKI for some time now.
Our CA policy merely states that every user is responsible for his own
keys.  From the CA point of view, we cannot do much about this, and
the fundamental problems with multi-user systems cannot be solved
anyway, so the situation is quite hopeless.
We run a keyserver for the keys signed by our CA; however, it is
currently more or less out of order.

No, they won't.  My employer is still waiting for an FSF copyright
assignment contract which is compatible with German law.
Werner is working on a different solution which protects the secret
keys in a better way.  However, I hope that some additional checks are
introduced as well because they prevent GnuPG from revealing the
secret key due to a computation error (which is perhaps the result of
a single flipped bit).

This wouldn't have prevented the ADK bug.  Creating packets in the
proper place is not too difficult, but if you don't add an additional
layer of abstraction, you have to check whether a packet is in the
hashed area or not in many places.

@_subject: [FYI][Linux/Kernel] Schlechte Entropie-Schaetzung bei /dev/random 
No, there isn't.  We don't think the problem is worth a
translation. ;-)
You can follow the links in the article and read the original
discussions on linux-kernel.
Summary: There are two defects in the /dev/random implementation:
entropy estimates for the data sources seem to be too high, and when
some entropy is retrived from the kernel pool, the estimate of the
remaining entropy is rather close to zero, regardless how many bytes
have been retrieved, so quite a bit of entropy is discarded
I don't think it impacts most users.  In order to mount an attack, one
has to know a lot about SHA-1 (provided that /dev/random is correctly
implemented here), and such knowledge is not publicly available at the
moment.  For most users, this problem is similar to the famous "world
spins into wrong direction" bug, except that it's security-related
software and that we know now that hardly anyone cared to audit this
code so far.  (BTW, it's far from clear that SHA-1 has got all the
properties required in this context.)
The proposed changes (later on in the second thread) may be of great
help in unattended key generation because more entropy is made
available per time period.

Yes, it's even possible without invalidating certificates.  This is a
known design flaw in OpenPGP.
I hope some day GnuPG will implement a workaround (e.g. limiting the
validity period of certificates to that of the certified key).

If an attacker obtains your secret key, he can arbitrarily increase
the lifetime of the key, thus increasing its value.
You can do that even if all certificates are invalidated along the

But it's clearly a regression!  The V3 key format does not show this
kind of problem.
This is certainly wrong.  For example, the attacker cannot override
already distributed revocation certificates.  Reliable expiration of
keys is required to be able to cut down the length of certification
revocation lists for most applications.  Otherwise, large-scale CAs
might become unusable after a few years of operation.

But this approach is completely broken from a security point of view.
Key expiration is usually used to impose a hard limit on the lifetime
of a key.  As a result, the key is not as valuable as one with an
unlimited lifetime.
I don't see how your approach differs from not setting a key
expiration time at all.

@_subject: Extending the key expiration date 
CRLs whose length is monotonically increasing are a problem.  If there
is a general consensus that keys are invalid after their expiration,
it is not necessary to include expired keys in CRLs by default.
An attacker who has obtained access to the private key can do the
same, and someone else cannot tell the difference.
Yours has the more severe problems.  The man in the middle attack
problem is solved by the requirement of recertification.
That's a problem, admittedly.  But your approach is insecure.
