@_subject: Getting A List of KEYIDS 
Hello one and all.  I'm determining keyids of encrypted messages.  I just
want the program to return
a list of keyids.  Here is my offering below.  I'm sure the users on the
list can improve upon it.  I would
like to see your improvements.
Thank you.

# getkeyid.pl : return just the keyids that the file was encrypted to
if ($ != 0) {
    die "usage: get_keyid.pl encrypted-file\n";
system "gpg --batch --decrypt --status-fd 1 $ARGV[0]  > tmp$$ 2> /dev/null";
open (GPG_OUT,"  # [GNUPG:] ENC_TO 123455E815EE4B29 16 0
while() {
    if(/^\[GNUPG\:\] ENC_TO (\w\w\w\w\w\w\w\w\w\w\w\w\w\w\w\w) (\d+) (\d+)/) {
        print "$1\n";
    }
unlink "tmp$$";
