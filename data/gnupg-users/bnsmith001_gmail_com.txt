@_subject: Removing all installed versions of GNUPG 
Hash: SHA1
Hello, Giangios.
I would follow the following procedure --
1) I would carefully and politely (aka, politically)
~   research why there are three gpg's installed on
~   the server.
2) Then I would update the "correctly" "standardly"
~   installed version of gpg.
3) Then I would politely send out an email/memo to all
~   parties involved in the non-standard copies of gpg,
~   and inform them that
~      "The latest version of gpg has been installed
~       on the server in [the standard library].
~       Please contact [someone] about using the
~       latest version of gpg.  This change will
~       happen on end of day Friday [2008/05/23]."
~   Please, use all of the politeness that you can in
~   this email/memo, because you want the users to
~   contact you voluntarily to make sure that they
~   are using the correct gpg.
4) Cron a script to run on [2008/08/23] to delete
~   the two wrong gpg directories.
Optionally --
5) In the cron'd script, create symbolic links from
~   the old directories to the new directories.
Sidebar tech ref guidance --
~   Copied from a web page --
~   > ln -s [TARGET DIRECTORY OR FILE] ./[SHORTCUT]
~   >
~   > For example:
~   >
~   > ln -s /usr/local/apache/logs ./logs
~   >
~   > This points a symbolic link "./logs" to "/usr/local/apache/logs"
~   Symbolic links in some of the "Unices" can have their own overhead
~   (OS is picky about doing "rm -r" when a Symbolic link is
~   encountered).  On the "Unices", Symbolic Links work super effectively
~   for program execution, and data access.
As everyone is probably aware (probably), on the
"Unices," all individual keyrings are stored in
a ".gpg" directory under each user's "/home/[user]/"
directory.  I point that out so that I can point
out the central point... that updating a central
version of gpg should be invisibly impactless to
any and all users, once they correct the use of
the different/alternate/deleted versions of gpg.
Further comment --
I ran across a similar problem in Windows.
1) One was needed by Cygwin (Linux under Windows),
2) one was needed by my email program (Thunderbird), and
3) one was needed by a GPG file toolpack (GPG4Win)
that I use regularly.
I determined that it would be easier to

@_subject: Clarification -- Re: Initial pass at a BNF 
I'm not intending to spam the list, just requesting a clarification.
You are asking for keys.  Do you need complete keypairs, or just the public key?
If you are working on a complete BNF for encryption/decryption, won't
you need multiple
_full_ keypairs to -- work with, document, etc.
I'm aware of a few people who users who use fairly complex keys

Environ - Windows 7 (64Bit)
                SeaMonkey 2.6.1
                Enigmail 1.3.4
                GnuPG 1.4.9
                GPG4Win 2.1.0
                GPGShell 3.78  (which is complaining about GPG 1.4.9,
but working)
Problem -- There is no binary install for gpg1.4.11 or gpg 2.X
Goal - I want to build a binary for gpg 1.4.11, and use it from all
three tools
           that I have installed (enigmail,gpg4win,gpgshell).
Wrinkle - the only build instructions are written using *nix scripts
which do
             not execute on Windows, so I am picking up new tools and
             resurrecting aging skills reading build script messages...
             so be kind while I try to stay kind. :)
What I've done so far --
1) I downloaded and installed MinGW 3.20 with MSYS 1.0.
2) I downloaded and extracted gnupg-1.4.11.tar.bz2
3) I opened MinGW (which put me in the MSYS home directory structure)
4) I ran the configure script.
    Having some experience on Ubuntu,
       I wanted to study the configure messages created under MinGW for
          missing libraries, missing settings, and other missing stuff to
          compile from a new computer.
I attached the configure log file from my execution of configure.
My plan is to delete the entire gnupg folder tree,
              make the changes and additions in MinGW,
              re-extract and re-config.
Please, look, and see if you see any major things wrong, that I should
fix, or download
(like IDEA?) that should be added to the MinGW environment before trying
the config again.

@_subject: Maximum keypair length... 
Summary -- Maximum standard pubkey plus seckey pair length is what I'm
asking about.
Let me continue by explaining some back up information for my question.
- I am asking in terms of the latest standards implemented in distros and
Windows .exe auto-install packages.
- I am trying to create a group calendar file and app for a private group.
- Original concept for my project -- use an annual calendar file that has
December (year minus 1) to January (year plus 1), so 14 months of days. I
want one keypair per day for the group.
I want the app to encrypt based upon date. I want the app to decrypt based
upon based upon 3 keys... Date minus 1, Date, and Date plus 1.
So, I need a keygen script that generates 427 (365+31+31) keypairs for a
single ics file.
THEN I'm thinking about field lengths in an ics, and realized that I don't
know the ABSOLUTE longest key that can be created for a secret or public
key. I have used DSA and RSA, and I moved from DSA to RSA years ago because
at the time there were security concerns with DSA... and i think the max
RSA can have as a discussion example is 8192... (that's bits, not bytes...
so that's 1024 bytes max)...
Not sure about ELG's max length...
SO I chose to ask the expert users here.
NO i didn't ask the devel group because I don't want devels confusing what
they are working on for future versions, and I didn't ask docs group
because they are also working in the future. ;)
SO, users, help!
I need to know the absolute longest key that GnuPG can create RIGHT NOW.
Not previous versions, not future versions, but the current stable Windows
auto-install .exe version RIGHT now.
Then I can decide if I can have two fields in an .ics file, or if I need to
create a data file for my app. ;)
Thank you.
Sorry that my email is so long for a simple question.
Summary -- Maximum standard pubkey plus seckey pair length is what I'm
asking about.

@_subject: Maximum keypair length... 
Thank you for your excellent response.
I laid out my scenario.
RSA keys have the default maximum length of
8192 set at compile-time.
Perfect. that was the answer that
I was looking for.
My "risk scenario" was an attempt to understand the maximum defaults of the
current maximum protection available in the standard distributed packages.
available. ;)
Thank you... 8196 on an RSA key. :)

@_subject: Maximum keypair length... 
Thank you, Peter.
My question is purely about the security of the encryption.
There is no need in my proposed scenario for extra signing or overhead.
Understand that I am suggesting the creation of a set of keys, one per day,
less than 33 keys, generated by one central admin.
Second, i am looking to export the "sec" file for each calender day key...
so that EACH group member will recieve both the pubkey AND the sec key on
the group keyring from the group admin.
Again, my focus was NOT on signatures or "bloat" involved in the keyring.
My focus is on security.
Thank you for your inclusion of valid points, but my point is only on
security for group communication, not overhead involved in keyring export
size. :)
thank you. :)

I am a long-time version of many different versions of Thunderbird,
enigmail, and multiple packages of gpg.
If TB 78 is going to have native support of openGPG encryption, then the
original person in the thread should be able to export all of the keys in
their key rings, and import all of those keys into TB 78, or am I missing
one of the gotchas with
TV 78 and it's openGPG encryption support.
