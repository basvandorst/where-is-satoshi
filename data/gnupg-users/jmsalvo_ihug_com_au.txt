@_subject: Newbie question: GnuPG and PGP 
First of, please cc me to my e-mail address at jmsalvo as I
am not subscribed to the list.
Second of, I have read the GnuPG to PGP HOWTO:
However, my problem is related to signing, which is not covered on the
What I currently have are:
* GnuPG 1.0.4 and the corresponding files are in my ~/.gnupg directory
* PGP 6.5.1i and the corresponding files are in my ~/.pgp directory
Being new to public key cryptography, I am first currently testing for
myself between the two before I actually begin sending out my public
Here is what I have done to convince myself evertyhing is working:
1) Using PGP, pairs also.
private key (OK)
key (OK)
2) Using GnuPG, :
pairs also.
private key (OK)
key (OK)
So far so good, now here comes the problem
3) Using GnuPG and PGP together:
tried to decrypt the same file with PGP using my private key (OK)
tried to verify the same file with PGP ( THIS IS NOT OK )
tried to decrypt the same file with GnuPG using my private key ( OK )
tried to verify the same file with GnuPG ( OK )
So the only problem is the third bullet point in item 3, signing a file
in GnuPG and verify it with PGP. Here is the actual result of that:
* This first part shows signing the file with GnuPG. Because the same
passphrase that I used with PGP works in GnuPG, this verifies that the
secret-key was properly imported:
[john .gnupg]$ ls -al README
-rw-rw-r--   1 john     john         2873 Jan  6 20:43 README
[john .gnupg]$ gpg -sa README
You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for

Thanks. That did it. I actually though that when I read the above, it
wont apply to PGP 6.x since it specifically mentioned PGP 5.x.
Assumptions, assumptions... :)
Thanks also to all those who replied and made my understanding more
