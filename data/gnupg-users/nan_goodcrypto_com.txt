@_subject: New Frontend for Network Related section 
I noticed your Frontends page and couldn't find any way to tell you about an addition to the Network Related section, except this list.
After using gpg for many years, we made a server distro that provides almost transparent gpg (and tor) to a whole domain.
Open source. Threat model, design, etc. are in the Technical FAQ at  Most users need transparent crypto, so installation is by the sysadmin. No training and no clicks for users.
Thanks again to Werner Koch and all the contributors for their excellent work on GPG.
We need testers and auditors if you'd like a free subscription. Any thoughts you have are welcome.

@_subject: Tweeting for GnuPG 
Werner, depending on what you want, we might be able to help. Here are some kinds of tweets that might be good for gpg:
  * Links to mentions of gpg, and maybe pgp
  * Links to mentions of attacks when we can say "This wouldn't have happened with GPG would have stopped/resisted this."
  * News about gpg from you and maybe products that use it
Obviously that last category would include us, and you may not want to include community product news. How often is "regular"?
rob at aspman.info is probably a better choice than me since I find Twitter a pain.

If you want to use gpg in an app, there's an easy way.
The Open Crypto Engine is one API for multiple crypto plugins. Open source. We've released a Python version with a gpg plugin at  There's also a java version with more plugins.

 Thank you, Bernhard.
I noticed you had a few "TODOs" in the wiki. Would you like me to modify the entry?
  >Is there a documentation for the API?
 Yes. Standard "pydoc MODULE". For example, to see the docs for gpg_plugin.py, you'd type:
    pydoc goodcrypto.oce.gpg_plugin
If you prefer docs in HTML, then add -w before the module name.

  >Do you use gpgme?
No. OCE predates GPGME. Thanks again, Bernard.

@_subject: DSA key sizes 
DSA was certainly compromised in the past. Some people think it isn't anymore.
It doesn't matter much whether NIST knew or was conned. NIST didn't change their Elliptic Curve spec until Snowden published proof of a backdoor. Then they adjusted the spec as little as possible. NIST's DSA standard has shifted similarly.
In our view it's generally better to avoid state sponsored standards.
DSA (U.S. Digital Signature Algorithm) keys haven't made the news, but they should. Here's a sentence from the ssh-keygen man page:
    DSA keys must be exactly 1024 bits as specified by FIPS 186-2. First, why should the whole world be restricted by a U.S. FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standard)? In this case it's obvious. NSA very likely has rainbow tables for DSA 1024 bit keys. The standard was compromised right in the open by not allowing longer keys.
But it's worse than it appears. The SSH spec says "exactly 1024 bits", not "1024 bits or less". Why? Because NSA wanted the key length to sound as safe as possible, but still make everyone vulnerable to their attacks.
Rainbow tables take a lot of resources to generate. The spec says "exactly" because that rainbow table is half of the size of a rainbow table for "1024 bits or less". NSA specified "exactly" 1024 bits to cut their work in half.
The standard has been updated, but ssh-keygen shows their past behavior. We see no reason to believe it has changed.
More detail: X is the size of the table at exactly 1024 bits. The table size for 1023 is 1/2 X, for 1022 it's 1/4 X, etc. Then (X + 1/2 X + 1/4 X + ...) is 2X.

The software that included OCE was also started in early 2001. Werner, since I don't remember the month you could certainly be right.  We knew and trusted GPG and hadn't heard of GPGME.

Hi Werner,
All email I send goes through the GoodCrypto Server. If I don't have a key for the recipient, then the tag is automatically added to encourage others to use encryption. Clearly, folks on this mailing list already understand the importance of encryption. Currently, there's no flag to designate that some recipient addresses are mailing lists related to encryption. If others using the GoodCrypto Server thinks that's a valuable additional, we'll likely add it in the future.
Werner, let me take a moment and thank you for your years of work on GPG.  Given the revelations over the past 1.5 years, we think everyone should be using it.

Hi Robert,
 >This would have the ultimate effect of destroying email as a platform. . . antispam . . . malware
I think you'll find this has been solved for years. The solution is PGP/etc. between mail servers, and TLS/SSL to the user.
Solutions like GoodCrypto integrate with your existing mail server. Your antispam and antivirus work as always. The sysadmin simply configures the mail server to filter inbound mail for viruses, spam, etc. after it's been decrypted. End users don't have to change how they read/write email nor use any special plugins.  TLS/SSL to their mail client keeps messages private within the group.
 >no really effective client-side antispam measures
Right. That's the sysadmin's job.
An additional advantage of having MTA to MTA encryption is that many organizations need a record of all mail messages. Sometimes it's required by law. User-to-user encryption makes that record unreadable.
This solution doesn't block experts who prefer user-to-user encryption, but an organization may object for the reasons that you gave, Robert.

Hi Robert,
  > Given that I've seen PGP-signed spam mails, no, I think you're being naive.
You use the same antispam/antivirus you use now. What people do today is a little complex, so I understand why it's not clear:
  your mail server -> your crypto server (decrypts) -> your mail server (antispam etc) -> user (tls)
   > If you're running the mailserver and you can decrypt my secured messages, then there's    > nothing preventing the federal government from serving you with a subpoena saying,    > "please hand over the encryption keys."
I agree. A third party should never handle the filtering of mail. If my email is nan at mygroup.org, then mygroup.org handles the encryption, decryption, spam filtering, etc.
   > The only person who can be trusted to do the decryption is the end user,
   > running on hardware the end user directly controls.
In an ideal world, yes. But after 20 years of recommending user-to-user encryption, it's clear most users can't or won't. As Bruce Schneier says, "If there's anything PGP has taught us, it's that one click is one click too many." Experts can still encrypt any messages they want individually. We can't leave the rest of us unprotected.
   > I care very little about what happens to corporations. I agree again. I'm much more concerned about human rights groups and stopping mass surveillance.
   > You're still talking about destroying the antispam experience of end-users.
The group's mail server handles spam, viruses, etc., just like it does today. No change for the user.

Alexandre, do you really believe that anyone could "deserve to remain a slave"?
Assuming you don't, I'll address your calmer points.
  > mygroup.org can be corrupted, menaced or cracked.
Sure, a server is a single point of failure for the group, and must be carefully configured and protected. It's still much safer than hoping users will protect themselves.
  > the change of roughly everything
I prefer solutions that protect as many people as possible now.
  > ClawsMail, Thunderbird, etc.
People usually don't want to change mail clients.  Most have no idea how to configure crypto or manage keys.

> third party -- your mailserver administrator
The "third party" you don't trust is your own sysadmin. That person already has access to the plain text messages right now. So does everyone tapping your connections. We suggest that you limit that risk to the sysadmin you already trust.
  > telling people that your product will keep their communications secure
Yes, we are. We suggest that GPG crypto is more secure than no crypto, and better when it works for everyone in the group.
Experts can still encrypt their own messages. That approach has had 20 years to work. Most people still don't encrypt mail at all.
Good encryption that is used is much better than encryption only used by an elite.
  > Made false claims that DSA is compromised
I said "was certainly compromised in the past". As you know, one source for DSA flaws is the current ssh-keygen man page:
    "DSA keys must be exactly 1024 bits as specified by FIPS 186-2."
You apparently feel there is some explanation for "exactly 1024 bits" other than the obvious one, that keys of that length are compromised. NIST changed this spec later, but always kept DSA.
If you want another source, NSA themselves consider DSA, specifically ECDSA, to be only Grade B security. With their usual misdirection, NSA calls it "Suite B". Red Hat explicitly says the NSA's Suite B is only good enough for "most" classified information. See   > Made false claims that NIST . . .
NIST has often changed specs as each compromise is discovered. Examples are DES, DSA, and Elliptic Curve. A very recent discussion is from "Keeping Secrets -- STANFORD magazine" (
  "The agency has a second tactic to prevent the spread of cryptographic techniques: keeping high-grade cryptography out of the national standards. To make it easier for different commercial computer systems to interoperate, the National Bureau of Standards (now called NIST) coordinates a semipublic process to design standard cryptographic algorithms. ... The NSA's influence over the standards process has been particularly effective at mitigating what it perceived as the risks of nongovernmental cryptography. By keeping certain cryptosystems out of the NBS/NIST standards, the NSA facilitated its mission of eavesdropping on communications traffic."
I suggest you are more careful about your accuracy before you make accusations of false claims, or use the nasty slur "snake oil".

Robert, let's try to defuse this.
To quote Werner, Salam-Shalom.
First, "charlatan" and "snake oil" imply deceit. Goodcrypto:
  * Is open source
  * Uses GPG for mail encryption
  * Links to "The limits of GoodCrypto" right on the front page
  * Has asked for audits from many people, including:
    * Open Crypto Audit Project
    * EFF
    * Privacy International
I humbly suggest this demonstrates that we are trying very hard not to fool anyone.
You made the great point that a mail server and sysadmin is a single point of failure. This is covered in our Design document referenced from our Technical FAQ. There are tradeoffs to everything. Because a mail crypto server is a tempting target, we have to protect it very carefully. Please let us know the details about any successful attacks you find.
We'll have to disagree on whether we should ignore clear evidence about DSA because academics haven't published yet. I understand this is very important to you because of your NIST association.
I'll try hard to let you have the last word :)

Hi Bjarni,
Our choice was based on compatibility and reliability. For an outgoing encrypted message, if there's an attachment GoodCrypto sends PGP/MIME, otherwise PGP in the body. We decrypt both formats.
Glad to hear Mailpile is in Beta. Good luck!
