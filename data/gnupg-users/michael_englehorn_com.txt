Perhaps there should be an off-topic mailing list for all this stuff,
rather than cluttering up a perfectly usable gnupg mailing list.

Hash: SHA256
If you revoked the key, and not just the user id, you have to start over
with a new key, especially if you published the revocation anywhere.
Once you send a revoked key to the keyservers, it's game over for that
key, by design.
You don't really have to delete it, you can just generate a new one
using the same name and e-mail address.

Depending on what the content of the e-mail is about, I don't think it
would be inappropriate for someone who I didn't know to contact me,
especially if it was about something I normally work on such as an
opensource project that has my name and e-mail attached to it.
My e-mail address is easy to find in places other than the keyservers,
and if you don't put your key on the keyserver it may be dificult for
someone to send me something like a security impacting bug report using
Also, it would be strange to only publish your key's "name only" UID to the
keyserver, because then at a keysigning event I wouldn't know where to
send your public key back to, and I couldn't certify any of your e-mail
The same goes for phone calls, though I do heavily filter my home phone
line with some IVR scripts and such to prevent autodialer spam.
That being said, sending 'hey, I'm just testing' messages to me would be weird.

I think it's redundant, besides, what if I were to replace all of the userland utilities with my own, or some other non-gnu userland? It would still be Linux, and Gnupg would continue working (provided the new userland could compile it). ;)
Also, I don't think "GNU/Linux" is a trademark of Linus. Linux is more generic and possibly more correct than GNU/Linux.
