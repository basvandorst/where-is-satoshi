Hi list !
I'd like to know if anybody here could find (or make) an IDEA and an RSA GnuPG
module that runs under Windows.
If yes, I'd highly appreciate to get it ;-)
I'm also looking for a Windows port of the pgpgpg utility.
Thanks in advance.

Hello list!
I've tried to compile the RSA and IDEA GnuPG modules by myself under
Windows. Unfortunately, I didn't succeed.
However, the same modules compile allright under Linux with GCC. I
may be missing something, but I can't figure out what...
I installed under Windows the MingW32 package including the GCC
compiler, but, when trying to compile, I get error messages like:

Hi Werner,
Thank you for your answer.
About RSA, I was expecting it to be included with the standard GnuPG
distribution as soon as its patent expires, and I'm glad to read it
will be the case.
But there must be a way to incorporate IDEA as well. Even though I
understand that you don't want to include a patent-encumbered
algorithm into the standard GnuPG distribution, there must be a way
for integrating it externally to get compatability with versions 2.6x
of PGP.
The success of GnuPG, IMHO, depends for a large part on its complete
compatability with PGP, and as well on its complete availability
under Windows (you know, there still are about a dozen of Windows
users out there ;-)
So, how could the IDEA / Windows version be solved ?
About PGP compatability: I've seen that GnuPG allows it thru quite
esoteric options (--force-v3-sigs, --rfc1991, --s2k-*, --cipher-algo,

Am I right understanding your statement as meaning that making GnuPG
compatible with the most trusted and original versions of PGP is of
absolutely no interest to you ?
Well, I have the feeling that a big lot of PGP users and free crypto
supporters wouldn't share this point of view.
On the opposite, many people seem to consider that the success and
diffusion of GnuPG will be very closely related to its ability of
being easily compatible with existing versions of PGP, and existing
PGP keys, on the most common platforms.
If GnuPG wants to be considered as a serious alternative to PGP and a
possible replacement for it, it *has* to put compatibility on the top
of its priorities-list.
Asking to "go fix PGP 2" is pure nonsense. Are you speaking seriously
The way PGP 2 stores signatures may be ugly -- or may not. But one
cannot ignore the fact that PGP 2 was there *years* before GnuPG and
has become so largely trusted that it has become a de facto worldwide
The interesting article "Replacing PGP 2.x with GnuPG" from Kyle
Hasselbacher, available at clearly shows that GnuPG is intrinsically capable of being compatible
with PGP 2.x, but that the choice of making it easy has not been

@_subject: GnuPG - PGP compatibility [Was: Can't compile RSA / IDEA under Windows] 
I don't think that these figures give and exact image of the situation. Here is
- PGP 2.x doesn't include any support for keyservers. So PGP 2.x users who want
to put their keys on servers need to perform it outside of PGP, using Web or
mail interfaces.
- PGP 5.x / 6.x includes native keyservers support, and automatically proposes
to the user to send his keys to servers as soon as a key pair is generated.
This will make many people send their keys (especially for newcomers, send keys
that will be lost and never reused ;-) to the servers where PGP 2.x users
wouldn't have sent them.
- Furthermore, current users sticking to PGP 2 may be a little more "paranoiac"
than PGP 5.x or 6.x users, making them more reluctant to distribute their keys
onto keyservers.
So, IMHO, keyserver statistics do not give an exact figure of the real ratio of
PGP 2 vs PGP 6  keys.
Last but not least, a number of tools in usage today, such as anonymous
remailers, heavily rely on PGP 2 and PGP 2 format keys, making them necessary
for interacting with such systems.
Well, it seems that signing and encrypting a message using GnuPG so that PGP2
can decrypt and sig-check it properly, is less trivial...

People that trust only PGP2 (for it has been there for long, extensively
reviewed, etc.) would never trust a newly "fixed" version of PGP2 incorporating
CAST5. That's why this suggestion doesn't make sense.
I perfectly understand this issue, and perfectly understand why IDEA cannot be
integrated into the main GnuPG distribution which is under GPL.
Although, this doesn't prevent from making provisions for the easy integration
of an external module that you can easily plug into GnuPG. This is already the
case in Unix, but I read your answer saying in wasn't working in Windows...
And not integrating these algorithms into the main distribution doesn't force
GnuPG to display messages stating these algorithms are "deprecated" or
"obsolete". Maybe just "unsupported" in the corresponding module is not
