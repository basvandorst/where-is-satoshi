I am trying to decrypt file from command prompt as below and it works fine.

Is that I need to give some other details ?

It gives below error. Why it is looking in 'C:/Documents and Settings/Default User/Application'?? Can someone help on this?
gpg: keyblock resource `C:/Documents and Settings/Default User/Application Data/gnupg/temporary': No such file or directory
gpg: encrypted with RSA key, ID XXXXX
gpg: encrypted with RSA key, ID YYYYY
gpg: decryption failed: No secret key
Application runs under different user id. What is chroot? It is windows environment.

Does the application run under the same user ID or in a chroot environment?

It still gives same error. I added '--homedir DIR ' in command.
echo paraphrase|gpg.exe --homedir DIR --batch? --secret-keyring temporary? --passphrase-fd 0 --decrypt-files E:\a.txt.gpg
gpg: keyblock resource `DIR/secring.gpg': No such file or directory
gpg: keyblock resource `DIR/temporary': No such file or directory

Because that is the correct directory as told by your Windows version
(by means of CSIDL_APPDATA) or configured by you:
? --homedir DIR
? Set the name of the home directory to DIR. If this option is not used,
? the home directory defaults to '~/.gnupg'.? It is only recognized when
? given on the command line.? It also overrides any home directory
? stated through the environment variable 'GNUPGHOME' or (on W32
? systems) by means of the Registry entry
? 'HKCU\Software\GNU\GnuPG:HomeDir'.

I am running simple command 'gpg --decrypt E:\a.txt.gpg'. It runs successfully from command prompt, but when I run from application it gives below error. Why it is saying
'No secret key'. How to fix this? It is the same environment.
gpg: encrypted with RSA key, ID BA041825
gpg: decryption failed: No secret key
Are you literally entering DIR? Because it was intended to be an indicator that
that is the place you should place the wanted directory name, as in for example[1]:
--homedir "C:\Documents and Settings\Rupali\Application Data"
or something similar.
[1] I don't use Windows, so I might make a mistake in syntax or actual directory
names or something like that

After importing keys, I am able to decrypt files. Thanks a lot.

I suggest that you import the keys first.? Why do you define a second
secret keyring (temporary) which does not exists?
You may also want to read one of the HOWTO documents at  first.

Right, there was a bug in the Elgamal signature code.? However this was
a regression long after we changed the default to DSA with version 0.3.0
in 1998.? Only a few keys generated with those versions - and those how
created keys without using the defaults - were troubled.
