I too, am looking toward some 1.07. I'm using 1.06 on Windows 2000 and
the bug which fails any server interaction is a major nuisance. So is
that known bug, which basically exclude people using Windows to use
GnuPG, fixed in the current code or forthcoming 1.07 ?
I have probably overlooked the website, but did not find coordinates of
the CVS repository (so I could have checked that by myself in the source
code). Can you point me to the right information ?
Are there instructions somewhere on building GnuPG 1.06 on Windows
systems ?
Thank you,

Great. I'll have a look for myself at what this issue looks like and if
I can fix it, else I will gladly talk with you of other possibilities.

Perfect. Thanks.

Is this done voluntarily, to limit or complicate its build and distribution
on Windows ? Not all developers having to work on Windows for their
living have skills on Linux and other free oses. It would be excellent
for them to be able to grab the source and compile it on Windows. It
would also greatly help the debugging. The fact the server issue on
Windows 2000 has not been fixed in months is very significant. I'm sure
if programmers working daily on Windows had a chance to compile and
debug GnuPG natively on Windows, that particular issue would have been
closed for long.
Are there licensing or political reasons not to let people compile GnuPG
with proprietary commercial compilers ? I suppose not.
Thank you very much,

I see.
But isn't it possible to at least encourage people to use their own
compilers they're accustomed to, to at least help pinpoint porting bugs
in GnuPG ?
I wasn't specifically thinking of using Microsoft compilers anyway. I do
not use those on Windows. There are a lot of other compilers.
Would there be any licensing issue if I took the source code and
compiled it (fixing any required porting issue) with my liking of tools
suite under Windows ?
Also, isn't there some Windows-hosted binaries of GNU tools available ?
You see, I like free software (in the right meaning of the term) and I
even write some. But I start to find things not so free when the
software is locked for _any_ reason to a specific platform or
I understand the fear that a proprietary compiler used to compile a
security tool like GnuPG could introduce backdoors, but that's taking
the fear a little bit far in my opinion. Why should I trust more a
windows binary which you provide and which I can't build myself than a
windows binary which I would build under my control with a proprietary
tool ? There is no real difference. Yes the source code of your tool is
available and mine is not. But did you compiled the compiler yourself ?
Or are you using any binary distro of the compiler ? You see my point, I
There is a very large number of excellent quality free software
engineered to be built successfully on multiple platforms with multiple tools.
In my opinion there is a much greater risk to have, for instance, a
private key captured by a Linux or Win32 key-logger virus or worm than
by a backdoor engineered to be included in gnuPG when compiled by one of
the proprietary compilers available, be it on unixes than on windowses.
I certainly don't want to start any 'guerilla' about these issues. So if
you prefer we can close this discussion here. I would try to find myself my
way around this limitation.

Okay Werner, I wasn't implying that _you_ should do all that. Aren't
there other people working on GnuPG source code or are you essentially
solely responsible for this nice piece of software ?
In most free software development, the teams do split between various
kind of collegues. Often, some are specialized in development /
maintenance of platform or otherwise environmental specific parts of the
If there was even only one more guy, committing to maintaining the
builds on one Windows compiler, you wouldn't have any more problems and
the software would be even more "free", in that people would be free to
choose with what and on what they want to compile it for themselves and
trust it.
Also, but this is only personal experience, source code has always been
better when compiled on many different compilers/environments. Some kind
of bugs can go undetected for months when you use a single development
environment. When regularly producing on various systems, the team can
smash a larger number of plain bugs, quicker.

You're making my point by saying that :-)
If co-maintainers were maintaining the 'other-platforms' specifics, you
wouldn't be bothered by that. If _you_ have to do it all, of course, I
understand it is an added complexity that you deserve not to be forced

Of course. But an even better and trustable GnuPG base code as a result.

Technically speaking, why not ? (Always making the assumption that not a
single person would have to be responsible for maintenance of all that,
of course).
May I ask how is the development team of GnuPG composed ?
How many different programmers do really master (at least specific
portions) of the code and have commit privilege to the CVS tree ?
Again, thank you very much,
Best regards,
