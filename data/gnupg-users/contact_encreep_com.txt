I wanted to create an easy to use gui for GnuPG. Without installing, choosing options, and just working from the get-go.
I appreciate any feedback (and bugs), you can check it at: The main use case is for encrypting/decrypting, and not identity verification. That is why the trust model is discarded.I feel unless your adversary is a government, getting the public key from a website / email / forum post should be fine (situational trust).
I wanted something to quickly load the key, encrypt the message, and send it away.
It is closed source, unlimited trialware.

Yep those are all valid points, and the issue of closed source vs open source vs crypto has been discussed many times before encreep, and there is nothing new for me to add on that.
I personally use a lot of closed software on my machine, it does not bother me as much.

Yes, if you don't specify a name a 'random' one will be chosen for you,this is to ease on two new users that exchange keys and will expect a change in the ui when importing a key.
Those are the defaults for unattended key generation.
