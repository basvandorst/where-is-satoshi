@_subject: GnuPG AES version 
Similar to version 1.0.3 of GnuPG celebrating the expiration of the RSA patent
it should be possible to release version 1.0.4 supporting the AES algorithm literally within seconds of the announcement scheduled for Oct 2.
An algorithm code for AES (7) is already defined in the OpenPGP specification
and it should be a relatively simple task to prepare versions of the tarball for the likely candidates, watch the live webcast and copy the right version
to the ftp directory on cue.
Naturally, this should be accompanied by a nice press release.
