Ok, but how does that solve my problem?  Even if I encrypt my file with
a symmetric cipher I face the same issue - each encrypted copy will be

I just noticed this today.  I suppose this is completely obvious to most
readers of the list and perhaps not something they want to be bothered with;
apalogies if that's the case.  I have a problem to solve :(
itz at matica:~$ echo foo > foo
itz at matica:~$ gpg-encrypt.sh foo foo1.gpg
itz at matica:~$ gpg-encrypt.sh foo foo2.gpg
itz at matica:~$ ls -l foo*
-rw-r--r-- 1 itz itz   4 Jul 20 13:33 foo
-rw-r--r-- 1 itz itz 904 Jul 20 13:33 foo1.gpg
-rw-r--r-- 1 itz itz 904 Jul 20 13:33 foo2.gpg
itz at matica:~$ cmp foo1.gpg foo2.gpg foo1.gpg foo2.gpg differ: char 84, line 4
itz at matica:~$ cat mirror/bin/gpg-encrypt.sh  /bin/sh
set -e
if [ $# != 2 ]; then     echo 'usage: gpg-encrypt.sh FILE DESTINATION' >&2
    exit 2
gpg --encrypt --recipient ABCD1234 --output $destination --armor --yes $file
So I suppose gpg puts some salt probably based on timestamp in.  Can this
be disabled?  Pretty please?

Not your fault, since I didn't say what it was :-)
I have a local file that I want to encrypt and upload to a remote
machine in encrypted form.  Encrypting is farily quick, but uploading is
slow, so I use rsync for the other (unencrypted) files.  But the fact
that the encrypted file is different each time defeats the rsync
incremental upload.
A partial workaround is only encrypting when the plaintext file is newer
than the encrypted one, but it's not bulletproof because sometimes the
plaintext _does_ get saved even if it's identical.
Not a huge deal, in all, but someone must have faced this situation before.
