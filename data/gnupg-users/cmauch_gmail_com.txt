@_subject: policy url's 
Could someone explain to me the practical differences between
--sig-policy-url and --cert-policy-url?
The manpage for GnuPG says
--set-policy-url string
      Use string as a Policy URL for signatures (rfc2440:5.2.3.19).  If you
prefix it with an exclamation mark (!), the policy URL packet  will be
flagged as critical.  --sig-policy-url sets a policy url for data
signatures.   --cert-policy-url  sets a policy  url for key signatures
(certifications).  --set-pol? icy-url sets both.  The same %-expandos used
for notation data are available here as well.
I ask because i'm guessing that the --sig-policy points to a document that
describes your personal keysigning policies, and --cert-policy would point
to the notes that describe the validity and process you went through to
validate someone's identity and match it to their fingerprint.
Am I right?  Is this just one of many interpretations?
When would one need to use the critical flag?
Just curious.
