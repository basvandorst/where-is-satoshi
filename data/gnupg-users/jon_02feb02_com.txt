@_subject: gnuPG and Php 
I got my GnuPg working fine with help from this group (thanks), and have
another problem!
Could some one give me some help on how to encrypt some user entered data
I can use it from command line, but would like either a cgi or php way to
use gnuPG from a webpage.
It is a hosted environment, but I do have ssh access to the server.
I am not too familiar with cgi, so would prefer php if this is possible.
(i.e. cgi would have to be a tutorial ;P )
A web reference etc would be helpful.
Thank you in advance.
