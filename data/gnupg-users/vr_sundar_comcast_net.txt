@_subject: Encrypt a file using a PGP key 
I am new to using gnupg/pgp etc. I got someone's pgp key and am trying to encrypt a file using it. I am having problems doing this. I downloaded the freeware version of pgp on a Windows machine and looked at the key. It shows up as Type: DH/DSS
Size: 2048/1024
Cipher: CAST
Expires: Never
I have a  few questions regarding this:
(1) Does this public key have more than one key in it ( as in one each for DH, DSS and CAST )?
(2) CAST is a symmetric key system. How can a CAST key be in this public key? If so, anybody can decrypt what is encrypted, right???
(3) As for encryption: DSS is for signing, and CAST key is probably not there in this public key. What remains is DH. If DH= diffie-hellman, isn't that a key exchange protocol only? how can i encrypt using this key? Usually DH is used to generate a symmetric key for a session but in this case I don't establish a session. All i want to do is to encrypt the file and send it What does this public key have actually and how do i use it? I'm told that it can be used for encryption. (I believe he has been able to interact with other people using it.)
I am pretty much lost right now. Any help on how to use this, pointers to understanding this better etc. are greatly appreciated.
