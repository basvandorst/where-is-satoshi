Use rpm2targz to convert the Red Hat package to a Slackware package.
Then use installpkg or upgradepkg as appropriate.
Note: you may need to verify the directory assumptions made by RedHat,
as Slackware is a bit more BSDish (a lot more since the merger ).

Seems to me that Frank has put his virtual finger on the crux of the
issue: How *do* you know which to choose? Even if GnuPG presented the
possible matches to the user, the only thing that's gained is not
hopping to the web browser.
transaction is to have Bob Smith send you a signed email. When you (or
your email program) verify the signature, you will get the correct key
from the keyserver, which you can then use for future communications.
If nothing else, my keyring is being filled with keys in this manner ...

But doesn't that become useful *after* you've retrieved the key from the
server? I thought the original question was about identifying which keys
to retrieve, not confirming the validity of the key after you've
retrieved it.

FWIW, I'm still running gpg-1.0.1 myself. I'm also using TkRat v2.0rc5.
When I first opened your message, the display was empty, but I was
prompted for my passphrase and eveything displayed just fine . . .
I got the same results with your subsequent gpg -vv post as well.

I'll have to check that more carefully. Those messages were the first
instance where I've been prompted for *my* passphrase by TkRat (other
than to encrypt). Checking a signature just requires clicking the
button. It's quite possible that TkRat withheld displaying the entire
message until the encrypted portions were handled . . .
