@_subject: About encrypting files 
I always use GpgEX and Kleopatra to encrypt my files.
However, i just wonder how my files are encrypted.
Will my files be encrypted with the symmetric cryptography first, then use the Public-key cryptography to encrypt symmetric key?
Or, the whole of my files are encrypted with the Public-key cryptography?
Thank you,
