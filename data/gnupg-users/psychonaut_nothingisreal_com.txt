@_subject: gpg-agent doesn't remember passphrase 
I recently upgraded my operating system (SuSE 9.0->9.3) and now gpg-agent
doesn't remember my passphrase anymore.
I have verified that gpg-agent is indeed running and the environment
variable is set.  When I run gpg --sign, the appropriate pinentry program
pops up and asks for the password.  But the password is never remembered,
regardless of what value for default-cache-ttl I use.  Here's a sample log
2005-08-13 22:25:44 gpg-agent[6343] listening on socket
2005-08-13 22:26:03 gpg-agent[6344] handler for fd 0 started
2005-08-13 22:26:03 gpg-agent[6344] starting a new PIN Entry
2005-08-13 22:26:09 gpg-agent[6344] handler for fd 0 terminated
2005-08-13 22:26:15 gpg-agent[6344] handler for fd 0 started
2005-08-13 22:26:15 gpg-agent[6344] starting a new PIN Entry
2005-08-13 22:26:20 gpg-agent[6344] handler for fd 0 terminated
2005-08-13 22:26:20 gpg-agent[6344] handler for fd 0 started
2005-08-13 22:26:20 gpg-agent[6344] handler for fd 1 started
2005-08-13 22:26:20 gpg-agent[6344] handler for fd 0 terminated
I'm using the following programs, all from SuSE 9.3 RPMs:
Anyone know what could be wrong?

Rebooted the system, and now suddenly everything works again.  Strange.
