Should do the trick.

I probably commit something like a sacrilegue here, but I need a windows-gpg
capable email client (for my wife mostly). Anything out there?

I'll look around for some opensource winlose email client... shouldn't be too hard
to bastardize it... or is it? Any suggestions?

How to patch gnupg to not complain? It messes up php-scripts of mine this way. (complaining
about insecure memory)

Hello Graham,
actually keymanagement is a non-issue for me, as I just need to decrypt orders
from my online-store. So there are only 2 parties involved, the store and the
receiving PC.
All: When decrypting via the command-shell, is there a way how to avoid being
prompted for the passphrase? (it's insecure, I know, but I want to batch it)
I will try those out (probably not now, as I'm at work)

The platform is actually FreeBSD. It's my webhost on which I just have a little useraccount. and
... I don't really follow what you are trying to say below.
Would going in into the C-source and just commenting out the offending message out - work?
Just wondering...

I tried out -q (for quiet), piping the output somewhere else, to no avail...it throws me that nasty
line on top, even before the HTML.

YESSSS!!!!! That worked! How embarrassing. I really missed the FAQ. I was
looking through the manual, readme files etc... but that one I missed. Someone
put a  around that FAQ-link please ;-)
That's a HUGE relieve!
Thanx Larry!

Seems that echo here on this NT box at work doesn't seem to have an option to omit
the newline. So I tried something else... I put the passphrase into a textfile and
just piped the output of this textfile into the command you described:
C:\gpg>type pass.txt | gpg --passphrase-fd 0 -d test.gpg
And it worked alright! (use cat on a *nix machine of course).
Thanks for your great help! Another problem solved. And I'm confident that I get a
decent solution now to work that my wife can process the decrypted orders.
Let's just hope that the customers appreciate the security.

not the key, just the passphrase. And I plan not to run any services on the PC where this
batch will be located. Maybe there's also a way to send the passphrase to gpg encrypted?
