Many years ago I used to maintain the Linux vacation and one of the
checks it did was to check for the existence of the Precedence header.
We also started to add support for Mailman listheaders.
Any decently written OOF/vacation should be able to ignore most mailing

I knew that dropbox could access stuff but was not fully aware of this.
Saying that my private keys are kept secure anyway on a USB key and not
my PC
