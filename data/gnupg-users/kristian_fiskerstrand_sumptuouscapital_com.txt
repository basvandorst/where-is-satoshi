@_subject: Malformed Revokation Certificate? 
Hi Doug,
The discussion entail having generated a revocation certificate using
--gen-revoke while having the passphrase and private key (should usually
be done at key generation and stored at a safe place, and is short
enough that a printed copy can be stored and manually typed need be)
At the time of key revocation it is then appended to the public key
using import, hence doesn't require a passphrase, the same way as A
doesn't need B's passphrase when signing B's public key.

When public keys are involved it is necessary to determine common
capabilities between the preferences of all.
You can see these preferences e.g using gpg2 --edit-key 0xABCDEF01 and
type "showpref".
To set this preference for your own public key you'd use "setpref",
which can also be used to update in accordance with the
default-preference-list you set in gpg.conf. Note that for others to see
the changes they will need an updated copy of the public key (typically;
re-send it to the keyservers).

different than signing a message.
For clearsigned messages, yes, for a message sent to someone else while

Dear all,
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) today
announced the winner of its five-year competition to select a new
cryptographic hash algorithm, one of the fundamental tools of modern
information security.
The winning algorithm, Keccak (pronounced ?catch-ack?), was created by
Guido Bertoni, Joan Daemen and Gilles Van Assche of STMicroelectronics
and Micha?l Peeters of NXP Semiconductors. The team?s entry beat out 63
other submissions that NIST received after its open call for candidate
algorithms in 2007, when it was thought that SHA-2, the standard secure
hash algorithm, might be threatened. Keccak will now become NIST?s SHA-3
hash algorithm.

@_subject: SRV records and HKPS requests 
In relation to setting up a HKPS pool for sks-keyservers.net[0] I've
encountered a scenario where some input would be appreciated.
In the process of trying to figure out a mechanism to not have to
disable certificate checking when using the pool (I quite like DKG's
approach in [1]) I set up nginx (which was a reverse proxy to my SKS
server for hkp requests already) to respond to SSL requests on port 11375.
Port 443 on this server is already used by Apache.  Normally I'd be able
to set up Apache with a ProxyPassReverse to use this as a shared
resource, but since migrating to mod_gnutls rather than mod_ssl , this
configuration directive seems somewhat non-trivial[2] (and since i'm not
using mod_proxy for anything else, debugging it isn't that much of a
priority), so for the purposes of this discussion, using port 443 for
this service is out of the question.
As 11375 is a non-default port I set up a SRV record as shown in
 1# below. When trying to send a key request as shown in
 2# below, however, a connection to port 443 is attempted. Am I
using the wrong SRV records for HKPS? When first introducing SRV records
in the pool, this was the one being pointed out[3].
Some background information on this particular pool: My crawler is now
trying to detect HKPS enabled servers by looking for this SRV record,
and if no such SRV record is found, attempting to connect and locate a
SKS stats page on port 443. Servers available on 443 are then included
as A, AAAA and SRV records, while other SSL-enabled servers are only
represented as SRV records, as shown in  3#

My first question is whether you notice the same behavior when using the geographical pools (eu,na,oc,sa) that are optimized based on the methods described in the PDF article linked in the overview of pools.

Note that you're trying to connect to my webserver, all the pools are

pool.sks-keyservers.net is only intended to be active on port 11371
(i.e non-SSL/TLS connections). This will almost certainly fail or a
HKPS request (defaulting on port 443). As Pete Stephenson pointed out
in a recent email, the pool setup require the pool CA to be used,
rather than the certificate of individual members as described on [0].
Servers viable for the HKPS pool are flagged as such on [1]. Several
of these depend on SNI, so the hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net hostname
has to be used together with the provided CA cert.
Also note that there is no requirement or any of the servers to offer
a human-readable web interface, and as such no checking is performed
as to how a possible such page is formed. This is a probably reason
for you reporting getting data back on a non-encrypted channel, if.e.g
you are met with a hard-coded  on such a HTML template.
The pool is configured to work with direct client HKP[2] requests and
I'm not aware of any issues with this.

Arguably the website doesn't provide information that strictly has to

the two schemes were incompatible, i.e. I couldn't get monkeysphere to

completely switch to the root CA approach, which I don't particularly

Well, in my case I wouldn't keep an encryption subkey on the mobile

could specify a wanted confidentiality level , e.g. enum {public;
confidential; classified} where two different encryption subkeys could
be kept at the same time. The trusted device would keep both
encryption subkeys but the mobilde device only the "confidential" one
at a lower security expectation. That said, I'm not entirely sure that
what we need for broader adoption is more complexity to the standard,
but at the same time this would enable encryption more broadly on
mobile devices. In my case though I'm mostly interested in digital
signatures for the mobile device though.

Then install it as a module or upgrade to at last 1.4.13 (where IDEA
was added in core)
What does showpref on this key tell you about key preferences on that
key and your own? If you include your own key as an encrypt-to and do
not list IDEA in preferences for that it should find another common
denominator (likely 3DES)

But you could always generate a new self-signature giving it signing
capability. But anyhow, that is a digression, the point remains that a
spare S capability does no harm to the security of the key.

Another factor to consider here is also that major distributions
backport security fixes without bumping minor and patch versions. So
the version information doesn't necessarily provide a good picture of
the state of a system.
I support just reporting the major version (as I agree this can be of
interest) and maybe when 2.1 comes out separate between 2.0 and 2.1 in
some way (i.e. include minor as well). Although this isn't strictly
speaking from a usability perspective (as the capabilities of a given
user's implementation would be presented in the key preferences), it
might have some value in tracking upgrade adoption.

Hash: SHA512
I got curious about the current distribution of keys available on the
keyservers and wrote up a quick tool to dump some of this
information[a] from SKS yesterday. Since this might be of interest for
others as well I'll include some of the findings here. The full post
with main results including some charts are posted in a blog entry on
[0]. I hope to get around to digging a bit deeper into more
information going forwards, in particular taking into consideration
subkeys and expiration/revocations (I just have to figure some good
metrics to look at for this), so please let me know if there are
specific things that might be interesting.
A snippet from the post:
The overall majority (94.74%) were Version 4 keys c.f. RFC4880 with V3
keys representing 4.73% and V2 keys representing 0.53%. DSA keys
represented 74.4%, while 25.6% were RSA keys and a minority ElGamal
(0.03%), Elliptic Curve keys (35 keys) and keys in the experimental
range (32 keys) .
The key lengths spans from 3 keys in the experimental range key with
algo id 103 of 224 bits to 32,768 bits (3 keys, two of which are RSA
and one DSA). Due to the low occurrence of ECC keys (that have an
expectation of lower key lenghts for similar expected security levels
- -  normally in the 256-521 bit range, although there is a strong
possibility that the aforementioned 224 bits keys should also fit in
this category) I have not done any adjustment for these. A full 77.4%
of the keys are included when looking at the aggregate figures up to
and including 1024 bits, roughly 2.7 million of the keys, and the
corresponding number when looking at a 2048 and 4096 bits respectively
are 95.3% and 99.95% of all keys included.

@_author: Kristian Fiskerstrand 
@_subject: [Announcement] SKS 1.1.5 Released 
Hash: SHA512
We are pleased to announce the availability of a new stable SKS
release:  Version 1.1.5.
SKS is an OpenPGP keyserver whose goal is to provide easy to deploy,
decentralized, and highly reliable synchronization. That means that a
key submitted to one SKS server will quickly be distributed to all key
servers, and even wildly out-of-date servers, or servers that experience
spotty connectivity, can fully synchronize with rest of the system.
What's New in 1.1.5
  - Fixes for machine-readable indices. Key expiration times are now
    read from self-signatures on the key's UIDs. In addition, instead of
    8-digit key IDs, index entries now return the most specific key ID
    possible: 16-digit key ID for V3 keys, and the full fingerprint for
    V4 keys.
  - Add metadata information (number of keys, number of files,
    checksums, etc) to key dump. This allows for information on the
    key dump ahead of download/import, and direct verification of
    checksums using md5sum -c .
  - Replaced occurrances of the deprecated operator 'or' with '||'
    (BB issue   - Upgraded to cryptlib-1.7 and own changes are now packaged as
    separate patches that is installed during 'make'. Added the SHA-3
    algorithm, Keccak
  - Option max_matches was setting max_internal_matches. Fixed
    (BB issue   - op=hget now supports option=mr for completeness (BB issue   - Add CORS header to web server responses. Allows JavaScript code to
    interact with keyservers, for example the OpenPGP.js project.
  - Change the default hkp_address and recon_address to making the
    default configuration support IPv6. (Requires OCaml 3.11.0 or newer)
  - Only use '-warn-error A' if the source is marked as development as
    per the version suffix (+) (part of BB Issue   - Reduce logging verbosity for debug level lower than 6 for (i) bad
    requests, and (ii) no results found (removal of HTTP headers in
    log) (BB Issue   - Add additional OIDs for ECC RFC6637 style implementations
    (brainpool and secp256k1) (BB Issue  and fix issue for 32 bit
    arches.
  - Fix a non-persistent cross-site scripting possibility resulting from
    improper input sanitation before writing to client. (BB Issue  |
    CVE-2014-3207)
Note when upgrading from earlier versions of SKS
The default values for pagesize settings changed in SKS 1.1.4. To
continue using an existing DB from earlier versions without rebuilding,
explicit settings have to be added to the sksconf file.
pagesize:       4
ptree_pagesize: 1
Getting the Software
SKS can be downloaded from
There are a few prerequisites to building this code. You need:
* ocaml-3.11.0 or later (ocaml-3.12.x is recommended). Get it from
* Berkeley DB version 4.6.* or later, whereby 4.8 or later is
recommended. You can find the appropriate versions at
* GNU Make and a C compiler (e.g gcc)
Verifying the integrity of the download
Releases of SKS are signed using the SKS Keyserver Signing Key
available on public keyservers with the KeyID
    0x41259773973A612A
and has a fingerprint of
    C90E F143 0B3A C0DF D00E 6EA5 4125 9773 973A 612A.
Using GnuPG, verification can be accomplished by, first, retrieving the
signing key using
    gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-key 0x41259773973A612A
followed by verifying that you have the correct key
    gpg --keyid-format long --fingerprint 0x41259773973A612A
should produce:
    pub   4096R/41259773973A612A 2012-06-27
    Key fingerprint = C90E F143 0B3A C0DF D00E 6EA5 4125 9773 973A 612A
A check should also be made that the key is signed by
trustworthy other keys;
    gpg --list-sigs 0x41259773973A612A
and the fingerprint should be verified through other trustworthy sources.
Once you are certain that you have the correct key downloaded, you can
create a local signature, in order to remember that you have verified
the key.
     gpg --lsign-key 0x41259773973A612A
Finally; verifying the downloaded file can be done using
    gpg --keyid-format long --verify sks-x.y.z.tgz.asc
The resulting output should be similar to
    gpg: Signature made Wed Jun 27 12:52:39 2012 CEST
    gpg:                using RSA key 41259773973A612A

Hash: SHA512
Dear list,
A Gentoo user has run into an issue[0] with using HKPS from a static
build of GnuPG 2.0.26. I seem to be able to replicate this behavior in
a virtual machine, but my debugging seems to stop around the configure
detection of curl being usable. As seen in the configure output in
[1], curl is detected but determined to not be usable:
checking for curl-config... /usr/bin/curl-config
checking for the version of libcurl... 7.39.0
checking for libcurl >= version 7.10... yes
checking whether libcurl is usable... no
                                    ^^^^^
I see this same behavior in my VM for multiple versions of curl; Using
shared linking everything works, but as soon as I try to use static
linking, curl is reported as unusable and gnupg reverts back to using
curl-shim, not supporting HKPS.
Any ideas as to why libcurl is not reported as usable by gnupg despite
having been built to support static linking?

The keyservers have no role in this, they are pure data store and can
never act as a CA. That would bring up a can of worm of issues, both
politically and legally, I wouldn't want to see the first case where a
keyserver operator was sued for permitting a "fake key" (the term
itself is very misleading, the key itself isn't fake at all, but a
fully valid key where the UID has not been mated to its holder through
proper validation).
Another way this is being handled in some systems is dedicated
keyservers for an organization (standard is keys.[domain] in the cases
I've seen) that looks up key using LDAP. This is a read-only store
that is connected to the Domain Controller / Active Directory in the
system I'm thinking of. So at least Symantec Encryption Server checks
for the existence of such a keyserver when sending and asking it for
it. The keys are automatically maintained with a short time to expiry
requiring frequent refreshes. I understand the rationale, but would
rather see a CA involved in this (i.e a Company Employee CA).
People need to understand that operational security is critical for
any security of a system and validate the key through secondary
channel (fingerprint, algorithm type, key length etc verifiable
directly or through probabilistic measures e.g. based on historical
postings on mailing lists over a long time for a project etc).

No, it is not, it has always been very clear no to rely on the
existence of a key on either a keyserver or on a local keyring without
proper verification and certification
Again, no it wont, a key could still be valid even though a second
user adopts a domain name, what should happen to the first key on the
keyserver in such an event, in particular if this is revoked, any
activity from the keyservers on this could lead to misappropriation.
This would be bad for the overall security of the network, it is a
reason the keyservers are add only and should continue to remain so.
It collides with security and is a bad idea.

This doesn't make much sense, if you don't have a trust path to any of
those other keys their existence is irrelevant, and that is before
taking ownertrust into considerations in the first place (only a dozen
of the keys I've certified have ever been assigned an ownertrust of
marginal and much fewer as full)
What is needed is better education and an increased consciousness in
society at large in considering security and privacy. I will concede
that we have a way to go on making the concepts better understood,
which is increasingly getting difficult due to diffusion from things
like discussions on algorithms and key preferences, that plays a
marginal role in the overall consideration of security (including opsec).

list was provided after a quick lookup - there were 7 keys in total

Increasing the information on keyservers like this, in particular in
the descriptive parts can be considered, would it suffice to be part

Hash: SHA512
At this point I would just like to point out that nobody should rely
on the existence of a key in the keyring for security. After a proper
key validation the key should be signed, either locally or as an
exportable signature to form part of the WoT. As such the existence of
the key on the keyring really does not pose any issue (maybe except
for aesthetically)
Just looking at the file in question the fingerprint is not stored
along with the data, but you can get the long keyid using
$ gpg --list-packets Tmp/kf.asc
:public key packet:
        version 4, algo 1, created 1197735934, expires 0
        keyid: 0B7F8B60E3EDFAE3
For the fingerprint the key will have to be parsed and the fingerprint
calculated. This doesn't have to be done in the primary user keyring
however, but you can easily use a temporary keyring - see "--keyring file"

 - LDAP Support in GnuPG 2.1 (currently not implemented, which makes
it difficult to work with systems such as Symantec Encryption Serve)

practice unless the blockchain itself was decentralized (it can't
function securely if completely local to validation server). iirc this

It makes the information more compact and will make hkp vindex lists
look cleaner. Presuming this information contains data objects in json
format it will be interpreted by a parser, and raw data from

Any secure system needs proper operational security surrounding it,
that require user awareness. So if security/privacy is a priority,
there needs to be an overhead (it might even serve a purpose as it
reminds the user about the the proper procedures to follow).
Quick example; They can use OpenPGP all they want, doesn't help one
bit if the private keys are stored on the computer, running a 10 year
old version of Operating System XY with so many trojan horses working
on copying the private key data that they are fighting over the
resources on the computer.
To paraphrase Schneier, security isn't a product it is a process.

Are they really the target group for this proposal? Keep in mind this
would be in addition to the regular WoT model, so there is no DoS
based on that, per se (obviously you should never encrypt data to a
key that isn't verified on some level, even if just a heuristic
analysis based on public data and a local non-exportable signature).
If the key isn't on keyserver it defeats some of the purpose of this
being an easy to use for senders (while still providing _some_ level
of security).

Instinctively this sounds flawed, the point is there is no way without
downloading the key and verifying the validation path through other
existing known good keys. If you rely solely on the number of
signatures that can easily be constructed, either through generating
new keys or due to the keyservers not doing any cryptographic
verification that the signatures themselves are correct.

In general I believe this to be an insufficient form of identification

PGP keyserver does it reasonably sane in its methodology by creating a

It isn't more complex, it is LESS complex to do it as a standalone CA.
We currently have about 150 different key servers in the main
gossipping network, you would have to establish severe trust
mechanisms between them as to convey the verification data, change the
gossiping protocol to accomodate this, implement crypto in the
keyservers, possibly have keyservers shut down for legal reasons as
possible verctors of legal attack for some additional data; data that,
in its concept is the job of a CA in the first place.

the key in these instances (that currently involve manual key

And anyone is free to set up a CA that performs this validation and

They are already quite up to date, SKS 1.1.5+ (development master)
even supports the experimental Ed25519 draft used by GnuPG. What you
are proposing here isn't about joining the rest of the internet, it is
about subverting the security by introducing a false sense of security
and even worse, that opens up well known attack vectors.
By the way, an OpenPGP key is fully valid without any email address as

For completeness, going to include some of the template for my
response to delete key requests;
But your situation is a good example of why one should never trust
a key based on email address in UID alone, but need to verify
fingerprint, creation type, key algorithm etc with the perceived
owner and certify/sign the key.
If you google you'll find some more detailed explanations as to
why you can't delete a key from a keyserver.
Long story short, even if it was technically possible the social
protocol is missing. Speaking more generally, there might've been
two (or more) people sharing the same name, and email addresses
change over time, if the previous user deleted his email, it
wouldn't make the key any less valid that someone else take over
the email address.
This is why one should never trust email address alone, but always
verify keys through other means (mainly fpr, creation date, algo,
size). That several keys exists for a single address is, from a
cryptographical and security point of view irrelevant, as it is
only applicable as a potential issue if people don't follow proper
procedure for due dilligence.

@_subject: [Announcement] SKS 1.1.6 Released 
Hello lists,
We are pleased to announce the availability of a new stable SKS
release:  Version 1.1.6.
SKS is an OpenPGP keyserver whose goal is to provide easy to deploy,
decentralized, and highly reliable synchronization. That means that a
key submitted to one SKS server will quickly be distributed to all key
servers, and even wildly out-of-date servers, or servers that experience
spotty connectivity, can fully synchronize with rest of the system.
What's New in 1.1.6
  - Add support for Elliptic Curve keys based on Curve25519 (both
    Ed25519/EdDSA and encryption keys based on these curves)
  - Fix format of md5sum file by adding a 2nd space to be format
    compliant
  - Improvements to sks build stack space requirements
  - Misc updates and fixes to web interface and typical config file
Note when upgrading from earlier versions of SKS
The default values for pagesize settings changed in SKS 1.1.4. To
continue using an existing DB from earlier versions without rebuilding,
explicit settings have to be added to the sksconf file.
pagesize:       4
ptree_pagesize: 1
Getting the Software
SKS can be downloaded from
There are a few prerequisites to building this code. You need:
* ocaml-4.0 or later. Get it from
* Berkeley DB version 4.6.* or later, whereby 4.8 or later is recommended.
  You can find the appropriate versions at
* GNU Make and a C compiler (e.g gcc)
Verifying the integrity of the download
Releases of SKS are signed using the SKS Keyserver Signing Key
available on public keyservers with the KeyID
    0x41259773973A612A
and has a fingerprint of
    C90E F143 0B3A C0DF D00E 6EA5 4125 9773 973A 612A.
Using GnuPG, verification can be accomplished by, first, retrieving the
key using
    gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-key 0x41259773973A612A
followed by verifying that you have the correct key
    gpg --keyid-format long --fingerprint 0x41259773973A612A
should produce:
    pub   4096R/41259773973A612A 2012-06-27
    Key fingerprint = C90E F143 0B3A C0DF D00E 6EA5 4125 9773 973A 612A
A check should also be made that the key is signed by
trustworthy other keys;
    gpg --list-sigs 0x41259773973A612A
and the fingerprint should be verified through other trustworthy sources.
Once you are certain that you have the correct key downloaded, you can
a local signature, in order to remember that you have verified the key.
     gpg --lsign-key 0x41259773973A612A
Finally; verifying the downloaded file can be done using
    gpg --keyid-format long --verify sks-x.y.z.tgz.asc
The resulting output should be similar to
    gpg: Signature made Wed Jun 27 12:52:39 2012 CEST
    gpg:                using RSA key 41259773973A612A
    gpg: Good signature from "SKS Keyserver Signing Key"
We have to thank all the people who helped with this release, by
discussions on the mailing list, submitting patches, or opening issues
for items that needed our attention.
Happy Hacking,

Well, it depends. Sure, should always use full fingerprint for

and the packet structure use 64 bit keyid as identifier, so using
fingerprint in quite a number of other cases is more resource

While this is correct in a perfect world, in practice it depends on
the context as expirations can only effectively be extended due to
possibility for an attacker to remove the new self-sig and presenting
an older copy of the certificate to a third party. The same goes for
revocation, it is true that the keyservers are add-only and provides
some protection against it, but it is feasable for an attacker to
present this certificate without revocation data to a user that isn't
diligent with regards to keyring refreshes or by manipulation of the
update channel (e.g. a preference for fetching from non-tls URI rather
than a keyserver).

Who said anything about creating a new one in this part of the process?
each device has separate A subkeys already, you lost your device, you
revoke the A subkey for it (this step is actually the most tricky, as
revocation certificates can't be generated for subkeys - so you need to
have pre-generated versions of pubkey with it revoked created carefully
manually beforehand).
not following, you don't have access to the primary key at this point
(say you're travelling and the primary is on smartcard in a vault)
Whether need for "right now" depends on severity, the compromise is in
most cases a lost device, not an active attacker, so a 20-30 min
timeframe is likely sufficient in most cases anyways e.g from a regular
crontab run of monkeysphere, this also should fit with most key

No, its not a design flaw, it is valid design. OpenPGP keyblock
information is based on an object based security model where packets are
added, but don't carry any meaning until the signature has been
verified. The public keyserver network is by design not a trusted third
party, and can not be, so keyblock needs to be imported using a local
client at which point invalid data, including invalid signatures,
results in discarding of the data, which would filter out the signature

No, that is also wrong, as it implies that anything is trusted unless
otherwise stated. A malicious actor can claim it is verified all he/she
wants (simply removing the disclaimer). The user's default position
NEEDS to be that nothing is verified until it is done locally or by an
explicitly trusted third party.
Any kind of disclaimer is actually doing the user a dis-service and
supporting a subset of the user base that lacks sufficient
experience/knowledge to do anything securely to begin with, which is the
root cause of the issue; the solution isn't a disclaimer it is more
Fwiw I don't recommend anyone to directly link to vindex etc on
keyservers, you'll notice that  only links to
get operations for similar purposes (if you find a (v)index link it is a
bug and you should report it separately), but being able to browse the
keyserver directly is too useful for debugging to completely remove. It
is a reason it is done on port 11371 for hkp and I would encourage only
accessing it through a local client, but other than that it isn't much
to do on the keyserver side.
But the lesson here is that in order to avoid misuse by an unexperience
userbase the protocol has to be a binary obfuscated mess instead of
trying to re-use well-established protocols in text form, just in case
the user walks into the maze for some reason.

The users shoudn't browse keyservers at all, so it shouldn't really be
an issue. Linking to get operation to get the public keyblock is just a
No, that actually is broken by design as it doesn't open up for proper
operational security controls, in particular lack of private key
separation on smartcard and airgapped computer.
the name of the primary UID of a signature is irrelevant; if we follow
this argument; (i) until it is verified everything is untrustworthy, so
(ii) the signature itself shouldn't be shown, nor should any of the UIDs
for the public keyblock itself, as the self-signature isn't verified,
and (iii) and the keyserver can't verify it as it isn't a trusted part
of the infrastructure so the user can't know that it isn't a malicious
operator running the specific server.
The only logical consequence from (i)-(iii) is to remove keyservers from
the mix and let users do bilateral exchanges (good luck with revocation
distribution), for the simple reason that SOME users can't do things
right, it has to destroy any chance of a proper security for others.
Which incidentally is similar to a lot of other over-simplification and
interconnections throughout the world, but that is a separate

gpg-agent though, that doesn't materialize when calling the pinentry
application directly in an environment.
In this case the gtk2 pinentry works as expected though... but something
is possibly off with the handling of DISPLAY (as far as I've gotten in
my debugging that is the only diff in the env vars between the direct

I would be generally cautious for both approaches without proper support
in the surrounding infrastructure. In particular an upgrade to a

container in the case of a security upgrade when such embedding happens,
which is generally a bad thing unless you have a large scale deployment
and defined QA processes for terminating and replacing containers with
new deployments regularly.

I normally recommend separating those, as the value for external parties
that might want to trust this CA for certifying employees but not other
third parties.
As for access to private key material, I normally recommend that the end
user never has access to any secret key material, but only access to
using subkeys (never the primary) using smartcard tokens.
Wrt your other discussion of ssh based scheme, an alternative for escrow
is actually using gnupg 2.1's gpg-agent through SSH socket forwarding so
key material never is available locally, a system could theoretically be
set up in a restricted setup so user doesn't actually get access to the
key material (but it would require some setup to ensure they don't have
it, so smartcard is generally easier)

no, there isn't necessarily a client plugin, the gateway decrypts the

I don't see this as disagreeing, this means you don't have any benefit
from storing the email in encrypted form once it hits the corporate

The issue with that is that as long as the employee has private key for
primary the individual can create new subkeys, and the primary will
always have signing capability (if not always specified as usage flag).
In most setups the employee won't need/shouldn't have the private key

This seems to be based on a misconception whereby you're attributing
properties of a certificate authority to the keyservers. OpenPGP already
has a method for certification from CAs, and that is by providing a
signature on the appropriate UID on the public keyblock. As long as the
signature is propagated on the keyserver network, these roles can be
appropriately isolated and the decision of whether or not to trust a
specific CA is left to the user performing the trust calculation,
incidentally also allowing for signatures from multiple CAs.

I'm somewhat interested in hearing how this scheme would work in the

(i) How would you distribute revocation certificates
(ii) Would you trust a signature for removal of keyblock provided to the
keyserver (a) after a revocation certificate has been added (b) before a
revocation has been added (as measured on the specific keyserver).
(iii) iff (ii)(a) and (ii)(b) differ; how would you handle a sync
conflict of said data?

I'd personally agree that the whole right to be forgotten EU is talking

out any trace of their historical behavior after said behavior has been
published / happened, but through legal means rather than a technical
restriction. Actually there are many aspects of GDPR that is quite
hostile to both free speech and businesses.
I would agree access control would be relevant up to the point that the
information is public to begin with.
in the current state EU seems to be building strongly on roots of

@_author: Kristian Fiskerstrand 
@_subject: DRM? 
Not really (and that is ignoring disagreement with the complaints to
begin with).
One issue with the first statement "please allow to be on keyserver" is
that it doesn't provide any verification that the email in UID (or just
the name) is accurate, so most of the complains regarding occurrence of
multiple matches for a search would not be honored, as you could anyways
create multiple keyblocks with this property.
To answer that request for feature, you need to make the keyserver a
de-facto CA instead of separating the roles, and performing some ID
verification at upload point, for email this might be a simple
robot-signing, but email addresses changes over time, and a key might be
relevant even after changing email providers to verify historical
signatures etc.
But for OpenPGP this isn't an issue to begin with. No keyblock should be
used without first verifying the material, which historically is mostly
done through fingerprint exchanges / key signing parties. If wanting to
introduce a CA in the system, nothing is stopping you, and you will find
some discussion on robo-signers etc e.g at [0], but it doesn't require
any changes on the keyserver side, exactly because that is just a data
store and distribution point without any other responsibility.
Obviously the same goes for a TOFU model and WKD, which still can use
the keyserver network as distribution point for updates of

The important thing would actually be that the data is retained in the
database, as that wouldn't break sync. Aside from that the keyservers
would have to implement cryptography and verify that the revocation
certificate is accurate, this is within the scope of feasibility,
although wouldn't do anything one way or the other with regards to
security. Whether it would help privacy is also a questionable matter,
as the full data store is downloadable, so anyone can download it
containing the data wanting to be hidden.

They don't really constitute an issue either for security or privacy,

your client will filter unknown keys and actually verify the rest) you
will see all kinds of interesting things like the Christmas present of
["funny sks"] on my keyblock some years ago. But it doesn't constitute

NB: I'm using the term keyblock rather than public key as to not mix

keyblock contains more data than the public key, including UID/UATs and
subkeys that are on their own consisting of multiple public keys in a
cryptographic context.

A distinction need to be made here, "know each other" actually means
ever having confidence that the public keyblock belongs to that person.
That doesn't imply a very deep relationship except for having met at one
point to exchange information. You don't really attribute anything
except possibly having looked at a governmental issued ID at some point.

Although RNP doesn't support smartcards currently, a potential solution

Details need to be discussed, but it would be an optional solution, that
only works if the user has installed software (scd etc.) in addition to

Outsourcing smartcard handling to scdaemon (scd), which is available
