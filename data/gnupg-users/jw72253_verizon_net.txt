Assume that the specified key (which must be given as a full 8 byte key ID)
is as trustworthy as one of your own secret keys. This option is useful if
you don't want to keep your secret keys (or one of them) online but still
want to be able to check the validity of a given recipient's or signator's
key. I read this definition online, but I can't seem to get a grasp on what it is
used for.  As it sounds as though it may have use for something I want to
do, I was hoping someone could elaborate a bit on this.  It may be clear as
glass to most of you, but I am not seeing it (sorry).  Thanks.

@_subject: --trusted-key 
I have a couple of questions about this idea.  First, why would you not have
assigned ultimate trust to the public key ID 0x215236DA when you created it
and had your secret key available to do so?  I mean, why the delay; what
value to you is your key without having it so trusted? (What point about
trust am I not factoring in here?) Secondly, you said, " So my gpg.conf says
'trusted-key 215236DA'." Where you shortening it for sake of brevity, as
that is not an 8 byte long key ID?  Finally, (and this part may very well
relate to my lack of fully understanding the trust procedures) would I be
specifying and ID in "--trusted-key long key ID" for a key that is one of
mine? If so, why would I need one of "my" keys, as the definition states, in
order "...to check the validity of a given recipient's or signator's key"?
I know I must be missing some critical point ----> woosh!  Thanks.

That is now clear for me.  Thanks.  I believe the part that threw me off was
that I apparently misunderstood where the trust components resided.  I
thought that, because the trust was maintained in your database
independently of the keys themselves, the presence of the database on your
machine would have sufficed to carry the weight of the trusted key that was
not present.  I suppose now that this component of trust, using the command
"--trusted-key", has been manually inserted into the present database as it
was not relocated in some way on to the present machine without the trusted
key from which it was derived.  The trust components and interplay is
something I obviously need to continue studying.

@_subject: batch decryption key identification 
Hello.  On this website
to-encrypt-a-message) I found this FAQ and answer:
Question:  How can I get list of key IDs used to encrypt a message?
$ gpg --batch --decrypt --list-only --status-fd 1 2>/dev/null | \
  awk '/^\[GNUPG:\] ENC_TO / { print $3 }'
As it relates in part to my original question below, I want to ask about
this in more detail. Knowing which particular key was used for encryption
would allow me to pinpoint which of the several keys on a key-ring to use
for decryption and would help save much time and effort in the process when
looking at a batch of messages.  I am not a programmer, but I can see that the above command uses the program
'awk' to identify the key used; and I understand that the Gnu program 'gawk'
has equivalent functionality. I have two questions about it.  First, using
the above command, whereabouts should I put the "path/filenames.asc" in it
for the command to analyze for decryption, and should I put any other
unlisted parameters in the command for it to complete?  I tried testing it
like this: gpg --batch --decrypt  --list-only --status-fd 1
But I saw nothing output on the screen related to the key used on the file.
The 'filename.asc' tested was just an individual encrypted file, but I later
intend to use this on a batch of files named such as 'path/*.asc'.
Secondly, are the 'gawk' program commands equivalent to the above listed awk
commands, or will I need to alter it in some way?  Thanks.

No there is no way to do this.
The best suggestion for all automated systems is not to use a
passphrase.  If you really want a passphrase and you require full
control over it you have three choices:
 - Write your own pinentry and send CANCEL back until the desired
   passphrase is requested.  Then send the right passphrase.
 - Write a simple pinentry to always send a CANCEL back (GnuPG 2.1 will
   have an option to emulate this).  The use gpg-preset-passphrase to
   seed gpg-agent with the desired passphrase.
 - Use --status-fd/--command-fd.  These options allow you to
   pass a passphrase to gpg entirely under script control.  They work
   even with GnuPG 1.4.

Hello.   The online manual for gpg states this about the "-list-keys"
option: "Changes the behaviour of some commands. This is like --dry-run but
different in some cases. The semantic of this command may be extended in the
future. Currently it only skips the actual decryption pass and therefore
enables a fast listing of the encryption keys."
I was testing some procedures with this option, using in one instance a
message encrypted with a public key passphrase and in another instance a
message encrypted with symmetric encryption only.  Indeed, as stated, in the
first case I was shown to which sub key ID it had been encrypted.  on the
other hand, in the second case, I was shown only a symmetric cipher type
(e.g., CAST5), the one which was used for encryption.  These results are
consistent with what I expected.  My question is, should I expect this sort
of outcome in all cases?  I should be shown a key ID for encryption with a
public key, and I should be shown an encryption cipher when symmetric
encryption was used?  Thanks.

I found, after fiddling with this a bit and looking at some documentation
online, that the problem is with the posted answer to the FAQ.  For the
above command to work as intended, it needs to have the part "--decrypt
" moved to the end of the line.  The Options are supposed to
precede the Commands.  Once moved to the end, the command's output does in
fact show me the information about which key it was encrypted to, assuming
that I have the key on my key-ring and that it was not a hidden recipient.

Hello.  In my web browser I am looking at the url of keys.gnupg.net, which
has the following title on top of its page: SKS OpenPGP
Keyserver at zimmermann.mayfirst.org. This site allows me to check or submit
public keys.  On that page there are some instructions in a section called
"Access", and it states:
To use this server directly via HKP add this to your .PGP keyserver list:
Now when I went to look at the site noted above (i.e.,
 it appears to be exactly the same as the
first page, the one with a url of "keys.gnupg.net".  So, is this an
officialy sanctioned site by gnupg, one which is simply redirected?
Secondly, regarding the instructions, already in my gpg.conf file I have
this line: "keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net"; so, would there be any point in
changing it?
More importantly, in the same instructions it states this:
use HKPS by dropping 	the May First/People Link Certificate Authority's
certificate into ~/.gnupg/mfpl.crt, and 	then adding the following
lines to ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf:
Therefore, if this is in fact an officially sanctioned site, I should prefer
to have this latter option for use as it supports encrypted key transfer
processes.  I am assuming that there should be only one entry for the
"keyserver" name option although the online instructions do not explicitly
state so? Thanks.

In addition, it seems to imply to me from the instructions online at
ions.html, that I could in fact use more than one "keyserver 'name'" option
in my 'gpg.conf' file; and that I could use different options for different
keyservers.  At least that is how I understand these instructions:
" After the keyserver name, optional keyserver configuration options may be
provided. These are the same as the global --keyserver-options from below,
but apply only to this particular keyserver."
Or is this instruction referring only to different options for different
"types" (e.g., hkp, ldap or mailto) of keyservers? I mean, if I am
interpreting it right, I could, theoretically, use these lines in gpg.conf:
keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net
keyserver hkps://zimmermann.mayfirst.org ca-cert-file=\mfpl.crt

@_subject: key selection in batch decryptions 
While I am using gpg 2.0.17 on a Windows OS, I often have instances where I
need to decrypt a few random messages from a large batch of messages.
Normally, I can pipe the passphrase, symmetric or public key, to the gpg
command, and it will attempt to match the passphrase with the keys on my key
ring for each message.  if a message does not correspond to the key after
trying each key, the process simply skips the file and moves to the next one
to try again.  If there are several keys on my key ring, but I am interested
in trying only one of them, or if the passphrase is for symmetric encryption
instead of for a key, it takes extra time for the process to try each of the
keys in turn.  Is there a way to tell gpg to use just one of the keys if
any?  I have tried specifying this as one of the options "-u userID", but it
seems to ignore my specification and it always tries to use a different key
from the one I intend.  Thanks.

@_subject: path defaults for gpg.conf 
Hello, Olav.
Thanks for the information and for the pointer to the "readme.w32". It clarified my understanding. Based on these sources and what you said above, it would seem that there are four places where a "gpg.conf" file should be referenced and that there is an order in priority used by "gpg.exe" for referencing it. As I understand it, and please correct me if I am wrong, in order of increasing priority, the gpg user's homedir, where "gpg.conf" should be placed, would be as follows.
First, if no option is stated for it, the program would look by default in "a directory named 'gnupg' below the application data directory of the user." In Windows 7, that is here:  %APPDATA%\gnupg.  Second, any arbitrarily chosen folder for the user home directory can be specified if its name is put in Windows Registry entry "under the key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\GNU\GnuPG using the name 'HomeDir'." Third, one can use an environment variable named "GNUPGHOME" to specify an arbitrarily chose directory for it. Fourth, the on-the-fly option of "--homedir" at the actual time when the command is issued can used to identify the position of a gpg.conf in the user's home directory. Is that about right, then?
I am not a programmer, but only a mere power-user (on a good day anyway!), so I will step outside my usual comfort zone for a moment to say that I am inclined to think that there is one more place where "gpg.conf" can be put and made use of effectively in a Windows directory, namely, the current directory of the executable "gpg.exe" at the time the command is issued. That is to say, if none of the previously noted methods point to the folder where "gpg.conf" were located, would it not be true that gpg.exe would finally look in its own current directory, which should suffice consequently for this purpose?

Hello, Olav.
I sincerely appreciate your replies. Like the other poster asking about the current directory issue, I too am curious about why including it would result in a less secure situation. Perhaps an example of how so would be helpful in this regard, at least for me or someone else who is not a programmer to understand your point.  As I recall from reading the instructions for the many programs I use, I have always read that a program's executable looks into its own directory as part of its routine in searching for files it needs; so your statement about using it ("the current directory would be a decision for the program's author") did come as a bit of a surprise because I was under the impression that this was normally unavoidable and just a result of how the code of an executable must function, at least in Windows OS. Apparently, that is not so?

Hello, John.
That's an authors' decision. I'm fine with it. It gives you many means to
control your environment - and for security products I prefer NOT to include
the 'current dir' default.

@_subject: default keyring file formats 
A lot of the documentation I see online includes references to files with
names like "foo.pub" or "foo.sec" as if these were public key rings and
secret key rings. However, I am accustomed to seeing keyrings like
"pubring.gpg" and "secring.gpg". Were the former of these used as keyring
files in the past, but nowadays the latter format are used?

Keyrings of that type are just files with multiple keys concatenated together.  The format is effectively the same no matter what the filename I've often seen foo.pub / foo.sec as a single key (while the pubring.gpg, pubring.pgp, or pubring.pkr) is the keyring, but that's just convention.
Hi, David. I appreciated your prompt reply. So with a concatenated keyring in the format "foo.pub" would I first use a command like the following one if I want to get the keys out of it in order to move them and import them into a default (i.e., conventional) keyring of the format "pubring.gpg":
gpg --export --no-default-keyring --keyring foo.pub --armor --output

@_subject: key ordering choices 
When I use this command:
Gpg -list-secret-keys
The secret keys are listed from the keyring in my gpg homedir. When there
are several secret keys, what is the ordering criteria used by gpg to
display the keys within an individual keyring?  Do I have any control over
the ordering?  Also, "if" I wanted to have more than one keyring, and I were
to name them, for example, "secring1.gpg", "secring2.gpg", would my ordering
be respected by gpg in the display from such a command?

@_subject: using gpg with http proxy 
When I looked here:   I
see it mentioned that the option "--honor-http-proxy" is available and would
work if there is an environment variable setting for "http_proxy". Would
this work in Windows, and would it simply be ignored if no environment
variable were set ahead of time? Finally, in general can an option like this
be put either in an options file or in "gpg.conf"? Thanks.

@_subject: path defaults for gpg.conf 
I have two instances of GnuPG installed on a Windows 7 OS. I also use an
application that appears to have installed an instance of it for its own use
and put it into one of its separate folders along with some of the files
needed with it, including "gpg.exe" and a unique "gpg.conf" file, among
others. However, when I go to that folder, in which this third instance of
gpg was placed, with a command prompt in Windows and type ".\gpg.exe -h",
the initial output from this command includes these lines:
Home: %APPDATA%/gnupg
Supported algorithms:
Pubkey: RSA, RSA-E, RSA-S, ELG-E, DSA
What puzzles me is the line with "Home". I have two questions about it.
First, where is it getting that environment variable(?) called "Home" since
I do not show it listed among the environment variables I can see in Windows
when I issue the "set" command to show me all of them? Secondly, why does
"Home" point to the path it does instead of pointing to the current
directory path for which I issued the command ".\gpg.exe -h". If there is a
unique "gpg.conf" in this folder designed to work with this third instance
of "gpg.exe", shouldn't "Home" also be this current directory? Otherwise, it
would not see the commands and options I included in its special "gpg.conf".
Is that not so? Thanks.
