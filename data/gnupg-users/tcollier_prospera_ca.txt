@_subject: Decrypting a file with a passphrase via command line 
I have gpg2 installed and I get prompted for the passphrase when I try
to decrypt the file.  If I enter in the passphrase and don't log out it
doesn't prompt me the next time as it is cached, but I need to
disconnect from the RDP connection so that's not an option.  I can
figure out how to put the passphrase into the command line so that it
does not require user intervention.  Help?

We figured it out.  We needed an extra parameter to get the passphrase to be entered from a file into the command line.
"C:\Program Files\GNU\GnuPG\gpg2" --batch --passphrase-file "C:\Program Files\GNU\GnuPG\pass.txt" -du "Username " -o "C:\RPTS%3%2%1.zip" "C:\RPTS%3%2%1.pgp"
