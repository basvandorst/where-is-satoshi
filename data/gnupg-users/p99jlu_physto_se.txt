So, why does GPG default to something that pgp cant handle?

Hi! I have a simple question:
Is there any point in signing all ID:s on someone's public key. Does not the trust-path flow from my signature on the main id to the other user-id:s via

But there is still no answer to the question 'how do I change primary user-id'. I'm thinking about exporting my
keys from gpg to pgp, change primary user id, and then put it pack in
to gpg. May this be a solution?

@_subject: unsuported key algorithm? 
Hi all!
I keep getting this kind of problems, hope someone can help me out:
gpg: requesting key  from finland.keyserver.net ...
gpg: key : unsupported public key algorithm
gpg: key something>: no valid user IDs
gpg: this may be caused by a missing self-signature
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:           w/o user IDs: 1
Then I tried with the --allow-non-selfsigned-uid (I know thats not great,
but I'm just testing this)
but then i get:
gpg: requesting key  from finland.keyserver.net ...
gpg: key : unsupported public key algorithm
gpg: key : accepted non self-signed user ID '(some key )     '  gpg: key : public key imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1  (RSA: 1)
and when I do
echo testing|gpg -er 8F0E6845
i get:
gpg: 8F0E6845: skipped: unknown pubkey algorithm
gpg: [stdin]: encryption failed: unknown pubkey algorithm
Is this an RSA key, and if it is, how do i use the --load-extension and
rsa-keys? Where can I get the extensions?
this is what i find in the handbook:

I cant agree with you more! Theres to mush work convincing people to
encrypt as it is. Wee cant expect the everyday users to learn all
about different OpenPGP implementations, and how to use them with each
other. Thats why I think that the all defaults in gpg must be something
that both OpenPGP and nai PGP likes and suports!

@_subject: Strange(?) files 
I have noticed a quite large number if files named something
like . in my ~/.gnupg
directory. Permissions for some files are -rw-r--r-- and for
some files -rw-r-----. Fore some of them root are the group owner, and for some of them I am. Strange! I assume they are lockfiles left when I ctrl-c running gpg's. Do they have to be kept for so long time, and couldn't there be a way to
remove the lockfiles on ctrl-c? ps. These files are not listed under 'files' in the man page.

In case you did not wipe the files, just deleted them, you might want
to try something like 'cat /dev/hda1|grep "some string in the files"'
to see if theres something left on the disk.

@_subject: secure file deletion 
I agree that "It is not the job of GnuPG to delete files".
Since I still use ext2, I use the wipe-command by Tom Vier
, and I think it does the job, at least as good as I
need. I have done several tests, and it seems to do the job. I don't know
about the electron microscopy-level safety, since I don't own one, but at
least you can't grep the plain-text from the device after it's been wiped.
It can also be used to wipe your swap-space, and I really think it's
*mush* better than nothing. I use IDE and ext2 only, and I don't know
how 'wipe' will do in other environments. The location is
By the way; there is another 'wipe' @ Another interesting thing partly related to this (or call it off-topic):
Has anybody used the s-bit (not sticky!) with ext2/chattr? From the
chattr man-page:
- When  a  file  with the `s' attribute set is deleted, its blocks are
- zeroed and written back to the disk.
I have tried it, but it does not seem to work. Anybody? How is wiping and/
or clearing handled in Reiser / ext3 or whatever they are called?

I might be wrong, but I think the option --trusted-key does
what you want.
# man gpg|grep -e --trusted-key -A 7
--trusted-key long key ID
                 Assume  that  the  specified  key (which must be
                 given as a  full 8 byte key ID) is as  trustwor-
                 thy  as one of your own secret keys. This option
                 is useful if you don't want to keep your  secret
                 keys  (or  one of them) online but still be able
                 to check the validity of a given recipient's  or
                 signator's key.
