Hello Chris,
I'm pretty new to using GnuPG as well. I use GnuPG 1.0.6 with GnuPG shell
v1.77. My PGP is Personal Security 7.0.3. Here's what I do when I want to
import secret keys from PGPkeys...
In PGPkeys, I Export the key(s) into "C:\gnupg" (putting a check mark in
"include private key(s)" before I export.
Then, I open a DOS box, and type the following:
cd C:\gnupg   gpg --import --allow-secret-key-import c:\gnupg\[filename].asc  <"enter">
This seems to work for me.  I hope it helps.

"something" sounds like the reasonable choice here.  ;-)

Hello Klaus,
The "cleanest" way I've seen this done is to have the raw HTML text
signed.  Then, as you mention - one only needs to view the source and
verify it.  The "-----Begin, etc.-----" will still be visible when one
views the raw text, but that's not really a problem, as it won't show up
when viewing the page in a browser.
Just be sure to sign the entire text (including the "" and ""
tags at beginning and end - not just what's within them).
