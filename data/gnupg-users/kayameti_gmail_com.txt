@_subject: why do not "gpgme-1.1.4/tests/gpg/t-decrypt.c" and 
Hi all,
I'm new user of gpgme. I installed gpgme-1.1.4 and studied examples of it.
But when I try to run t-decrypt and t-encrypt binaries, they give this
# ./t-encrypt
t-encrypt.c:60: GPGME: End of file
# ./t-decrypt
t-decrypt.c:64: GPGME: Decryption failed
I'm using Fedora Core 8 (2.6.23.9-85.fc8) and I want to use gpgme to
encrypt/decrypt and assign plain data. Can you help me? How can I
encrypt/decrypt/assign plain data via gpgme library functions?
