Hi, (i think i previously sent this question to the wrong mailinglist)
I am installing collectd-4.10.0 on a CentOS 5 machine:
1) Configured collectd: ./configure --with-librrd=/opt/rrdtool-1.4.3/ --with-liboping=/opt/oping --with-libnetlink=/home/username/iproute2-2.6.29-1 --with-libgcrypt=/usr/lib
2) make followed by make install
3) Configured collectd.conf and this is the network plugin:
          SecurityLevel "Sign"
          Username "client2"
          Password "password2"
#       TimeToLive "128"
#       Forward false
#       CacheFlush 1800
#       ReportStats false
4) Restarted collectd and got the following error: Stopping collectd:                                         [FAILED]
Starting collectd: /opt/collectd/sbin/collectd: symbol lookup error: /opt/collectd/lib/collectd/network.so: undefined symbol: gcry_md_hash_buffer
I looked everywhere to find the problem but had no luck. I installed the same version of collectd on another machine exactly the steps above but it went smoothly and had no problem.
Can someone please help me with this?
Thanks in advace,
