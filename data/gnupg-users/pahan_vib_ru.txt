Dear friends!
I have a question about the GPG's command line:
How can I specify the passhprase in the command line?
in the PGP 6.5.8 command-line there is option
-z PASSPHRASE
it is very usefull option in the scripts that automatic process
encrypted mail
Best regards,

I know about --passphrase-fd n,
but it is not usable under Win9x :(
Also I know about a secret key without the password (--edit passwd)
I read  man and forum :)
