Using the option "--no-permission-warning" on the commandline of gpg
1.2.1 and 1.2.2 suppresses successfully warning messages. But when
"no-permission-warning" is inserted into the file gpg.conf (or options)
I still get a warning about unsafe file permissions.
I know how to avoid this message the better way, but it would be nice if
I could get this option working.
What could be the reason for this behaviour?
