of course you have to import the secret key as well.
Have a look at section "6. Importing keys from PGP" from
or if you have an old PGP version I found this docs useful:

I'm in the lucky position that I always could drive past M$ OE and neither
know details about GPGOE plug-in behaviour nor OE itself.
Just for my general understanding I want to ask if this problem mentioned
below can become true also with GPG OE plug-in. Does the plug-in user
see if he accidently sends his mail unencrypted?
Some active mouse implementations can really make this a problem, as the
focus will follow whatever the mouse rolls over.  The problem can also
happen when using the tray icon to encrypt & sign the current window.  I've
seen it since pgp version 6.5.1, and in windows 95, 98, ME, 2000.
I work-around by using the tray icon rather than the plugin for Outlook
Express for encryption.  I can see the message encrypted that way.

@_subject: win95 / gpa / gpg 1.0.6. 
Dear all,
during the night I've installed gpg 1.0.6. on Win95 (an early edition)
and afterwards gpa. gpa worked just fine but after generating a
new key-pair I unfortunately had to learn that the gpa binary packet
for Windoze is 'bundled' with gpg 1.0.4. and after a simple replacing
of gpg.exe the gpa doesn't work any more. Do you think I've messed
things up in the registry (a quick look didn't prove that) or is this
a known problem? Any workaround for using the existing binaries?
Searching the web couldn't answer this question.

@_subject: 1.0.6, Win95, etcetera 
[ hope it is ok for you when I go back to the list ]
thx for your interest.
when I replace the gpg.exe 1.0.4 which is 'shipped' with the
Gnu Privacy Assistent with the actual gpg version 1.0.6. the
gpa brings both: an error message with only an [OK] button
and a message regarding the program abortion.
I think I don't want to dig deeper into gpa. My next step will be
GPGshell. Before I followed up with WinPT but there is another (known)
problem for my OS:
-> I installed the mentioned update, but it doesn't work either.
Even after installation of two other related update packages.
What GUI/shell are you using? Any hints for having a look at?

@_subject: CNN on PGP and alternatives 
Keeping e-mail encryption alive
Alternative answers?
The alternatives still need work.
Authora, for instance, lacks compatibility with non-Microsoft e-mail
software such as Eudora and Lotus Notes.
Gnu is only a command-line program and needs a graphical interface
to be attractive to the vast majority of users. A few interfaces, including
Windows Privacy Tray, have been developed but none are as versatile
or simple as Network Associates' program.
The Gnu project "is the thing that comes close to what PGP from (Network
Associates) was, and it's really not there yet," said David Del Torto,
executive director of the CryptoRights Foundation, which promotes
encryption for human rights workers.
Zimmermann, who chairs the OpenPGP Alliance and works with som
commercial distributors, thinks any viable alternative will also need
extensive marketing. And if the PGP user base is to expand, he said,
tools must be easier to use.

because it seems you're a bit confused with keys and sigs
maybe you haven't exported your _secret key_ to Demoin1.asc? read the man page section for --export-secret-keys [names]
if you don't need any new keypairs or such which you may have
created in the meantime so why don't you simply copy your existing
