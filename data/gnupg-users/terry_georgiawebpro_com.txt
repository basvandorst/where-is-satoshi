@_subject: Have key ID, but can't decrypt. 
Newbie here...
I'm using GnuPGExch for unencrypting emails.
It works fine on my home computer but when I installed it on a client's
computer I had problems.
I imported the public and private keys through the DOS window fine, but it
turns out the text files I imported were corrupt (I had sent them to a Yahoo
email account to download at the client's office) - in binary form instead
of ascii.
So when I tested the unencryption, I got a message that looks like this:
 (89k)
After getting a good copy of the key text files, I tried re-importing the
text files in the DOS window and that didn't work.
I tried deleting the key from the GUI window in Outlook then re-importing
the text files in the DOS window and that didn't work either.
Then I tried uninstalling GnuPGExch and reinstalling and importing the text
files again. I even deleted everything in the C:\Program Files\GnuPGExch
folder, but still when unencrypting I get a screen similar to the above
linked image.
Can anyone give me some insight?
Be gentle, I'm very new to this. Please, if you could, walk me through
anything I may need to do.
Gracious thanks,

@_subject: Imported Corrupt file? 
Sorry - I posted this a bit ago with an older Subject Line.
I didn't see any feedback on my dilemma so I thought I would restate the
Subject Line and give it another go.
Can anyone help me *clear* these corrupt keys?
If not, can any recommend me to someone or somewhere who could?
I've read over the Manual here:
but 95% of it is over my head. I've rarely used the DOS window. Maybe 10
times in my whole life. Hopefully you can understand why this is such a
struggle for me.
