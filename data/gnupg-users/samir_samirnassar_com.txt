It is my understanding that 2.1.0 has a problem with hkps keyservers (such as the hkps SKS pool) and that this is only fixed in the betas for 2.1.1. If this understanding is correct and 2.1.1 fixes the hkps issues, I'd vote to release

On upgrade to 2.1.0 looking up keys from a keyserver stopped working for me. I tracked down the following comment from Hugo Hinterberger:  and Kristian Fiskerstrand's suggestion: I had the impression that this bug is getting fixed in 2.1.1 and that I shouldn't increase noise to an existing and known problem. At this stage I can report that despite trying out Kristian's suggestion I am not able to interact with either the hkps pool or individual hkps keyservers. Arch Linux, GnuPG

It might not be clear, but many of us have easily and simply migrated our .gnupg directories from computer to computer.
I've even deleted my .gnupg directory and restored it from backups. I've intentionally messed up my private key and restored my private key to working status from backups.
I guess I don't understand why you can't copy .gnupg from one system to another system.
Yelling on the mailing list is extremely rude. It is now very clear, and archived, how you feel about the topic. Repeating yourself further in the manner you have been using will only alienate people and will not move you to a resolution.

Of course this may or may not change (or it could all be a misunderstanding), in case it isn't though, I don't see what E2E-compatability adds. If the projects make a solid commitment to OpenPGP compatibility and back it up then that changes things.

SKS is behind a nginx reverse proxy using the instructions from: I can access SKS on the web through:
When I access the keyserver through:
gpg-connect-agent --verbose --dirmngr 'keyserver  'ks_get 1e42b367' /bye things work.

gpg-connect-agent --verbose --dirmngr 'keyserver  'ks_get 1e42b367' /bye
gpg-connect-agent --verbose --dirmngr 'keyserver  'ks_get 1e42b367' /bye
gpg-connect-agent --verbose --dirmngr 'keyserver hkps://keyserver.myriapolis.net:11371' 'ks_get 1e42b367' /bye
I get the following error: ERR 1 General error dirmngr.conf contains:

@_subject: PGP/MIME (Was: One alternative to SMTP for email: Confidant Mail) 
I am using KMail2 4.14.6 and I see your, Doug's, and Ingo's emails clearly even after mailman's modifications and all three are using PGP/MIME from different clients (I presume).

@_subject: Is Open PGP or GnuPG or GPG possible on a Mac? 
Yes, it is possible to use OpenPGP with GnuPG on OS X:
The best (most stable, best supported, easiest overall) results tend to GPG Suite: Mozilla Thunderbird: Enigmail: Keep in mind that the parties you want to communicate with also have to understand how to handle OpenPGP.
If it matters to you to be more secure in communication, I would strongly suggest making sure your computer is using full disk encryption. In the case of OS X on a Mac, this means enabling FileVault.

@_subject: FAQ: drop mention of 1.4? 
I do not see how this stance is justifiable.
What is the amount of current PGP users?
What is the amount of current PGP users who started using PGP in the last 5 What is the amount of current PGP users who started using PGP in the last 10 What is the amount of current PGP users who started using PGP in the last 15 Now, the three people who encrypted really important data using PGP 2.6 but somehow missed out on the last 15 years of GnuPG development, use GnuPG 1.4 to decrypt your information like Werner said.
There is no point to keeping the FAQ cluttered with references to old versions of GnuPG and many reasons against keeping the reference.

I can confirm this. Robert J. Hansen is indeed a real life human being and not a bot.

The GnuPG project describes the three branches of GnuPG as?Modern
(2.1.x), Stable (2.0.x), and Classic (1.4.x).
Should it be understood that GnuPG Modern is similar to a development

@_subject: Installing gnupg 
A small point of clarification. There is software called PGP, but this
is the user mailing list for GnuPG also known as GPG, which implements PGP.
There are several ways of gettings GnuPG for OS X:
A comprehensive guide to install GnuPG and configuring Thunderbird and
Enigmail is here:
If you look at the gnupg download page: note the section called binary downloads. This is most likely what you
are looking for there are two options for getting GnuPG installed.

@_subject: Feedback requested: GnuPG lookup and retrieval of PGP certificates 
I put together a short 1-page document of around 300 words to illuminate
the mechanics to a group of friends of the new key lookup via PKA and
The document is available in PNG format at
 and please don't bookmark
the URI for long-term use. It is not a cool URI(2).
I used "Publishing Keys in DNS(3)" by Damien Goutte-Gattat as a reference.
I did not use the OPENPGPKEY RR type since it is not implemented in my
DNS server yet(4). I used TYPE37 for PKA and TYPE61 for DANE.
If you have comments, concerns, additions, detractions, denouncements,
or applause, the document and a sufficiently recent version of GnuPG
should help you find a way to share this with me. If you decide to reply
to the mailing list, keep in mind that it is a public list and to be
considerate of the others on this list.

I tried it out and it works really well and GnuPG has made it very easy to do:

I control my gpg-agent with a systemd user service and that is pretty nice Samir Nassar
