I get a bus error trying to decrypt:

  1024-bit ELG-E key, ID 2481455C, created 2000-08-16 (main key ID 061E8FC3)
  Bus error           kosh:~/t$ I also get a bus error generating a new key:

  You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.      We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
  some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
  disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
  generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

This is bug  shown at   [ **]  1999-02-22  0.9.3
      Bus error on IRIX 6.4: Crash while doing a keygen. I think while creating
      the prime.  Other bus errors are reported when doing a "gpg README"
      on sparc-solaris2.6.
      --> Solaris fixed.
      --> IRIX bug still there but someone should test this again!
  	  ( reports that it is still alive in 1.0.0)
  	  (seems to be fixed now. wk 2000-01-14)
Apparently it is not fixed after all.

Thanks, but I got the solution from another correspondent: avoid the
buggy assembler.  This configuration worked:
   ./configure  --prefix=/usr/people/jrv/gnu --disable-asm
I suggest you document the problem, and add an item to the TODO list:
configure should check for this assembler bug, and invoke
"--disable-asm" automatically.  Or, make "--disable-asm" the default
except for architectures where the assembly code is known to work.

Compile gpg without assembler optimized MPI code. There is a
   bug in the mips assembler code, but the generic c code works.
