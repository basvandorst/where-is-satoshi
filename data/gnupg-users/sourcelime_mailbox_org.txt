@_subject: Importing an off-card backup of the encryption key of a Nitrokey 
I generated keys on a Nitrokey and have chosen the option to make an off-card backup of the encryption key:
gpg: NOTE: backup of card key saved to as described in: Now I tried to use this backup key. So I imported the public keys, and when I try to import the secret key backup file, I get an error "no user ID" and the key isn't imported to the secret ring:
gpg2 --import sk_26D728A8F09033F1.gpg
gpg: key 26D728A8F09033F1: no user ID
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:       secret keys read: 1
I only found a hint so far that the key can be uploaded to another card with the bkuptocard command ( but I had hoped that it is possible to use the backup key without a card. Any hints here, is this possible?

I was wondering about that, because on of the reasons that convinced me to buy a Nitrokey was the "the key cannot leave the device" argument. So I wondered about the backup option, read up on it (because I am not very knowledgable of using GnuPG yet). I thought it makes sense to have a backup only of the encryption key and live with the risk of losing the signing / authorization key. Not sure what is worth how much, I was going with what the generate procedure suggested because it made sense to me intuitively and I assumed it represents time-proofed best practices.
Maybe that would have been better.
I stumbled on that option, but the "generate" command option looked way more simple:
than this procedure recommended on the Nitrokey documentation:
The whole "master and different sub-keys" seemed somewhat complicated to me. I learned that the devil is in the details, sometimes even in little things. Like: the public key is not on the Nitrokey. You need to backup it to use the Nitrokey on another machine. So I went for the path that looked a lot more well-travelled and just a lot more simple.
Or is there a simpler way to generate keys locally + upload them to the Nitrokey, backup the keyrings and remove the secret parts that I missed?
I was hoping for a simpler workaround to make GnuPG import the key.
I was happy to hear that importing such a key will be tracked as a feature request.
Until then, I'll either only use this for things I could afford to loose when I lose my Nitrokey. Or I'll take the time to generate new keys and re-crypt everything.

thanks, good to know I wasn't missing something obvious here.
An option for "--import" sounds great, that was what I was looking for intuitively, something that would allow me to specify the user id / the hash of the public key.
I am curious, from a user-perspective, couldn't GnuPG be trying to be very helpful with importing the secret key and "just do the right thing" and scan if there is a matching public key in the keyring?

Hi Peter,
I was hoping for something simple and I think eventually this should be simple; nevertheless I would make use of such a workaround / would be thankful for such an example :)
