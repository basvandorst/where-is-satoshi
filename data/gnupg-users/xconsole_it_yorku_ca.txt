I assume you're using a *nix type system. If so, the first time you type
gpg --gen-key a ~/.gnupg directory will be created (if it does not already
exist). All your keys will be stored in there.

Since man is really more of a UNIX thing, perhaps it would be better to
rename gpg.man in Windows to something with a .txt extension. It would
make it obvious to Windows users that this is a readable text file then.
