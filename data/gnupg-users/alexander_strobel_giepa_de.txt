Thanks for the hint to look at the web archives.
Strangely enough, even until today it does not show up in my inbox...
Therefore I thought it wasn't delivered to the list.
Thank you for clarifying :)

Thank you for the hint.
It was a problem with this single email only. All other emails showed up
in the past.

@_subject: Gpg 2.1.13 Import from keyserver ip not working 
I'm not sur eif this has been reported here recently, but I am not able
to import keys from ip addresses.
gpg --keyserver hkp://127.0.0.1 --search-key test
gpg: Kein Schl?sselserver bekannt (Option --keyserver verwenden)
gpg: Suche auf dem Schl?sselserver fehlgeschlagen: Kein Schl?sselserver
When I use the keyservers name (hkp://keys.example.com) everything works
Is this a known bug?
Best regards

Same here but with GPG 2.1.11 already.
Using Brainpool curve it works as expected.

@_subject: Create subkey with same passphrase 
I wanted to know if there is a way to create a new subkey without giving
it a new passphrase but using the same one as the primary key and the
first subkey.
AFAIK while creating the first subkey there is no passphrase question,
it simply uses the passphrase given for the primary key.
The use case behind my question is that I want to create a combined
RSA/ECC key in a batch like way without getting the ?Please enter your
passphrase/Please repeat your passphrase? twice (which means 4 dialogs
in total).
gpg --batch --gen-key
gpg --edit-key abcd1234 addkey

@_subject: Error searching key from keyserver in gpg 2.1.19 
I have installed GnuPG 2.1.19 on my Windows 8.1 (x64) machine. When I
search for a key on a keyserver it shows this error:
  gpg: error searching keyserver: Input/output error
  gpg: Suche auf dem Schl?sselserver fehlgeschlagen: Input/output error
My commandline:
  gpg --keyserver hkp://subset.pool.sks-keyservers.net --search-keys
When I do this with GnuPG 1.4.21 everything is ok.
What's the problem here?
Best regards

The problem was sitting before the monitor. GnuPG 2.1 was blocked by my
firewall. GnuPG returns the key from "subset.pool.sks-keyservers.net"
and "pool.sks-keyservers.net".
Thank you for your help!
