I have tried many suggestions on the internet and none worked.
I have finally generated the key pair on another system and then exported/imported the keys.
I hope that my experience may save some time and effort of other fellows.

??: Two questions about system entropy and update Good Morning ,
  I have been tried to generate a key pair and gotten the error :
  Not enough random bytes available.? Please do some other work to give
  the OS a chance to collect more entropy! (Need 300 more bytes)
  It seems that the error is very common by googling the internet . However, none of recommendations has worked and helped .   I am using Solaris 10 X86 system . I had generated the key pair without any problem before . Can some experts explain why I have suddenly had this problem ? Does it help if I remove the old key pair ?
  (I had tried to run the key generation while running iostat, mpstat and using find in other windows. Is there any way I may view the system entropy in Solaris system ?)
  My GPG is pretty old :
  gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.10; Copyright (C) 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
  How can I update GPG ? I have the file transfers with dozens of clients, which are essential for business . The update cannot affect the current public/private keys . Is it safe to upgrade on the current system or I have to build a new system ?
  Can the new version solve the problem with system entropy ?
  Thank you,
  Shaoping
