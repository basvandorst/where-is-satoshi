We are implementing PGP on Integration Server by using OpenPGP package from
webMethods. As required by OpenPGP package, we have installed/configured
GnuPG software in our DEV environment.
Environment details:
IS running on AIX 5.2
Integration Server 6.1
OpenPGP package version 1.1
GnuPG Version 1.5.8
The solution is implemented successfully in our DEV environment.
While migrating to QA environment, we ran into following-like error when
creating the PGP keys.
gpg: fatal: can't open /dev/urandom: There is a request to a device or
address that does not exist.
Our Unix team have verified the access to /dev/urandom device from user
that runs webMethods IS process. Alternatively, we have also failed to
create GPG keys when running as Unix root user.
We did think of using PGP keys from DEV environment to get around the
problem. However, the same error will occur when we use encrypt service
(pub.openpgp:encrypt) from OpenPGP package to encrypt the contents.
Looking forward for help.

Sorry about the typo, we are using GnuPG version 1.2.1, OpenPGP is a
package which runs on webMethods Integration platform.

I don't know what this is.
There is no official version with that release number.  From where did
you get it?

Its open to world in other word yes it has the correct permission. We also
try to create the keys using root userID but still getting same error.

Are you sure that you did not miss the end of the line?  It should
show the actual error message.
You should also update to the latest gpg version which is 1.2.6; there
are some fixes for AIX in it.
Are the permissions of /dev/urandom correct?
