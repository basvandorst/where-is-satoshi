@_subject: secret key cannot be imported: "no user ID" 
I was trying to migrate my gpg setup on box_a to box_b. I'm using gpg 1.0.6 on both boxes. When trying to import the secret key on box_b, it complains of "no user ID", even if I import my public key first. Am I doing something wrong? Things that don't seem to help:
-removing passphrase from secret key
-exporting from box_a with --no-comment
-specifying secret keyring with --secret-keyring=.gnupg/secring.gpg
-using the hex id rather than userid to specify which key to export
Here's a pseudo-transcript of my activities:
[jimbo ~]$ gpg -a --export-secret-keys jimbo > test.asc[jimbo ~]$ scp test.asc jimbo
[jimbo ~]$ ssh box_b
[jimbo ~]$ gpg --allow-secret-key-import --import test.asc

Ah! Interesting. That works... I can first copy the secret keyring over, then import the public keyring. But what the heck? I don't like that.
I shouldn't have to transfer a binary secret keyring from one machine to another, should I? What if I want to move to a diffent PGP program on another platform?
