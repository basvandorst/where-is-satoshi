The simpliest way I can think of is to use netcat with encryption (i've
seen mentions of such a version). If you can access network configuration,
you can establish an encrypted tunnell (I can think of some methods and used
vpnd and IPSec personally). You can also wrice a simple client-server with
encryption or tunnel existing application over ssl (stunnel).

RFC 2440, page 46:
6.4. Decoding Radix-64
   Any characters outside of the base64 alphabet are ignored in Radix-64
   data. Decoding software must ignore all line breaks or other
   characters not found in the table above.
   In Radix-64 data, characters other than those in the table, line
   breaks, and other white space probably indicate a transmission error,
   about which a warning message or even a message rejection might be
   appropriate under some circumstances.
   Because it is used only for padding at the end of the data, the
   occurrence of any "=3D" characters may be taken as evidence that the
   end of the data has been reached (without truncation in transit). No
   such assurance is possible, however, when the number of octets
   transmitted was a multiple of three and no "=3D" characters are
   present.
so, end-of-line-spaces are PEFECTLY legal.

Which is difficult to organize succesfully (have you actually TRIED to get *decent* amount of key signatures _again_an_again,_year_by_year_?). And
uncertified key leads to MITM.
Yours is insecure in more subtle way. In perfect world it would be secure.
But we live in imperfect world so they are about evenly insecure. How many
keys you have certified to the point of being trusted? Do you believe in
signatures made by non-fully trusted keys? With your method, this will be
yet more common to believe untrusted key, because it will be a lot harder to
get a key to trusted level.
Moreover you refer to 'consensus of expiring private keys'. Well, its the
first time I hear about such a consensus in the context of PGP keys. There
is no consensus that I'm aware of. No publicly avaliable PGP guides I know
of advise that. There is no such a consensus.
Sidenote: Crypto revolution and PGP in particular failed spectacularly to
catch in mainstream because public-key crypto is hard to learn and maintain.

Yes, and moreover you won't be able to decrypt anything encrypted with
corresponding public key. This applies to messages received both before and
after expiration date.
The signature will be good although there will be warning that 'Signing key
has expired on .' or similar.
Expire date means that signatures made with that key are not to be
considered valid after the expire date. But they still will be perfectly
good and verifiable signatures.
Do what? Reset the expiry date? You need key's secret key to do this.

It is okay. Your name is stored within the key as a proper unicode.
It is the other applications (keyserver web interface) that don't support

As long as you have proper charset in your .gnupg/options you should not
worry about it. You may also add accentless variotion of your name as a

I don't think so.
And I think you are wrong or haven't done proper threat analysis. Case 1:
someone impresonating Werner posts a message about a bug in GnuPG and a
patch to fix it. This patch actually plants a backdoor. In your approach,
you have no way to tell nor it makes any difference to you.
Case 2 (real life example): a friend of mine is an active usenetter, she
also posts a lot to mailing lists. One day a sexually suggestive (at the
verge of explicit) forged messaged attributed to her started to appear. PGP
signing was the simplest way to make a good distinction of which messages
come from her and which are forgeries.
In saying about 'strangers' you forgot one thing: while on everyday use of
PGP there is little need to use it to establish RL identity, it is a very
good and a convenietnt way of establishing origin. I don't care much if
Werner's name is actually Werner, but I do care if new GPG releases come
from its author.
A good example is remailer-operator list. Anon remailer operators need not
to know each other's identities (I'm one of the few who reveal their names)
but need to know if given remailer configuration changes come from the
remailer's operator (because of MITM).

OpenPGP for example allows such a situation: I am a Thawte WOT notary so I

It is a controversal subject if you should make expiration date for
general-use keys at all.=20
I personally think you should not set expiration date on your primary key.
The rationale behind it is having new key again and again makes it hard for
your peers to extablish trust in your key, thus it is partially disruptive
to Web of Trust (which is feeble already and need not more disruptions), and
could be a mayor annoyance for your peers. If you want to change your keys
often, generate subkeys for encryption and signing then make them expirable
in time. This also solves the problem of signing other people's keys - you =
this with your main key and not with a subkey, so the signature won't
The command for generating a subkey is 'addsub', and for resetting expirati=
time is 'expire'. You enter both from within gpg --edit-key .
It is also important to have a prepared revocation certificate generated and
stored in a safe place in case you lose your secret keys. Standalone
revocations are short, you could even consider printing them out in case of
disk crash.
Hope this helps.

It goes like this: a *default* OpenPGP _public_ key consists of two keys
- Primary public key (signing key for Digital Signature Algorithm/Standard)
- - one encrypting subkey/secondary public key (encryption key for a varian=
t of
    Diffie-Hellman/ElGamal algorithm).
This public subkey is bound to the primary key by signature made by a secret
key correpsonding with the primary (DSS) key.
You may add any number of subkeys which may be either signing subkeys or
encrypting keys.=20
Please note that the term 'signing [sub]key' when talking about public key =
a simplification/jargon. Those are actually public keys for _verification of
signatures_, not for making them.
You mix two things: every key in public key cryptography has two parts -
private (also called secret) and public. This applies to all keys. Thus
getting back to the example, the public key I described above has a secret
counterpart which consist of private DSA key (the real signing one) and a
private decryption subkey - a counterpart of the encryption public subkey.
The point is that the subkeys are a feature of the protocol, the theory of
crypto does not imply them.
The signing subkey you may enter into the picture also will have a public
part that goes into the 'OpenPGP public key' (as used by the application)
and a secret one that goes into secring.
Definitely yes. That's actually the point of the subkeys - you may revoke
them without losing all things associated with master key.
Yes and no. When you create a signing subkey, you shoud reexport ypur public
key and send it to your correspondents so they will know that the  key
0xDEADBEEF is your signing subkey, but this won't make you lose your
previous keys - you may use them all at will. Selection of key to use when
encrypting to you is done by the encrypting software based on supported
But remember, your primary key ID is the keyid of your primary signing key.
You choose this when encryptiong and the software does the rest.

@_subject: Best GnuPG tool for the non-technical windows user 
I'm interested in helping some non-technical people get up and running with
encryption; a good thing.  Is GPA + WinPT (as read in an older post) still the
best way to accomplish this?  Or should I get them using plugins (in this case
for either Mozilla Mail or Qualcomm's Eudora)?  I want to make this as simple
as possible for them.  Thanks for any pertinent information.

'Configure' didn't point out the need for zlib.h but examination of its output
indicates that it had noted its absence.
I already have zlib (as I already had the other dependencies albeit at earlier
versions except for libksba) but the ubuntu distribution seems to rename them
and install in the /lib/ branch rather than the /usr/local/ branch.
For example, I have the package zlib1g installed according to dpkg in
So I suppose I now have to find a source for zlib or find how to tell gnupg
where to find it ?

Even if the "verify" level seems to open the door once again to
unauthenticated DNS MX lookups (and possibly, MITM), the name
verification parameter smtp_tls_verify_cert_match keeps it locked.
But that's theoretical, as it is not considered to be appropriate for
systems that deliver mail to the Internet.
I have a spontaneous sympathy for the "fingerprint" level as it
suppresses (the need to rely on) any (CA) authorities :-)

I can not figure out what is the problem. Neiter I found anything in the

Maybe it is just that I'm doing something wrong.
Happy to provide more information if needed.

documentation (from the XSD) and XHTML docs (from the Docbook); in
case anyone finds a need for validating the XML files.  There isn't
currently a formal XML namespace setup for the schemas since it
doesn't appear that anyone's done anything with it (i.e. no one
noticed and thus no one asked for it).
Anyway, if they're of use, the schemas and docs are in one of my
branches on the git server, here:
I'd recommend using either the XSD or the RNG rather than the others.
They're generally going to be better or more accurate.  The RNC and
DTD are there because I figured I may as well generate them at the
same time.
