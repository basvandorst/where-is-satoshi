@_subject: GPG 1.4.9 false verification 
Hi Guys,
I'm new to GPG so I'm not sure if this is a problem or if it's by design but
it's possible to modify a clearsigned message/document and still have it
verify.  When I sign a document GPG adds the two header lines "-----BEGIN
PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----" and "Hash: SHA1" followed by a blank line.  I can
add any text I wish into the blank line without affecting the verification
of the signature.  Changing anything else breaks verification.
Is this behaviour by design?  Are GPG users supposed to be aware that this
line is untrusted?

I was testing this with the --verify switch only so I didn't see the final
output with the stripped headers.  Thanks for clearing this up.
Your point regarding my mail client was interesting though.  I use the web
interface of Gmail with the firegpg plugin.  I thought I'd look at this in a
bit more detail.  Sending the below message to me verifies as good through
Hash: SHA1
Hi, this is my modified line.
This is some tested verification text.

@_subject: Can't sign & encrypt from command line 
I'm running gpg 1.4.9 on Vista.  When working with files from the command
line I can encrypt or sign but I can't do both.  The results I get as are as
gpg -a -s -e file.txt
Encrypts the file only.  I cannot verify a signature on this file, I get the
following message.
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: verify signatures failed: unexpected data
gpg -a -e file.txt
Gives the same result as above
gpg -a -s file.txt
Signs the file and I can verify the signature.  Produces an armored output
file which looks encrypted but can be decrypted without a passphrase prompt
gpg file.txt
Is this something I'm doing wrong or is this a problem?

Guys, scratch this question.  It doesn't verify if I only run a verification
using the --verify command but it does verify it I decrypt the file.
