I just tried to set up an OpenPGP that I had lying around for a
while. However, none of the admin commands seem to work (`name',
`passwd', `lang', `sex', `url'). For example when using `gpg2
--debug-level=guru --card-edit': (gpg (GnuPG) 2.1.4, libgcrypt 1.6.3)
Do you have any pointers as to what could be wrong?
I get the same results after perfoming a `factory-reset' (which looks
like it succeeded, see below).
Please CC me, as I'm not subscribed to the list.
Thanks, Johann

I have an external card reader with a pin pad  (CHERRY ST-2000 USB),
so that is what I use. If I enter a wrong PIN the pin retry counter is
reduced, so I guess it's working?
Regarding the link to the reset code, I think `factory-reset` already
sends the exact same instructions to the card.
