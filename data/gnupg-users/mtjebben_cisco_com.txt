@_subject: Share group aliases between GnuPG and PGP? 
Is there a way to share group aliases between GnuPG and PGP?
Most of us in my department use GnuPG, and we've defined group aliases in our gpg.conf file, but there's a few hold-outs who still use PGP.  Is there a way to export our group alias definitions and import them into PGP so that we can all "stay-in-sync?"

@_subject: Enigmail having troubles with EOF? 
Hash: SHA1
Hello gnupg-users-
We are noticing problems where enigmail (v. *0.86.1.0*, but it could
be other versions too), in Thunderbird (v0.8, but it could be other
versions) (note that we match enigmail version to Thunderbird version
as instructed), sometimes will not decrypt an email.
But, if we happen to run PGP on the the window ("Current Window -
Decrypt and Verify"), it is decrypted and displayed okay.
Interestingly enough, if we start to reply to one of these emails in
Thunderbird, the reply window shows the text decrypted!
It seems to be some sort of EOF problem.
Has anyone else seen this problem and know how to eliminate it?
