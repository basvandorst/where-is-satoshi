@_subject: how to store the public keys in a db? 
Hi Chris,
as you want to use gnupg anyway to encrypt your mails, I don't think you
should care about storage of public keys in a database as you don't gain
anything from using a database to store the keys.
Actually gnupg uses its own database to store keys.  I don't know how
optimized that database is storing several thousands of keys, but I
don't think that it will result into a bottleneck before reaching
10^6-10^12 keys (I didn't prove this statement!).
Getting keys you don't have yet is quite easy using public keyservers
too.  GnuPG and any other pgp should come with a simple set of commands
to import from these public keyservers.
But in the end gnupg will always work with keys, that has been imported
into the keyring.  So if you still plan to keep keys in some database
you will have a redundant set of keys in the keyring unless you don't
cleanup the keyring regularly (which doesn't make much sense to me and
will likely be the most expensive operation you can do (this statement
a pure guess too!)).
But you can use gnupg anytime to export public keys and store these text
blobs in a database.  I just can't figure out any use for such

@_subject: How to share my private key with others? 
Hey Alex,
though its generally possible through a special command, I would have to check the manual first, that's not how gnupg or pgp in general is supposed to work. Actually your team members, of course should have Gpg4win or 4any other system, installed and have their own private keys, one for each member.
Then you share your public key with the team members and encrypt the file with your private key.
When you encrypt a file, you tell gnupg which recipient you want to encrypt this file for, means, for which public keys from your team members you want to encrypt the file for.
Everyone who has any the right private key, that belongs to any of these recipients public keys, that are in your public keyring, can then decrypt the file again.
This way you only share public keys, and never share private keys. Its a security breach actually to share private keys, but there are options to back-up your private keys, which again is a way to share it.
Just better use pgp like its designed for.
cheers, ingo

@_subject: pinentry-curses and dumb terminals 
this is just a first idea to change pinentry-curses for dumb terminals:
============ BEGIN
commit 0207ab455a36e6e49017e2a8e44b31a3200f5c14
Author: Ingo Krabbe     added \n for the dialog default sequence
    I use very plain dumb terminals from plan9 to connect to my servers and I still want to use gpg with pinentry to unlock my keys.
    This is just a first quick patch to (re) enable the Enter key to finish the dialog, as my terminal posts \n not \r for an enter key.
    Actually that is no terminal but a plain text connection over the network, which is much less interpreted and much simpler than using full tty emulations.
    Maybe I will replace the dialog with a plain no-echo dialog, when the terminal is "dumb"
diff --git a/pinentry/pinentry-curses.c b/pinentry/pinentry-curses.c
index 58da255..2f02780 100644
--- a/pinentry/pinentry-curses.c
+++ b/pinentry/pinentry-curses.c
 -888,7 +888,7  dialog_run (pinentry_t pinentry, const char *tty_name, const char *tty_type)

 	  break;
-	case '\r':
+	case '\r': case '\n':
 	  switch (diag.pos)
 	    {
 	    case DIALOG_POS_PIN:

That are ascii (therefore the asc) encoded public pgp keys and message signatures, with
which this message is signed, that anyone who has a trusted pgp key of the author can
check that he truly signed that message.
