@_subject: Decrypting file - Private key issue 
I'm trying to decrypt a file that I encrypted for myself. However gpg doesn't
seem to recognize the correct private key.
Here is the output of gpg --list-secret-keys
sec   2048R/69258CF8 2015-09-17
uid                  user ssb   2048R/EA31820A 2015-09-17
Here is the the output of   gpg -vd -o OUTPUTFILE  ENCRYPTED_FILE gpg: public key is 4A83B612
gpg: using subkey 4A83B612 instead of primary key 0BBBBDB3
gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit RSA key, ID 4A83B612, created 2018-02-19
      "user "
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

I'm trying to decrypt a file that I encrypted for myself.
I managed to have an output of gpg --list-secret-keys but I still can't
decrypt the file. Here is the output of gpg --output doc --decrypt doc.gpg:
    gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit RSA key, ID 4A83B612, created 2018-02-19
"user " gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
