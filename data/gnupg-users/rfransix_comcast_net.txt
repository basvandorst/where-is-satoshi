@_subject: help with libgcrypt 1.4.4 on aix 4.3.2.0 
I've followed the docs/help/install without any help.
1. the libgpg-error configured, compiled and installed okay on aix 4.3.2.0,
as did libassuan, tls, and other libraries
2. the libgcrypt configures with ./configure --disable-asm or CFLAGS="-g -O2
-mcpu=powerpc" ./configure
    yet, it will not make (using aix' make and gnu's gcc++/gcc)
3. the make always returns errors
4. i don't have or access to an ibm c compiler, so that's out
The goal is to compile gnupg.
Thanks a lot for you clues.

@_subject: make of libgcrypt on aix 4.3.2.0 failing 
Hi, ./configure --disable-asm runs to success, the make fails with mpi/asm errors. Any help? is this a known bug? Much appreciated.
