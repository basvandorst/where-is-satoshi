@_subject: libpam_poldi without entering pin  
Hash: SHA1
I am sucessfully using libpam_poldi with my OpenPGP Smartcard to
authenticate myself, but i still have a question, is there a way to
authenticate without entering the pin? I allready tried to set the
"Force signature pin" Option to no but this didnt work.

@_subject: OpenPGP Card in SIM Size. 
is it possible to cut the OpenPGP Card to the size of a SIM Card without
destroying it?
I am asking this because i want to use a Kobil KAAN SIM III Reader, its
a ccid compatible
USB Token which takes Cards in SIM size. I guess it should work ..?!
