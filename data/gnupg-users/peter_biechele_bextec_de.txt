@_subject: Error/Warning when decrypting messages with my own key ? 
Hello !
I have a problem using gnupg 1.0.4. I have created my own key pair and have given it to somebody else. He is encrypting a file using my public key (PGP >6.5). Then  I can decrypt this message using my own private key. This works fine, except that it always displays an error message A file encrypted by other Company with the pulbic key of Our Company, decrypted again using the private key of O'ur Company:
Sie benötigen ein Mantra, um den geheimen Schlüssel zu entsperren.
Benutzer: "Our Company"
1024-Bit ELG-E Schlüssel, ID E06A7F65, erzeugt 2000-09-04 (Hauptschlüssel-ID A199E467)
gpg: verschlüsselt mit ELG-E Schlüssel, ID A502F3A2
gpg: kein geheimer Schlüssel zur Entschlüsselung vorhanden
gpg: verschlüsselt mit 3072-Bit ELG-E Schlüssel, ID 1756B1C4, erzeugt       "Other Company"
gpg: kein geheimer Schlüssel zur Entschlüsselung vorhanden     What does it mean ???
It DOES decrypt the file, but still displays this warning/error ?? Is the encryption not correct or do we decrypt with wrong parameters or is it just a PGP/GnuPG warning ???
Thank you for any help !

@_subject: Problem encrypting with new key !! 
Hello !
I have created two secret keys using 1024 ElG/DSA as suggested by using Now I want to encrypt a file using one of the secret keys. To that end I gpg -r NameOfKey1 --encrypt filename
This works fine.
Then I try gpg -r NameOfKey2 --encrypt filename
This always gives the message:  gpg: Diese Verschlüsselungsmethode taugt nicht mehr viel; verwenden Sie eine stärker stan-dardisierte Methode! (translation: This Encryption Method ist not of great use any more ! Use a stronger standardized Method !
What does This mean ????????
Thank you very much for any help !

@_subject: PGP 6.5.3 on Windows and GnuPG 1.0.3 ?? 
Hello !
I know it is discussed probably a lot of times, but I can not find the right Mailings or HowTos. I am trying to use GNU PG 1.0.2/3 on Linux and on the other end of the communication line PGP 6.5.3 on Windows.
I have created my own secret key/public key on Gnu PG Linux and exported it to an ASCII File. This ASCII File was imported on the PGP 6.5.3 program and worked fine. Then the other side created a PGP 6.5.3 keypair and exported their key to ascii. I tried to import the PGP 6.5.3 public key to my keyring and it worked, except the name of the other side was missing on the Geheimnis GUI in the KeyRing display. But it was available in the gnupg commands. To test the installation, we encrypted a file using my GNU PG public key on PGP 6.5.3 running Windows. I tried to decrypt this file on my Linux GNU PG machine, but it did not work !!!
Does anybody have experience with exchanging encrypted files between PGP 6.5.3 and GNU PG 1.0.2/3 ???? We just want to communicate securely !! No export of secret keys necessary.
Thank you very much for your time and patience !
Best Regards
Peter Biechele

@_subject: Kmail 
Hash: SHA1
Hi !
I am using Kmail with GnuPG and it works great !
First of all, try to check if GnuPG and your keys are installed correctly by doing some tests on the command line. Then if thsi works try to use them with Kmail. As a test you could sncrypt a mail/file with your own poulbic key, so you can right after it go and decrypt it again: 1) gpg --encrypt -r "MyName" File.test
2) gpg --decrypt File.gpg > File2.test
After thios youz can compare File.test and File2.test. If they are equivalent GnuPG seems works and your private and pulbic keys are installed.  gpg --list-keys
If you see all the keys, you can go on and try kmail.
Hope this helps,
best regards

Hash: SHA1
Yes, that is a good idea, BUT
how do you automate encrypting attachments ???=20
We have to send a lot of Emails with encrypted attachments, and it is alw=
a hazzle to encrypt/decrypt attachments by hand and then attaching them t=
the Mail. (or using GPA)
Is there already a nice solution, integrated to KMail !???
(We have Kmail 1.3 from KDE 2.1.2)
