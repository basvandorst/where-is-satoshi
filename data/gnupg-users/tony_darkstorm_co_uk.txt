@_subject: Issue with GnuPG -> PGP, self signature, new key 
I create a new key yesterday using gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.9 (Ubuntu 9.10),
selecting all the defaults, without changing my preferences file
I exported the public key (ascii armored), no other options, and
mailed it to a contact.
They checked the key with PGP (sorry, don't know what version), and
got this output,
% pgpk -ll 'Tony Evans'

uid  Tony Evans sig      0x00000000 2010-03-24 (Unknown signator, can't be checked)
1 matching key found
The Unknown signator bit is the worrying part.  I've checked my key
with gpg and it believes it to be self-signed correctly.  Did I get
something wrong, should I have done something different on the export,
or is it just a compatibility issue with PGP (I know, hard to comment
without knowing exactly which version).
