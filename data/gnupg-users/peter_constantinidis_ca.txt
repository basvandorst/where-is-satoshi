@_subject: GnuPG has trouble decrypting multi-key messages? 
Using GnuPG 1.0.6 for Windows.
I made a key and gave it to my registrar for security purposes. Then I =
something at the registrar and they auto-emailed me back using a PGP =
encrypted message that they made using my GnuPG key.
It came back encrypted with 3 keys. My public key, and 2 of theirs, one =
a  ELG-E key, and the other was an RSA key. (I guess they were making =
of interoperability.)
I was not able to decrypt it at all. Eventually I twigged on that I =
to find an IDEA.dll for GnuPG before it would work. So I found it, and I
can decrypt and view the message now. Before it would just say invalid.=20
These are the headers it shows before the message now, with idea.dll
gpg: NOTE: cipher algorithm 1 not found in preferences
gpg: encrypted with ELG-E key, ID 18DB62EA
gpg: encrypted with RSA key, ID A1E12995
gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit ELG-E key, ID C482C81A, created 2002-02-12
      "Peter Constantinidis "
And these are the headers it shows after the message:
gpg: old style (PGP 2.x) signature
gpg: Signature made 02/11/02 20:48:04  using DSA key ID 1AD79751
gpg: Can't check signature: public key not found
My question is, if I receive a message from someone who encrypted it with
two formats of key, shouldn't GnuPG be smart enough to recognize that one
of the keys is an ELG-E key and thus doesn't require me to find and =
an IDEA.dll ? Or did I misunderstand something somewhere?

@_subject: How does Windows GnuPG generate random numbers on keygen? 
I was wondering this because back in '97 when I generated a PGP key using
the 'slow' method I had to move the mouse, tap keys, etc. to generate
entropy and then wait a while while it calculated a key.
In the options file it makes reference to unix random number generators =
doesn't mention how Windows operates..
Also keygen on GnuPG seems awfully fast.. granted I have an XP 1700 which
is a significant improvement from what I had in '97, but still shouldn't =
take longer than a few seconds to generate a 2048 key?

@_subject: Argh I forgot how to re-create the options file 
This is driving me nuts. I don't see anywhere in the docs how to make =
make a default options file if one is not present or empty in Windows.
I already have the correct paths listed in the registry.
I even tried a 1.05 ver and it doesn't make it either.

Thanks for answering guys but my question isn't answered yet.
I'm on w32 and the zips don't contain an option file and I can't figure =
how to generate one with all the defaults, etc. that somehow was done on
the first 1.06

Still no 'official' win32 release.
I propose June 30th as an excellent time to do so. Thus showcasing the
portability of the code that allows for rapid transfer to other operating

Are the third parties trustable?
Would Werner recommend and use their release? Would the German =
If not, why would you?
