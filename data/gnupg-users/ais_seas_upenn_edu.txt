Hi - I hope having 'subscribe' in the subject is sufficient to subscribe to
this group. (There were no such instructions on the main gnupg page). In
any case, please cc any responses to me.
I have been having some difficulties compiling gnupg 1.0.1 sources on
solaris. The compilation uses a binary "ar" which doesn't exist on my
system. I was wondering whether this has come up before.
Thanks in advance for any help.
