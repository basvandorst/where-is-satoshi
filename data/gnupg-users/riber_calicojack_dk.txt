I looked into the code (not a c programmer - so won't comment if below
behavior was intended or not) but managed to find some hints how to decrypt
messages  with --passphrase
For me it was necessary to add --pinentry-mode loopback for it to work.. It
now looks like this:
gpg2 --decrypt --armor --pinentry-mode loopback --batch --passphrase XXXXX
Maybe other could find this usefull as well.

Does it work if you simply use a key for which you have set an empty

Thank you very much for you input - much appreciated. Yes, it worked with
empty password. Then it is possible to decrypt passwords without
I would however prefer to have password - any suggestions to get this to
work with password?

I've tried to setup so I can decrypt without typing in my password - since
this is needed for unattended machines. However I can't seem to get it to
work. To ensure it had nothing to do with my keyfiles I started from a new
