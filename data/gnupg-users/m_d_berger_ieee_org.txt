On FC4, I execute this command:
  gpg -vv --recipient mdb00 --armour --cipher-algo blowfish --encrypt
and while it works, I get a warning that blowfish is not preferred.
So I ran:
   gpg --edit-key mdb00
   setpref S4
I confirm that I want to do this, and then it aska for my passphrase.
However, the gui (KDE) does not accept a response.  I modified my
passphease to something trivial to get the mouse out of the picture, but
it still did not work.
Note that a similar passphrase query when decrtpting the message works
with no problem.
What am I doing wrong?  In any case, if I could get the result by
editing gpg.conf I would prefer it.
By the way, I have extensive experience studying gpg:  1.5 days ;)
Thanks for your help.

--personal-cipher-preferences string
did not seem to work either in the config file (without --) or in a
command line.  It was "seen", however, since a misspelling resulted
in a diagnostic.
I ultimately was able to add blowfish to my preferences with:
   gpg --edit-key mdb00
      setpref BLOWFISH It is noteworthy that the 3DES cipher cannot be removed by this
procedure, while any other cypher can.  I wonder why this is.
Thanks for help and encouragement.

@_subject: pgp & outlook 
Now that I have gpg working on my linux box,
I was thinking of cutting-and-pasting or attaching
encrypted messages into outlook on my win2k box.
On the other hand, I see that there are outlook pgp
plugins.  Are these good to use?  Any suggestions
regarding which plugin to use?
Thanks for your advice.
