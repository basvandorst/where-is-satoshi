@_subject: do_plaintext() error on OpenVMS 
i am running gnupg 1.0.4 on an OpenVMS 7.1 server.  when i try to encrypt a
file using the following command
i get the following errors
i know that the first error is a bug in 1.0.4, but i can't find any info
regarding the do_plaintext() error.  it is being generated from code in
build-packet.c, but i can't figure out what is causing it.
thanks in advance for any insight you can give --
