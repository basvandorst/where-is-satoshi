After adding some keys recently, I always get:
gpg: public key 6E05F681 is 27717 seconds newer than the signature                                  gpg: public key 8D1C8442 is 86014 seconds newer than the signature                                  gpg: public key 8D1C8442 is 86010 seconds newer than the signature                                  gpg: public key 8D1C8442 is 86010 seconds newer than the signature                                  gpg: public key 4A90E7A1 is 30558 seconds newer than the signature                                  gpg: public key 3022C951 is 31305 seconds newer than the signature                                  gpg: public key 8F1B19A5 is 9972 seconds newer than the signature                                   gpg: public key 4A90E7A1 is 30494 seconds newer than the signature                                  gpg: mpi larger than indicated length (2 bytes)                                                     gpg: keyring_get_keyblock: read error: invalid packet                                               gpg: keyring_get_keyblock failed: invalid keyring                                                   gpg: failed to rebuild keyring cache: invalid keyring                                               gpg: 3 marginal(s) needed, 1 complete(s) needed, classic trust model                                gpg: mpi larger than indicated length (2 bytes)                                                     gpg: keyring_get_keyblock: read error: invalid packet                                               gpg: keydb_get_keyblock failed: invalid keyring                                                     gpg: validate_key_list failed                                                                       And the trustdb is not updated, because on the next run
I get the same error.
How can I fix this?
Or how can I find out which key it is, so I can remove it
(as workaround)?

@_subject: S/MIME questions: how to set default key? 
I'm trying to set up mutt with gpgsm for S/MIME.
The documentation was not easy to get together, but I'm now in a state
where I can read signed and even encrypted emails I already had.
Currently I'm stumped at signing new mails.
I always get "error signing data: Certificate expired?"
I do have two certificates, one that is expired and one that is not.

I guess the wrong one is chosen; so I tried setting in .muttrc:
set smime_default_key=0xID2
but this doesn't change anything, nor did
set smime_default_key=FI:NG:ER:PR:IN:T2
Does anyone here know how to fix this?

I don't understand what 'local-user' wants to signify as a parameter,
but I can confirm that adding
    local-user FI:NG:ER:PR:IN:T2:...
to my .gnupg/gpgsm.conf does indeed work.
Thank you very much!
