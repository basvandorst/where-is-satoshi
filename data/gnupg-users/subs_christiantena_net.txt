I have some questions about gpg
1.  using gpg command line, can I pass data to be encrypted to gpg that
isn't in a file?  For example if I want to encrypt "Mary had a little
lamb" to a an asc file but I don't want to put that text onto the hard
drive unencrypted first.
2.  is there something like gpgme that can be used easily for pascal
Personally I use freepascal and I just want to be able to select a key,
encrypt and decrypt from within my program.
If anyone knows of any opensource pascal programs that use gnupg it
would be appreciated.
thanks, Philip

I found that if I just type "gpg" I get this
"gpg: Go ahead and type your message ..." which looks promising but I
can't find any documentation on how to use it.
Also this works in linux
"echo Mary had a little lamb|gpg --yes -eat -o test.txt.gpg -r [keyid]"
but I don't know how to do something similar in dos/windows
thanks, Philip

I got it to work in Windows.
With a default install of gpg4win gpg is not in the path, but this command works
echo Mary had a little lamb|"c:\Program Files\GNU\GnuPG\gpg.exe" --yes -eat -o test.txt.gpg -r [keyid]
I'm thinking that it might be easier for a pascal programmer to interface with gpg on command line than to figure out how to compile against gpgme c code, even if it isn't probably the right way to do it.

So far I have figured out that on windows if I enter the command
gpg -eat -r [recipient key]
I get a prompt on the console
If I then type a message, followed by  control-Z then gpg will encrypt the message and dump the pgp text to the screen,
or to a file if I used the -o [filename] option.
However on linux control-Z just terminates the program (no pgp text)
Does anyone know the official, correct console way to get pgp to
terminate and output the encrypted text from console?
I'm amazed that it just doesn't seem to be documented anywhere.
thanks, Philip

I spent a little time coding in windows today (using lazarus).
I have come to the conclusion that you can pipe stuff to gpg from inside dos window, but that if you try to pipe stuff directly from the pascal program it fails.
I actually got my program to work by piping to cmd.exe with "echo Mary had a little lamb|gpg" inside the stream, which sort of proves that I know how to program a pipe.
Example code is at
you can look at this code by installing lazarus, unziping the above file into a folder, and then from lazarus do project/open project and point it at the lpi file in the folder
hit F9 to compile it
This feels a bit like a bug in gpg to me...

Hmm, that would spoil things.
reading this
the opinion there is that sending control-Z is just a signal from the keyboard to the shell which the shell uses to cut the flow to the application listening on stdin, it doesn't actually send control-z to the app.
in other words I need to flush and close the input side of the pipe, but not the output side or won't collect the program output.
I was hoping that tprocess.CloseInput might acheive that but it doesn't seem to cause gpg to stop listening for input.
Anyone got any ideas?
thanks, Philip

all the links from  are dead
for example
404 Not Found
The requested URL /howtos.en.html was not found on this server.
I tried to email the webmaster but the email is bouncing
I can't access  to see if
there's a better list to send to than this one either!
I'm hoping someone here can do something about it

I don't remember where or what linked to maybe it's related to this "bug"
I think it might be better if the content at
