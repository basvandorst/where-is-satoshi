And some will just write down the password on a sticky note stuck to
their monitor.  The more annoying you make password requirements, the
more likely this becomes.
Don't smartcards have a built in lockout policy that makes it impossible
to brute-force the password anyhow?  Given that, password complexity is
a moot point.

Are you on some sort of drugs?  I can not find anything that makes any
sense or has anything at all to do with the previous messages in this
thread you quoted.  I see nothing here but the ramblings of a nutter.
What the heck is all of this nonsense and what does it have to do with
this thread?

Each dev just uses their own key to sign a release?

Bingo!  And as long as the user is not interested in it, and won't learn
how to properly use it, all they will get is the veneer of privacy and
learn the hard way that they really aren't secure.  You just can't make
security idiot proof.
There was also mention of "legally binding digital signatures" in
practice.  So far, the ones I have seen are nothing more than a web site
that you log into with a username/password, click sign, and it adds a
nice forged signature to the pdf document with an attestation that the
server verified your identity at such and such a time.  That's not a
cryptographic signature in any way and only an idiot would consider it
"legally binding".  Yet that is exactly how I signed the contract to
purchase my house a little over two years ago.

How do you figure that?  If they aren't encrypting mail then how is it
private?  Or or is it using some other form of encryption ( s/mime )?
If that's the case then why don't you just use that yourself and skip
the centralized web site for holding your key?
Of course they do.  If they don't, then they utterly fail to maintain
your privacy.
iirc, it may poke you to import the key, but at least it tells you "hey!
I can't encrypt this without the key.  Unless you *really* don't want to
encrypt this?"  Silently sending the reply unencrypted is entirely unacceptable.
So you think it is easier to sign up for some dedicated private webmail
service that can only communicate securely with other people using that
service than to run proper e2e on a real mail client?  I suppose that's
a matter of opinion, but it certainly is less secure and conveinient.
And by conveinient I mean it is annoying to have both parties switch to
some silly web site instead of just following their normal and preferred
email routine.

Why the heck don't they just run gpg the way enigmail did?

True, since validating the signature means validating the secure hash of
the contents.  That is, the checkum is reisistant to accidental
corruption, but the secure hash is *also* resistant to intentional
manipulation.  The latter is a superset of the former.

What do you mean?  S/MIME authenticates the user's identity via the CA.

I'm confused.  I thought the whole efail thing was about crafting a
plain text message that says "Good signature verified" and fools the
user even though it was never run through pgp or had its signature
verified with s/mime.
AFAICS, that is for encryption+sign.  If you just want to sign, it
sounds like you are saying that is broken.  I don't see how.  You can't
modify the message and keep the hash unchanged, and you can't encrypt a
new hash because you don't have the sender's private key.
