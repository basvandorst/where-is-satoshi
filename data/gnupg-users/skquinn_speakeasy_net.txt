IMO, a likely reason that AOL wants to deprecate ICQ is because by=20

I think this can be worked around but a better solution is to not use=20
any AOL-owned IM service at all (especially in light of the fact that=20
AOL forces a proprietary mail client on all of its users and it does=20

Sounds pretty devious, but this will probably take up a noticable amount=20

They will if the signature is untrusted and it should not be. KMail=20

I know KMail at least does not let you encrypt attachments easily; they=20

The fingerprint is only the lowest-order 32 bits of one of the primes=20

That's something you'd have to ask them, but my theory is if they have=20

harder for an attacker to pass off a bogus key as valid.

I feel there does need to be some GUI version of GnuPG that is not just=20

our flavor of OpenPGP-compatible encryption.
They should not care about trust values or key management? Really? Why=20
not? You mean they should trust a key randomly placed on the net by=20
some schmuck? That defeats the security of the whole system, leaving=20
one wide open to things like man in the middle attacks!
No, it doesn't. It needs to be there so the users can tell the software=20
who they trust.
Maybe most don't, because the CAs are supposed to be people the average=20
user can trust. In fact, if one does not trust a particular CA it is=20
rather painful to configure the software not to trust it; this is what=20
I consider to be a design flaw in the SSL system. This is why one can=20
go to a particular CA and get a certificate for Microsoft Corp. and =20
sooner or later catch someone napping who actually gives one.
The trust model is completely different. OpenPGP is based on=20
user-defined trust, i.e., telling the software which keys you feel are=20
trustworthy. The users *should* have to care, because most of the=20
security provided by the system comes from the trust database.

A good way of shattering this perception would be to use a program like=20
dsniff or Ethereal as part of a controlled demonstration on a closed =20
network (i.e. disconnected from the Internet) specifically dedicated to=20
the purpose. Outside of a controlled demonstration, of course, you run=20
the risk of violating laws such as the ECPA (in the US).
To really hammer it home, it should be made clear that everything is=20
just peachy as long as you trust *every* person with the capability of=20
root/administrator access on the path between and including you, your=20
mail servers, your recipients' mail servers, and your recipient.=20
Finding out just how many people have root on e.g. AOL's or Earthlink's=20
mail servers will quickly show this group is much, much larger than=20
most people think, as in at least one order of magnitude larger.
In theory, anyone can install Linux or one of the BSD variants on a=20
laptop, plug two network cards into it, configure it as a bridge, and=20
put it in front of a gateway with tethereal or tcpdump running full=20
time capturing everything that goes through it to disk. It is very=20
difficult to detect the difference between a legitimate dumb switch and=20
a laptop with two network cards conveniently set up to run a sniffer=20
and log everything. Also note that a bridge does not need an IP=20
address, and most attackers would in fact not want it to have one.
(Do realize that actually doing this almost certainly violates policy at=20
any decent company and probably every single applicable law. I am=20
definitely not advocating anyone actually do what I described, far from=20
it, however I do want to make sure as many people as possible are aware=20
of the risk of sending unencrypted e-mail!)
This just seems too risky. Especially in the US, where we have laws like=20
the ECPA, this seems like a one-way ticket to prison (and bankruptcy if=20
a civil suit is filed as well). A controlled demonstration on a closed=20
network probably would not.
KMail seems easy enough. If only more programs were as user friendly.
Well, they do so at their own risk, and I do not think it would be that=20
infeasible to brute force anything up to about three-word Diceware=20
passphrases. If they realized just how insecure a one-word "passphrase"=20
was, I think more would warm up to the idea.
Unfortunate, but not a total show-stopper. AOL is the worst offender=20
here, they don't even allow you to bring your own software to read AOL=20
e-mail. (You could always go get an account from HotPOP for $10/year=20
and a POP-capable e-mail program, but many will see it as not worth the=20
I disagree. If I send you my key, all you have to do is copy and paste=20
into a running 'gpg --import'. If you have the right options in=20
gpg.conf, you might even get a version of the key sans things like=20
photographic user IDs automatically. This is the one thing I dislike=20
about KMail; it does not let you import keys easily.
I agree somewhat that the console mode interface to GnuPG does suck.=20
Even I would like to see some form of native GUI interface(s) at some=20
point, and I have become accustomed to doing many things via CLI.
Not sure just how workable this really is in practice. You'll have a lot=20
of useless keys before too long. We already have keys created with very=20
old versions of PGP that are still floating around on the keyservers. I=20
know at least two or three of the keys with my name on them (mostly=20
ones with FidoNet addresses) are completely useless, yet they live on.=20
Designing a system to generate bloat like that on purpose strikes me as=20
bordering on insane.
This is still incredibly dangerous. At one time, I did not use=20
passphrases myself (in the pre-Diceware era). I can't believe I was=20
that naive at that time, even today, and thankfully did not use=20
PGP/GnuPG for anything very important at that time.
Contrary to the usual saying, the passphrase requirement sacred cow=20
makes absolutely terrible hamburgers, and personally I flatly refuse to=20
trust a system that actively discourages or even prohibits users from=20
