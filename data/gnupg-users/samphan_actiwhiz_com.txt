@_subject: Win32 gpg --gen-key never finish 
I try using Win32 Gnu GPG 1.4.0 and 1.4.1 to do 'gpg --gen-key'
using the default setting. The generation process rarely ever finish.
Most of the time the generation process run and never finish.

DSA keypair will have 1024 bits.

What keysize do you want? (2048)
Requested keysize is 2048 bits
Please specify how long the key should be valid.

You need a user ID to identify your key; the software constructs the user ID
from the Real Name, Comment and Email Address in this form:
     "Heinrich Heine (Der Dichter) "
Real name: Samphan Raruenrom
Email address: samphan
You selected this USER-ID:
     "Samphan Raruenrom "
Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? o
You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.
We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.
The output stop here and never continue. I tried using the disk, keyboard, mouse.
I can't make gpg to finish generating keys.
I happen to have cygwin and cygwin version of gpg works.
Are there anything wrong with the Win32 version of GPG? or my setting?
