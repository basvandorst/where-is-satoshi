@_subject: getting keys from keyserver whithout knowing the ID 
I'm sorry if this is an often asked and maybe stupid question, but I didn't
find an answer in any documentation.
My problem is, if I want to fetch a public key from the keysevers I have to
know the keyID. But what if don't know it? One thing is, maybe I want to
send an e-mail to someone I hadn't have any contact before. I only know the
e-mail adress. So I would search the keyservers for a key for that adress. I
certainly wouldn't know the ID already.
The same if I don't even know if the person I want to write to uses
PGP/GnuPG. I could find out by searching the keyservers.
And third, imagine I would know the keyID. I think it is much more easy to
enter the e-mail adress (which is more human-readable) than the ID.
So how can I get a key without knowing the ID? Or how can I find out the ID
using GnuPG? I'd think that this is a problem many new users have, isn't it?
It would be great if you can help me.
And again, sorry if that question is really silly.

thanks for your tips. It seems that I have to use a browser to search for
keys that way.
Is there a reason why a command like 'pgpk -a email_address' isn't available
in GnuPG, or is it just absent because no one complaint about that?
