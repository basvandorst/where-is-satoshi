@_subject: signing mail to a mailing list 
Content-Disposition: inline
A number of mailing list managers will change parts of the MIME headers
in the message which breaks PGP/MIME signatures.  If a cleartext
signature survives unscathed that may be the problem.

@_subject: what is the use of signing keys? 
Is there anything technical preventing the signature key from being used
for encryption other than stuff like option flags?

@_subject: discussion on increasing amount of gpg signatures... 
Indeed.  A lot of people will just sign all IDs on a key so even if
there is some e-mail verification other identitites will get signed too.
This frequently seems to include signing revoked identities - it might
be nice if GPG would complain when asked to sign something with a self
revocation certificate.

It would be nice if these could be presented more clearly.  I can't
actually suggest a clearer way off-hand, mind you.  Also, it would be
nice if there were no space between the "sig" and the digit as in
current output.

@_subject: Revoked keys on keyservers 
[Reformatted to 80 columns]
It is useful to advertise the revocation certificates indefinately so
that people who obtain the key without the revocation certificates can
update the key from the server and discover that it has been revoked.
No.  Unless you have the revocation certificates or the private keys to
generate them you're stuck.

@_subject: GnuPG and PGP 2.6: unusable public key 
The warning says that you are encrypting to this key but you don't
have sufficient information (in GPG) to determine if it is owned by who
it claims to be.  Depending on how much you care about nobody but the
intended recipient reading the mail this may be a problem.

Did you sign their public key?  The trust you specified is how much you
trust that key to make good signatures while that in the second field of
the --with-colons output shows the degree to which GPG believes that
that the key concerned is valid.

@_subject: Mutt/GnuPG doc initial release 
What does it do if it doesn't have (and can't obtain) the key?  With
mutt if signature verification fails for some reason (such as a missing
key) all that happens is that an error message is displayed along with
the verification attempt.  If you don't have the key then gpg can be
configured to either just fail or try to get the key from the

@_subject: Revocation questions 
You can generate a revocation certificate for just the user ID and
upload that.  There's no need to revoke the entire key.

@_subject: Several questions as feedback on gnupg 
If you think about it you don't want to delete the UID anyway - removing
it from the keyservers does nothing to invalidate copies in people's
keyrings.  Uploading a revocation certificate for the UID does that and
distributing it.
When validating the user ID you should validate the whole of the user
ID, including the e-mail address portion.  Methods like showing that encrypted mail to the e-mail address in the UID can be read could be

Note that the GPL has a specific exception in it for libraries like
kernel32.dll that are shipped as part of the operating system.

@_subject: Card readers supported by GPG's internal drivers 
Current systems with udev should use somewhere obviously named in /dev
by default, with libusb preferring them.  It's those that get their
permissions changed.  There are unresolvable races with using /proc.

Many mail clients will assume that any GPG message is encrypted and
prompt for a passphrase prior to invoking GPG.
