@_subject: Slightly OT - mobile OpenPGP usage 
Well, not GnuPG but I thought more about other OpenPGP apps, because
the OpenPGP protocol besides S/MIME is still widely used.
Here is an idea ... I recently read about Prof. Kaminsky's Enigma2000
which is a JavaScrpit encryption app running on an offline Raspberry Pi
with a touchscreen.
If someone would write a JavaScript OpenPGP app which works like
one could attach an USB stick to store an amored message, unplug and set
the write protect switch and insert the USB stick to a public computer.
would have a secure OpenPGP messaging device, not requiring an expensive
smartphone nor a laptop to carry around.
It could be done as a kickstarter project (Raspi+Touchscreen as one
device + JavaScript code.
Well, just a thought and hopefully a talented coder and hardware
tinkerer could make this happen.

No, seems not to be nonsense, as understood.
2.4 ICC
The maximum size of an ICC profile is limited to 256 * (63535 - 16) =
16,261,888 bytes. This is quite a large profile!
I wonder what kind of data would require such a max size.

@_subject: Info for GnuPG users which have a keybase account 
Hi all,
slightly OT, but since some of you are on keybase  I would
like to inform you about a current promo from Stellar Network
running on keybase.
I received yesterday my free Lumens, currently worth $21.29 USD :-)

@_subject: Protecting your private key - passphrase 
I said that my program does *not* store any *keys* and the *required*
parameters (which can be set manually and individually, in order
to use the same passphrase again) ...

@_subject: Message Padding for GnuPG 
Thank you for pointing that out, but I don't understand then when I do
enter my passphrase for symmetric decryption of how GnuPG does this, or
are you referring to asymmetric encryption?

Stupid me, just checked by switching on and off my computer ...

@_subject: GnuPG 'Lottery' - 'fun' with 256 bit keys 
P.S. according to Bitcoin specs the 256bit HEX values needs to
be in a proper range.
And another idea, to expand the GnuPG 'Lottery'. How about this:
Some cool GnuPG hackers write a program which checks publicity
available SKS key server dumps for signature packets  the
once that are only 256bit long, then saves those values in a
text file, convert these values to Bitcoin key pairs and then
uses a balance checker program, to see if a key has a balance
(in the future)?
Well, just a thought. At least it would give publicity available
key server dumps an additional research value.

@_subject: Show that an encrypted message was signed, without decrypting it 
Thank you very much for your detailed reply, much appreciated!
P.S. already replied yesterday off-list and had deleted the message,
hence my short reply here.
Best regards
