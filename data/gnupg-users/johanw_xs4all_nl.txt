Yes. Of course, you can remove it locally.
Then you might have a problem.
Not really.
The only thing that comes close is the keyserver at (I believe) pgp.com,
who issues a new signature every few months clogging your key with
expired signatures.

That can be done much easier: upload a version without the email address
to the keyservers, and store locally a version with your (current)
email. Then don't sync that with the keyservers of course.

Isn't it much easier to use the key ID / signature for that? You already
have that.

Use the keyID / signature as the hashed user ID, since it (should)
uniquely identify the key. Since a hash is one way you can't derive the
email address from it anyway, from the keyID you also can't (directly)
deduce the email address.

I didn't claim that one version was better than another version, I said
it will probably never become widespread. Just like Linux on the desktop
is only a small niche player, and windows phone on the smartphone
market. Wether I like that or not and which system is best doesn't
change anything.
