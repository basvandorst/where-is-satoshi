I was wondering if anyone knows what the reason for this message is when
decrypting messages:
encrypted message has been manipulated
My friend encrypted the message with his own key so there should be no
When he decrypts the message in a normal shell there is no problem but when he
decrypts it "transparently" in vim this message shows up...
When I do this there is no problem at all and I had him use the same settings
as me so I am unsure why this "message manipulation" is occurring...
------------- gpg.conf----------------------
If anyone can help that would be great...=)
