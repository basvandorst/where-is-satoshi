@_subject: gpg and ximian 1.2.2 for redhat9 
I recently installed Red Hat 9 which comes with the Ximian evelution
mail client. I like the interface, however I'm having trouble decrypting
messages. Are there any special tricks I need to know to get it to work?
Has anyone else experienced a similar problem?
As a side note: If I use the kmail client I CAN decrypt the message so I
know the keys are good.
