@_subject: Possible content for gnupg.conf file... 
I suppose this is a rookie question, but what would be
appropriate content for the configuration/options file?
I've looked about but can't seem to find any suggestions
out on the web about a likely default file. This is what I
have in place:
display-charset ISO-8859-1
keyserver random.sks.keyserver.penguin.de
keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve include-subkeys
load-extension c:\windows\system\idea.dll
default-cert-level 3
Is this workable? Any suggestions for additions, deletions,
or improvements would be greatly appreciated.
