@_subject: gnupg for a multiuser system 
Dear Webmaster,
I read a lot of manuals how to install GNU on a windows 2000 computer,
because I wanted to know, if it's possible to install GnuPG on a single computer
with multible users. Unfortunatelly I found no information for this topic. Now, I thought, maybe
you can help me with my little problem. Or maybe you know someone, who had a
problem like this before.
Thanks in advance,
Markus Franke
