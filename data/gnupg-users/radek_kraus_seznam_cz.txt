@_subject: Encrypt file for multiple recipients 
I have got a problem with encrypting a file for multiple recipients (I =
want to write a script for automatically encryption).
I used gpg in this format
gpg  -r alice -r bob
Are there some options for it? I cannot find it. Please help me.

PS: I used SUSE 8.0, gpg 1.0.6
