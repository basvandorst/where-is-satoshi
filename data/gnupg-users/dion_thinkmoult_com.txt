@_subject: Finding key ID of a keypair 
I've got myself a DSA keypair, just two files - one being the public key and the other being the private. I'm trying to find out the ID of that keypair. However this keypair doesn't show up when I do gpg --list-keys. It's passphraseless, it's DSA, and that's pretty much all I know. I made it quite a long time ago, perhaps through ssh-keygen. Is there perhaps a way to add it to the --list-keys list or find out the keypair ID through an alternative method?

Unfortunately it didn't seem to do anything:
localhost ~/.ssh # gpg myfile.key
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: processing message failed: Unknown system error
localhost ~/.ssh # gpg myfile.pub
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: processing message failed: Unknown system error
Where myfile.key is the file containing the private key and myfile.pub is the file containing the public key.

I would recommend putting it below the document root of the webserver for added security - you really don't want crawlers easily discovering it.
