Hi list.
Was this assumption correct?
Ah. I've probably found this one out myself.
The embedded back-signatures are inside the un-hashed area.
What was the reason for this? Simply because it's not necessary as the
back-signature secures itself?
Same as above,... were these assumptions correct?

On really last addition on this (promised :-) ):
I tried to mix up keys with new and old packet header types.
Is it desired that gnupg simply converts them back to old packet
headers (if possible) without any notice to the user?
What will keyservers do when someone uploads a key with e.g. old
packet headers,... that's already there, but just with new packet

Hi folks.
I'm currently reading RFC4880 and I think I have many minor questions... is
the gnupg-users list the right place to ask? Or is there any better place?
Anyway,... I think I start right now and ask my first question,.. (think
it's easier to handle if I ask only one or two questions per mail-thread).
Hopefully you can help me and hopefully I'm not to annoying ;-)
1) In chapter 3.7.2.1 on page 13 it says that the octet can have values "255
or 254". Is there any difference between the two?
2) I've digged a little bit into the bit layout of gpg created keys (with hd
and pgpdump), and it seems that gpg creates packets with old packed format
(bit 6 in the packet header cleard) whenever possible.
What's the reason for this? I mean the RFC recommends to use the new packet
format. Can I change that default behaviour? And if I have a key, that's
already used and signed by others, could I convert it to using the new
Thanks in advance,

Hi David.
I'll have a look at this, but as at least some of my questions seem to
be gnupg specific I'll continue to ask some stuff here.
Ah, thanks. So I'd should be 254 for better security of the private key, right?
Uhm, I just wanted to follow the recommendation of the RFC ;-)
So all other signatures would still be valid?
But there is probably no function in gnupg to do this conversion, is it?

@_subject: Series of minor questions about OpenPGP 1 
Ah,.. interesting,.. thanks for that pointer.
Ah,.. ok so to support older applications. Good decision.
Uhm what happens if one of these older implementations sees a packet
type above 15? Do they give a warning? Or is there something similar
to the critical bit?
Thanks for that info,.. but you're right and it's probably better to
stay with the compatible-mode.

Hi again.
This is about signature types and how gnupg uses them.
I've looked through the signature types in chapter 5.2.1
1) The 0x02 standalone signature: What is its intended use (by the
standard) and is it ever used by gnupg?
I mean it's clear to me that it signs just it's own subpackets, but
how could this be ever used?
2) The 0x1F direct key signature: Is it ever used by gpg? I mean it
would perfectly fit for all subpacket types that apply directly to the
key, e.g. key expiration time (9), revocation key (12) or key flags
But gpg always puts these kind of information in the 0x13 signature.
3) Last but not least, the 0x50 3rd party signature. I must admit that
I absolutely don't understand its usage. Do you have an example? And
is this used by gpg?
Once again,.. thanks in advance.

@_date: 2009-01-27 00:15:10
@_author: Peter Thomas 
@_subject: Series of minor questions about OpenPGP 1 
Yes, that was clear
My intention (and also behind the question whether there is something
like the critical bit for packet types) is this:
Suppose a new packet type (above 15) is added which is VERY critical
for the security, meaning that it would be very very bad if some
implementation isn't able to interpret it.
Is it secured that those applications will blow up, give errors etc.?
If not (and that was my motivation behind the general usage of new
packet headers) it would be better if no packet type (even those below
16) are understood by these legacy applications and thus the whole
key/message would be unusable for them.
See what I mean?

Hi David.
btw: Thanks for your excellent answers. Great to have one of the RFC
authors here :-)
Ah,.. I see.
What a pity :-(
Ok,.. I'll come back to this later when I ask some stuff about
signature subpackets.
Would gnupg understand these subpackets in a 0x1F signature?
Ah,.. now I understand :-) So it's somehow comparable to the timestamp
signatures, isn't it?

@_date: 2009-01-27 13:15:46
@_author: Peter Thomas 
@_subject: Series of minor questions about OpenPGP 1 
Although you've convinced me that using old packet types where
possible is preferable, I still tried to get this working (just for a
better understanding of gpg's sources).
I didn't found what I've needed in those two functions, though.
I used the following patch:
--- gnupg-1.4.9/g10/build-packet.c	2007-10-23 09:50:33.000000000 +0200
+++ foo/g10/build-packet.c	2009-01-27 13:00:57.569232835 +0100
 -86,10 +86,7        default: break;
       }
-    if( new_ctb || pkttype > 15 ) /* new format */
 	ctb = 0xc0 | (pkttype & 0x3f);
-    else
-	ctb = 0x80 | ((pkttype & 15)<<2);
     switch( pkttype )
       {
       case PKT_ATTRIBUTE:
 -1261,9 +1258,6  static int
 write_new_header( IOBUF out, int ctb, u32 len, int hdrlen )
 {
-    if( hdrlen )
-	log_bug("can't cope with hdrlen yet\n");
     if( iobuf_put(out, ctb ) )
 	return -1;
     if( !len ) {
Does this seem ok? Or what did you meant, that I should change? Not
sure why I had to remove that log_bug call.
But when I create a new key,.. pgpdump lists new packet headers.
When I do e.g. passwd (in --edit-key) the secret key is rewritten with
new paket types, and if I do e.g. adduid, the public key is rewritten.
The trustpackets however continue to use the old style headers. *weird* ;-)
I've seen that you have some switches like force-v4-certs in gpg.
Would you be interested in a patch that adds

@_subject: Series of minor questions about OpenPGP 3 
Hi again.
Ok this is a first bunch of questions on signatures (again both
specific for gnupg but perhaps also common for OpenPGP).
Would be glad if someone could help me with answering these (David?! xD).
1) For the 0x11 signature the RFC says "...has not done any
verification of the claim that ..." which as far as I understand means
"The signer simply signed the key without checking the keyholders
Does gpg include this signature type in its trust-calculations or is
it simply ignored (no matter whether I directly signed another key
with a 0x11 or whether its "in the middle" of a trust-path between me
and someone else?
And if so, is this generally claimed by the RFC? I mean will every
implementation behave like this (ignoring 0x11s) when it follows the
2) Why are the 0x19 signatures only used as embedded signatures? I
mean wouldn't it be the same to simply add them as another "top level"
signature packet?
3) I've understood why we need a "backsignature" (the 0x19) for
signature subkeys, but why don't we need one for encryption subkeys?
4) I've looked at the different revocation signature types. It seems
that it's not possible to revoke 0x00, 0x01, 0x02, 0x40 and 0x50
signature types?
Is this desired? I mean I understand that these signature types can
also be applied to casual data (and not just keys) but one could think
of "revocation servers" like keyservers that could be asked whether
some signature is still considered to be valid.
5) I've looked at the layout of v4 signatures, which lead me to two questions:
a) What does gnupg put in this unhashed area. I mean which subpacket
types (at maximum).
b) This two octet field containing the left 16 bits of the signed
hash, doesn't this allow some kind of DoS attack? In the sense that
someone that captures and modifies the OpenPGP message can change
these two octets and an implementation that looks at these would
immediately say "invalid signature"?

@_date: 2009-01-27 16:27:33
@_author: Peter Thomas 
@_subject: Series of minor questions about OpenPGP 4 
This time it's all about signature subpackets:
Sorry that this got longer, but I think these points are all somehow
connected. So feel free to split up as you like :-)
I know that these questions are more about OpenPGP itself than gnupg,
but perhaps you, David, can have a look at them here, before I post it
on their mailing list (don't want to look stupid there ^^ and I'm
still quite new in OpenPGP's standard).
1) gnupg (and as far as I can see other implementations, too) don't
set the critical bit on much signature subpackets by default. The RFC
(AFAIK) doesn't demand any subpacket to be understood by applications.
Unknown subpackets should be ignored, except the critical bit is set.
Correct so far?
Now when I go through the currently defined signature subpackets, I
see several which are or at least could be critical for security and
for the correct evaluation of signatures:
2, 3: a signature might not be valid yet, or might be expired already
7: an attacker might manage to revoke an irrevocable signature
9: they key is expired and the owner does not want it to be used any
longer (maybe also due to security reasons)
12: if an implementation doesn't understand this, it might not notice,
that a key/UID is already revoked
26: the policy may contain critical information for security (e.g.
"this key signs any applicant without validating his personal data)
27: it might be a security issue, if a key that was marked for
certification-only (0x01) has signed some casual data
31: required for revocation signatures and thus possibly security critical
32: required for the signing subkey backsigs (0x19)
I'd even consider the following as critical:
28: the signer might want to express that a specific role/UID made the
signature, and this might be security critical depending on the policy
Of course no one can force the user to actually read and follow these
subpackets (the policy (26) is the best example for this ^^), but
wouldn't it make sense that the RFC _REQUIRES_ these subpackets to be
understood by conforming implementations?
Just an idea, though :-)
2) Selfsignatures and possible ambiguities:
In an email before David told me that it's fully ok that some
signature subpackets are on 0x13 and/or 0x1F self signatures. I said
I'll come back to this; here it is.
The RFC is very clear (5.2.3.3) about which signature types may be
self-signatures, namely 0x10-0x13, 0x1F and 0x18 (I assume 0x19 is let
out, as it's made by the subkey, right?).
This chapter also says that an implementation should interpret it as
narrowly as possible.
a) That's by the way the first "problem" which _could_ lead to
secrutiy issues, as the standard doesn't define for every case what
"as narrowly as possible" mean. Of course everyone could say "just
follow the common human sense" but this is always problematic, isn't
it? ;-)
b) What for example, if a 0x13 and a 0x1F have conflicting key
expiration times? Should an implementation use the time in the most
recent of the two? Should it use the information from the 0x1F, as key
expiration time is "clearly" related to the key, and not the the User
ID? Should it just use the smallest value of the two? Should it use
the value accordingly by which the key was found (if by Key ID -> use
0x1F, if by User ID -> use 0x13).
One can easily think of similar examples for other subpacket types,
and its easy to think of examples where this could lead to security
problems (Imagine a user resets the expiration time of his key to
denote that it should not longer be used. His implementation updates
only the 0x13 self-signature but not the "unlimited" in the 0x1F, made
by some other implementation. A third implementation may now choose
the "right one" or not.)
c) It's nowhere clearly specified if and what meaning these supackets
have on the subkey binding self-signature (0x18)
A solution would be, that the RFC clearly specifies which subpackets
MAY go to which self-signature, which one takes priority, and for
which the implementation is allowed to choose itself (e.g. according
to the way the key was found).
btw: The example on page 27 "If the key is located via Key ID => use
the subpacket from the primary User ID self-signature also shows the
conflict with 0x1F signatures that could arise in that case.
3) This is probably clear for everybody, but the part on revocation
signatures should perhaps highlight, that all subpackets in revoked
signatures MUST NOT be used, e.g. imagine the key expiration time is
only stored in an 0x1F and not in any 0x10-0x13. If that 0x1F gets
revoked, the key has no longer an expiration time.
btw: Is it specified what happens when possibly security critical
subpackets like the expiration time or key usage are absent?
4) In chapter 5.2.3.3 it is explicitly allowed that the key expiration
time is reset by a user (of course this cannot be prevented as the key
expiration time is no longer part of the key itself). Isn't this
possibility comparable to revoke a revocation?
I mean the creators states: "This key SHOULD NOT be used after ." for example because he thinks an RSA786 key SHOULD no
longer be used in 10 years. An attacker might simply revoke this
(implicit) revocation by issuing a new self-signature with an updated
5) Chapter 5.2.3.3. also says what should happen when multiple
self-signatures are encountered by an implementation.
Wouldn't it be more secure to require that ONLY the most recent self
signature of a given type (per primary key in the case of 0x1F, per
User ID in the case of 0x10-0x13 and per subkey in the case of 0x18)
may be used and if that one could not be parsed (e.g. because of
unknown subpackets with the critical bit set) no self-signature MUST
be considered as valid?
My idea is about this:
Imagine a very old self-signature that still uses MD5 (which is now
broken, isn't it?) and a newer (in the sense of it's signature
creation time) self-signature which uses say SHA512. Both
self-signatures specify a designated revoker (subpacket 12).
Now an implementation doesn't understand SHA512 signatures and thus
uses the older one with MD5 (as far as I understand the RFC allows to
do so). But than one is probably a forged one by an attacker which
doesn't contain the subpacket 12.
See what I mean? I think it's quite easy to create similar examples
with other subpackets involved.
So a solution would be that the RFC requires, that always and only the
most recent self-signature is used.
Ok,.. enough for now,.. but I fear that I'm still not finished :-(
Is it possible to donate a few bugs to gnupg in order to compensate
the time you spend for answering my questions?

@_date: 2009-01-27 22:44:37
@_author: Peter Thomas 
@_subject: Series of minor questions about OpenPGP 3 
Ok,.. so this means basically that I, as an end user, must expect that
some (stupid) implementation may take my 0x11 and fully trusts it,
And the "descriptions" from chapter 5.2.1 on page 20 are just
"informal" and not strictly normative, right?
(If so, then perhaps this should be added as a kind of "rationale" in
a future revision of the RFC.)
btw: As you're one of the RFC authors: If the meaning of the 0x10-0x13
will ever be specified more normatively and strictly it should be
noted, that the 0x10-0x12 (especially the 0x11) may no longer make
sense to be used as self-signature (which seems to be allowed right
now) :-)
Ok,.. that's not a question but: I'm very sad about this. Would like
to see that people have their policies and give 0x10-0x13 according to
their personal policy :-)
That's what I wanted to know xD
Lol I'm so stupid! It's so obvious...
Perhaps this can be suggested in a future version of the RFC? Not that
I'd need it, but I think it's not the worst idea, and we also have
already some other stuff (like signature types) that are probably
The first one, Issuer (16), is it only kind of a hint? I mean the
signing key follows from that hashed/and encrypted data and not from
the Issuer subpacket right?
If so why does it exist? To speed up validation?
And which one did you mean with the second?
Yeah, that's clear,.. so all an attacker could do is some kind of
denial of service or better said, denial of validation,.. but he could
do this in any case.
Yeah,.. you are right,... it's actually obvious but sometimes one
doesn't see those things when writing about.
Ok so I assume the Issuer (16) subpacket is a hint that tells which
public key should be used for verification, and the 16 bits are the 16
leftmost bits.
So to speed up things, an implementation uses the public key from the
Issuer subpacket for calculations, makes a first check after the 16
bits of the signature hash, and only if these are equal, checks the
remaining ones.
Is this correct?
Thanks again so far :-)

@_author: Peter Thomas 
@_subject: Series of minor questions about OpenPGP 5 
Now this is surely gnupg specific again ;-)
Ok let me see...
1) When creating keys or other data which needs random numbers, how is
this done in gnupg? I mean does it per default use /dev/random? Or
does it have its own means like a modified Mersenne Twister or
I wonder because I'd to test the used source with this
 so is there perhaps some function in gpg
to just generate a bunch of random data as it would be used for key
generation (both symmetric and asymmetric).
2) It seems that the following is an old issue coming again and again
over this list. gpg per default does not create keys larger than 4096
bits (talking about RSA), but it can use keys (and
signatures/encrypted data created by such keys) larger than that,
right? Is there any actual limit (apart from computation power and
life time)?
I fully agree that it makes sense to set this limit, as keys larger
than 4096 bits are not that much usable and its questionable if one
gets that much security by using a say 65563 bits key.
However I wanted to do some compatibility tests with gnupg and other
implementations (PGP, BPG and perhaps some others).
It seems that it's quite easy to disable this limit in the gnupg
source, all I have to do is set max=something in keygen.c, correct?
Is there any knowledge about specific weaknesses of such large keys? I
mean there might be strange effects with the PNRGs that don't happen
until some large keysizes, but would effectively render these super
large keys completely unsecure.

Hi David.
One more thing on this:
I had already wrote in another message that I'm trying to do some
interoperability tests (with large keysizes for example).
I'd also like to play with these signature types (0x1F, 0x13 and even
0x18 !) a little bit especially the with the subpackets:
preferred symmetric/hash/compression algorithms, policy URI and key flags
(I think it would even make semantic sense to put them on 0x18s).
Anyway to do this I need to generate those signatures (of course) and
I'd like to use the wonderful code of gnupg :-)
Could you perhaps point me to the useful function names where I can
modify these signatures (0x1F,0x13,0x18) and the functions that are
used to inject subpackages?
Was a great help when you pointed me to the write_header()/etc
functions before :-)
