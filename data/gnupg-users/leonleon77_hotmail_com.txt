@_subject: supported ciphers...  in CBC mode? 
Hi all, my
"gpg --version"
lists various algos (e.g. AES, 3DES, etc.) as being supported... is there a way to determine if such algos are used in CBC mode by gpg (or is it a default behaviour?)...
for example, documentation for other software such as cryptographic device drivers (cgd) in NetBSD explicitly states that aes algo is supported as aes-cbc mode... is there a similar kind of information available for gnupg?
