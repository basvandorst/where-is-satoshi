@_subject: Decrypting file encrypted for multiple recipients using a given ID? 
Hash: SHA1
Dear all,
I have a file encrypted to two different User ID's, both for which I
have the public keys as well as the secret key. When I try to decrypt
the file, it always prompts me for the passphrase of user A, while I'd
like to decrypt it using the passphraseless key of user B.
I've tried various combinations of -u with and without exclamation mark,
but without success. How can I specify that the key of user B should be
Thanks in advance,

Or do you? People will submit their keys to the keyring up front but won't be at the party as their dog got sick, their boss didn't approve of them taking a day off after all, etc.
Furthermore, perhaps you don't feel comfortable signing the key of someone because you have no idea what a valid Nigerian passport looks like, etc.

The party I was at last weekend (and the first one I ever attended) [1] had all the keys with the signatures on a textfile and requested participants to compute hashes for that document up front and write that down on the print of that file. At the start of the party the hashes were read out aloud so we all knew we were working from the same list of keys.
Then everyone present announced their listed fingerprint was correct for their key.
After that, we checked ID's and verified each others keys.

For what it's worth... using gpg on my linux box with the mutt mail client also complains about bad signatures on Benjamin's emails.

True to some extent. But when you are on dialup or pay by the byte wireless, it does make a difference when you are quickly checking your mail and your mailserver / ISP has good spam filtering in place.
Still, the reason the original poster sent a mail to this list is to solicit help. The HTML mail shows up as hardly readible on some mail clients. While you might argue that that's a problem for the receiver and not the sender, it does reduce the chances of getting a helpful reply from someone who'd know the answer but can't be bothered to decypher the unreadable HTML junk that arrived in their mailbox. The sender in that case is the only person suffering from their HTML-only mail.

Hi Aaron,
For me, the following does the trick:
When viewing the message enter P
It will prompt you for a password, just hit enter.
These two steps made the message readable for me in mutt.

And as a further side note... the GPG-signature failed to validate, most likely due to the legalise bla-bla signature being inserted in the message. I suppose that disabling that signature might be out of the original senders control, but since they used a gmail account, perhaps they should post through gmail instead of using whatever server that inserts the legal disclaimer.

Hi Ben,
I exchanged a few emails off list with the OP as well, and that led us to conclude that most likely the original mail also included a HTML-part (scrubbed off by the mailing list?) which caused the signature to fail. The legal mumbo jumbo disclaimer was added by the MUA and not the MTA, so I imagine enigmail properly signed the footer and my original assumption that the MTA was to blame was incorrect.

Hi Martin,
While I fully agree on bottom posting being preferred, I wonder if it's not a lost battle already. People quoting 'properly' are in such a minority that I don't think this can be changed around anymore. Of course, some fora will still be the exception to this, but I fear they will become less and less in number. Most of the guides on proper netiquette date from the previous century too and people don't seem interested anymore in doing things properly.

To me it does some. Knowing that we know that you are really Jean-David Beyer and that it probably is not a made up name, makes it far more likely that you'll consider your words before posting them online and that it is also less likely that you'd be trolling just for the fun of it.
Please note that I am in any way suggesting you'd be trolling otherwise, but a properly signed post for which a trust path from my key to yours exists does make a difference to me. A small one perhaps and you might not find it worth signing your posts for my convenience / peace of mind, but if you do sign it, I do appreciate it :-)

This is way too little information for anyone to help you.
What are you trying, what package of gnupg (download URL?) are you trying to install. On what OS is this? How are you attempting to run the installer? What exact error message do you get (thus not your own interpretation of it)?

Or filter on the List-Id header perhaps. That one is always set when you receive mail from the mail list.
Seems easier to set such a filter than to expect the world to be trained into sending email in your preferred way.
(Also, apply such a filter then before any spam blocking on empty To: lines etc.)

Hi Davi,
What is your intended goal? Is it to compile (this specific version) of gnupg from source, or just to use gnupg?
If the latter, as root doing:
apt-get install gnupg
should download and install a working gnupg version on your computer.

I appreciate signed mails on this list (and any other lists). Most problems these days on the internet are, in my opinion, related to people being completely anonymous. If you stand behind your words, show so by signing your posts.

...your signature is not. Just writing that you've signed something
does not make it so (from a gnupg perspective).

Hi Stefan,
I feel (speaking only for myself), that this subject has ventured off far enough
to no longer be on topic for this list, if it ever was to begin with. While it
might make for interesting reading, other forums might be more suitable for it,
or even a postal only remailing club or something, I don't know.
