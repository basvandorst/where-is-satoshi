@_subject: error decrypting 5GB rar file 
I have encrypted a huge (5GB+) winrar file using GnuPG v1.2.3, on WinXP
SP1 (NTFS), which resulted in a gpg file of 5.372.648.141 bytes.
Now, however, I cannot decrypt it anymore:
gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit ELG-E key, ID E907AED2, created 2003-11-30
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=7e)
gpg: [don't know]: old style partial length for invalid packet type
gpg: WARNING: encrypted message has been manipulated!
gpg: packet(1) with unknown version 97
gpg: fatal: zlib inflate problem: invalid stored block lengths
secmem usage: 1408/3936 bytes in 2/8 blocks of pool 4896/32768
and the output file is a 1.075.771.576 byte truncated rar file (it's
possible to extract some but not all files)
What strikes me is that the error occurs round about filesize minus 4GB.
Is there a filesize limit on GnuPG? I have truncated the gpg file to
both 4GB-1 and 2GB-1, and it still fails in exactly the same way, so it would seem the error occured (silently) during encryption.
Is there any way to retrieve the original?
