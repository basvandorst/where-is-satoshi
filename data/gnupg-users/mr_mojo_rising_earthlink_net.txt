I'm running GPA 0.7.0 and it doesn't seem to respect my globally-defined http_proxy setting. gpg utilizes it fine and the proxy responds, so I know http_proxy is set and valid.
Is there any way to get GPA to use an http proxy?

Thanks, but I already had that in gpg.conf and that's why gpg correctly uses http_proxy as I stated. The problem is that GPA doesn't seem to be using that setting. When I try to send a key to a keyserver with GPA it says it's unable to connect to the keyserver -- even though I've set it to use the same keyserver I successfully used with plain gpg.
Here's the relevant line in my gpg.conf:
keyserver-options honor-http-proxy broken-http-proxy
Any more ideas?

I still can't get GPA to submit a key to a keyserver using the proxy specified by my http_proxy setting. I'm starting to think perhaps http_proxy is being respected by GPA after all, and instead it's the DNS lookup for the keyserver that's causing the failure.
Does GPA perform its own DNS lookup on the URL of the keyserver before it attempts to send the key via gpg? That could be a problem because the particular keyserver URL I'm specifying needs to be DNS resolved via the proxy (SOCKS 4A/5), otherwise the lookup will fail. gpg itself handles the DNS lookup correctly using my proxy.
Is there a way to make GPA defer to gpg for DNS lookup?
