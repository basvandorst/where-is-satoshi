Obnoxious also.
"gpg --batch --keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve" does the job, or
clicking on a button within Thunderbird. If some people don't know how
to fetch a public key from a signature, it's better not to trust
encryption with them.
Concerning key servers, unless in very specific cases, I think keys
should be on big and commonly used keyservers which synchronize among
themselves. Otherwise new signatures, IDs, and revocations will not
get propagated when people refresh their keyring.

I am used to being a minority. :)
Set an expiration date to your key one year from now. Every 6 months,
postpone this expiration date to 6 more months. It's too late for
these people, but in the future and same conditions, others won't have
a false security feeling when writing to you: if they keep using the
wrong tkey, they will get a warning.

I wonder if it's possible to bring real security to people without
them understanding the complicated things that happen behind the user
interface. I think not.
However, I agree with you Parcimonie should be widerly spread.

I know several people for whom you can find public keys on keyservers
with no expiration date, who have lost the private key. Long time ago,
just testing PGP, disk crash with no backup... Sometimes they still
using the same e-mail address.
Maybe softwares creating keys should impose expiration dates, unless
in export modes. Maybe softwares using keys should automatically
postpone expiration dates and re-export the keys... But computers
can't do everything. People have to learn and understand some basics,
and practice.

I find quite funny reading from people advocating for ToFU while not
even signing their e-mails.
Come on, ToFU is very interesting from an intellectual point of view,
but has almost no practical use: almost nobody sends signed e-mails.
People don't here on this very particular ML, where do you expect
finding some?

@_subject: signatures from revoked key, trusted? 
A friend sends me signed messages wich signature is said correct by
GnuPG: "good signature from...".
I have just noticed I had signed his key with my old key, which is now
revoked in my keyring. So why does GnuPG consider the signature
correct? I would expect that, since I have revoked my old key, all
certifications done with this key should not be trusted anymore.

Well, these are not defaults, hence unlikely to be defined by people
who never refresh their keys. And the second looks dangerous to me
with the growing use of TOFU.

============================== START ==============================
A good practice is to define close expiration dates for keys and
subkeys, and regularly postpone them (or renew subkeys), which is only
possible with the "master" offline key and not with the possibly
compromised subkeys. This forces those people who never refresh keys
to do it, or complain, or for most of them abandon PGP because they
get painful warnings and this stupid thing does not work.
Furthermore, if you start sending messages signed with a new subkey,
people who have not refreshed your key will get error messages,
hopefully refresh the key (or complain or abandon PGP), and get both
the revocation certificates and the new subkeys. Without even having
to understand what happens.
Definitely, having different keys for signing and certifying looks OK to me.
I prefer having an easy to type (and weak) passphrase, and rely on
full disk encryption with a big, big passphrase I only type once in a
while. Am I wrong?
Strange tuto... Using a laptop, caring about security (which is
deduced from the use of PGP), and not considering having the storage
memory encrypted.
