@_subject: GPG signing so sloooooow 
Hello folks!
I have problems with gnupg 0.9.7 running on Solaris 2.6
key generation and signing is extremly slow (signing: 10-30 sec). I
would await much better performance on SUN E250.
What is the problem?
I suppose that the random number generation would cause such a delay.
I'm not using egd. How do I confgure gnupg to use egd?
