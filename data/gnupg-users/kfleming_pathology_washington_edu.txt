@_subject: No certificates with undefined trust found. 
I have a very interesting problem.  I have received a public key from my
co-worker and have signed it as a trusted, but yet I still get the
following message:
However, when I run "gpg --edit-key elizabeth" it says that trust level
is "f/f".  Also, Elizabeth's key has two UIDs associated with it and when I use the
secondary UID I don't get the trust error shown above, only when I use the
primary UID.  If anyone has any ideas what's going on, I would be greatly appreciative.  I have recently installed gpg and have been impressed so
far so I hope this problem is just something I'm doing wrong.
