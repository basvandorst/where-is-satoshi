as recently posted I get an errormessage if i want to encrypt any File/Text.
I tried it twice:
1. I tried to encrypt a file.
2. I tried to encrypt a mail.
Both ended with the errormessage "Malformed User ID".
I chose another email-address of mine, so i had the public key.

I did as Atom Smasher told me,
but it's still the same error Message ("malformed user id").
I also tried to create a new key and crypt with it, but the same message I don't know what else to describe.

I tried to encrypt it, but it just created a file named Crypt.txt.asc
, but then the same error message occured ("Malformed user id").
It's clear to me how it works, but it doesn't as i want. I always get
this errormessage.
Please help, don't know what to do now
