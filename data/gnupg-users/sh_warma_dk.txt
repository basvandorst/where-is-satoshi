@_subject: Getting a key from a keyserver.. 
A'ight, I need to get something straight..
When I want to send an e-mail to someone for the first time, how do I
get his public key? The obvious answer would be: Get it from a
keyserver. Well then.. How? As far as I can see, to get a key from a
keyserver, I need the recipients key ID. How do I get my hands on that
one? When I go to keyserver.net, I can search for an e-mail address. Why
can't I do that from the gnupg commandline? What do you guys do? Is it
really necessary to send a regular e-mail to the person in quesion,
asking for his public key? If so, is the keyserver only good for
checking for additional signatures on a persons key?
Enlighten me, please!

I'm running Evolution on Debian Sid. It says that the above mentioned
e-mail has a bad signature. Is anyone else experiencing this on any
ohter mail-clients?=20

@_subject: Key expiration 
I've set an expiration date on my key.. When the time comes, where I'll
have to generate a new key, what then?
Which commands will I use?
How will everybody know?
How do I make sure I don't break any trust-relationsships that I've
What will happen to other people's keys that I've signed?
These may seem like stupid questions, but I'm still very new to this.
It's my third day as a gnupg-user..

@_subject: Key editor 
When I'm in the key-editor (gpg --edit-key ) and do a 'list' i
get this:
pub  1024D/E8BDA4E3  created: 2002-02-22 expires: never      trust: f/u
sub  4096g/7EDF358D  created: 2002-02-22 expires: never    =20
(1)  Soren Hansen (2)  Soren Hansen (Work e-mail) (3). Soren Hansen (Secondary e-mail) What does the dot after "(3)" mean?
When I run 'gpg --fingerprint' my secondary e-mail shows up first even
though it's the one, that I added lastly:
pub  1024D/E8BDA4E3 2002-02-22 Soren Hansen (Secondary e-mail)
     Key fingerprint =3D 196A 89ED 78F3 9047 2A36  F327 A278 DF5E E8BD
uid                            Soren Hansen uid                            Soren Hansen (Work e-mail)
sub  4096g/7EDF358D 2002-02-22
Does it matter in any way whatsoever? If so, how do I change it back to
Another thing: I've generated a new key (because I had a ridiculously
low lifespan on the previous key).
Naturally, I'd like to keep the old one to be able to read e-mail
encrypted with the according public key.
But I do not wish to use the old key for signing or encryption anymore..
I've done this:
1. I generated a revocation certificate, and imported it.
2. I sent the revoked key to a keyserver.
3. I used gpg --edit-key to disable the key. When I try gpg --edit-key
on the old key it tells me that it's disabled, so all is good.
4. When I run 'gpg --sign' it still asks for the passphrase for my old
key. Why?
