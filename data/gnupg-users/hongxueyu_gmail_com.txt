@_subject: error: mpi too large,help me please! 
I am trying to signature and then verify some executable file through gpg,
bsign and digsig. Firstly, i start the following commands in order:
1.       gpg ?Cgen-key
2.       gpg ?Cexports >> my_pubkey.key
3.       bsign ?Cs ps_test; bsign ?CV ps_test
4.       digsig.init start my_pubkey.key
5.       ./ps_test
Here, the program ps_test is killed, and error information shows that
"Signature verification failed because of: -1 for ps_test", also "mpi too
large" is showed too.
I have no idea about this. Could you tell me how i can do?
thank you!
