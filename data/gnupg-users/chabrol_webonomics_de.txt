@_subject: Conventional Encryption interoperability 
if I encrypt messages with CAST5 (GnuPG 1.0.2) I can't decrypt it with
either PGP2.6.3i or 6.5.1i. Under 2.6.3 I get an empty file and no password
is asked. Under 2.6.3i I have to enter the correct passwort but nothing
happens. Is PGP not able to decrypt CAST5 or 3DES? I try to find a method
which is interoperable between PGP & GPG with conventional encryption. I
tought only the patented IDEA is a Problem.
Thanks for your help,
