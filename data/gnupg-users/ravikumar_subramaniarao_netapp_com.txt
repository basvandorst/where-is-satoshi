Daniel Kahn Gillmor,
Thank you for your Feedback.
Sorry, it was not the intention to advertise the Phrase or using a Famous Passphrase. I wanted to show after giving the Passphrase it was hanging. So I showed that in the Screen Shot. We wanted the Resolution for this.
Yes we access the System Remotely and we tried to install the Pinentry. But it gave the error .
Further I would like to give the output below when I ran ./configure
It said,"
Perhaps you should add the directory containing `QtCore.pc' to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
No package 'QtCore' found
configure: creating ./config.status

        Pinentry v0.8.4 has been configured as follows:
        Revision:  f610ea6  (62992)
        Platform:  sparc-sun-solaris2.10

        W32 Pinentry .....: no
        Fallback to Curses: yes
        Default Pinentry .: pinentry-gtk-2
I tried to find the File QtCore.pc
ngztruapp02-dev# find / -name QtCore.pc -print
find: cycle detected for /apps/dtrusaas/.snapshot/hourly.2014-10-31_0803/home/infauser/informatica9.1/source/ODBC6.1/help/userguide/wwhdata/common/

Please help us to resolve the issue.

I'm sorry, but i don't know enough about Solaris to make sense of the information you've provided.
Perhaps someone else on the mailing list will be able to help you better.
        --dkg
PS I agree with Samir Nassar on both points:
 a) if this is a system accessed remotely without a graphical UI, you really only want the curses interface for pinentry
 b) you should not publish your passphrase to a public mailing list.
(you also shouldn't use a "famous phrase" as a passphrase, since it's more easily guessable) -- I hope you'll choose a different passphrase.

Thank for your Input.  Please help me where I will get the tar File for Qt pinentry, so that I can install it. If QT Pinetry is not required, when I try to set up the Passphrase
I get this error
gpg-agent[7931]: can't connect to the PIN entry module: IPC connect call failed
gpg-agent[7931]: command get_passphrase failed: No pinentry
gpg: problem with the agent: No pinentry
gpg: Key generation canceled.

You weren't entering a passhprase there. If it were asking for a passphrase, it wouldn't show your typing. Instead, your input was most likely simply not processed and echoed on the terminal. Try this and see what I mean:
$ sleep 10
Just type anything interesting in the 10 seconds the program sleeps $ Just type anything interesting in the 10 seconds the program sleeps
That last line will be the new prompt with what you just typed echoed /again/, as it is now processing your input and using it as the command line.
Are you sure there is an error? I interpreted it as that the Qt pinentry was simply not built, but the others, and the wanted curses pinentry was. Were there any binaries generated by the build?
See? If it's not going to build the Qt version, why would it need any Qt headers?
I use the GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG) in combination with Enigmail.
You can send me encrypted mail if you want some privacy.

Thank you fir your Help. Yes we are using putty only. Not any Graphical. But it complains that
You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.
gpg-agent[7931]: can't connect to the PIN entry module: IPC connect call failed
gpg-agent[7931]: command get_passphrase failed: No pinentry
gpg: problem with the agent: No pinentry
gpg: Key generation canceled.
 We do not know why it gives this error when QTPinentry is not required.

It might be worth to check whether there is an interest in running gpg on the server via Putty and have Putty forward the communication of gpg to a gpg-agent+pinentry running on Windows.
I can't understand why anyone wants to use a Windows box to admin Unix servers, but the success of Putty shows that we Unix folks will soon be minority.

Hello GNUPG Users,
Help needed to setup Passphrase with GNUPG 2.0.26.
We have installed the following.
(a)     libgpg-error-1.11
(b)     libgcrypt-1.4.0
(c)     libassuan-2.1.2
(d)     libksba-1.3.1
(e)     pth-2.0.7
(f)     GNUPG 2.0.26.
Then (1) % echo $PATH
        (2) echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
After  that we are invoking the Command "gpg2 --gen-key-The Screen Shot is pasted below: The issue is, after entering the Passphrase it stays there forever.

Daniel Kahn Gillmor,
Thank you for your reply. Yes after sending the Mail to you, I installed the Pinentry v0.8.4. But it gives the error " No package 'QtCore' found. We are using Sun Solaris 10.
P.S: The Emphasis is, once you have reached Excellence, do not stop. I was just created the Passphrase with the Famous Phrase ?Excellence is not an Adjective but a Verb?, so that I can remember it..

your screenshot suggests that you're doing all of this on some remote machine via ssh (it looks like you're using putty on windows).  You haven't mentioned what operating system you're using, though.
Anyway, gpg might want to use pinentry to gather the passphrase from the user, and it's not clear that you have the right environment set up for pinentry.
whatever package manager you have, can you install pinentry-curses and try again?
        --dkg
