@_subject: GnuPG skips the passphrase when creating a keypair 
Hi, I'm using MacGPG2 version 2.0.14RC2 with MacOS X 10.6.4 - Snow Leopard as the OS.
When trying to generate a keypair, MacGPG skips the step to input the paraphrase and continues to create the key.
me$ gpg --gen-key
Please select what kind of key you want?
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
*entered name, comment & email
Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? o
You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.    You don't want a passphrase - this is probably a *bad* idea!
I will do it anyway.  You can change your passphrase at any time,
using this program with the option "--edit-key".
i've tried to edit the key using --edit-key passwd parameter, but i get an error :
me$ gpg --edit-key "me"
Command> passwd
This key is not protected.
Enter the new passphrase for this secret key.
gpg: problem with the agent: Not supported
I don't now if anybody else is experiencing this problem or not, if so has this been resolved?
