@_subject: signing header required? 
I looked through the FAQ and a few of the archives, but haven't seen anything about this. Forgive me if it's a common question. When signing a message, is the header at the beginning of the message required? If you aren't sure what I am referring to, here it is:
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
I understand that the signature at the bottom is required, but I don't understand why the header is needed. On the off chance that it is not required, is there a built-in option to turn it off?
thanks for any help-
