Now the NIST has selected the Rijndael algorithm as a successor for DES
I've created a smal patch for gpg. (Just for fun)
I've used the 'official' Optimised ANSI C v2.4 implementation of
Rijndael and Joan Daemen. See for details:
          gzip -dc gnupg-1.0.3.tar.gz tar xf -
  gzip -dc gnupg-1.0.3.aes.patch.tar.gz | tar xf -
  cd gnupg-1.0.3
  rm cipher/Makefile.in
  automake ./cipher/Makefile
  ./configure
  make
If all went OK you should see something like:
  gpg --version
        gpg (GnuPG) 1.0.3

@_subject: FYI: AES patch 
Preferences should be determined by:
- Algorithm security
- Patent restrictions
- Encription & decription speed
But I agree with Werner:
It's likely the NSA have already found a backdoor in the
algorithm, this is probably why the NIST has selected it ;).
Hash: SHA1
Actually, there are "AES" prefs, no?
