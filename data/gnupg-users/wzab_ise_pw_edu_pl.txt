@_subject: Encrypting for multiple recipients eith GnuPG 
Hi All,
I'd like to encrypt a data file for multiple recipients, using the GPG.
It should be possible, just encrypt the file with a symmetric key, and then attach multiple copies of that key (with some random data added), each copy encrypted with public key of the other recipient (the random data should vary to make attack more difficult).
However are there any options in GnuPG to automate that process?
Meybe such a functionality should be added to the GnuPG?
