@_subject: how do I uninstall GPGMail? 
Mac OS X 10.3.9
Mail 1.3.11
I installed GnuPG Mac OS X 1.4.1
I installed GPGMail
I played with these for a while and all worked well.  I haven't used encryption for months because, except for my wife, no one else was using it.  My wife was only using it because I made her help me try it Today I went into Mail and into a folder for my doctor which contains 5 messages.  When I click on 3 of the messages, a yellow banner appears that says "Unable to decrypt message."  When I click on Show Details, it says, "There was a problem decrypting this message. Please check that you have a valid certificate installed in your keychain."  These messages are not encrypted, they've never been encrypted.  I figure the only way to get to read these messages again is to uninstall GPGMail and possibly GnuPG.
How do I uninstall this software?
Many Thanks,
