@_subject: binary for IRIX? 
Hi there,
I'm on a SGI IRIX web server but I don't have the privileges to
compile C code on this machine. Even though I was able to "smuggle"
a gcc on this machine, i didn't succed to compile gpg. "sh ./configure"
leads to the error message "configure: error: installation or configuration
problem: C compiler cannot create executables."
Could anyone send me a compiled version of pgp for IRIX by mail to
mailto:karl Thanks.
  Platform:
    osname=irix, osvers=6.5, archname=IP27-irix
    uname='irix64 nexus 6.4 02121744 ip27 '
