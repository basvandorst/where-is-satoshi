@_subject: multiple keys vs multiple identities 
If I have multiple not related e-mail accounts, is it better to create
one key pair with multiple identities or a separate key pair for every
Is it good idea to create 4096 bit keys when creating new key pair? I
read through archives on this mailing list, and it seems there is no
real disadvantages of doing so.

Thank you for all your replies. It seems that multiple separate keys is
the way to go for me. Is it socially acceptable to ask someone to sign
several keys, for example during key signing event? Is this a common

I did some quick tests on Nokia N900 (600 MHz ARM CPU), with gnupg
1.4.6, here is what I got:
Encrypting and signing, 2048 bit RSA keys:
real    0m 2.50s
user	0m 0.50s
sys	0m 0.02s
Decrypting and verifying, 2048 bit RSA keys:
real	0m 1.74s
user	0m 0.41s
sys	0m 0.04s
Encrypting and signing, 4096 bit RSA keys:
real    0m 3.58s
user	0m 1.92s
sys	0m 0.06s
Decrypting and veryfying, 4096 bit RSA keys:
real	0m 3.80s
user	0m 1.89s
sys	0m 0.03s
Is one second considered a rule of thumb limit? That would mean that
4096 keys are not suitable for widespread use yet.

2048 bit keys are suitable - it's "user+sys" what matters in this case,
but not "real" by all means, as that includes waiting for passphrase
input too.
