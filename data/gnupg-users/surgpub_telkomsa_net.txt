Big problem for me :
paul gpg bigfile.pgp
gpg: fatal: zlib inflate problem: invalid block type
secmem usage: 1920/3872 bytes
I've seen this problem mentioned several times on the lists but never seen a working solution. I have 28GB of data sitting in GPG encrypted archives (4GB each). I can't some of the archives and I can't get hold of the original data I'm running gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.1 with zlib 1.2.3 on a Kubuntu Breezy system.
The system that encrypted the data was running gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.1 with zlib 1.2.2 on Debian Sarge.
My questions are :
1. Was the bug on the encrypting side or decrypting side?
2. Is there any way to recover the data I have sitting in the archives or did gpg/zlib screw up my data good and proper? Must I kiss the data goodbye?
One slightly pissed off first time user who would like to get his data back.

Decryption works like a charm now!
Thank you so much for that tip - I really didn't think that redirection would be the cure.
