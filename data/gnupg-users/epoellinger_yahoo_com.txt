@_subject: Renewing expiring key - done correctly? 
Hello all
This is my first experience with renewing GPG keys - I did some research but wanted to confirm an observation.
This is the key before issuing the 'expire' command:
pub ?2048R/4A4DBDC7 ?created: 2012-01-13 ?expires: 2014-01-12 ?usage: SC
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?trust: ultimate ? ? ?validity: ultimate
sub ?2048R/0C0305EC ?created: 2012-01-13 ?expires: 2014-01-12 ?usage: E
I did a 2 year expiration and the master key (4A4DBDC7 ) was updated as expected (to 2015-12-03)
PRIMARY QUESTIONS - I am uncertain about the sub-key. ?When I attempt to 'expire' it the date does not seem to change. ?Maybe you cannot expire a sub-key? ?Maybe I do not need to care because we are not using it in our encryption commands?? ?FYI, this key is only with one trading partner, so managing the change is not difficult. ?
SECONDARY QUESTION - is there documentation regarding 'best practices' on managing expiring keys and renewing via sub-keys --- my theory is that doing it this way minimizes the coordination necessary but I am not understanding how it works if you have multiple trading partners to coordinate with.
Thanks for everyone's time to read this!

First, thank you for taking the time to reply!
Regarding the steps I took to expire the keys (4A4DBDC7 is the primary key,?0C0305EC is the sub)
1. gpg --edit-key?4A4DBDC7?
1a. expire...2y
1b. enter passphrase
1c. quit and save
2. same as  but for the sub-key
I am not 100% sure what you mean by 'marking' the key - and I assume the 'quit and save' is saving the key ring
Regarding the "renewal" best practice I am thinking about scenarios where you have automated file transfers and how to minimize the coordination effort so as not to disrupt and data flows. ?For example, if process runs every 10 minutes to encrypt, sign and send a file, do you just have to accept there is some 'downtime' while you update the key, send it to the trading partner and have them import it? ?What if the trading partner requires lots of paperwork (e.g. banks) like faxes on top of emails?!
Thanks again for your support.

What exactly did you do? Did you mark the subkey before and did you save the changes to the keyring after the expire command?

You can.
Expiration serves two purposes:
1) Passively revoke a key if you have lost access to the secret mainkey (i.e. to the key itself or to its passphrase).
2) Force your communication partners (people are lazy) to update your certificate from time to time (requires some understanding on their side).
The length of the validity period is a compromise between higher "security" and less inconvenience (your own, too).
I am not sure whether I understand correctly what you mean by "renewing". You can prolong the validity of subkeys and you can replace subkeys. It's not a big difference for your communication partners. Replacing subkeys for security reasons makes real sense only if you use a secure offline mainkey.
Usually you upload your certificate (public key) to a key server (or more) from where everyone can get updates of your certificate.
