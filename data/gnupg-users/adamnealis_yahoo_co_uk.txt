@_subject: Imported keys under gpg 1.0.7 - "There is no indication that this key really belongs to the owner" 
Hello all,
I'm in the process of trying to set up enigmail under
Mozilla at home. Here is my set up:
GnuPG: v1.0.7
enigmail: v0.49.5.0
IPC: v0.99.9
Mozilla: v1.0.0RC1
OS: FreeBSD 4.4-RC
I already have this stuff working at work, where I have
GnuPG: gpg (GnuPG) 1.0.6
OS: Linux 2.4.8-26mdk (Mandrake 8.1)
work % gpg --version
gpg (GnuPG) 1.0.6

Home: ~/.gnupg
Supported algorithms:
Cipher: 3DES, CAST5, BLOWFISH, RIJNDAEL, RIJNDAEL192, RIJNDAEL256, TWOFISH
Pubkey: RSA, RSA-E, RSA-S, ELG-E, DSA, ELG
Hash: MD5, SHA1, RIPEMD160
I began by transferring my ~/.gnupg at work to ~/.gnupg
at home. But on trying to use gpg via enigmail I get this:
home % /usr/local/bin/gpg --batch --no-tty --status-fd 2 --comment 'Using GnuPG with Mozilla \

Which I have no clue about. If it helps, I appear to have imported
Tim's key. It's the same as for at work, and I can send Tim
encrypted mail at work.

I bet I'm missing something obvious, buy the docs are still
not making much sense to me 8-(.
Can anyone help?
