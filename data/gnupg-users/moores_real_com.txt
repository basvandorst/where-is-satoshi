i am on solaris 2.6, gcc.
configure has no complaints.
the make can't create a ".lo" file.
oracle make

make: Fatal error: Don't know how to make target `mpih-add1.lo'

make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `all-recursive-am'
i found several .lo file with the word "timestamp"
in them so i just created the missing files.
then i got down to failing on

this probably means i did something bad above...
can someone give me some input on this?
is there a binary dist for solaris?

actually it should have been obvious to me.
but i am so used to making on linux
where make IS gmake.
