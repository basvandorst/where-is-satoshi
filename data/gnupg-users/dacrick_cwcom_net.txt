(please CC dacrick in any replies, thanks)
Looking at the "OpenPGP" document in the source distribution,
I found this paragraph:
* Neither PGP 5.x nor PGP 6.0 recognize ElGamal Encrypt
and Sign keys. They only handle ElGamal Encrypt-only keys.
On the key generation menu we can select:
   (1) DSA and ElGamal (default)
   (2) DSA (sign only)
   (4) ElGamal (sign and encrypt)
Am I therefore correct in assuming that "ElGamal Encrypt-only
keys" refers to the ElGamal keypair part of (1) above?
