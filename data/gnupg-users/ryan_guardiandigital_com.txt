There are two GnuPG modules available for perl which may make your life
  This does not fix your problem, but it may help you so you don't have to
reinvent the wheel. :)

This is true.  From the null(4) manpage:
  NOTES
       If these devices are not writable  and  readable  for  all
       users, many programs will act strange.

@_subject: RSA Key Generation 
I know that this has been discussed many times, but is there a "timeframe"
for adding RSA key generation to GnuPG?  I'd even settle for a third-party
patch so I don't have to write my own. :)
The reason I need it is I've started playing with FreeS/WAN and PGPnet
(PGP, Inc.).  In order to get PGP authentication going you need RSA PGP
It's no huge deal as I'm using X.509 right now, but is there any
timeframe?  All the archives (circa when the patent expired) say "soon",
but 1.0.5 came out recently and it doesn't look like it's in.
