Hi all,
I have 2 encrypted files on my PC, let's call them A and B. Every now and then, they are decrypted, edited and encrypted again with the -c option. This has been working very well for decades, surviving several changes of PCs and Linux flavours. The problem arose after my update from	Linux Mint 17 (Ubuntu 14)
to	Linux Mint 19 (Ubuntu 18)
Since then, A wasn't re-encrypted, and I can decrypt it as before. B however was re-encrypted, and now I cannot decrypt it anymore. Each attempt is responded with
gpg: AES256 encrypted data
gpg: encrypted with 1 passphrase
gpg: decryption failed: Bad session key

Hi there,
I had a bad timing with my post, so just as a reminder for those who were absorbed by the holidays. Any hint?

Hi Peter,
It took me quite some time until I got aware of this. A term like "key" or "encryption key" would have made it easier for me, the "session" was somewhat misleading.
I wrote a simple program which generates the most likely variation of my passphrase, such as omitting single characters, changing upper/lower case and trying the neighbors of each character on the keyboard, but without success. So I probably will follow your hint about existing tools.
Thanks a lot for your answer.
