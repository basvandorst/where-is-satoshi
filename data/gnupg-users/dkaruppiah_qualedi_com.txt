I'm getting the following error when trying to decrypt a file received
through HTTPS on command line:
gpg: CAST5 encrypted data
gpg: block_filter 00AF8A00: read error (size=4245,a->size=1002)
Detached signature.
Please enter name of data file:
No such file, try again or hit enter to quit.
Please enter name of data file:
gpg: can't hash datafile: file read error
gpg: WARNING: message was not integrity protected
gpg: block_filter: pending bytes!
Sender claims that the signature is attached and this error does not
duplicate on all the files received from the same sender. I am using GPG
1.4.2 on windows (tried decrypting on version 1.4.8 too); the sender uses
PGP 6.5.8. There is no CRC error reported. Any ideas?

How do I compute sha1sum in GPG? I can't seem to find an option that
computes sha1sum in the GPG manual.

That looks pretty much like currupted data. Check that you received the message intact, for example by asking the sender
to provide a sha1sum and compare that to the sha1sum you got.
