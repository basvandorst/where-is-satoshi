@_subject: secret key id disclosure 
Hello.  Have I compromised my secret key or encryption strength
if I have disclosed its id like this:
pub  1024D/8066516A 2006-12-01 my name sub  1024g/GGGGGGGG 2006-12-01 [expires: 2010-12-01]

I didn't understand this sub-key ID, and mistook it for the
secret key ID.  It makes sense that the public key and the
corresponding secret key have the same ID.
