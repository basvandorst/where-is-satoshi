@_subject: GnuPG language setting 
From where GnuPG takes its language setting in Windows, exactly?
I am having a problem with GnuPG text ui-language. My windows is in english, but GnuPG is in swedish. I know I can fix this issue with lang=en enviroinment variable, but I am having this wrong language problem in several other software also. Regional settings (Control Panel\Clock, Language, and Region) in control panel are what I desire, but no affect with this. I believe my computer vendor (HP) made some customization to the operating system installation package and broke something. My os is Windows 7 64b.

In my case it is very hard to find the place where to change this setting in os. I know I can override this with lang=en env setting. I have checked all the settings in Windows 7 control panel and made some digging in to the registry, but failed so far.

@_subject: suspicious key found 
I made a key search with my name and found something suspicious.
The search:
I have used my old key since 2007. Fingerprint F4DB 40F8 BF22 8B9D 9B8F  F679 A482 4C9A 033E 22A2. I know this is quite old key and maybe I should revoke it.
I also found another key with fingerprint 87C4 F4C8 16D1 3CC3 03E0 7977 1A9C 6259 033E 22A2. The key ID is the same 033E 22A2 on both keys. There's also signatures in this key. Looks like same persons and same key ID's but fingerprints doesn't match. For some reason this key has been revoked.
Did someone really generated same looking key? And why? Any ideas? Someone tries to capture my emails? I would like to see some sort of theory what is going on, thanks :)
