Perhaps --disable-asm would help.

Rusty Howell (rhowell
This comes from util/secmem.c. Line 141 sets err (err = EPERM),
and ll. 171 checks for err and errno. Since errno remains 0,
gpg throws an error.
This patch did it for me:
diff -Nru gnupg-1.2.4.orig/util/secmem.c gnupg-1.2.4/util/secmem.c

          )

@_subject: [Announce] GnuPG 2.1.17 released 
I believe there's something wrong with the signature of the latest
 Werner Koch (wk at gnupg.org):
This fails:
gpg: Signature made Tue Dec 20 11:33:11 2016 CET
gpg:                using RSA key D8692123C4065DEA5E0F3AB5249B39D24F25E3B6
gpg: BAD signature from "Werner Koch (dist sig)" [unknown]
But the SHA1 hash of the release tarball matches the one in the
release announcement.
I downloaded directly from gnupg.org. For reference, the hashes of
the release file and the signature (as downloaded here) are:
SHA1 (gnupg-2.1.17.tar.bz2) = d83ab893faab35f37ace772ca29b939e6a5aa6a7
SHA1 (gnupg-2.1.17.tar.bz2.sig) = 34cea3e6d139cb340bf14f04ff217cb6960cf36d
Or is that just me and a local issue?

Christoph Moench-Tegeder (cmt at burggraben.net):
Since then, this has been fixed:
gpg: Signature made Tue Dec 20 14:59:50 2016 CET
gpg:                using RSA key D8692123C4065DEA5E0F3AB5249B39D24F25E3B6
gpg: Good signature from "Werner Koch (dist sig)" [unknown]
Note the newer timestamp. Also, HTTP reports that the signature has been
replaced: "Last-Modified: Tue, 20 Dec 2016 14:05:28 GMT"
(Almost) everything is fine,

That is the MD5 checksum of the gpg4win-2.3.0.exe file, which has
