@_subject: Gnupg and cardreader 
I have installed Gnupg 1.4.9 and Enigmail 1.3.5 on a Mozilla Thunderbird
10.0 mail client. My OS is Windows 7.
Everyting works just great (can send and receive encrypted mails).
When I try to use my cardreader (ACR38U), which by the way works fine
with websites that require ID cards, I get an error:
"Your SmartCard reader could not be accessed
Please attach your SmartCard reader, insert your card, and repeat the
Is there a way to make that work?

@_subject: PGP and BeID 
Besides Mozilla Thunderbird (v31.3.0) en Enigmail (1.7.2) I installed
GpG4Win (2.2.3) in order to encrypt/sign emails.
Works like a charm (no pun intended).
The only problem I have is that, when I try to open the "Manage Smartcard"
option in Enigmail, I receive an error saying that the smartcard is not
supported (gpg: OpenPGP card not available: Not supported).
As smartcard I use my Belgian EiD card with the the ACR38U as cardreader.
Additional software installed:
1. middleware (4.0.7 7453)
2. OpenPGP Smartcard Minidriver (OpenPGPmdrv-1.0.0.0)
Works also a like a charm.
As OS I use Windows 8.1 64bit
I suspect that the OpenPGP software is the culprit and doesn't support
my smartcard.
Is this correct and can I do something to make it work?
