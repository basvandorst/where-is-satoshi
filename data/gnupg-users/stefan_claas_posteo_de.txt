Hi all,
just wondering if there is an easy way to generate a Bitcoin secret key
from a GnuPG  secp256k1 secret key. If so, how would you do that?

To be more precise, i would like to see the secret Bitcoin key in WIF or
WIFC format, if possible.

Thanks for your reply!
I could imagine that no one will do this, because if you have no
private key for "your" public address (according to your reply),
you have no control of that address, like spending/ sending
BTC from this address.

Ah, o.k., i appologize.
I think this is a good idea, for people who have publicity posted their
Bitcoin address on their web page or for example on keybase etc.

Hi all,
i don't know how many of you folks use social media sites like Twitter
and Facebook etc. and wondered what's a way to post a GnuPG clear
signed message on those sites, due to line width limits or characters
per message limits.
Well, i thought about that to and i like to share an idea with you.
I found out that with short GnuPG clear signed messages a good way
to do that is to encode the message in the popular QR-Code format.
For this task i used the package "qrencode" which is available as
Linux package and can also be compiled under OS X, for example.
So, simply prepare your short GnuPG message and then do a:
$ qrencode -o message.png < message.txt.asc, to obtain a
.png image, ready to be posted on social media sites.
To decode such an image in Terminal simply do a:
(please note: the images when downloaded are then in .jpeg format)
$ zbarimg image.jpg > output.txt && sed "s/QR-Code:-/-/g" output.txt |
gpg --verify
If you know a better and shorter way to decode, please let me/us know.
Hope you find this little tip useful and i hope it may spread the usage
of GnuPG! :-)

sorry to hear that it is not working for you!
I tried this already several times and it always worked for me.
Here's again a little test without GnuPG usage. I created a padded
test message with the same byte amount like your file has.
Input for qrencode:
Mmmhhh, that is strange!
-----BEGIN MEANINGLESS GARBAGE-----
-----END MEANINGLESS GARBAGE-----
Output from zbarimg:
QR-Code:Mmmhhh, that is strange!
-----BEGIN MEANINGLESS GARBAGE-----
-----END MEANINGLESS GARBAGE-----

I re-read your reply and saw that you used in point 2:
qrencode -o david.png david.asc
please try: qrencode -o david.png < david.asc
then it should work.
I also looked for other decoders and found a C++ port of zxing, which
makes the task shorter in Terminal, because we can omit sed.

Hi David,
glad that it works now for you.
Well, i guess we are all here in the same boat with this...
I started using PGP in 1994 and submitted my first public key to
key servers in 1995. Since then i also tried to convince family
members, friends and co-workers to use PGP/GnuPG, but as
usual no interest was/is shown in securing email etc.
A while ago i thought also to convince people to use S/MIME
because their is no learning curve as with GnuPG involved, but
nobody was interested either. Same goes for suggesting modern
(free) Web based email providers like ProtonMail, for example. No
interest either.
I also started an international  Facebook group a couple of years ago
about PGP/GnuPG and it has the amazing number of *36* members
(including me) while Facebook has now 2 billion monthly users...!!!
I think the problem with encryption and GnuPG is that it has no lobby
from industry giants like Apple, Microsoft, Google, etc.
In post Snowden times it should be possible for developers who
create commercial OS Software and mail clients that those softwares
warns a user when using a commercial mail client that he/she has
not set-up encryption yet, prior first usage. Whether it is a GnuPG
or S/MIME.

Well, to me the formatting then looks a bit ugly. :-)
I also tried it again with a document created with Text Wrangler under
OS X, clear signed it and copy and pasted the file in Facebook.
But when importing back and verifying it i get:
gpg: invalid armor header: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur
adipiscing\n gpg: invalid armor header:iQEzBAEBCAAdFiEEK6+F+SgavVQ4I8fFmB63w4LsUrQFAlmFyfIACgkQmB63w4Ls\n That was the main idea behind it, because i know a lot of well known
security / privacy experts are on Twitter and maybe they find this
little tip useful.

@_subject: Bitcoin private key from GnuPG secp256k1 secret key? 
Hi NIIBE-san,
while reading a bit more on the Bitcoin Wiki and reading about
Bitmessage papers etc. I would like to know from you and all
other experts here on the list about some thoughts i have and
what you think about this.
First of all, inspired by your script i looked for an easy way to
extract the secret key material of a GnuPG secp256k1 sub key,
which works nicely with GnuPG, without the usage of a script
or programming knowledge etc.
With this secret key material everybody could create a valid Bitcoin
address and when using two sub keys (like a signing and a encryption
key one can also generate a Bitmessage key pair with the proper
Bitmessage address.
Usually pub keys with Bitcoin or Bitmessage are not seen by the
user, afaik. Except a Bitcoin user would sign a message with
it's secret Bitcoin key and the pub key would be derived from
the address and the signature data.
i tried also out educational open source software for Bitcoin signing
and encryption and the interesting thing was that when a user
likes to encrypt a message to another user the software looks up
the blockchain and checks if there was a valid transaction done.
If not the encryption fails.
I tried also another .html based software for Bitcoin signing out and
what i liked very much about this is that users can verify a signed
Bitcoin message, without needing a public key from the communication
partner in advance, nor does the software collects public keys,
because it's not needed.
Now my thoughts about this subject.
Let's say i create a valid Bitcoin address from a secret GnuPG secp256k1
sub key and import the secret key material, which i have converted to
a valid WIF secret key, into my Bitcoin wallet. Now if i buy officially
some Satoshi from well known traders and transfer, as a registered user,
from this account the Satoshi to my newly created GnuPG Bitcoin Address
the transaction is in the blockchain. If then i would send from my valid
GnuPG Bitcoin address some Satoshi to a valid gnupg.org Bitcoin address
i would have donated (the modern way :-)) a bit to the GnuPG Foundation
and it would appear also in the block chain and i think this could be
then also a sign of proof that i'm the owner of a public key, without
being in the Web of Trust. keybase.io users for example have the
option to publish their Bitcoin address on their page as well.
The second thought. I already have lot's of GnuPG public keys collected
due to reading the mailing list or signed Usenet posts. Thanks
to auto-key-retrieve on.
If GnuPG would allow a user in the future to use an additional flag,
when signing with a secp256k1 sub key, which would produce
signatures that would work like Bitcoin key signatures, users would not
need to collect a ton of public keys and the signature would verify.
Well, i hope that my thoughts are not to crazy, but i really would like
to hear the opinion from other members here.
Best regards

And if GnuPG would allow in the future to export a secp256k1 sub
key additionally in WIF format one could easily import the key in
his/her bitcoin wallet without the usage of some scripts etc.

If your communication partners would use the same software, like opmsg.
Or if you would use Bitmessage instead of classic email, then
you have authenticated/encrypted messages too and can later
nuke your keys, if needed.

i like to ask application developers if it's possible to implement,
in the future, identicons like for example Bitmessage has?
The reason why i ask, i started to use Thunderbird with Enigmail and
Enigmail shows me always Untrusted Good Signature with a 32bit key ID,
when i have not carefully verified the persons pub key and --lsign'ed
the pub-key. Showing only the long key id or the complete fingerprint
is imho more difficult to quickly memorize than an additionial shown
identicon (computed from the fingerprint).
P.S. With scallion it took me only seconds/or a minute to generate
a fake pub-key with the same 32bit key id, on my old notebook.

I'm no cryptographer nor a programmer, but i think a visiualisation

the word "text" in the sample code with "0x0000"etc. and in the second
image with "0x1000"etc.

Call me stupid, i use(d) GnuPG not to much and i'm not a pro user like
many here on the list. But when i receive(d) a signed message the first
from a user completey unknown to me i did not lsign his/her key. Instead i
verified always the fingerprint and the email headers a couple of times.
With Thunderbird/Enigmail (i can't speak for other apps) a user new to GnuPG
and and not savvy with checking email headers and not carefully checking the
fingerprint (he must click addionally on the Details button) and who has
signed a public key before would in my opinion have it easier if he would be
presented with an additional visual fingerprint imho, because he would
spot after the second email if the pub-key, he not yet lsigned, that
there is
something wrong.
If the visual fingerprint would be bullet-proof it would not hurt to
such a feature, imho.
Hope that my suggestion is not to naive or to stupid!

Very good article Daniel i will re-read and save it as reference
and let other people know about it.
No, of course i have not. My thoughts as a not so-skilled GnuPG user
would be that it helps users detecting (assuming it's bullet-proof) a
proper key from a fake key more easily if they have not yet signed
(locally) a public key while they already exchanged a couple of emails.
I can speak only of Thunderbird/Enigmail wich i use now. It gives a
user the usual "Untrusted Good Signatur" and i have to click also on
the Details button to carefully verify the fingerprint from an addional
list to see if the key belongs to the person the signature claims. An
additional visual fingerprint would make that proccess for me easier,
if it's bullet-proof.
I could imagine that Joe user average may not always look at mail headers
very carefully for a little typo in the from: or reply-to: header in his
mail client or web-mailer.

And another thought, since this thread says "app developers". How would
services like StartMail, ProtonMail or gmx.de for example handle this...?
If i remember correctly users have not the possibillity to sign someone
elses pub-key when they both use the same service. If someone gains
unauthorized access to one account and use his own fake pub key...?!

For me it means that the idendicons should be visually easy to read
and cryptographically secure. Sorry that i have no better explanation.
Well, in the past, before i started using this email combination i
used web based email accounts copy and pasted the message into
a text editor and had no auto key retrival and looked up WWW
key servers to download the required key to verify the sig. I had
not often communications back then. So this was an acceptable
workflow for me.
With the current set-up it's all automatic and my understanding is
that in case i would receive a fake message my set-up would download
the fake key, display it as "Untrusted Good Signature" too, because i
have not yet locally signed the key. Therefore i click details to see the
fingerprint (which i can't memorizy) and look it up again. Maybe, as
casual user who never used this set-up before, i make a fundamentally
mistake in understanding of how the auto retrieve and verify function
works. I mean why is a Details button there to see a fingerprint which
i believe nobody can memorize in the first place? It must serve a purpose,
or not?
For me a MUA is passive and happily accepts what he receives, whether it's
correct content or not, so i can't answer that question, sorry.

In old times I would say if Bob and Alice don't know each other and they
have no clue how that particular security software works it should be that
the second message send to one person the security software already detects
forgeries and reports that to a person. However, with that thinking it does
not guarantee that Bob knows that Alice is not Eve. Therefore qualified CA's
in my opinion are mandatory where each user in each country has to register
with his/her id-card so that it's guaranteed that Alice is not Eve.

Is TOFU verifying the email address from the from: header of the message
and then compares it with the email address in the UID? I ask, because
if i would use a free form UID with no email address, or i use an Anon
Remailer with a nym account where both email addresses are not identical.
I just installed modern GnuPG and used it with two inline PGP messages from
Usenet and i like it. :-)
I tried also with Enigmail under OS X but when checking the signatures here
from the list members i always get the blue "Untrusted Good Signature".

Well, that's debatable. As an example:
My old pub-key had a sig3 from a well known german computer
magazine, which i believe a lot of people here in Germany would trust.
Their procedure was that you attend their booth at electronic fairs
show up with your id-card and a fillet out form, containing your data and
the pub key data. They carefully checked then the filled out form with
your id-card. So it's imo compareable with key signing parties you
attend. But who guarantees that an id-card is not fake with this
classical procedure?
My new pub-key bears a sig3 from a german CA which is run on
behalf of  our interior ministry. People may not trust our government
but the procedure how the pub-key was verified* tells me that the
sig3 issued to that person is correct.
*our new german id-card contains a chip and when you look at it
i would say this sort of modern id-card can not be faked.
The procedure went like this: I inserted my id-card in a certified
card reader, which i purchased, startet the german certified id-card
software "AusweisApp2" to connect to the CA Server and the server
checked my id-card online and after verification send the signed
pub-key to my email address. Can this procedure be faked by
criminals etc.? I doubt it.

Thanks, i'm aware of the classic trust model.
I configured GnuPG to use the TOFU model and expected that Enigmail
would switch from blue Untrusted to green when TOFU gives "full" trust
to a pub key. For example when i downloaded a signed Usenet message
as a test (where Enigmail showed me a blue bar) and let GnuPG verify
the saved file manually it gave me the statistics. After downloading a
second file, where Enigmail correctly showed the blue bar again, i ran
the file via GnuPG and it gave "full" trust to the message. After that
i klicked again in Enigmail in the Usenet thread and voila i had a green
bar. So that is the reason why i thought Enigmail would give me with
the new trust model also a green bar when checking here list members
And appologies for the multiple thread chaos!

I have one more question if you don't mind. One of my tests showed
me the difference between the classic way Enigmail handles the
Untrusted blue signatures and how TOFU handles this.
Now my question as a Mac dummie and TOFU newbie. If Mallory would
gain tomorrow access to my Computer, but not to my passphrase and
he would replace one pub key in my pubring and modify the TOFU
database, how would TOFU handle this? Would TOFU alert me again
that there is a second key with the same email address?

I agree with you and it makes perfect sense, but then it would raise
another question. How should an average user of GnuPG, like me,
then handle this. I mean what you just said is not mentioned in
GnuPG tutorials and you can't expect that every GnuPG is trained
on that subject as well.
Would it then not be good if Enigmail, for the casual user, would
display a different color than green, for the explained scenario?

Well, i assume that the majority of people who are using GnuPG

not security experts like all you guys here on the list and let's
also assume they are following popular tutorials like the ones
from EFF: because they know EFF are good people (like you security experts).
Now here is my thought. Mallory knows this very well what i have
described above and after he gained access to my computer he
simply replaces on of my locally signed pub keys with a fake
one where he sets owner trust to ultimate. A user, described as
above would imho have a hard time to detect a fake pub key,
because Enigmail shows for both keys a green bar.
Maybe as an additional security feature Enigmail should give
a key with a set trust level of "Ultimate" a different color than

Thanks for pointing this out!
I come to the conclusion after reading all the replies from this thread
that i will return to pure GnuPG usage, instead of using an email / Usenet
client with add-ons. I already found a script for PGP/MIME so that i can
decrypt/verify a message send to me when using GnuPG in command-line
Another thing i will do in the future, which i haven't read in popular is that once checking the hash/sig of the provided package i will also hash
the binaries after unpacking and print them out on a piece of paper, so that i
can frequently check the values.

During my lunch break i thought of that too. I think as a good start
i will next time (which popular tutorials also do not mention) install
the next version available on an USB stick, symlink to them and put
the USB stick in a safe place. Should an email arrive i will then insert
the USB stick to decrypt/verify the message.
Regarding hashes, maybe it's possible for the authors who are
providing packages that they not only include the hash or sig,
of the package but the hashes of the unpacked binaries too,
on their download page. Should one hash discrepancy show
up on my computer i could try another one and see if the hash
matches then.
For me i see this way, for big Organizations i would not have a single
chance, but i assume that i am no target for them, because i am of no
interest to them.
On the other side, where money is involved etc. and people are good
in keeping their computers clean, and they rely on popular tutorials,
the "green bar problem" would still be there, imho.

What i mean with my example is: As you can see there are 3 messages
with the same email address "em at example.com" The third message was
signed with a key having a fake 32bit key-id, which was generated
with scallion.
Technically spoken Enigmail showed all three messages as "Untrusted
Good Signature from Ernst Mustermann etc. , because i have not signed
the first key locally, to get for the first two messages a green bar
in Enigmail.
Had i used TOFU in CLI mode then of course TOFU had detected that the
third message is not done with the first key, used for the previous
two messages.
What i mean also with this example is that if people do not sign a
key locally after the second message, from people they do not know
personally, they may have a surprise in Enigmail when receiving the
third message.
This assumes auto-key-retrieve is on. Sure when replying to the third
message the user may be warned because now he/she should have two
public keys in his/her keyring.
To be fair, Ludwig announced the update to 64bit key-id's in Enigmail,
so that this issue should be gone by then.

I asked this already in this thread, do you know what TOFU does

even with a modified database TOFU would tell me, wait there

one is not the correct one.

Correct. But what i mean was an attacker would replace on of my pub
keys (which i signed) with one he/she only replaced with one that
has only the Trust Level set to Ultimate, resulting in both keys
showing up with a green bar.
According to (i'm no programmer) RFC 4880 OpenPGP Message Format:
5.2.3.13.  Trust Signature      	Page 30
5.10.      Trust Packet (Tag 12)	Page 47

Good point! And what would be your proposal against this kind of

The idea with this scenario is that it can be carried out by people

P.S. Maybe it was not such a bad idea to propose identicons, for
third party apps using GnuPG, along with showing the fingerprint.

while i am not new to GnuPG i must admit that i did not used it very often
and when i had signed/encrypted email communications i usually had the
"Untrusted Good Signature" from person x,x,z, because i am not a member
of the classic Web-of-Trust. So far so good. I'm interested about your
thoughts (especially from people living in Germany) about the following:
A couple of days ago i came along the CA Service of Governikus KG at:
where i obtained a  sig3 signature for my new pub key:
pub   2048R/82EC52B4 2017-05-26 [verf?llt: 2021-05-26]
  Schl.-Fingerabdruck = 2BAF 85F9 281A BD54 3823  C7C5 981E B7C3 82EC 52B4
uid       [ uneing.] Stefan Claas sub   2048R/64C48933 2017-05-26 [verf?llt: 2021-05-26]
I also received my X.509 classIII certificate from the "Volkverschl?sselung"
initiative from Fraunhofer SIT:
Additionally i have a reset keybase account, due to the upload of my new
pub key, where people could have seen that i had there a Facebook, Twitter
and github proof and i am running the PGP/GnuPG Forum at Facebook.
Let's assume we would exchange signed emails (PGP/SMIME) would these proofs
be enough for you to warrant a sig2? And for a sig3 an additional video
The classical procedure would be to sign a key with a sig3 after seeing
the persons id-card in a real meeting. But who guarantees that the
id-card is not fake (if the person is a complete stranger)?
Please note, i don't want to ask people here to sign my pub key, i just
want to know what your thoughts are. :-)

For a sig3 from the well known CT Magazin in Germany you have to show

To be more precise, when i will buy me an Offline Computer my idea

maybe i buy one, let's say with Windows 10, never update or upgrade
it due to it's permanent offline state, download once gpg4win, look
at the checksum of gpg4win.exe, maybe extract the package on an Online
Computer, transfer the gpg4win.exe via minimodem, even if it takes a
very long time. Cross compile minimodem with CygWin and transfer with
minimodem the .exe and cygwin.dll to the offline computer as well.
Should i receive a PGP/MIME Message i would then use a Python script
from Github to convert the message on my Online Computer to PGP/Inline.
That was/is my idea. But thanks for pointing out the USB-to-serial

signing someone's public key should work similar to revocation

send me a, let's call it, Signature Request Certificate, if i accept
it i enter my passphrase and then the Software would extract
the needed signature bits from the request cert and add those
bits to my pub key. Like i said i'm no programmer and can't
therefore test if such a feature proposal would work.

Now i am a bit confused... Then maybe a "funny" design flaw? I mean
what should users unfamiliar with the whole WoT procedure may
think when seeing a fake "sig3" (which they may not spot) and then
clicking on the key-id in question, which then links to the original
Well, as i mentioned previously i have have no longer access to my key,
due to my stupidness. I may consider to create a new one for posteo

I just created a new key pair made a second UID with only containing
my email address and now i don't know how to filter for an export...
Also i have let certified my pub key again by Governikus.
Then i checked posteo's FAQ and now i see (under Point 4.) this:
Diese Kriterien muss Ihr ?ffentlicher OpenPGP-Schl?ssel erf?llen, um
ihn bei Posteo hinterlegen zu k?nnen. 1. Das Namensfeld muss leer sein oder lediglich Ihre E-Mail-Adresse
enthalten. 2. Der ?ffentliche Schl?ssel darf nur eine E-Mail-Adresse
enthalten. Unterschl?ssel (Subkeys) oder mehrere E-Mail-Adressen sind
nicht zul?ssig. 3. Ihr Schl?ssel muss Ihre Posteo-E-Mail-Adresse oder eine
Ihrer Alias-Adressen enthalten. 4. Der Schl?ssel darf nicht von anderen unterschrieben oder signiert
sein. 5. Der Schl?ssel darf kein Foto oder andere pers?nliche Daten
If i need email privacy with GnuPG i would use Mixmaster Remailers
with a nym account or Bitmessage and not a german based email
provider, where i have to pay for their service... :-)
So it seem that while it's a good idea with WKD, posteo is no
option for me, when it comes to submitting my pub key there.

Well, i can't fetch keys from keybase with GnuPG in the command line
like i can do with traditional key servers. On keybase i am in full
control of my pub key, so that nobody can add there unwanted
signatures or a fake "sig3" to my pub key. I could not test WKD yet,
but believe that the same rule applies there too, with protecting
my pub key. If both, WKD and keybase could work as one unit
GnuPG power users could fetch keys via CLI, as usual, or via their
client software and users had the ability too to check also the keybase
Web Interface for additional infos about a user, if they like to do so.
keybase current stats:
Keys: 763,642
Humans: 180,431
Teams: 8,652 (new!)
The figures should not be underestimated imho because i believe
that keybase helps also the grow of GnuPG and is a nice addition for
GnuPG users, me thinks.

Can you give more details about the security aspect?
Currently users can still search sks key servers by names, with
Lynx... :-) As understood key server operators can still give a whole
dump to 3rd parties, which like to analyze the data, or third parties
run their own key server and analyze the data. So what purpose should
your suggestion serve?
If you are talking about GDPR issues, those keys server operators
are not "licensed" by governmental institutions and run their servers
according to some strict regulations.

Well, my understanding would be that a least one (search) criteria
would be needed to fetch a key, right? And if so i could also imagine
that this one criteria could be abused as well, in form of a given

Sure, thats the way it works. If Werner and you for example had an

Well, i am not familiar how the current warez etc. scene works,
but my assumption was the following (o.k. i am no programmer...):
As long as we have the option to add additional UID's  to a key my
thinking was, after reading the links from Yegor, that one appends
arbitrary data to a key and provides a link, at some other place, to
that key, in the form of URL://keyserver/keyid_or_fp.
People then would only need a little program to dearmor and
extract the data from that key UID's.

Understood. Please check this example, a key with with plenty of data,
which only needs to be extracted.
That's right, but my thought is / was someone can (ab)use key servers
as data storage / retrieval system and then only provides the key id
in a link.

I have read also the threads at sks devel ML and my suggestions
would be that we need more international CA's to get rid of all
the problems, the key server network has.
People should think about the following:
Get a sig from a CA and then upload your key via email.
Then the key servers do something like a gpg --check-sigs
to see if a key bears a valid CA sig and if it is found in their
index the key will be added to the network, once the submitted
UID matches with the email address header. So no cryptographic
verification is imho needed. This would also eliminate, i think,
that someone else can upload someone else's pub key.

@_date: 2018-12-09 19:38:31
@_author: Stefan Claas 
@_subject: Garbled data in keyservers 
No, in 2018 i think it is not. CA's can be run by non-profit
organizations like EFF etc., which i believe a lot of people trust.
Then don't forget all the worldwide assurers from CAcert.org.
I don't think so. Create an anon account at ProtonMail via Tor for
example and then do "funny stuff" with those keys.

Hi Dirk,
If trusted organizations like EFF etc. would run a CA...
Nobody said that it should be free.
I have learned in the past the phrase "trust nobody" when it comes

example... ;-)

My proposal could be run also in parallel. I think it would be
only a weekend job for a programmer to modify the server code,
so that it accepts only incoming and verified email and not web
or GnuPG via Tor submissions.
People can then still use the old key servers (until they may become
obsolete...) or use keybase.
To bad that Werner's WKD is not widely adopted from email
service providers...

Hi Dirk,
Well, if one creates a valid UID for ProtonMail, for example, the
the Server needs then also to check additional UID's or "funny" sigs,
right? A key which would bear a CA sig would imho not have such
additional and funny UID's or sigs, because it would make the key owner
look a bit stupid, i would say.

Mind you in the 90's PGP key servers accepted also email and Usenet

@_subject: Garbled data in keyservers 
Hi Wiktor,
Yes, it seems it would be a good start. However, if unwanted data can then be still
submitted remains to bee seen, because what if anonymous email services would use
DKIM too?
As per Werner's suggestion to make only the fingerprint available for (Web/API) searches,
is also a thing, because like i previously said a list of fingerprints for example can still be
generated and uploaded with a description of a file name, so that users only need to use
a one line like that:
gpg --recv-key $fp | gpg --export $fp > key.asc && gpg --list-packets key.asc |\
grep -e '^:user ID packet: "[[:digit:]]'|sed -e 's/^:user ID packet: "//' |\
sort -n | sed -e 's/^[^ tr -d '"\015\012' | fold -w 76 | base64 -d > Kristian.jpg
And i tried also a modified version of the github program (uploading disabled) and it is
pretty fast imho for generating jpg image content keys. For other binary stuff it is slow.

This can be simply avoided by using a mixnym address and using the Usenet group alt.anonymous messages.
It requires of course that people get familiar with Mixmaster, which is as old as PGP. Or simply use Bitmessage.
Nobody is against a decentralized system. And probably nobody wants that 3rd parties can upload your key with funny or not so funny signatures, or knock-out
your key so that friends can't no longer download it from key servers.
The latest user guide from EFF shows key server usage as *last* option in their document and also tells people to think
about it, uploading a key to a key server. True, but have you ever seen replies from (a) key server software developer(s) saying we are aware of all those problems
and we are working on a solution? I don't refer here to the pgp.com key server, WKD,  Autocrypt or keybase, i mean the
widely used SKS key server network.

While i also played with S/MIME and PGP setup's in Mutt long time ago, i am

remember vaguely that for those (Neo)Mutt S/MIME set-up gpgsm was not
required. I would suggest that you simply google for "Mutt S/MIME" to see a lot of
tutorials on how to do that. Once you have a correct neomutt set-up
you can send me an S/MIME signed email so that we can see if your
set-up works properly. I have a D-Trust certificate. The D-Trust
root certificates should be already installed in most systems.

While testing today how to make someones pub key non-importable,non-
receivable, with an evil version of GnuPG, I am wondering about the following:
Is it not possible that for pub key submissions GnuPG could be installed
on key servers to check if the key material is valid, prior keys got added?
My test today showed me that it looks like that GnuPG is not used on
key servers.
In case if there would be email submissions possible, in the future, i think
it could work something like this: Install postfix and procmail, while
procmail would pipe that message to gnupg for verification of valid key
data, prior the pub key gets added to the pool.

it does not use the MacPorts agents, but it failed.
Finally i decided to update MacPorts and now i am using
GnuPG 2.2.10, which is the latest there.
With The MacPorts version everything works as expected.
However, it would be nice to know why GnuPG told me
that the certs are not trusted. I googled for that but could

Maybe we need (a court) case were a PGP user requests the removal
of his / her keys until the operators and code maintainers wake up?
Or PGP users simply forget those old fashioned geek key servers

How long do we have now those old fashioned key servers, and was
there ever been made attempts by the software maintainers to
modernize the code, like you are saying incorporating crypto
O.k. Werner invented WKD which solves those problems, if i'm not

Well, it is up to the user what he / she publishes on keybase.io besides
the public key. He / she is not forced to provide any identity via other
web sites etc. Doing this is a method they have implemented as sort
of another way of a web of trust, so to speak.
Why do i prefer keybase.io over the old key server system? Because
i am in control of my public key there, so that nobody can do funny
things with my key, like it is possible with the old key servers. If
people would like to sign my key they would have to provide me
my signed key so that i can upload it to keybase and not like the
other way the old key servers let people do, without my approval
Understood, but what speaks against a (syncing) public key server
system like the old pgp.com key server was, compared to the regular
key servers, which don't allow deletion of a key, by the owner and if
i remember correctly also only upload by the owner.
As it is of now with SKS and Co. i think in 2018 such a key server
model does not help for a clean database, which everybody can
look up, nor does it help users to protect their keys nor deleting
their keys, in case they like to do so.

Agreed. But the word privacy would then also mean to me that
users who uploaded their public keys on key servers would not
reveal that they know each other as shown with their signatures,
which the classical WoT somehow requires, instead of using local sigs. To me this seems to be the only advantage that the network can't be
controlled. If IMHO key removal by the owner and upload only by the
owner could be implemented in the future than that would pretty

Thanks for pointing this out. When looking in the past on sigs, via
WWW key servers i always had the impression that people do a lot
of "fan" signing, thus making the classical WoT somewhat untrustworthy
to me, because those fans have never met you or others in person.
Should we ever see a new key server model, replacing the current one,
and only owners can upload their keys i think this would help to
eliminate those fan sigs too, which IMHO have no weight, unless of
course the owner of that key with fan sigs would also verify and sign
those signers.
Maybe a sig4 = family, long time friends which does not involve
verification of ID card documents. ... :-)

Hi Dirk,
I  expected something like this... ;-)
I personally like that we have such EU regulation. And i understand
that it costs money to build and maintain such infrastructure.
And this is the problem i have since 1994/95... For me signatures
made with PGP / GnuPG have no weight, for several reasons, except
those made from Governikus and maybe CT Magazine signed keys.
Why? Can i, for example, trust fan signatures made by users on
someones key which bears several hundred sigs and the key holder
does not sign the signers keys? No, of course not. Call me stupid
but even if Governikus would be run by the BND or NSA etc. i would trust
the validity of such signed keys more than a signed key from "somebody"
signed by other people i do not know. Due to the procedure Governikus
uses i can be personally rest assured that the key belongs to the person
which the key data states. The only thing GnuPG offers me with not made with Governikus signed keys, is that if someone has tampered
with a document the "signature" would be then no longer valid.
Here is a little example, of a .pdf i have signed with my qualified Linux users can verify my qualified signature here:
macOS oder Windows users can use the free Adobe Reader DC
to do he same.
At list of TSP's (Trust Service Provider) can be seen here:
I think PGP users should be more open to current available and accepted
standards when it comes to digital signatures.
Yes, in case of PGP / GnuPG when using the classical WoT procedure.
Thanks, much appreciated! I really like to see some more examples from
native English speakers living in the U.S.
I would like to omit the creation procedure or how the signing
procedure works, because imho people from the PGP ecosystem
should accept in the future qualified X.509 signatures.

Hi Dirk,
How could Governikus be listed, they are a PGP CA and not X.509, run on
behalf by Germany's BSI ? No, i don't think it is the same, or do you personally verify a X.509
Root CA? I can only trust macOS or Windows with it's build in key store
and the fingerprints on web sites from the CA's. Regarding Governikus
in can check for the PGP fingerprint on one of their pages and must rely
on proper operation of my BSI certified card reader, AusweisApp2 and of
course of my nPA.
I am not able to verify a qualified eIDAS conform X.509 sig, which
i can create now, with LibreOffice, nor with other tools, except Adobe
Reader DC or with the mentioned web site link. Have you or someone
else actually tried to verify my greetings.pdf on my keybase page?
If so i am really interested in the results from various tools!
The sign-me service is currently free of charge and i expect once
commercially available the costs for signing (frequently) a document
there would be much lower than obtaining a qualified eIDAS conform
certificate on a signature card, plus software and card reader costs.
Same for me... and that is the reason why i started the discussion, to
let people think about it.
That is the reason why i like to sign the .pdf, containing my key data,
with a qualified eIDAS conform signature. The detached GnuPG sig should
be an additional info, that matches the key data in the document. I only came up with this, hopefully good, idea because a qualified and
eIDAS conform signature will be, i strongly assume, the highest level
in trustworthy  signatures available, in the future. At least in Europe.

the years i have used GnuPG, have no weight for me except for
cryptographically securing documents content or files from tampering,
from people which i personally don't know, when it comes to the
classical WoT.
I think it is also very sad, that after all the years, afaik only
Governikus offers such a service. I am not aware of any other CA in
in the world which work the same.

is still around... :-) If i would send as some form of a registered
letter than i would say yes.
I also thought about PayPal etc., but decided against it after receiving
an advice.
Yes, i remember this blog post and thought about this as well.
I like to point out that i remember RSA encryption, before PGP was
available and there was no WoT, so only people who knew each other
communicated that way.
When i first learned about PGP in 94/95 i also thought why should
people sign each other's key for a WoT and why do we need a global WoT
and what is it good for.
With my humble approach i like to be honest, in that form, that i did
my best for certifying someones key which might be useful for someone
else, entering the WoT, without letting third parties know   that i know
a person personally, or have a longtime online friendship etc. or that i
belong to a certain group of people.
With the postal approach the requester does not need to send his
address in encrypted form in case my computer would be compromised.
When someone request a signature i don't keep records on my computer
later. I only keep the postcard as souvenir.
With the sig0 approach i have the following problem: I could create
a couple of fake keybase accounts, for example, give each other
a sig0 and then what is this good for if i follow the advise from

If people read between the lines, so to speak, when reading my

they could adopt it or improve it and sign each others key that
way to build a stronger chain. Or i am to naive and blue eyed?

Hi Dirk,
You make a very important point, which i thought also about and
that is my little approach for covering my a* I would strongly
assume that law enforcement would also check a sig0 user,
regardless of policy or not, if something happens to a key owner,
or if i sign with sig0 a key on a key signing party, where i also don't
know that the person who attended is a good or bad person with a real
or fake id. I am totally unable to distinguish  between a real or fake
id nor do i know if a person is good or bad if i would attend such a
key signing party.
Like i said in my previous reply i have to study this in more depth.

Hi Dirk,
No, no... this absolutely no bad example, regardless of sig level!
I wish that more users on the Mailing List would participate in this
discussion and critic or comment my policy. I would also very much
appreciate a proper formulated policy of mine, from a native English
speaker. Regardless whether he / she likes my policy, or not!
Sounds interesting! I will check the docs, thanks!
I must say good night now because it is already late! ;-)

I understand your points, but like to point out my view of sig0
and why i think it is not good and why i wrote a policy that way.
Agreed, use X.509... ;-) (disagree, see my point when it comes
to Protection of Minors)

O.k. before i try to explain what i mean i like to ask why do we have,
or need a Web of Trust and what is it good for?
You are a well respected community member, i assume. For me
it would be enough if your key bears no sigs. If i would like to
communicate with you i only need to be sure that the fingerprint
matches, when downloading your key from your web site. Same
imho applies if i would be an activist and would like to communicate
with EFF for example. I download the key from their site and encrypt
to them.
Now, since we have PGP and GnuPG with the Web of Trust and
its sig levels you make your points on your blog. I understand,
as non-native Englisch speaker that i or someone else should
think about to consider to use sig level 0.
With my humble approach i avoid sig level 0 and also try with
sig2 level and sig3 to do my best to avoid any surprises due
to the fact that i like to use a postcard / letter method for
verification, so that a third party or the requester know
there is some documentation (the postcard) available.
If we had certified CA's globally, like Governikus, and they
would do cross certifications, PGP or GnuPG would not need
all those sig levels, every user would be properly registered
if he / she likes to do so and there would be no need
for an extensive explanation in the manual nor a discussion
about sig levels, policies and what not. Everybody is still
free, in case of not trusting Governmental institutions and
use PGP / GnuPG the classic way.
This was more a joke, but i must admit (i own a classII and classIII
X.509 certificate) and in combination with Thunderbird there is
no learning phase and it's quite simple to use and you have the
assurance that the name and email belongs to that person you
are communicating with, without consulting a manual etc.
:-) While minors are usually smarter (or they think their are) than their
parents my thought is/ was to create a policy which shows clearly
that i try to do a proper verification, give a sig level to do my best.
In case something could happen i can show a postcard.
I mean why do we have the possibility for a WoT verification
with it's sig levels? If i issue a sig0 that could mean i don't like to
tell because if have something to hide to the public WoT public or
i cheat. Sure if people use other policies or none they could do
the same for level 2 and 3.... :-(

Sorry for the late reply....
I like to give a (fictitious) example.
A person with bad things in mind could theoretically use anonymous
email services via Tor or Remailer Services via Tor, with a proper
looking name used in his/her email/nym address. I believe that a lot
of people do not care to much from what domain an email arrives, as
long as the email is not spam.  With my approach there is a postcard.
With the currently used validation model people would have a hard time
to find the bad person, in case he / she would abuse the WoT.

or an official  binary, if your are not able yet, to run make in a Java

Unfortunately i am no programmer and therefore can't help you,
so hopefully someone else can do.
In case it is not a security problem maybe there would be also
the option, if a Java environment is nessesary to call a
GnuPG binary from within Java.... But like i said i am no
programmer (or a security expert)

Hi all,
while i don't use public keys from email services which offer as a
service to create the key pair on their servers, i have a question,
for those who use ProtonMail from the very beginning and have
made a copy from that public key.
I ask because it puzzles me a bit when i discovered a while
ago that i have now 2 public keys on my account, which
are created at a later date, then when i signed up to the
service, which then created the key pair upon sign-up.
Therefore i like to know if users can show me that when
they signed up with the service from the beginning that
they also had a public key with the uid user at protonmail.ch
and not name etc.  and I can't prove publicity that i had from the very first time
a public key with the UID user at protonmail.ch, because
i never bothered with this key and therefore never stored
it as a backup on my computer.
I signed up for ProtonMail in Nov 2014 and the
public keys i have now there are created (not by me)
at a later date.
I asked also a while ago their support and the
answer from them was not convincing.

Hi Juergen,
while i no longer use Enigmail, i would try to export your secret key
with gpg --export-secret-key Juergen and then see if it imports
properly on the other side.

@_subject: key server query tool 
Hi all,
while i do respect the privacy of people, i was wondering,
since i see the public key server network as a public data
base containing full names and who signed who's public
key, if there is a tool available (source code preferably
written in Golang) which allows a user to connect to
a key server and do a query in a form that it spits out
all the data where a name or key id appears.
The idea behind this is that i can see if for example
Mallory signed someone else's public, with my key
after it got compromised and i am not aware of it.
I know that there are projects running which show
the strong set etc. but i like only see simple
data like my name or my key id/fp on someone
else's public key.

Thanks for the info, hopefully someone else can tell me if they
had only one pub key, like me, with that user@ UID. :-)
Thanks for the advise, much appreciated! Since i don't use those
keys for communications i am imho o.k. I may consider to delete
that account, because my email provider is now posteo.

Hi Wiktor,
I like again to make it clear that people don't have to be my
friends, or that third parties would know that they are my
(real) friends. ;-)
Also regarding privacy. I fully understand that people may think
that I am crazy, demanding a postal address. I see this currently
(because of lack for better suggestions) as the only valid method
for me, to do a proper verification.
Hi hope  i make now people at EFF not angry!!! The community could also run a petition, asking EFF
if they could do this as a paid service, in case they
would like to do so and have the resources...
I trust EFF 100% and they already have my postal address
because i did a small donation recently. ;-)
Best regards

When reading this document and checking out github for the Python
code, which produces .sql output, as understood, it should be no
problem to run some cron jobs etc. on a key server to provide
a searchable key sig database. And then a little Golang tool for
everybody and the job could be accomplished... ;-)

@_subject: Slightly OT - i need the proper wording for a signed document 
============================== START ==============================
Hi all,
i hope this is not to much off-topic...
I recently signed up for the new Service of Germany's
Bundesdruckerei*, to obtain a *qualified* X.509 Certificate,
which is complaint with the EU's eIDAS regulation.
Because PGP signatures are not qualified, nor the pub keys,
i thought to create a little .pdf document containing my
name and my pub key data and give this a qualified signature
and publish it on keybase. The signed document will then
also be detached signed with my current GnuPG key.
The idea behind this is that people who find my pub key on
keybase can be assured that i am the owner of the key.
My pub key bears also a sig3 from Governikus, but i can't
expect that people living outside of Germany understand what
Governikus is and how the Governikus signing procedure works.
So far so good.., since i am no native English speaker i would
like to know what the proper wording would be to put such
statement in the .pdf document and what name should i use
for this document.
Any help would be greatly appreciated!
