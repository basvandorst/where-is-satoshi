@_subject: Backup of encrypted private key on uncontrolled disks 
Hi all,
My private key is encrypted with a very strong passphrase (10 word diceware [1], not written down, 129 bits of entropy). Given that, is it safe to back it up on disks I don't control, such as a private S3 bucket or a VPS? My intuition says yes, but I've learned to never trust my intuition when it comes to security.

Hmm, I?m having a hard time imagining how someone could get me to divulge the passphrase if they couldn?t also get me to hand over the key backups I own. Of course, my imagination is not the limit here, so is there something I?m missing?
