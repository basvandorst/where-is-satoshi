@_subject: Problem with tar ball 
Hi everyone,
I have downloaded gnupg-1.2.2.tar.gz from your site. I use the HowTo document as my reference and in doing this procedure. However, when I did:
# tar xvzf gnu-1.2.2.tar.gz
I got an Archive contains obsolescent base-64 headers and invalid compressed data--crc error as well as invalid compressed data--length error which eventually exited from the process.
Does this mean that the tar that I have downloaded is corrupted or is there something that I should have done before issuing the tar command? Or should I just download the gnupg-1.2.2-1mdk91.i586.rpm instead and run the rpm command?
I use RH 9 with minimum installation. Hope to hear from anyone soon. Thanks in advance.
Best regards,

@_subject: GNUPG FOR WINDOWS WITH GUI 
Hi everyone,
Is there a gnupg that runs on windows that has a GUI functionality? I found one at the gnupg.org site but it's via command line. And I couldn't find the installation and command howto for windows. It will be too hard for ordinary windows users to use this. Any other options?
Thanks in advance.

@_subject: WinPT Current Window Problem 
Hi everyone,
I have installed winpt-install-1.0rc2 on 2 client machines both running windows, XP and 2000 Professional.
Actually, I have encountered problems on WinPT's Current Window option.
If I go to WinPT - Current Window - Sign & Encrypt or just Sign only. I get an error message - WinPT Error: Make sure that the window contains text. Could not extract data from the current window.
The window is currently active and I have no other windows open. I even go up to the extent of highlighting this whole message body and still get the same error message.
However, if I copy these to the clipboard editor, I could encrypt and sign with no problem. Did I leave some stones unturned here or do I need some additional configuration options or preferences tweaks on WinPT and GPG? Or is this normal?
Any help would be highly appreciated. Thanks in advance.
Yours sincerely,

Hi everyone,
I tried adding Hot Keys to Current Window Hot Key Management. But I am getting an error message: Could Not Register Hot Key.
I did searched WinPT's Support Page and did exactly the suggestions, but still could not register the Keys.
Encrypt: Alt + Shift + E
Decrypt/verify: Alt + Shift + D
Sign: Alt + Shift + S
Before I throw our Windows client machines to the trash.  Any ideas on this? Thanks a lot.

@_subject: Signing or Encrypting to the Full Extent... Is It All About Key 
Hash: SHA1
Hi guys,
Sorry but I am just curious. If you would notice, I
have signed this
message and it has PGP Signed - Hash:SHA1 only. How do
I make this to SHA256 or even
greater as with Mr. Atom Smasher's all signed email
When I first generated a key, I chose the default DSA
& ElGamal 1792
key. If I have generated RSA Sign and Encrypt with key
as much as
4096, would you think I would have SHA256 or unless
otherwise? In
other words, more secure and harder for others to
break? Or at least,
will take a little bit of time to?
Special thanks to Neil Williams, Atom Smasher and
Werner Koch and
others who have replied to my previous post.
Thanks a lot!

@_subject: ALL ABOUT CA'S, DIGITAL ID'S & DIGITAL SIGNATURES 
Hash: SHA1
Hi guys,
We are considering of setting up digital id's,
signatures and
encrypted emails for our small organization consisting
of users no
more than 10.
We are thinking of purchasing and registering with
verisign.com, a CA
authority but before we do that, let me ask some
questions from this
Most of the computers are windows and almost all users
use outlook as
MTA and one using netscape 7.1. We would like to send
all outgoing
email messages as digitally signed by the user in our
organization. Now, to do this it's either we signup with verisign or
any other CA?
And configure outlook to have the digital id among
other things. My
question is, can we do the same with gnupg? All I see
from the site
are frontends for windows such as winpt and other
tools for outlook
whose site is unavailable.
Is there a way in gnupg that we could create a
public/private key in
windows and enable digital id's and signature in
outlook or in
Thanks and hope to hear from anyone soon.
P.S. If you would notice that I have used WinPT for
this to sign. Is there a way for us to use outlook to
send all digitally signed email messages automatically
for our domain without going through the hassles of
winpt? Thanks.

Hi everyone,
I don't know if someone has asked this question
I was trying to compile gnupg-1.2.5.tar.gz which I
downloaded from a mirror site of gnupg.org and I got
an Error 127 result. I use Fedora Core 2 for my linux
First, I downloaded a tar-ball from a mirror site of
Then, I did # md5sum gnupg-1.2.5.tar.gz and I got an
output match.
So I proceed to compile:
# cd /usr/local/src
# tar xvzf gnupg-1.2.5.tar.gz
# ./configure
# make
# make install
And from here on, I got the error message --> Error
127, install recursive Error 1... Has this error
happened because initially, I have a gnupg
1.2.4-2.1.rpm and I have forgotten to rpm -e the old
rpm of gnupg?
Or is this because the tar-ball I downloaded is
Do you guys have any idea as to what went wrong here?
Hope to hear from you soon.

Hi folks,
I compiled successfully gnupg-1.2.5.tar.gz. I followed
the instructions on the gnupg handbook from generating
a new key pair to generating a revocation certificate
which all worked fine.
However, when I went on to the section exchanging keys
and exporting public key I could not get any
If I do the command: # gpg --list-keys, I get only pub
and sub. I don't see anything in the output:
Did I do something wrong during the compile though I
throught everything was fine? I could not find the
public key so that I could export it or copy it to my
windows machine.
Any tips would be highly appreciated. Thanks in

@_subject: Can't locate public key or pubring.gpg - followup 
Hi Atom,
Thanks for the reply.
Initially, I intend to use gnupg to encrypt and sign
or maybe just sign my emails because I wanted to make
sure that the email gets received by the intended
party as really coming from me.
But I have a lot of questions in mind since I am new
to gnupg.
For instance,
1. Can I make my keys from /home/servie logged in
root? Or shall I just logout of root and login using
ordinary account and make myself another set of keys? 2. Can I just mv ~/.gnupg to /home/servie? And log in
as user servie and be able to encrypt and sign.
3. Initially, I'd like to sign and encrypt attached
file from my linux box and scp or ssh the file from
this box to my windows machine in my small home
network so that I could send an email with this
Is there a better way to do this? I find that all
gnupg experts who has emails replied to this user
group has their email signed.
I tried a windows frontend WinPT but it is hard to use
especially with clipboard.  Is there a fast way to
sign or encrypt emails from windows? How do you
customize your email so that all outgoing emails get a
begin pgp signed message and end with the gnupg users
list below? It's really cool and nice looking. My
account is yahoo.
And final question, any tips in sending encrypting
files across the internet using gnupg on top of scp or
ssh? I just need some ideas?
Thanks a lot! Special mention also to John who also
helped out.
