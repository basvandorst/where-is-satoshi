@_subject: Question about key fingerprint 
Hash: SHA512
Usualy, gpg key checks are made comparing the fingerprint of the signing
I don't understand how the integrity of the subkey or of the informations
like name or email is protected by this way.
Is the entire GnuPG key block (including subkeys and owner informations)
signed by the master key ?
Thanks for you help,

HI Sam,
You can already use Elipric Curve Crypto wiith X.509 cryptosystems
(TLS/SSL). It's faster than RSA and use slamer keys so it make you save
bandwidth and CPU load. Try "openssl speed" to get benchmarks of the
diffrent algorithms and see by yourself.

Hash: SHA512
I just set up a mirror of the GnuPG website.
I update it automaticly every 12 hours with a cron task.
Could you add it to your mirrors list ?

I would like to know if when I send an encrypted and signed message the
signature is also encrypted or not ?
Thank you.
