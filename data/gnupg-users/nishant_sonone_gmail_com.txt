@_subject: Unable to run gpg command in JAVA 
Hello All,
I am porting an existing perl-mason code to java.
I need to create certificates for certain inputs.
The command used on perl-mason was
open(COMMAND, "echo $text | gpg --homedir $ENV{HOME}/.gnupg -s -u \"The
Certificate Key\" |");
my $enc = join('',);
my $encCert = encode_base64($encrypted);
When i tried to use the dame command in java, its not able to recognize the
input to '-u' option.
I think java is not able to interpret the spaces between the words of input
string  \"The Certificate Key\".
Can anyone help me with this?
