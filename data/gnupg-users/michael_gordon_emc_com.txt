I am trying to understand the new functionality added to release GnuPG 1.0.5 for Windows.  The release noted states "This is a binary release for Windows".  What does this statement mean?

I can't find the word "Windows" in the NEWS entry for GnuPG 1.0.5 nor in the release annoucement for it (from April 2001).  Same for libksba
1.0.5 (from 2009).
What are you referring to?

So the entry is unknown, correct?

I forgot about this.  The page needs some work.
