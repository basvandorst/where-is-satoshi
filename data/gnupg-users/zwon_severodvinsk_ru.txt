Yes, I mean new GnuPG PKA feature. I'm translate manual to russian and
have found this term in cvs version. What is this? I don't see relation
between authentication and trust model, while. Maybe Werner or David
explain this new feature?

Thanks! Now the things much clearer. Can somebody point me to RFC or
IETF draft (or other info) about this special DNS recodrds?

Seems nothing with DNSSEC.
IIRC, after looking into util/pka.c, this searches in DNS TXT RR of form
fpr - key fingerprint
uri - key location
If email is alice then RR name alice._pka.example.com
Am I right?
Where I can find specs?

@_subject: New to GPG 
this is not good idea
 --export is export only public key. for decryption you need secret.
 use --export-secret-keys
better use floppy

@_subject: This IS about GD - a proposal on dealing with the problem 
I think this is public more keyservers design problem than GD. Keyserver
should accept new signatures only from key owner.

@_subject: This IS about GD - a proposal on dealing with the problem 
I mean only key signatures, not revokations
what if key's owner don't want it?

You must install libgpg-error. But I'm not sure if gpgme can
be compiled in the mingw at all.

Try ettercap ( ;)
It allows you easily sniff traffic in the switched LAN.
