Hi all,
after creating a new key and getting back into 'serious' gpg usage,
I attended a key signing party where the overwhelming portion of
people had only one form of ID with them.
It seems that most people assign the highest trust level to others
who have presented only one form of ID. Personally, I tend towards
only granting that to people who showed me two seperate pieces
of ID.
I know I am free to do whatever I want, but I am looking for
feedback and, perhaps, consensus from the community.
Best regards,

Living in the EU, the only forms of ID I got to see were government-issued.
Of course, not all of them are officially an ID card, like the German dirver's
licence, but a German driver's licence has more security features than a
few passports I have seen.
I noted which IDs are of the laminated, bazillion-checks kind of type and
which were mere paper. Of the two paper IDs, one was an old German
passport of a person I have known for quite some time, the other was
a German passport for children under 16. I know and remeber these, but
while I will sign the first, I did not yet decide on the second.
Of course, I did not have a full list of reference ID cards for all major
countries with me, but I _did_ try and remember if a Greek passport from
guy one matches the Greek passport of gal two.
I would never sign anyone with only a university ID unless I knew them for

Good point, I will ask & note that in my signature, in the future.

Yes and no. While a web of trust may look just like a huge interconnected
graph, it actually is a directed graph and the only root node you care about
is your own. So while it is true that you can't do too much about a guy who
is ten hops away from you, you can try and make connections to nodes
near to you as good and detailed as possible.

5.2.3.13. and 5.2.3.20. of RFC 4880 look very promising. Even if no
one else cares about them, I will probably try and implement them.
While that is a problem, you can do your best to make the local
situation the best you can possibly make it.

It is not (all) about the authority who issued it. Two are harder to forge
than one (unless you have direct access within the authority, of course).
Basically, the only thing I would accept is state-issued unless I know
that there is an actual replacement system in a specific country that
is _better_. If in doubt, don't sign.

That is probably a good idea, yes. Will need to ponder.

The basic assumption is that a key signing is good and that you actually
gain something from it. If the other guy were to start copying my ID, he
would not get far.
In some countries, you simply have to carry it on you, end of story. You
might as well enjoy the few benefits.
In the US, they are just using credit cards and the ability to block money
on your account for their own use in stead of ID. This is basically an ID
with electronic traceability (people _know_ you were in X, renting a car.
And they can look it all up in a central location).
I would like you to do that as well. Please keep that out of what others
_try_ to make at good as possible.
While living in a perfect world is, of course, perfect (for exactly one
person) I would rather try and change what I can and until such a
point, do the things that I can do to make the best of actual reality.
I just hope those people stay as far away from my personal nodes
as possible.
WIth a name of Brian Smith, this is easily feasible..
This will give you only identities of people who look like you, which is
also possible in the real world. The only thing you are proving is the
need for better ID for the sake of 'added security'. Gee, thanks ;)
I doubt you include the unique message ID of this mail in your key. Else,
this is just a snug comment with no actual warning value to anyone.

You are not challengging the assumption, you are attacking the
implementation :)
For some things, you simply need to establish identity. As
soon as you leave the 'I have known you since birth and you
are tightly knit into my social circle' regions, doing some
things, especially ones involving large amounts of money,
is simply not feasible.
You can challenge that assumption by giving me your car,
house & bank accounts. Unless you never go far from your
birthplace, or progress very slowly in one direction, you
simply need to be able to establish ID. Or you can do the
US thing of just taking a pile of [electronic] cash into
There are three forms of ID:
a) 'This is the same person I have had contact with before.'
   This can be done via an unsigned key or facial recognition.
b) 'This person is known to someone I [have to] trust.'
   Web of trust, government-issued ID, alias-based eID
c) 'I know this person to be X.'
   You have known them for a very long time, preferably since
   their birth.
As GPG WoT aims to stay in the realm of b), it is, quite literally,
impossible to establish anything of use with a). Note that there
are schemes that involve GPG and a), but they can not reliably
establish identity, only authenticy.
If your full DNA print is being taken at birth, you are implanted with a
chip immediately & you are under close, automated surveillance for
all your life, this would be the complete solution and 'help', yes.
If I had any reasonable doubt as to the validity of someone's ID
or if they match the identity on the ID, I would say so, yes. If you
are concerned about the social implications, tell them you will
sign it and then don't. Chances are that in such a scenario, you
will not meet the other person again, anyway.
