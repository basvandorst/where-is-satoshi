@_subject: pocket gnupg anywhere? 
On GPG's homepage, there is a link to a PocketConsole based version, which
can run on Windows Mobile platform-based PDA's. (
 ) By
the way, this page doesn't exist anymore. Are there anybody who can help me,
and post a link to a working WinMobile version (or mail me directly that
software) ?
