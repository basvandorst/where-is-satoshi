Hash: SHA1
It doesn't have too much science (wonder if that's legal in English).
Depth is how far from the trust source the analysis is. For example, depth 0
applies to ultimately trusted keys, which are the primary sources of trust
in gpg. Depth one applies to keys signed by ultimately trusted, depth two by
those signed by depth 1, etc. Actually, this is a bit of a simplification,
but you get the idea.
The other kind of cryptic bit goes like this:
This is a summary of the trust (not validity) levels assigned. In this
particular case:
Ultimate trust 1, full trust 0, marginal trust 0, "no trust" 0, don't know
trust 0, uncalculated (IIRC the - means that) trust 0.
Note that this is quite necessary filled with zeroes except for the last
digit, since depth zero implies ultimate trust. From here, you can work it
out, I hope.
BTW, I haven't found this on the fine manual or on the fine source but just
used my powers of induction which are quite fallible, so maybe I have
misinterpreted the data.

Hash: SHA1
I'm not entirely certain about this, since I've given up on HushMail due to
the amount of trouble it causes me to use. Basically, one reason why the
keys might not be found is because IIRC HushMail does NOT follow the OpenPGP
standard (or at least good manners) when creating user IDs and does NOT
place the e-mail address in the e-mail field of the UID between angle
brackets. OTOH, I might be entirely off track and it may be a
misconfiguration issue, but if you try on the command-line to encrypt to the
addresses and they work, that's probably the case. I don't know if you can
convince Enigmail to get rid of the angle rackets in the invocation, or to
use key IDs instead (good idea anyway).
You can revoke a key by issuing and subsequently importing a revocation
certificate for such key like this:
gpg -o revoke.txt --gen-revoke KEYID
and follow the prompts which are simple enough. After which
gpg --import revoke.txt
is in order, after which you should re-distribute your key (through e-mail,
keyservers or whatever means appropriate).
You cannot, AFAIK, at present, delete a key from a keyserver, but revoking
it should make clear that it's not to be used.

This is the most often encountered reaction to digital signatures I get from
my friends, some of which are quite computer-literate yet not willing to go
through the trouble of encrypting and signing e-mail. Simply, I think it's
time to admit people in general don't care whether an obscure sysadmin
somewhere can read their mail. Most people sign acceptable use policies that
give sysadmins powers to monitor all of their traffic, and yet it is also
true that most often sysadmins seemt to be either honest or careful. The
OpenPGP threat model is not appropriate for most people, and expecting to
make people fit into it is not very productive. I used to think along the
same lines, but now I just think it's useless to try to convince people to
use crypto. Today's interfaces (gpgrelay for example) are incredibly easy to
use, and their is PGP which AFAIK has a polished UI. I don't think it's a
question of UI any more, I think it's a question of needs and threat models.
If you don't need something and it carries a cost you're not likely to use
it. Perhaps the only way to get people to use encryption is to have a
so-called "zero-UI solution" but even so, unless it would come incorporated
in the MUA, I don't see people bothering to install it.

Well, a couple of things here. 1) we're mostly agreeing here about the fact
that encryption is unlikely to be widely used unless it comes by default. 2)
you claim it's not about needs and threat models, but essentially about
lazyness and ignorance. 3) I claim that if users don't value their privacy
(which is IMO the reason why they don't use crypto) is not because they're
lazy or they don't know better or the software is hard to set up, but simply
they have different values and they aren't terribly bothered by writing
e-mail in the clear. Just annecdotally, most of my friends know what the
Internet is, but not AOL. I guess that might have to do with market
penetration of AOL in my country.
Which means they have no threat model.
With this, you further prove my point that the users' "by default" threat
model is the cause. Users don't care about privacy thus they don't use
crypto. That was my point in the first place. OTOH, S/MIME crypto under OE
doesn't seem very easy to set up to me, since you have to get a certificate,
but I wouldn't know since I use OpenPGP anyway.
100% agree with you. As I said, the only way to see widespread use of crypto
is if it would be included by default in the default MUA, which isn't
happenning any time soon, if ever.

In such a case the DLL or .so or whatever MUST be GPL-compatible (GPL or
less restrictive) per the meaning of FSF in order to be GPL-linkable, or be
covered by the "standard OS component" exception.
If a library runs on a shared addressable space, FSF (which is GnuPG's
Copyright holder, I assume?) considers the combined result a derived work in
the meaning of copyright law. This is the whole point of the LGPL, to have a
licence that allows linking libraries into non-free software, but which
ensures distribution of the library will always be on free terms and so on.
You are wrong. The GPL does not talk of standards in the meaning you
propose. If a work links to a shared library and invokes its functions it is
making use of the library in a manner similar to copying pages from another
book into your own book. This process creates a derived work of the library.
Whether the library implements a patent-protected standard, a Trade Secret
or an open, non-patent-encumbered standard is for the purposes of the
linking issue, irrelevant. Linking creates derivation.
The difference is that when I write onto a socket to talk to an HTTP server
I do not copy its code onto my memory segment, I am making use of the server
but not copying anything from its internals, which is why HTTP does not lead
to a derived work being created. Whereas when I link in a library I copy its
code onto my memory segment, and I invoke its functions in a manner
equivalent to writing those functions onto my own code, which makes a
derived work.

First, I might have written to you directly instead of to the list. If so
I'm sorry, I screwed up with my mail agent.
This is really, really wrong. Just because a piece of hardware is
proprietary it needs not have proprietary drivers. There are plenty of free
drivers for hardware in the Linux kernel, for example, thanks to either
reverse engineering or to companies who make the hardware being smart (and
doing the write thing) and releasing the necessary specifications of the
hardware so that a free driver is possible. In addition, with ever-cheaper
FPGAs and so on, hardware and software might converge quite a lot (a lot of
hardware these days is more written (VHDL or VeriLog code) than designed).
But this is a bit OT. The fact is that, even though I mostly agree with you
that it is a hard fight to convince smart card manufacturers to provide ISO
compliance or specs for their cards and that using PKCS would make GnuPG
more capable this does not matter, because the things you're able to express
with a licence are limited, and GPL is written as it is. So nothing there is
to be done.
There are a few more.
This already happens today to an extent. Winmodems, winprinters. Fortunately
there are pervasive reverse engineering efforts together with pressure to
manufacturers to yield specs.
Again, this happens today. See proprietary nVidia drivers (which probably
violate the GPL).
4. Hardware manufacturing companies will follow standards about smart cards
like the cited ISO standard.
5. Hardware manufacturing companies will provide specifications that will
allow the creation of free drivers.
Options 4 and 5 are much preferable to option 0 (GnuPG implements PKCS
and people use non-free drivers) and not implementing PKCS might put some
optimizing pressure in this direction.
