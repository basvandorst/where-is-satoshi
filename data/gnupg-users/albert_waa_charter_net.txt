@_subject: Problem with migration from 1.2.4 to 2.0.9 
this might be related to some changes they made in the keys a while
back.... I think PGP V6 used one key for both signing and encrypting but
if you look at the keys now you see each key has a sub-key as well....
one used for signing and the other for encryption.
so i don't see how you can bring the old style key forward if i'm right
about the change
I just junked the keyring from PGP658WIN ( the old MIT version ) .  actually I kinda like the idea of using separate encryption and signing
keys, but too: we should all consider how we will implement our policy
on expiration dates. when my key expires I will generate a new one and
upload it to the keyserver. hopefully the keyserver will be smart enough
to understand that I need to supersede my key and not give mu a bunch of
'duplicate record' crap.  if it gives any trouble in this regard oh
well: it just ain't ready for use yet.

Is PGP/ENIGMAIL compatible with folks using Outlook or Microsoft Mail
with PGP Desktop?
I've tried searching for this but no luck,-- :-(

@_subject: 2.0.17 
we are supposed to be on 2.0.17
if the user sent data and didn't click the PGP/MIME option this could be
if you don't have the key for the sender this will be trouble
check in Kleo/config, make sure you have the right keyserver.  i think
it should be
    hkp://keys.gnupg.net
if you had a virus in your 'puter "the results can be unpredictable". Try Malwarebytes on it; I've had some luck with that
