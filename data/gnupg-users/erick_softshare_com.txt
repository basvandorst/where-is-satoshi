@_subject: License for gnupg or gpgme 
Hello all,
I'm sorry to ask a question that has probably already been answered here before, but I couldn't find the answer in the FAQ or in quick search of the lists from  Is gpgme using the LGPL (or the GPL)? The reason I ask is because I work for a company that sells commercial software, and we are looking at possibly using gnupg via gpgme to support OpenPGP in our product. Before I get very far on figuring out if we'll be able to use it though I wanted to find out if it was even possible/allowable to use it in a commercial context. It seems much more desirable a library than the commercially available ones I've been able to find not just because of its cost, but largely because being open source, there is a chance to look at the source and find (and report) bugs myself (rather than waiting months or years for a fix from the vendor).
Anyway, thanks for your time.
P.S. If you could CC me on the answer I would appreciate it. I've not yet subscribed to the various lists for gnupg.
