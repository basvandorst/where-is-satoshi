@_subject: recording and retrieving "secrets" into gpg files 
Hi Stephan
The "Bash scripting" material, which I began reading, gave me some
valuable informations and I will go on reading it.
On the other hand, I did not understand the aim of the material
concerning bash for gpg, as it deals with issues which I am quite
unaware of. Maybe, when I get more confident in gpg concepts, will I
understand its purpose.
In fact, I wish to record "secrets" in gnome-keyrings, as seahorse does,
and I am looking for tutorials which explain how to do so with bash
scripts, which are the only "programs" I am able to write.

Hi Damien
It's exactly what I was looking for.
Thank you a lot.

Thank's, Bernhard, to taking time to reply to my post.
Asymmetric encryption requires the recipients to use my public key to
get access the documents, whereas symmetric encryption only requires
them to key in the encryption key. Obviously the recipients who are not
confident enough with using asymmetric encryption won't be able to
verify the authentity of the documents, but this a least drawback.
However, if I can't sign and encrypt in a single step, I'll sign and
then symmetrically encrypt the signed document, or the other way around.
I forgot to write that I want the process (sign and encrypt) to procede
without any keyboard-typing.

Hi Bernhard
I eventually changed my mind as I have'nt found out how to extract the
source document from a signed one.
So I decided to procede with detached signatures applied, as you
suggest, on the source documents and not on the crypted ones.
Regarding asymmetric versus symmetric cryptography, I stick with the
latter one, which allows me to crypt a document only once with a single
key, a "document-key", and either transfert the asymmetrically crypted
document-key to recipients whom I know their public keys, or its
symmetrically crypted value with a permanent password specific to each
of the others recipients I share their passwords with. I don't know yet
how to share and manage these passwords.
I finally download on the public server an archive containing the
document-key symmetrically-crypted document, the clear document
signature and the bunch of asymmetrically or symmetrically crypted
document-keys, and send messages, "release notifications", to inform the
recipients a new document has been released on the server.
I'm still wondering how each of them will know the specific file they
have to uncrypted to get the document-key. That is, I haven't yet
figured out whether or not to keep the list of recipient secret. I can
obviously consider to provide the information in the
release-notification e-mail, but I don't know if e-mail clients can
handle symmetrically crypted messages.
Thank's again for your help.

Seahorse (distributed within Ubuntu) allows for the storing and retrieving of "secrets", as passwords, into what I understand to be gpg keyrings, or at the least, files.
Y've been through pgp's manpage and several tutorials without finding any clue as how to record those
secrets and get them back at a later time.
Thanks to anybody who will inform me on the commands to be used, or direct me to a tutorial containing such informations ?

Thank you Andrew.
In the material I've been ready lately, all examples are written in a
programming language and I only have abilities in bash scripting.
Can somebody, please, direct me toward a url where they provide bash
scripting examples.
