Unfortunately, this fails to build on Solaris 2.8. Here's what I get:
if gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I.. -I.. -I../include  -I/usr/include  -g -O2 -Wall -MT mpih-mul3.o -MD -MP -MF ".deps/mpih-mul3.Tpo" \
  -c -o mpih-mul3.o `test -f 'mpih-mul3.c' || echo './'`mpih-mul3.c; \
then mv -f ".deps/mpih-mul3.Tpo" ".deps/mpih-mul3.Po"; \
else rm -f ".deps/mpih-mul3.Tpo"; exit 1; \
gcc -E -I.. -I../include -DHAVE_CONFIG_H mpih-add1.S | grep -v '^ > gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I.. -I.. -I../include  -I/usr/include  -g -O2 -Wall -c _mpih-add1.s

        Same error repeats until line 198. I avoided 1.2.5 on Solaris due to the install issue, but I just tried this, and the same happened. 1.2.4 compiled cleanly.

My mistake here. apparently one of my other admins upgraded the box. We're on Solaris 2.9 now. Here's what I get from fpversion(1):
pioneer% fpversion
 A SPARC-based CPU is available.
 Kernel says CPU's clock rate is 500.0 MHz.
 Kernel says main memory's clock rate is 100.0 MHz.
 Sun-4 floating-point controller version 0 found.
 An UltraSPARC chip is available.
 Use "-xtarget=ultra2e -xcache=16/32/1:256/64/1" code-generation option.

@_subject: Solaris 2.9 and 1.2.6 (was Re: GnuPG 1.2.6 released) 
That, it doesn't. I just gave it a build and got the same error. The version of GnuPG I'm using on there is 1.2.4, but was compiled on Solaris 2.8 before the box was upgraded. This isn't my primary box, so it isn't much of a showstopper for me. But I thought I'd just bring it to everyone's attention. But for anyone using GnuPG on Solaris 2.9, they might need this.

@_subject: Werner's key expired? Re: [Announce] GnuPG 1.3.5 released 
Okay.. just grabbed this down on both my linux box (2.4.25) and Sun E4500 (Solaris 2.8) and went to verify the distribution. I got the following:
pioneer% gpg gnupg-1.3.5.tar.bz2.sig
gpg: WARNING: using insecure memory!
gpg: please see  for more information
gpg: Signature made Thu Feb 26 10:16:17 2004 PST using DSA key ID 57548DCD
gpg: Good signature from "Werner Koch (gnupg sig) "
gpg: Note: This key has expired!
Primary key fingerprint: 6BD9 050F D8FC 941B 4341  2DCC 68B7 AB89 5754 8DCD
        While the dist is good, does Werner have a new key available?
                                                        BL.
