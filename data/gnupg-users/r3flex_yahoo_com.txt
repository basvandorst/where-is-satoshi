@_subject: [GPG] One user ID with multiple keypairs question 
Is is possible to have multiple keypairs using the same user ID with GPG?  If it
is possible, how does one differentiate between the different keypairs when (for
example) exporting (or editing) a specific keypair, or decrypting a message that
was originally encrypted using a public key from one of the keypairs with the
same user ID?

Thanks for the quick replies, Werner Koch and Brian Galbraith.
Just one last question.. How do I find out what a key's ID is?
Thanks again,

@_subject: New Stable version of XFMail 
Brian, I downloaded xfmail from the link you provided, but the installation fails.. With the debian package, I managed to install it manually, but it complained that it was missing a file called "libdb.so.3".
The system I tried this on is currently running SuSE 6.1, w/ kernel 2.2.11, and if I recall correctly, it is a glibc2 based distribution of linux.  I also tried the SuSE specific package of xfmail, which gave me the following errors:
Any thoughts on how to resolve this?

@_subject: GPG worked yesterday, now it doesn't work at all.. 
Think I may have done something foolish, but for the life of me I can't seem to put my finger on it..
Yesterday, GPG worked fine with decrypting a test encrypted message.
After a few reboots later (deliberate, the OS didn't crash), now I can't seem to decrypt the test message anymore, and I'm stumped as to why..
Here's the GPG warning messages:
I had no problems decrypting this test message yesterday.. though I have a feeling that I'm just missing some obvious first step that has to be done before decrypting messages.  Ideas, anyone?

@_subject: md5sum verification of gpg 
I've searched through gnupg's site, and I still
haven't found the official checksum that corresponds
to the gpg-1.0.0 version that I downloaded, and I
don't have an earlier trusted version of gpg to verify
the gpg signatures that came with it.. Am I screwed,
or have I just missed the obvious??
Any help would be appreciated!

Thanks!  It's a perfect match.. though it would be nice would if some other people verifed the sum... (hint, hint) ;-)
