@_subject: storing keyrings into SQL database? 
Hi there!
I would like to store keyrings into SQL database. Is this doable?
Would be hard to code such gpg hack ?
Any directions, etc?

i would like to write horde imp (free webmail) extension which would support
gpg for encrypting messages.
I know, i can create directory for each user on webmail server and then call
gpg binary using different env settings, but this logic will break up if imp
would run on multiple servers simultanely without shared FS.
It would be much easier to implement such thing using SQL database.
Too bad.
Any ideas how to implement such thing?

Uf. This is ugly and possibly unsecure, but it's doable.
