I don't know what rfc1991 actually does and I don't use it.
The manpage says: "Try to be more RFC1991 (PGP 2.x) compliant." I also have digest-algo sha1	# gpg will otherwise use RIPE-MD-160
and, though you don't appear to have key problems
s2k-cipher-algo cast5	# gpg default for this is BLOWFISH
s2k-digest-algo sha1    # default RIPE-MD-160
There have also been some No Callback discussions on pgp-users; unresolved
AFAIK. Make sure it is not actually a problem with the plugin or the mail
client on the Windows side. Are you using PGP/MIME? Try without.

Thats what I get:
gpg: encrypted with ELG-E key, ID 76C3AFBB
gpg: no secret key for decryption available
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
So for me it's ok. Make sure your client progs are configured properly and you don't introduce some
unwanted whitespace, linebreak characters, or whatever.

[snip] I have also seen this. The culprit seems to be the pks-type keyserver.
Currently no solution, AFAIK. You might want to use the NAI keyservers until this is resolved.
My current assessment is that the pks is stripping off "subkey binding
signatures", leaving the key in a crippled state.
I believe it only happens when adding a new key, adding a subkey to an
existing key appears to fail entirely. If people can download your key
they must furthermore be using pgp, because gpg does not import such a
key. I have also tried to use a broken key for encryption in pgp, but it
did not work.
Has somebody successfully encrypted mail to you using your freshly downloaded key?

You have to examine the key *returned* from the keyserver. Gpg will not
import such a key, but you can download and then export it with pgp or
cut & paste it from the web interface.
You will see something like this (two subkeys and only one binding signature):

This of course depends on the policy. IMHO 2 years is a reasonable
lifetime for a key that gets used. But if this default expiration is
mainly intended to prevent screwed up keys to linger around forever, I
would recommend to make it rather short and advise users to change it when
they are positive their key is the way they want it.
On second thought though, not. This just would add *another* thing to
think about in the already complex process of keyhandling.

Here is what the RFC says:

5.2.4.1. Subpacket Hints
   ...
   It is certainly possible for a signature to contain conflicting
   information in subpackets. For example, a signature may contain
   multiple copies of a preference or multiple expiration times. In
   most cases, an implementation SHOULD use the last subpacket in the
   signature, but MAY use any conflict resolution scheme that makes
   more sense. Please note that we are intentionally leaving conflict
   resolution to the implementer; most conflicts are simply syntax
   errors, and the wishy-washy language here allows a receiver to be
   generous in what they accept, while putting pressure on a creator to
   be stingy in what they generate.

@_subject: Expired keys/sigs untrusted? (longish) 
I seem to not get it at all!
To play around with trust propagation I created three users - Alice,
Carol, and Donna - each of which got their own OpenPGP key pair created
with GnuPG 1.0.4. - Alice receives Carol's public key from Carol, signs it, and marks it
  as fully trusted.
- Donna receives Alice's public key from Alice and signs it.
- Carol receives Donna's public key from Donna and signs it.
- Alice receives Donna's public key from Carol (with Carol's signature).
As a result, Alice and Donna can communicate securely as Donna's public
key is certified by Carol's key (which Alice fully trusts).
- Carol's key will expire in the near future so she creates a new key,
  signs it with her old key, and distributes it to Alice.
- Alice takes no extra steps, as Carol's new key is certified by Carols's
  old key (which Alice had originally signed and still fully trusts).
Alice and Donna can still communicate securely (of course).
- Carol's old key expires. -> BANG!
In Alice's keyring/trustdb Carol's old key goes to 'e' and as a result (?) Carol's new key - and Donna's key - go to 'q'.
No more trust! Alice can no longer securely communicate with neither Carol
nor Donna.
What am I missing? I have found in the PGP documentation that expired
keys can still be used for signature verification and decryption. I have
asked on this list a couple of months ago, how to retain trust in case of
key expiration, and was advised to make a new key and sign it with the
soon-to-expire key. I believe this is exactly what I did in this
scenario. Still - no cigar.
Alice, BEFORE Carol's old key expired:
alice$ gpg --list-sigs --with-colons

Carol, and Donna - each of which got their own OpenPGP key pair created
with GnuPG 1.0.4. - Alice receives Carol's public key from Carol, signs it, and marks it
  as fully trusted.
- Donna receives Alice's public key from Alice and signs it.
- Carol receives Donna's public key from Donna and signs it.
- Alice receives Donna's public key from Carol (with Carol's signature).
As a result, Alice and Donna can communicate securely as Donna's public
key is certified by Carol's key (which Alice fully trusts).
- Carol's key will expire in the near future so she creates a new key,
  signs it with her old key, and distributes it to Alice.
- Alice takes no extra steps, as Carol's new key is certified by Carols's
  old key (which Alice had originally signed and still fully trusts).
Alice and Donna can still communicate securely (of course).
- Carol's old key expires. -> BANG!
In Alice's keyring/trustdb Carol's old key goes to 'e' and as a result (?) Carol's new key - and Donna's key - go to 'q'.
No more trust! Alice can no longer securely communicate with neither Carol
nor Donna.
What am I missing? I have found in the PGP documentation that expired
keys can still be used for signature verification and decryption. I have
asked on this list a couple of months ago, how to retain trust in case of
key expiration, and was advised to make a new key and sign it with the
soon-to-expire key. I believe this is exactly what I did in this
scenario. Still - no cigar.
Alice, BEFORE Carol's old key expired:
alice$ gpg --list-sigs --with-colons
gpg: key A9CF22EF.64: expired at Mon Oct 23 19:03:47 2000 CEST
gpg: NOTE: signature key expired Mon Oct 23 19:03:47 2000 CEST
gpg: NOTE: signature key expired Mon Oct 23 19:03:47 2000 CEST
Please enlighten me

This has nothing to do with PGP 6.8.5 other than IIRC it defaults to
"encrypt to self". The message means that the above file is not only
encrypted to you, but also to Veritas, and, for obvious reasons, you do
not have Veritas' secret key in your keyring. This is good, no reason to

I am pleased to announce the availability of the PGPdump Interface, a web-interface to pgpdump, the PGP packet visualizer by Kazu Yamamoto.
The reason I wasted my weekend is the large number of questions regarding the exact contents of PGP key blocks (algorithm preferences, expiration dates, subkeys, ...).
While tools like pgpdump are available, the PGPdump Interface is intended for those who are not inclined to work at the (Un*x) commandline level.
Please visit the PGPdump Interface at

Take your key to for a more verbose packet listing than gpg
will give you. Furthermore, there is AFAIK no
way to change the preferred sym algs in gpg
short of modifying the source.

After upgrading to perl 5.6.0 I found that pgpenvelope
takes approx 7 seconds to display the first prompt/message.
This is especially annoying when automatically verifying signed messages. Reading security related mailing lists becomes a real PITA. I am not familiar enough with perl to be able to tell why the slowdown
occurred. It sure was a lot snappier with earlier versions (perl5).
I am running perl 5.6.0 / pgpenvelope 2.9.0 / pine 4.31 on a 200Mhz PII
Debian box.
Any hints appreciated,

The version line says nothing about the key or the certificate!
It just tells you which software generated the ASCII-armored

This is very likely due to the PGP/MIME implementation of the
Windoze MUA. Try clearsigning your message to test the key material.

Set your "Preferred algorithm" to CAST and create a DH/DSS (= DSA/ElGamal) key pair.
The cipher will be selected automatically according to the preferences of the public key.
To make sure things interact smoothly with 6.x, you might want to add this to your ~/.gnupg/options file:
compress-algo 1
digest-algo sha1
cipher-algo cast5
And, if you want to be able to move gpg created keys to pgp 6.x:
s2k-digest-algo sha1
s2k-cipher-algo cast5

I take it you did not forget to check "Include Private Key(s)" when
exporting your key pair from Windoze PGP?
gpg --import < mykeyfile.asc
does it for me.
Just export and publish your public key.
gpg --export --armor mykeyid > mykeyfile.asc

@_subject: gpg: NOTE: cipher algorithm 9 not found in preferences 
This means something like:
a) You have selected RIJNDAEL256 (sym 9) as your symmetric alg
b) The key you have been encrypting to is not offering this    algorithm in its preferred sym alg subpacket.    If you type gpg --list-packets thekeyfile.asc you might see:       ...
      hashed subpkt 11 len 5 (pref-sym-algos: 7 10 3 4)
      ...
   Which means: RIJNDAEL128, Twofish, CAST5, Blowfish
c) GnuPG has used sym alg 9 for encryption (as told) and gives the
   mentioned notice when decrypting.
d) There should be no need to specify a sym alg in normal operation
   as it will automatically be selected form the key preferences.
Things work better when plugged in.

GnuPG will create a "Symmetrically Encrypted and MDC Packet(tag 18)" for the IV16 algos (AES*, TWOFISH). Could it be that your friend's PGP version does not support this packet type?
Try the --openpgp option to suppress MDC generation
