Hello all,
I would apprecaite if someone could tell me if there's any docs about
using GPGME APIs, and where could I find it.

Hello, Werner,
just one other quick question; are you planning to build a Windows
version of the GPGME?

@_subject: Gpgme Error : Invalid Engine 
Hello all,
I have problems using GPGME on RedHat 6.2. The function call
returns error Invalid Engine.
I have compiled the same source code on Solaris 7, and everything is
working fine. But, on RedHat, I can't use it because it can pass this
error. The versions of GPG is:
- output of gpgme_get_engine_info()
- output of  'gpg --version':
gpg (GnuPG) 1.0.4

@_subject: Can't import keys -- link() failed 
I was following this discussion, which I'm very interested in. I guess,
I was also trying to do a similar thing as Sam, to use floppies as some
kind of smart cards for the users' keys (public and private). To be
perfectly clear, I'm programming a simple user interface for
encryption/decryption using GPGME APIs, and all of my keys are on floppy
disk. I was testing this on different platforms, and came to this
conclusion so far:
- on Solaris, you just need to set up the GNUPGHOME variable to point to
the floppy, and there's no need for the option that Werner said.
- on Linux (which I'm pretty sure Sam is working on), that's not
possible, for the reason Werner pointed out. I didn't know about the
--lock-never option, I'll try that later on.
- on Windows... no idea, and therefor I'm getting involved here. I'm
trying to set the GNUPGHOME to point at the floppy (a:), but it's
ignoring me, and always goes to the c:\gnupg. I've tried to set the
variable in different ways, and no success. So, how can I set up my
enviroment on Windows to change the default keyrings directory?

@_subject: GNUPGHOME on Win2000 
Hello all,
since I'm quite unexperienced working on Windows (beside typing in word
and openning explorer :-) ), I would appreciate if someone out there has
some information about setting up the enviroment for GPG on Windows.
What I'm interested in is how can I change my default directory for the
keyrings. I've tried changing GNUPGHOME variable, but it's completely
ignoring me, no metter I do, it constantly looks at the c:/gnupg
directory. If I use --homedir option in the command line, it works fine,
but I would like if I could make it work automatically, like it works
perfectly on UNIX with GNUPGHOME variable.
I'm working on Win 2000, and the version of GNU PG is:
gpg (GnuPG) 1.0.4g-winpt

@_subject: GnuPG ME 
just to add a small comment to this: I completely agree with Werner, I've
been working with GPGME on different platforms, and most recently with
Windoze. I've used this aproach: by compiling GPGME to static library,
I'm making my programs as DLLs by staticly linking it to the GPGME
library. I use Cygwin compiler on Windoze, and it works surprisingly
well, considering Windoze overall. DLLs aren't that big, and they are
perfectly stable, since they rely on Cygwin's DLLs.

@_subject: Java interface for GnuPG 
Hello, Ganesh,
my work has been based on very similar thing. I'm using signed applets to
access native methods written to encrypt/decrypt data. For that purpose
I've used GPGME API's, compiled them on several platforms, and written
couple of functions that use those APIs and GnuPG on the system. So far my
experience with this has been pretty good, especially on Win32(!)
platform, since Java Plugin has shown better results on Windoze and
Explorer that UNIX and Netscape.
So, I would definitively recommend taking a look at GPGME on

@_subject: GPGME for WIndows 
Hello again,
I'm having (again) some difficulties with GPGME. After copying libgpgme.a
and gpgme.h files in the Cygwin distribution, I tried to compile my test
programs on Windows which are working well on Solaris. The compilation
goes ok, which means that it's able to find gpgme.h, but linking fails.
The linker complains about undefined references to:
Does anything else needs to be copied on Windows? I've installed cygwin
in the c:\cygwin (default), and placed gpgme.h in the
and the libgpgme.a in the
I've tried a workaround. Since I have set up a cross-complier on Solaris,
and it's able to compile and link the test programs in the
GPGME distribution, I've tried to compile and link my examples on
Solaris. Everything goes ok, and the binaries works ok, so I can manage
for the time beeing working like this.
Sorry if I'm a bit boring with all my questions, but my knowledge about
Windows is rather simple, and the project requires me to build the
application on Windows.
Thanks all,
    Miroslav

@_subject: Verifying keys 
Hello all,
does anyone know is it possible, and if so, how can I found out who has
signed a public key of a person without importing it into my pubring? I
mean, when I download a pubkey somewhere from the net, is there a way
that I can check the signatures on that public key without importing it
to the pubring?
I don't know wheter this is a FAQ, I've browsed through my
documentation, and didn't find an answer.
Thanks in advance,
    Miroslav

Hello, Michael,
I'm developing a very similar thing, and I'm using GPG Made Easy API's. You can
find more unfo about it on:
It is all written in C, and it possible to build it for Windows, by compiling
it with a cross compileron UNIX. The result is a static library, which works on
top of GnuPG, and you then use it in compilation of programs. It is all still
in the development phases, but I have no problems with it, it works great.
