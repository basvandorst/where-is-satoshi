@_subject: GnuPG 1.2.0 Make problem 
I'm am an MVS Systems Programmer attempting to install GnuPG 1.2.0 on the OMVS (IBM mainframe UNIX) platform.  I am a VERY novice sysadmin and am looking for help with a problem.   I am doing a 'make' and receive the following messages:
Making all in po                                   make: Error -- FSUM9415 Don't know how to make all FSUM8226 make: Error code 1                        FSUM8226 make: Error code 255     Any ideas?
Thanks, Steve

steve.weaver [01/11/2002]:
Maybe you need the GNU 'make' program, instead of whatever 'make' is
installed by default under OMVS.
I tried that, with the same results.

@_subject: GnuPG Make Install problem 
There is a problem with --disable-nls in the current
gettext/automake/autoconf.  A workaround is touch po/all
(i.e. create a file name "all" in the po directory)

Excellent.  Thanks, that got me past that problem. I also realized that I 'lied' on my first post, I'm actually working with GnuPG 1.0.7 at this point.  I'm now on to the 'make install' and I'm getting the following...
Making install in po                                   make: Error -- FSUM9415 Don't know how to make install FSUM8226 make: Error code 1                            Making install in po                                  make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/GnuPG/po'           make[1]: *** No rule to make target `install'.  Stop. make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/GnuPG/po'            make: *** [install-recursive] Error 1

@_subject: GnuPG 1.2.1 OMVS problem 
I'm an MVS Systems Programmer attempting to install and use GnuPG 1.2.1 on the OMVS (IBM mainframe UNIX) platform.  I am a VERY novice sysadmin and am looking for help with a problem. The configure, make, and make install seems to go okay, but when I run gpg all I get are the following messages:
gpg: can't open /dev/zero: EDC5129I No such file or directory.                  gpg: can't mmap pool of 16384 bytes: EDC5129I No such file or directory. - using malloc                                                                         gpg: Please note that you don't have secure memory on this system  I set the the permissions to 4755 as suggested in the FAQ, with no change.
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks, Steve

Has anyone out there been able to get GnuPG to work on an OS/390 (or MVS or Z/OS) Unix platform?
