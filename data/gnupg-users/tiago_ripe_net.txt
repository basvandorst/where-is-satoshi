@_subject: GPGME vs GPAPA vs home-made wrapper 
Could someone please help me with this: We develop and maintain a whois=20
server that uses gpg (automatically, not manually). We currenlty use a=20
home developed interface which has some problems and we are thinking in=20
replacing it by something else.
The alternatives that I saw were
GPGME, which is said to be alpha but after a first inspection it seems=20
to be in a better state than that
GPAPA which is tied with GPA.
I would like to know what would be your recommendation for a system that=20
  needs to be very stable with frozen APIs: GPGME or GPAPA or maintain=20
our home made stuff or other alternative?
Thanks very much for any comments

The problem is that in GPGME site it is said that the software is alpha=20
status. We have a server that is very stable (available as open-source,=20
serving mostly ISP/network admins) and we cannot make use of unsable=20
libraries. Do you think it is stable? Are the pages on dated in regards to that?

@_subject: Verifying signatures with gpgme 
I have a piece of data to verify, like this:
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
And I want to verify it with gpgme. Is there any way to do it without=20
having to preparse the text? I know of gpgme_op_verify, but it forces me=20
to pre separate body from signature (2 gpgmeData)...
Thanks for any help.

@_subject: gpgme_get_op_info about imports 
I am currently trying to use gpgme to import a key into a keyring, after
that I want to get more info (namely I want to get the keyID of the
key), but get_op_info returns a NULL. My 2 questions are:
1. Shouldn't get_op_info always return something after a successful impor=
2. Is there another way to know a keyid from a public key block?
Also it seems that when I do an import gpgme (and only one import)
creates 2 entries, like this:
pub  1024D/C7BC94FD 2002-07-23 dbupdate test sub  1024g/96EEAD0E 2002-07-23
pub  1024D/C7BC94FD 2002-07-23 dbupdate test sub  1024g/96EEAD0E 2002-07-23
I suppose this is not correct?
Thanks for any help

PS - also gpg 1.0.4 is not able to read a keyring generated by gpgme
(with 1.0.7), I suppose this is normal, but I am just informing in the
case it is not.

@_subject: gpgme_get_op_info about imports 
So, currently it is not possible to to know with detail what happened=20
after an import with gpgme? I would like to know which keys (and=20
sub-keys) were created in the keyring after an import.

Yes. If you want me to collect some other extra data or run any tests=20
just say.

@_subject: web of trust vs subkeys use cases 
What would be the best way to deal with this scenario:
We have a department of people that has to sign messages, each person=20
should have a different key, but the key should not be accepted after=20
the person goes away. For that we need to know if a key is trusted or=20
not. Is it better subkeys (its a small group so it can be manually=20
maintained) or using the mechanisms for a "web of trust"? If we used=20
subkeys, each person would have a subkey of a master key, and somebody=20
would maintain the master.
Thanks for any suggestions
