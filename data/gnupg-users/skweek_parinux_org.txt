@_subject: Problems to migate PGP 7.0 Key to GPG 
Hello ! :)
Voila my problem is simple, i don't know how to export my pgp 7.0 keys
(public/private) and my key ring.
I read many tutorials treating gpg but all speaks about generation of new
key to the  gpg format but I will want reuse my key PGP.  Is it possible? If
you can you describe the procedure to make it?
Your fairthfully
