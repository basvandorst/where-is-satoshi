It seems as if your /bin/sh is acting strange. The error above should
be observed if (and only if) config.sub is called with more than one
argument (ll. 108 in config.sub).
However, I can't reproduce your problem with hppa2.0w-hp-hpux11.00.
I was not able to compile gnupg 1.2.1 with HP's cc, there were some
issues with undefined symbols wich went away when switching to gcc.
configure can be influenced by setting some environment variables, e.g.
CC=gcc for using gcc as compiler.

 .NOEXPORT:
Note that the sed script breaks the $CFLAGS for IRIX's cc (it uses
-O -OPT:Olimit=2000), so it's a good idea too get rid of these lines
Now for the compilers and $CFLAGS:
AIX 4.1, 4.3, 5.1:
 Compiler was xlc (IBM) (called via cc)
 Environment:
  CFLAGS='-O3 -qstrict'
  CXXFLAGS='-O3 -qstrict'
 ./configure --enable-tiger --enable-static-rnd=unix --disable-asm
HP-UX 9:
 HP-UX 9 does not know not know about RLIMIT_CORE. One can disable
 disable_core_dumps (g10/misc.c ll 85) or define RLIMIT_CORE as 4
 (this comes frome the HP-UX FAQ). I did the latter, so I ended up
 with:
 Compiler: gcc 2.95.2
 Environment:
  CFLAGS='-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -DRLIMIT_CORE=4'
  PICFLAGS=+z
  CXXFLAGS='-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer'
 ./configure --enable-tiger --enable-static-rnd=unix
HP-UX 10, 11:
 Compiler: gcc 2.95.2
 Environment:
  CFLAGS='-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -DRLIMIT_CORE=4'
  PICFLAGS=+z
  CXXFLAGS='-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer'
 ./configure --enable-tiger --enable-static-rnd=unix
IRIX 6.5:
 Compiler: cc (SGI)
 Environment:
  CFLAGS='-O -OPT:Olimit=2000'
  CXXFLAGS='-O -OPT:Olimit=2000'
 ./configure --enable-tiger --enable-static-rnd=unix --disable-asm
Linux (glibc 2.1 and 2.2):
 Works out of the box.
 Compiler: gcc 2.95.2
 Environment:
  CFLAGS='-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer'
  CXXFLAGS='-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer'
  PICFLAGS=-fPIC
 ./configure --enable-tiger --enable-static-rnd=linux
Solaris 7:
 Do not set CFLAGS=-xO3, you will get bus errors in some checks.
 Compiler: Sun WSpro 6
 Environment:
  PICFLAGS=-Kpic
 ./configure --enable-tiger  --enable-static-rnd=unix
I could not get a Tru64 for testing, may be next time.

@_subject: Build-Reports 1.2.3rc1 
after all I built gnupg 1.2.3rc1 on the relevant platforms.
HP-UX with HP's cc works without any problems.
With IRIX and SGI's cc make sure to not set -OPT:... in $CFLAGS
or patch cipher/Makefile.in when compiling with TIGER192-support.
On Solaris 7 (using Sun's WSpro 6), compilation fails when
optimizing with -xO3 (but I take this as an compiler bug).
I called configure with
--with-included-gettext --disable-dynload --enable-tiger --enable-sha512 --disable-asm

That should not be  a problem. I build gnupg 1.2.1 on HP-UX 10 and 11
using gcc:
Compiler: gcc 2.95.2                                                            Environment:                                                                     CFLAGS='-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer'                               PICFLAGS=+z                                                                     CXXFLAGS='-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer'                                           I'm not sure if your gcc is broken in some way, perhaps our installation
has been tweaked a little.

Uhm... "Our" gcc has been bootstrapped by a colleague. It is not
a version supplied by HP.
I built gnupg on PA-RISC 1.1 (a model 735). The binaries are distributed
via NFS and do work fine on our 785s, too.
There's also a 715, still running HP-UX 9...
