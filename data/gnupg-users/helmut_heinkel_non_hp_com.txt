@_subject: decryption failed 
I tried to decrypt a file with the command:
gpg --decrypt  gpg.txt
I got a message:
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit ELG-E key, ID 6A7E44E2, created 2001-12-03
     "HP homeworkers "
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
The file was encrypted on Windows, in the file I found:
Version: PGPfreeware 7.0.3 for non-commercial use Is this a problem of IDEA?
Best regards
Helmut Heinkel
Have a nice day!
