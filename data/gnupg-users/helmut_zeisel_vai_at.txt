@_subject: GPG outlook plugin - Key ring question. 
I am trying to move from PGP to GPG.
I installed the outlook plugin GDATA_plugin_091-eng.exe
on Microsoft Outlook 2000.
Previously I installed also PGP 6=20
and some older German version of the GPG Outlook Plugin.
Under Tools / GnuPG key managment,
the correct key ring appears.
When I try to write a message and choose "Encrypt message before =
and try to send the message,
it takes approx. 30s and a key list appears which is different.
Could it be that some old key ring is still present there?
Where can I configure which key ring is used?
