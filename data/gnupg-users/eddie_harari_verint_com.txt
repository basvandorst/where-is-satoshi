@_subject: gpg2 and eToken Pro 72k aladin 
Hi all and thanks for taking the time,
   I have an aladin eToken pro 72K. It works fine with pcsc-lite tools, I was able to store keys and certificate on it's slots and read those with the usual tools (PCSCD , opensc-tool etc...).
   I am trying to get it to work with gpg2 but with no success and need some pointers how to debug my problem.
   gpg2  --card-edit ---> admin ---> generate  outputs the following:
