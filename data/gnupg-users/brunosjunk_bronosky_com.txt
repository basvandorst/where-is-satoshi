@_subject: pinentry-mac never displays any UI 
I've had no luck with the binary version that I downloaded based on
Benjamin's various howtos and mailing list messages.  I have
downloaded the source, and poked around it in Xcode.  I wanted to make
sure that there was a GUI element to the pinentry-mac.app.  There is.
I built it and tried placing both the build and debug versions in
and placed it inside /Applications/pinentry-mac.app/Contents/MacOS/
and set ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf to try it.
Nothing works.  Same result in all cases.  The pinentry-mac icon
bounces, but I have no UI to speak of.

@_subject: how can I use/test pinentry? 
I have an app that is barfing trying to call pinentry.  I was to try
calling pinentry manually to make sure that it is doing the right
thing.  Information is very parse.  Based on...
pinentry -h
Usage: pinentry [OPTION]...
Ask securely for a secret and print it to stdout.
      --display DISPLAY Set the X display
      --ttyname PATH    Set the tty terminal node name
      --ttytype NAME    Set the tty terminal type
      --lc-ctype        Set the tty LC_CTYPE value
      --lc-messages     Set the tty LC_MESSAGES value
  -e, --enhanced        Ask for timeout and insurance, too
  -g, --no-global-grab  Grab keyboard only while window is focused
      --parent-wid       Parent window ID (for positioning)
  -d, --debug           Turn on debugging output
  -h, --help            Display this help and exit
      --version         Output version information and exit
I would expect there to be some way for me to call it from the command
line and get prompted for a password.  The best I can do is get it to
prompt me with: "OK Your orders please" and the only thing I have
found that doesn't give an "ERR 103 unknown command" is "OPTION ..."
(which I found in a mailing list post.)  I cannot find any other
Please advise.

@_subject: pinentry-mac never displays any UI 
I got a lead on how to use pinentry, and now have an error message to report:
echo GETPIN|/Applications/pinentry-mac.app/Contents/MacOS/pinentry-mac
OK Your orders please

Object 0x31eaf0 of class NSCFString autoreleased with no pool in place
- just leaking
Again, the icon appears in the dock and bounces once, but no UI.  I
hope that helps.

Application?  First I tried doing the complete approach that your
howto describes.  Then I tried adding it as the pinentry-program in
~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf, and tested it via command line.  Still no
luck, so I tried sending the GETPIN command to it manually with the
results that you responded to.

By God, he's right!  it was no-grab that was doing it.
Thanks all!
