@_subject: passphrase works ONLY with enigmail 
Dear all,
I'm becoming crazy and begging for help.
I generated a pair of key one month ago with gpg command line, I use GPG
with Thunderbird/Enigmail.
Everything fine until I tried gpg with gajim : my passphrase was
systematically refused.
As my passphrase contains accent (eg "? la ville, j'y vais de suite"), I
thought I should try to change it to remove the accent (eg "a la ville,
j'y vais de suite").
Then I realized that my passphrase is also refused on the command line !
I tried to change the locale (UTF-8, ISO-8859-1...) with no success.
I also tried gpa with no success.
As a conclusion, I can't change my passphrase, because it is accepted
ONLY in Enigmail !
Please help...

I found the solution.
I had a carefull look at Enigmail Debug Console.
I found out some weird characters, that were only reproducible in a
console in X mode when default locale was ISO-8859-1. In addition, the
option --charset utf8 was used with gpg.
I fixed to this locale, restarted X, and use gpg --charset utf8 in a
console in X (didn't work outside X!) to change my passphrase.
Maybe this can help someone else...
