@_subject: Restore Smart-Card-Manuel 
since 2 years, I'm using pgp. It's very nice.
Today I've got 2 pgp-smartcards.
The frist one works very good. Everything works good.
Now, I want to test, what happens when I lost this card or it's broken.
I've both cards, the public key and an .pgp-file.
I searched google for over 2 hours, but I only found an entry in this
lists. But the user did not complete the restore.
Is here any expert than can post a step-by-step guide to get my
backup-card working ?
This restore-procedure should be published on any smartcard-howto.
Thanks from Germany

@_subject: GnuPG incompatible with windows-vista ? 
today I've made some tests with gnupg and vista.
Everything works fine, but at the moment, gnupg has to communicate with
any external keyserver, I get this result:
gpg: searching for "svt at teris.de" from hkp server subkeys.pgp.net
gpgkeys: this keyserver type only supports key retrieval
gpg: keyserver communications error: Dateilesefehler
gpg: Suche auf dem Schl?sselserver fehlgeschlagen: Dateilesefehler
When using the --debug all option, I get the same output (firstline is
config-dir, the rest is the same).
This error comes very fast. GnuPG does not search for hostnames or any
other external recource.
While these tests, the firewall was disabled.
The same commands on a winXP-System are working correct.
Can somebody verify this problem or know how I can solve it ?
I know, some people here hates Vista, me to, but as software-developer I
have to use it...:-(

Hi David,
The gpgkeys_hkp.exe is in the same directory as the other files. Here is
my directory-listing:

Can I set the path to this file in the config-file or set any
global_system_var to help gpg to find this file ?

Hi David,
I don't have any enviroment on this system, to compile gnupg. So I can't
 tell you these informations.

Hi J?rgen,
yes, it seems to work for me.
But I hope I can help to fix the problem completely. In the next month
there will be thousands of users with new hardware, where vista is

I hope, I'm not the noob of the year, but yes, I've just downloaded the
1.4.7 in installed it.

Hi Henry,
I had already added the gnupg-directory to my path-variables and I've
tested it. The path-variable works correct.
I think, gpg can find the program correct, because
"gpg: DBG: system() command is C:\gnupg\gpgkeys_curl.exe"
is in the output. I've installed gpg in this dir, to test, if the
vista-roaming-function make problems (The auto-roaming of vista does
only work in system-dirs like program_files or windows, but not in other
dirs on a partition.
To analyse the problem, I've tried to change the props of the exe-files
in vista:
Run as admin, win2000 compatibility, winxpSP2 compatibility... All of
these probs don't have any positive effect.
Thanks for your idea!

Hi David,
I can't build it now, because, I don't have installed the software to
build it.
If you know a website, where I can find out, how to build the package, I
will try it.
I've some experience in building packages like apache, php... on a linux
system. Under windows, I've never built anything. - But, I can learn it:-)
Thanks a lot for your very fast work. I hope, you and the gpg-community
can solve it.

@_subject: Cardreader Pinpad only on linux ? 
this community is one of the best, I've ever seen.
Now, I've a little question:
Is the smartcard-reader-pinpad function only available under
linux-system or should this work under windows ?
I'm using a SCM-Card-Reader: Chipdrive Pinpad 532.
The cardreader works perfectly with gpg, just the pinpad is unused.
Thanks a lot!

@_subject: HowTo make a donation to gpg... 
I'm really exaltet about gpg and want to support the project with a
little donation. I think, if I can't help to develop such a good
project, the team should get a little bit support. The most OS-projects
are better than commercial products. A donation is the least, that I
(and other users) can do.
On the gpg-website I've searched for a paypal-donation button or
something else... Nothing.
I think, the gpg-team should install a possibility for this on the website.
