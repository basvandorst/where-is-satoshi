@_subject: GnuPG 2.0 decryption of two PGP Message blocks in one Message 
Dear Developer,
Here's a peculiar scenario, I have a file which has 2 pgp messages or blocks
embedded in a single file one below the other. Can GPG 2.0 be able to decrypt both the blocks and concatenate the messages
inside same single file?
I have attached the sample PGP file for reference and more clear picture of
the scenario.
Any help is greatly appreciated.
