@_subject: Query on GPG - should I install GPG in every system? 
Our institute has an intranet consisting of around 60 machines. I am
planning to implement GPG in my mail server. Is it enough to install GPG
only in the mail server. Then how do I create the keys for each user.
Please help me on this. Rajam S
