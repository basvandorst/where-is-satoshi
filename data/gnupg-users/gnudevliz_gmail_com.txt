@_subject: smartcard reader 
Hello, I'm in the market for a smartcard reader and I live in the United
States. I found two ways to get an OpenPGP card already, either from
shop.kernelconcepts.de or from the FSFE as a sustaining member.
Does anyone know how I can get a smart card reader though?
It has to be one from this list:
SCM SPR 532
USB ID: 04e6:e003
PC/SC reader name: SPRx32
KAAN Advanced
USB ID: 0d46:
FSIJ Gnuk Token
USB ID: 234b:0000
Reiner cyberJack Go
USB ID: 0c4b:0504
Vasco DigiPASS 920
USB ID: 1a44:0920
Cherry ST2000
USB ID: 046a:003e

@_subject: spr332 vs spr532 
Hello, I'm interning for the PGP Clean Room and am trying to get an OpenPGP
Card reader. Kernelconcepts is offering a SPR332 which is the successor
to the 532. According to this page, though,
the 532 seems to be recommended but the 332 is not. I'm wondering if
there's a specific reason why it was left out and if I should go for the
532 instead.
Thank you,
