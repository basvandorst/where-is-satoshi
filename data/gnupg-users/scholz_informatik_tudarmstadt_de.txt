Hi everybody.  I'm using gnupg 1.2.2.
When I encode a file with     gpg -c -s and decode it with
    gpg --decode .gpg
I get the message:     gpg: WARNING: message was not integrity protected
Why? The FAQ says: "There is a small security glitch in the OpenPGP (and
therefore GnuPG) system; to avoid this you should always sign and encrypt a
message instead of only encrypting it."
I did sing the file.  Did I?
And in another posting I read: "This isn't true any longer.  OpenPGP now has
the MDC protection.  Both GnuPG and PGP support it.  MDC can be turned off
manually, or if you encrypt to a key that doesn't support it, it is switched
off automatically, but in general it is on."
So why do I still get this message?  And what does it tell me?  Am I doing
something wrong here?
Thank you, Uli

As I said, I _am_ using gnupg 1.2.2.  That's the reason I'm asking.

Of course, that should read gpg --decrypt .gpg
PS. Now I've updated to gnupg 1.3.91.  The behavior stayed the same.

You are right.  If I encrypt a message with   gpg -c --force-mdc then I don't get the warning on decryption.  Maybe you should hint that in
the documentation (or maybe you did and I just too lazy to find it.)
Thank you, Uli
