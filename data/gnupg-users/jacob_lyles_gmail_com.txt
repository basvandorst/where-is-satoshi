@_subject: Trojan detected in Windows 10 Simple Installer for GnuPG Modern 
Platform: VM "Microsoft Edge on Win 10 Stable (14.14393)" for
Virtualbox (download
GnuPG download: gnupg-w32-2.1.18_20179123.exe
(sha256 1FD01E24F65465DFD075B8AD55A58EAEE13E79C02C42096C325A7CCF5A1EB283)
"Simple installer for GnuPG modern"
Problem: Windows Defender detects a trojan named
"Trojan:Win32/Sprisky.C!cl" in the installer and deletes it.
This could be a false positive or a problem with the Windows 10 VM
distributed by Microsoft. The sha256 checksum matches the checksum expected
by the developer. It would be useful to know whether windows 10 users who
run windows directly on their hardware experience the same problem.
I am able to download other GPG distributions, such as Gpg4win, without
Should I file a bug report with the maintainer? Even if the problem is on
Microsoft's end, this is a bad experience for GPG users.
