Hi All,
I've been on the list for some time but have thus far been a "lurker",  and this is my first post. I have a very basic question.
I have seen for quite some time that GPG v2.x has been available. It  seems to offer some significant advantages according to what I read.  Yet, no one seems to be using it and it seems to be available only in  source code. In particular, I have not seen any Mac binaries. Why does  it seem that virtually no one is using it?

Thank-you to all who responded to my questions about v2.x. There were  many excellent points made. I need to stay on the v1.x branch as I am  using a Mac and would not be able to integrate v2.x with either Apple  Mail or Thunderbird. But I'm more content now! :-)

I am currently grabbing Mac compiled binaries for the TEST1 version of  2.0.7. How would one integrate v2.x into Thunderbird, though? I think  the Enigmail version supports only GPG v1.x. Also, I'm absolutely  certain that the Apple Mail plugin for Leopard only supports v1.x. And  even it is in mid to late beta status.
