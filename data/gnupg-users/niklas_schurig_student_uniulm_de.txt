Hash: SHA1
does anybody have experience with GnuPG (and email-frontends)
used in computer-pools for example in universities (Windows and Linux) ?
I'd like to know wether - - there are already universities supporting PKE-infrastructure, especiallly in Germany
- - how problems with those shared computers and secret keys are managed
- - there are already keyservers in universities
Any information is welcome,

I hexedited the GPG-files for additional storing-info but I don't have a
