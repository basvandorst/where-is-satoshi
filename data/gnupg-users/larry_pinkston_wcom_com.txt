@_subject: Not able to compile 
To All,
I was not able to compile gnupg_1.0.0 on the following platform:
Intel Pentium 166, 64Mb RAM, linux 2.2.6, slackware 4.0 distribution.
I received the following errors:
mpicalc.o: In function `i18n_init':
../util/.libs/libutil.a(argparse.o): In function `show_help':
../util/.libs/libutil.a(secmem.o): In function `print_warn':

../util/.libs/libutil.a(errors.o):/home/lapinkst/src/gnupg-1.0.0/util/errors.c:106: more undefined references to `gettext' follow
make[2]: *** [mpicalc] Error 1

make: *** [all-recursive-am] Error 2                                            It appears to me to be associated with the libintl stuff, and it is present
on the system. I also tried forcing it to use the included libintl stuff, but
it failed with the same errors... So, obviously, I haven't a clue...
Any ideas or help would be greatly appreciated!! Thanks!!
