Hi reverend gnupg users!
  Tell me, please,
  1. Is it possible to run efficiently gnupg under Windows?
  2. If yes, how can I do that? (What files I need, what
  instructions...)

@_subject: subkey expiration time 
Hash: SHA1
  Hello highly reverend gnupgers, (freedom loving of course)
  I changed expiration time for a key. But I cannot change it for the
  subkey. How can I do that?
  When I go to edit this subkey, prg says "you have to select ID".
  When I select ID of this subkey, it says again "you have to select
  ID". And so on. One of two of us doesn't speak same language. I
  cannot find any more specific command for selecting (sub)key. Cannot
  see if I missed it in documentation (Readme, Readme.w32, Faq,
  Faq.html, gpg.man...). Maybe I need a rest... Or help.

@_subject: Signing from The Bat! 
Hash: SHA1
  Hello gnupgers.
  My grey brain cells are entertaining their selves with the flying
  blind mouse (The Bat!). They try to induce it to sign message when
  completed. And what happens:
  "To use GnuPG 1.0.5 with The Bat! just install GnuPG completely, and
  make sure that the directory in which the GnuPG executables have
  been installed is in your system's PATH Environment variable." (So
  the Bat's Help spoke.)
  It's done, but I cannot sign ('sign when completed') message from
  the Bat. It says something like that:
  "gpg: no default secret key: secret key not available
   gpg: [stdin]: clearsign failed: secret key not available"
   What's wrong here? Bat cannot reach my secret key? Why?
   It's not big deal, I'm signing from the gpg then, but sometimes is
   handy since I forget, here and there, to sign message.
   Any kind suggestion?
Mica

Thanks Roman, it is already fixed few days ago. And guess what? It was
just about that what you are talking - checked S/MIME. :)
