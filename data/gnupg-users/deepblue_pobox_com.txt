@_subject: Estimated release of GnuPG 1.0.7? 
Can anybody close to the development team (or Werner himself, if he's
reading this), give me an estimated release date of GnuPG 1.0.7? I've
been waiting a long time for the fixes that are in 1.0.6a and b, but
since I can't download those, I'll wait for 1.0.7 to come out. Is it
like a week, a month, or a year? Thanks in advance.
