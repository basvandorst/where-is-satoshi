@_subject: Delete a key from keyring, using gpgme 
Hello, I'm using gpgme to use some functions of gpg in my code. All other functions are working good, but deleting of key  doesn't work. It returns gpgme_no_error, but key stays in  keyring. Here's line of my code: err = gpgme_op_delete(ctx, key, 1); Context and key are not null. Does anyone know, where  is the prob ? Vit
