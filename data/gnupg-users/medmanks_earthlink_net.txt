@_subject: problem with mutt and gnupg 
Hello all, Well for the first time, I am having a problem, and I just cannot get a
handle on it.  This is with the new Progeny Debian distro.  All of my
other distros work fine, and my pgp.rc and options files are all the same,
same as I have been using for a year or so, except for the upgrades to
gnupg and mutt, but again, works in other distros.. What I am experiencing is the following.  When I set gpg to be used to
encrypt mail with the "p" command in mutt, if I select the sign only
command, it works fine.  However, if I set it to encrypt mail, I get the
following error which will not allow me to encrypt:
sh: pgpewrap: command not found
I cannot find anything on pgpewrap anywhere.  Can someone offer some
insight?.  This happened with gnupg 1.4 and 1.6 now.. just in Progeny.

That's it, that's what I need.  My thanks to you and Micha for your help,
works well now.
