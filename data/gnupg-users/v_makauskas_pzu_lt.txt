@_subject: PGP 6.5.8 - PGP 7.7.4 compatability with gpg 1.4.2 
I've been crypting files with gpg 1.2.2 on SUSE8.2 distribution.
Partners use PGP 6.5.8 - PGP 7.7.4 for decrypting.
I need transfer crypting to SuseEnterpriseServer10 with gpg 1.4.2 by default
in distribution.
Problem is, that partners can't decrypt my files now.
Before encryption i export secret key from SUSE8.2:
gpg --armor --export-secret-keys SECRET >SECRET.ASC
and import to SLES10.
gpg --import SECRET.ASC
gpg --import PARTNER.PKR - public key
Our partners cant't decrypt my files now.
PGP use DH/DSS 1024-4096
GPG use DSA and ElGamal 1024-2048
How can I check used key formats and change by default?
How can I be sure what i use DSA and ElGamal 1024-2048 by default?
I check ability to uninstall gpg1.4.2 and install gpg1.2.2, And get many
affected SLES10 packets by requirements:
pattern:base-10-51.20.i586 has missing dependencies
pattern:gnome-10-51.20.i586 has missing dependencies
pattern:apparmor-10-51.20.i586 has missing dependencies
pattern:SUSE-Linux-Enterprise-Server-i386-10-0.i686 has missing dependencies

net-snmp-5.3.0.1-25.2.i586 has missing dependencies
gpgme-1.0.3-16.2.i586 has missing dependencies
hplip-hpijs-0.9.7-19.2.i586 has missing dependencies and many many yast2
There fore I'm affraid downgrade gpg.
Does I break system if uninstall 1.4.2 and install 1.2.2 packets only.
How can i resolve compatability?
