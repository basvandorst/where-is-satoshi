I can open the file fine with the PGP program. I don't see in GPG where I
can set the default export directory it always before just put it in the
root directory where the file is.
I have tried creating the folder Inet and PGP on the desktop but that still
didn't put the file in it. I get the same error.
I am using GPGshell for Windows v3.76
Any help would be great.
