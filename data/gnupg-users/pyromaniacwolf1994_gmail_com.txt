Hey, this is going to seem like stupid questions, but, I just found out about
PGP, OpenPGP, and GnuPG yesterday, and I didn't create a key pair until
about 2 hours ago, so I'm pretty unaware of how some thing work...First is,
that using either Mozilla Thunderbird, with the OpenPGP plugin, or Claws
Mail, to generate a key pair, it only lists, one key, my "key id" Is that my
public key or my secret key? Or is it supposed to be both? If it's only one
of them, how do I find the other? Also. I was wondering, in my reading on
the internet about this sort of thing, it mentioned signing a message, say
an e-mail, with my secret key, so the recipient knows it's from me...but I"m
confused, since doesn't that mean, that any one I send a message to, that I
"sign" will have my secret key and thus will be able to decrypt any messages
they intercept? Thank you for any help, and have a nice day.

Okay thanks for the help though I'm still somewhat confused...I understand
that they key id is the entire keypair, but then how do  I found out what is
just my public key, and just my secret key, the reason I"m asking is that if
I want to give my public key to someone, then I apparently give the entire
keyid since that has my secret key too..or am I wrong on that and I can give
them the entire keyid? Thanks again and have a nice day.
