@_subject: gnuPG: no valid OpenPGP data found 
i use gnupg to generate a key and send this key to a
local keyserver. this work.
then i delete the key from the local keyring.
after that i use:
gpg --keyserver  --recv-keys but the answer is:
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: Total number processed: 0
the same result when i use --search-keys, gpg show the
keys and wait that i enter the number of a key, but
after this i get the same error message.
with "pgp keys" from  it works without
have somebody a solution for my problem.
sorry for my bad english but i hope you can understand
what i mean.
