The same with me. Your signature is the only one which Enigmail cannot verify correctly.
The error message says:
gpg: Unterschrift vom 12/16/04 22:17:17, DSA Schl?ssel ID 010A57ED
gpg: FALSCHE Unterschrift von "Werner Koch "
Thunderbird 0.9 DE
EnigMail 0.89.0
GnuPG 1.2.5
Windows Millennium
I have had no problems with any signatures till now.
Can you tell us, what went wrong?

I haven't changed anything in my configuration since yesterday.
Very strange...

Thanks a lot for this explanation. I hope, the Enigmail-Developers will resolve this issue. Maybe, I should upgrade to the latest Enigmail-version. But in order to do so, I will have to upgrade Thunderbird and many many extensions...
Btw: This mail has not been verified correctly, again ;-)
