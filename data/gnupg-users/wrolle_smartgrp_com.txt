@_subject: artifacts and file name insert themselves before first line after 
I am researching an issue that I'm having trouble finding the solution.
When I encrypt a file using GnuPG and then decrypt it using a pure Java library which supports Open PGP - some artifacts are inserted in the beginning of the file.
For example, the text below is inserted before the first line, and note that it contains the file name as well.
Has anyone seen this before? If both GnuPG claims to be OpenPGP compliant, shouldn't this method work?
