@_subject: gpg --gen-key fails with "invalid packet (c2b=2d)" using 
I tried searching this list and found a few others having problems with
key generation, but I haven't figured out the solution for me.  I've
tried downloading GnuPG for windows by itself (gnupg-w32cli-1.4.7.exe)
as well as part of the latest gpg4win package.  Trying to generate a new
key by using GPA gives the following feedback:
   The GPGME library returned an unexpected error.  The error was:    General error
   This is probably a bug in GPA. GPA will now try to recover from this
When I run at a Command Prompt gpg --gen-key, I get (after a bunch of
+^.> characters and two messages saying to type to generate random
   gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=2d)
I only want to install GnuPG, generate a private key, import a few
public keys, and use gpgee to encrypt and decrypt a few files - I don't
need Outlook integration or anything fancy.  I was a bit surprised to be
shut down so fast.  I have administrator rights (or I couldn't have
installed).  Anything I could be missing?

Thanks Werner,
That was exactly the issue - after moving pubring.gpg and secring.gpg to
a backup directory, key generation works fine.  Would it be worth
modifying the code so that it checks for existence of these files and
asks for permission to overwrite them or simply exits with a message
saying that these files must be deleted in order to generate new keys?
(Perhaps GnuPG 2.05 already does this - I haven't had a chance to try it
on Windows yet).
