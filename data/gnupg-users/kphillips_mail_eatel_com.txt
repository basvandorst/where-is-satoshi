@_subject: gnupg 1.0.3 RSA problems... 
I have recently installed gpg 1.0.3 on an HPUX 10.20 machine in hopes of
being able to use it for RSA encryption/decryption.  However, I am running
into some problems.  Here is the scenario:
I generate RSA key "KeyA" with PGP 6.5.2.
I import "KeyA" in to my GPG 1.0.3 keyring successfully.
Using PGP 6.5.2 and KeyA, I encrypt FileA resulting in file FileA.pgp
When I try to decrypt this file using GPG 1.0.3, I receive the following
gpg: protection algorithm 1 is not supported
gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit RSA key, ID 6F753D41, created 2000-10-11
      "KeyA"
gpg: public key decryption failed: unknown cipher algorithm
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
I then took this a step further doing to encryption and decryption both with
GPG 1.0.3 thinking that this would surely work.  However, I was wrong and
received the exact same error message.  I am guessing the
compilation/linking is bad.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.
