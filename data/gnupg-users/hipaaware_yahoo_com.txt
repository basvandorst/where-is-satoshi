Dear Gnupg users,
???????? I am having problems installing Gnupg on Solaris 10, and am getting? library not found messages from the configure script.? Any help from you is greatly appreciated !
This is what I basically did. 1) I untar 'ed the build libraries from required tar files from below sites ;? 2) After unzip/untar, formed below directories:
Under ?? /export/apps/gnupg
egate> dirs
drwxr-xr-x????????? gnupg-2.0.17
drwxr-xr-x????????? libassuan-2.0.2
drwxr-xr-???????????? ?libgcrypt-1.5.0
drwxr-xr-x????????? ?libgpg-error-1.9
drwxr-xr-???????????? ??libksba-1.2.0
drwxr-xr-???????????? ??make-3.82
drwxr-xr-???????????? ??pth-2.0.7
????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? 3) I ran "build.sh" file in downloaded make directory ( /export/apps/gnupg/make-3.82 ).
?I think that activated??make? command.
Than I ran make in same directory.
4) Ran ?configure? in /export/apps/gnupg/libgpg-error-1.9
config.status: creating config.h
config.status: config.h is unchanged
config.status: executing depfiles commands
config.status: executing libtool commands
config.status: executing po-directories commands
config.status: creating po/POTFILES
config.status: creating po/Makefile
??????? Libgpg-error v1.9 has been configured as follows:
??????? Platform:? sparc-sun-solaris2.10
????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? 6) Ran ?make? command in /export/apps/gnupg/libgpg-error-1.9
7) But, when I try to build the ?libgcryp, I get below error.

Configure: error: libgpg-error is needed.
??????????????? See ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgpg-error/.
Seems?- libgcrypt appears to depend on libgpg-error, and I ?haven't successfully built libgpg-error.
8) ??The libgpg-error build installed the library somewhere that the libcrypt or libassuan build can't find - looking back at the log of the build, could not find exact install the library file?? I added the path /export/apps/gnupg/libgpg-error-1.9 to? the $LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable in .profile.? Still does not recognize the libgpg-error !
9) Tried to build libassuan ; same error as above.

Simone ?? Many thanks.? I got a message Permission denied from the make install script. Maybe because I didn't come as root ; was rather doing a 'sudo su'.
??? I'll update you after working with Admin.
