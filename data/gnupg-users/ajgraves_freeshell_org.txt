I have created a key that for some reason does not have the "authenticate"
flag set. Is there a way I can somehow set this flag? Or do I have to start
from scratch?
Here's an example. From the key in question:
pub 1024D/9FB54294 created: 2006-09-17 expires: never usage: SC
trust: ultimate validity: ultimate
sub 4096g/DE94A6C4 created: 2006-09-17 expires: never usage: E
And from another key that has the flag set:
pub 1024D/34BAFE51 created: 2006-08-26 expires: 2011-08-25 usage: SCA
trust: ultimate validity: ultimate
sub 4096g/84400184 created: 2006-08-26 expires: 2011-08-25 usage: E
Notice the "A" in the usage section. How can I add that to my other key?
Or if it's not necessary, would it be possible to ask why?
Thanks very much for your time.

The keys I listed are of two seperate keypairs. The signing key on the
second one has the authenticate flag, the signing key on the first one
does not. And that's strange about the sig... never had that happen The "2nd" Key you reference above is the Encryption Sub-Key to the
Main/Signing Key above it.  I believe that the 'Authentication" Flag
_must_ be 'placed' on the Signing Key at the time it is
Generated...there is no reason for the Encryption sub-Key to have any
other Flag.
Many folks have a Main Key with both a Signing sub-Key & the Encryption
sub-Key.  I haven't done it, but perhaps You could add a Signing sub-Key
to your existing Key and add the 'Authenticate' Flag at this time.
BTW: Your Sig on this Post did not Verify.
