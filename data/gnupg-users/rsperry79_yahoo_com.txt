The issue you have is caused from the newer version of
GnuPG.  Timo is doing a great job of writing a newer
version, but with all new releases it takes time to
find the bugs. for a working beta of my Ol03 installer goto
The installer takes care of some of the OL issues and
uses the .94 plug-in for stability. It also has Winpt for keymanager, GnuPG 1.4.2 and
GpgEE .  I have tried to write it stupid friendly so
everything is set in theroy.  For security reasons  I
set the keys and conf into the userdocs. I recomend
using EFS if you are on XP Pro.  I would like any feedback you have.

I love the German language.  I don't speak it, can't
read it.  And sure as heck have too many emails a day
to filter through.  The mech you speak of was the
german list, made by german speaking people. I have  a
funny feeling those who speak german in this list, are
on the same german list we speak of, so they would get
the same help.  But if you really want to add high school drama, try
adding every post in pig latin.  i'm sure any english
raised kid can help you, and hey it will only annoy
the rest of the world. Do You Yahoo!?

The setting for cached mode can cause bandwidth
problems on the network. you may be in violation of
your IT policy by implememting this.  Some companies
have terminated users for such actions.  It also can
pose a security threat as the raise in bandwidth, if
by many users, could over load their IDS/IPS sniffers.
