I am using GnuPG (1.4.11) with mutt (1.5.21) and the following muttrc When encrypting a mail with myself in Cc:, I get the following:
How can I disable having to press a key after this message or disable it

Christian Aistleitner:
Right. I would like to disable this warning in GnuPG.
Back in 2001, Werner Koch  said on this list:
Has that ever happened? Does anyone know how to do that?
Thanks for that hint. But I prefer keeping mails sent encrypted also encrypted locally.

Thanks a lot!
Werner pushed something like it (swapping --quiet and non --verbose) here:

I agree with dkg.

@_subject: how to recover secret key passphrase? 
Over the years, I have used quite a number of keypairs. Unfortunately, I have forgotten the passphrase for some of them. But I do know potential parts of the passphrase.
What's the current recommended way to recover the passphrase of OpenPGP private keys?
The classic John the Ripper includes a tool "gpg2john" to convert ASCII-armored exported private keys to a format that john can work with: However, to export a private key from the current private-keys-v1.d/ gpg-agent key store, I need my passphrase. Which I can't remember.
I would welcome any hints on how to achieve this.
According to Kerckhoffs's principle, this can be public knowledge, in contrast to "security through obscurity". But if you feel like this is sensible, feel free to answer me directly instead of the list.

Markus Reichelt:
Thanks. But my problem is not the actual brute-forcing part, john is perfect for that. My problem is getting a usable input for john from the current the current private-keys-v1.d/ gpg-agent private key key store

@_subject: I deleted 80 % of my keyring, but my keybox file isn't shrinking 
Over the years, my keyring grew and got rather big. So I did some cleaning and deleted some revoked and otherwise useless certificates.
(If you wonder how, see this script - feedback welcome: This got my keyring down from 4.600 to 1.000 keys:
But the keybox file didn't get any smaller:
Why is this?
I really don't understand keybox well enough to answer this myself.
PS: This could probably be updated:

Same on a different box with a different keyring. I trimmed it down from ~1250 keys to ~350 keys, but the size of pubring.kbx remains 19M.
Does --delete really mean *delete* with keybox?

Thanks, that explains it.
And the faketime gpgsm command worked (after installing faketime).
But that's a hack, and users should not have to do this. Especially since GnuPG 2.1 defauls to keybox and more people recommend it with of the recent flooding issues.
I opened an issue to track this: Werner Koch:

@_subject: revoke last valid user ID 
Doing more keyring housekeeping, I would like to all revoke user IDs of keypairs with revoked/expired certificates. However, I am getting this This is also in the documentation:
Why it this?
I have keypairs with revoked/expired certificates keys in my keyring which have *all* user IDs revoked. And I am sure I want to do this. Is there a way to override this limitation?

Wiktor Kwapisiewicz:
Thanks, that sounds possible. But I wonder, if there is a reason GnuPG won't let me revoke it directly - and if so, if that reasoning is strong enough to not even have a way to override it. Since I have keys with all user IDs revoked and I only ever used GnuPG, it seems I was able to do that once.
The keys I am trying to do that for *are* revoked or expired. That's why I want to remove the (immediate visibility of the) user IDs, even from the classic SKS keyserver network.
