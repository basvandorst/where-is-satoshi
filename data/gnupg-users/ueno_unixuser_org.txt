That's my fault, sorry.  The attached patch should fix the problem.
Could you try it?

@_subject: gpg --list-secret-keys does not skip revoked keys 
I noticed that gpg --list-secret-keys skips expired keys but not revoked
keys.  For example, when I have two keys (one is expired and another is
$ gpg --list-keys A6CC6651 D1458906
pub   2048R/A6CC6651 2010-11-10 [expired: 2010-11-17]
uid                  Daiki Ueno pub   2048R/D1458906 2010-12-22 [revoked: 2010-12-22]
uid                  Daiki Ueno $ gpg --list-secret-keys A6CC6651 D1458906
sec   2048R/D1458906 2010-12-22
uid                  Daiki Ueno ssb   2048R/AE471CB5 2010-12-22
Is this an intended behavior?  Also, if I supply the revoked key to say
gpg --sign, it simply fails:
$ gpg --sign -u D1458906 < /dev/null
gpg: skipped "D1458906": unusable secret key
gpg: signing failed: unusable secret key
BTW, I'm wondering if there is any reason why the validity field (Field
2 of --with-colons output) is not used for secret keys.  It might be
useful for the libraries which call gpg internally (epg.el I mean :) to
check if a key is usable.  Currently we need to run gpg --list-keys
followed by gpg --list-secret-keys.

Actually, it looks that GPGME ignores the validity when listing keys
with SECRET_ONLY flag.  Here is a sample program:

@_subject: GnuPG 2.1 beta released 
I just tried GnuPG 2.1 and the OpenPGP part seems to work fine.  Now I
started playing with the G13 tool.  With the EncFS backend, I got the
following error:
$ g13 -v -r A6CC6651 --create foo
g13: DBG: used keyblob size is 61
g13: no running gpg - starting `/usr/local/bin/gpg2'
g13: running `/usr/bin/encfs' in the background
g13: DBG: starting runner thread
g13: encfs-1: encfs: unrecognized option '--annotate'
I couldn't find --annotate option in EncFS versions from 1.4 to 1.7.3.
Do I need some patch to EncFS for G13?

Thanks.  It now basically works (I used encfs-1.7.3_annotate.diff you
posted to gnupg-devel), though the usage was a bit unclear to me :)
For anyone else who wants to try, here is my trial log:
$ g13 -r A6CC6651 --create foo
$ mkdir /tmp/x
$ g13 --mount foo /tmp/x &
$ echo aaa > /tmp/x/passwords
$ pkill g13
$ ls /tmp/x # there are no files
$ g13 --mount foo /tmp/x &
$ ls /tmp/x

And it seems you already fixed it in the git repo some time ago:
Is there any chance of new release? :-)
