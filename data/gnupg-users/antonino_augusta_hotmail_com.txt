@_subject: Error on gnupg-2.1.20 installation 
I hope someone can help me with the following.
I have already installed successfully (on linux) the following packages:
     npth
    libgpg-error
    libgcrypt
    libksba
    libassuan
When I try to install the gnupg-2.1.20 package, during the make i receive the following error message:
sysutils.c: In function ???gnupg_inotify_watch_socket???:
sysutils.c:1163: error: ???IN_EXCL_UNLINK??? undeclared (first use in this function)
sysutils.c:1163: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
sysutils.c:1163: error: for each function it appears in.)
make[2]: *** [libcommon_a-sysutils.o] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/root/GnuPG_Pkgs/gnupg-2.1.20/common'
make[1]: *** [check] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/root/GnuPG_Pkgs/gnupg-2.1.20/common'

Many thanks,
