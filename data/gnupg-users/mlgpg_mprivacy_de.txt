@_subject: Can GPG make use of OAEP form new LibGCrypt 1.5.0? 
Hello list,
I read that Libgcrypt 1.5.0 has support for OAEP and PSS methods as
described by RFC-3447.
Does GnuPG 2.0.19 make use of this libgcrypt?
And is there any flag, environment variable or command-line option that
could be passed to gpg2, to make it use RSA-OAEP padding for encryption?
Thanx a lot!

You should check if your smartcard reader can handle "extended APDU" as
described here: I had only success with extended APDU readers with 4096bit keys.

@_subject: Problems with keypad on Cherry ST-2000U card reader 
Hello Johannes,
I have the exact same setting with the same card reader ST-2000U (which
I think is one of the best to be used with the OpenPGP card) on Debian
(also testet on different flavours of Ubuntu makes no difference).
I'm willing to help evaluate on this issue if someone could lead me
through debugging it. Or has anybody success using the card readers pinpad?
