the short question is how do I enable the IDEA support in GPG2.
I tried following this article:
but even the patching of the libcrypt source files does not work. Here's
what I did:
The patch command gives me a lot of FAILED messages:
what am I doing wrong?

is the IDEA algorithm licensed? Under which conditions am I allowed to use
the idea extension in a commercial product?

It is clear to me that the patent expired but it is not clear how I'm
allowed to use the sourced of idea.c
I have to use GnuPG 1.4.10 and a self compiled idea.c  from here
so the question is .. can I ship the idea shared object with my software?
The idea.c contains the following comments. So if I understand it
correctly, I just have to add this somewhere in the documentation of my

I have to stick to the version provided by Debian Squeeze and it's 1.4.10. I haven't found any back port repositories.
ok so idea is GPL.

Sorry, I sent the last mail only to Hubert.
I was saying that Squeeze does not have in any of its repositories the
versions that support IDEA:
Max version of GnuPG  is 1.4.12
Max version of libgcrypt is 1.5.1
So in other words, I can  have IDEA support in Debian Squeeze only when I
compile myself either the extension for GPG 1 or libgcrypt for GPG 2.
Compiling and shipping IDEA means that I have to provide the sources of my
software, correct?
