@_subject: Are gpg signatures considered attachments? 
I know that is probably a lame question, however, I'm on several mailing lists that are bouncing my messages back to me because they are signed. The list owners are telling me this is because they don't allow attachments.

Thanks Thorsten. It was pointed out to me that my signatures had been added as attachments which was causing the bounces.  When I changed to 'inline' the problem went away. Kmail however shows 'Inline OpenPGP (deprecated)' not exactly why it shows that, but its the option I'm now using.

I've switched to that method, however, Kmail shows Inline OpenPGP as deprecated. On the Mandriva Newibe list signatures using OpenPGP/MIME show up as bad while those using Inline OpenPGP show up as good. Not sure if the fault lies in Kmail and/or the ML software configuration. I've already received quite a few off-list replies explaining the pros and cons of inline signatures.

They make it to the list, however, they show up this way using OpenPGP/MIME:
Message was signed by cpollock (Key ID: 0xE372A7DA98E6705C).
Warning: The signature is bad.
On the bad signature I see this when looking at the msg source:
  charset="iso-8859-1"

@_subject: gpg-agent directories in /tmp 
I've got a bunch of directories in /tmp that are like this:
total 0
srwxrwxr-x  1 chris chris 0 Aug 16 20:42 S.gpg-agent=
total 0
srwxrwxr-x  1 chris chris 0 Nov 23  2005 S.gpg-agent=
total 0
srwxrwxr-x  1 chris chris 0 Jul  8 22:45 S.gpg-agent=
total 0
srwxrwxr-x  1 chris chris 0 May 14  2006 S.gpg-agent=
total 0
srwxr-xr-x  1 chris chris 0 Dec 29 18:28 S.gpg-agent=
total 0
and so on, about 25 all together. What is their purpose and can they be safely removed? What is the purpose of the S.gpg-agent socket file that is 0 bytes?

@_subject: Sig shows as bad in sent mail folder 
This may be a lame question, but, is there any reason that in my sent mail folder the sig on outgoing messages show up as bad?
Message was signed by cpollock (Key ID: 0xE372A7DA98E6705C).
Warning: The signature is bad.
Message was signed by cpollock (Key ID: 0xE372A7DA98E6705C).
The signature is valid and the key is ultimately trusted.

@_subject: Key Revocation 
This may sound simple, but I want to make sure I get it done right. My ISP/DSL provider, Embarq, has dumped Earthlink as their mail provider sine 9 April and setup their own mail servers. Simple, revoke the EL key and make a new key for Embarq, except, the two have come to an agreement and that is that Earthlink will continue to forward mail for Embarq users until 31 Oct. Question being do I keep the Earthlink key and also generate one for my Embarq address or once I have everything setup for the Embarq servers generate one for Embarq and at that time reovke the Earthlink key?
Thanks for any suggestions/advice.

Thanks Joseph, Roscoe and David, you all three came up with the same suggestion which sounds like the best route to go. I'll read up on the manpage on how to do this and maybe give it a try this weekend.
Thanks for the quick replies.

Thanks John and John, thats been the suggested way to handle this and thats what I'll do. Didn't realize though that there was so much to do when changing addresses, modifications to postfix, fetchmail, gpg and so forth. Thanks again to all for the suggestions.

I'll be changing over to my new email address tomorrow so I want to make sure I understand the procedure. According to the manpage I want to run $gpg --edit-key cpollock at earthlink.net. I'm then presented with this info:
[chris at cpollock ~]$ gpg --edit-key cpollock at earthlink.net

I 'assume' at the "Command>" prompt I'd enter adduid and my new embarqmail.com address. Once that is done, in order to make it the primary key would I then have to again run gpg --edit-key and my new uid and at the Command> prompt enter primary? If I understand this right I'll still be using the same key only with a different address. Since I've now, hopefully, made my embarq address my primary is it just a simple matter of exporting this to the keyservers?  Then later down the road when I'm sure that all mailing lists and so forth have changed to the new address I just run all the above and at the Command> prompt run revuid cpollock at earthlink.net.  Please let me know if I've got something wrong in the way I understand this.

@_subject: upgrade errors? 
I've just upgraded to version 2.0.1 on my MDK10.1 system. After a few problems here and there, lib upgrades, I have it installed and gpg-agent is running. When I started $gpg-agent --daemon this came up:
gpg-agent[18666]: Secure memory is not locked into core
What does this mean?

@_subject: Still Bad Signatures - KGPG seems broken 
Robert, I've missed some of this thread but maybe I can partially help. I too see my sigs as bad when sending to one particular mailing list, the Mandriava Newbie List. I've been told it has to do with the software they use, sympa. My sigs only show as bad if I use OpenPGP/MIME, if I use Inline OpenPGP they show up as good. I still see bad signatures in my sent mail folder mostly on LARTs I've sent out. I'm not sure what causes it, some say it has to do with Kmail. I've not yet gotten around to setting up another mailer though.
