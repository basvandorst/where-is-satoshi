@_subject: Help with passphrase in script 
Hi I'm using gnupg to send/recieve files securely to another user on the internet.  I can get it all to work fine until I decrypt, which needs the passphrase from the terminal.  Is there any way to supply this from the command line or any other way around.
Thanks Keith Home page
