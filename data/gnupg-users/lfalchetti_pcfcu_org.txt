@_subject: Can not decrypt and verify CD's 
I work at a credit union that gets CD's with archived information on them
that upon arrival need to be Decrypted and verified by the GnuPG software. I have to say that I have never used GnuPG software for anything except
Decrypting and verifying these particular CD's. This past week I went to Tyr and decrypt one of the Cd's and now I can't get the Passphrase box to
pop up in order the download the contents. I have tried absolutely
Everything and anything I can think of including googling the error messages
I am getting.  I have no idea what I did to get this to not work properly.
We are actually on a Data center network or like a cloud environment, if you
will, with our data processor and the first time the Kleopatra software
Needed to be re-installed if what installed on the terminal server but I can
not run CD's on the DCN and therefore, it was then put on my desktop.
This is what it looks like, which looks normal to me.
But when I tried to Decrypt and verify the CD I always get this. I have
tried to Certify and Import the keys and nothing is working.
Every time I try to Import keys:
Could Not Determine the Certificate type of C:Program
Below is where Kleopatra file is actually located.
I also have the private key, as well as, the passphrase. I did change the
passphrase today to see if that would help but of course it didn't.
I know this is probably a long shot but if anyone there could help I would
be eternally grateful.
Thank you,
