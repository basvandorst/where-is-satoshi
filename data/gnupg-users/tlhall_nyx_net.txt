A native W32 version is much preferable in terms of getting gnupg out
there amoung the public.
A "cygwin version" should require little mods from the standard *NIX
release, if any, and is sort of a quick-and-dirty way to get gnupg without having to commit to a totally non-MS Windows environment.
I see cygwin as primarily a way to wean future *NIX users off of MS
Windows. Once they are comfortable with - and see the power of - *NIX,
and realize what a tremendous waste it is to run on top of Windows,
they can dump Windows/cygwin and go with a free *NIX.
