Does anyone have a solution for this problem?  Do you know what socket the gpg-agent is using?

Does anyone have a solution for this problem?  Do you know what socket the gpg-agent is using?
version: GnuPG 2.0.14
OS: Windows 2003 server
How: Batch file
I'm not sure if the gpg-agent is running or not.  How do I check?  I installed on my local and on testing and proceeding to
do to the same on staging.  It failed on staging.  Any ideas?
