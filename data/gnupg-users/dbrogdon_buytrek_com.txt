I'm probably asking a question that's been asked a million times but I
couldn't find an answer on the website so please forgive me.
What is the status of a set of libraries for GnuPG?  I can think of so many
applications that could benefit by having GnuPG capabilities built in.

Something concerning this should really be on the GnuPG website, up front,
given I've answered it so many times.
