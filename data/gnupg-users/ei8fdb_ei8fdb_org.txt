Hi all,
Nicolai: I am very glad you've started this thread.
At the risk of being flamed, can I suggest asking the users what they
Nicolai, by the look of it you've carried out some user research. I
guess so by the "real world" discussion you posted in a message.
If you did can I ask what you focused on? Did you look for suggestions
from users?
I have read some HCI research into non-expert user understanding of PGP.
If there wasn't user research done, can I suggest doing some?
With the utmost respect to the list members, you (we) are not
non-expert users, and so our opinions really don't matter.
The focus of Nicolai's question is *non-expert*, so we need to get
their opinions.
Suggestions? Arguments?

@_subject: Organizing a GPG key signing party in London 
Hello Ludovic!
I?d like to go along and take part.
One thing: what kind of person are you expecting to attend? I would like to suggest you open it to journalists, human rights defenders, activist communities?
I was at the Fosdem KSP and eventhough I enjoyed it (can you actually ?enjoy? a key signing party?) I observed some ways in which it might have been improved, particularly for first time party-goers.
I had intended on writing this up as some feedback for the great Fosdem people in case they were interested, but you?ve prompted me to do it here:
NB: This feedback makes the following assumptions:
1. People who *are not* advanced/expert GPG are encouraged to attend.
2. A similar key signing protocol to the modified Zimmerman-Sassaman is used.
1. Explain whats needed *before* you attend the key signing party.
Steps of:
a. Submit your keys before date X. Give clear steps on how to submit the keys.
b. Inform the user when the list of participants will be released. Explain the list of participants needs to be downloaded.
c. Please, please, please outline the steps the user needs to take to verify the participant lists keysum *on the website not* in the list of participants.
(I spoke with a lot of party goers at Fosdem who were unaware of the steps?which were in the list of keys. But if you didn?t know you had to download the list, and didn?t have access to a printer?.)
2. Explain the overall process involved *once you are at* the key signing party.
Again, at Fosdem this seemed to be handled eventually by word of mouth and general ?whipping? people into order. Some people were unsure of the process.
3. Explain what is needed *after* the party finishes.
This was handled well at the Fosdem party.
A few other things I made a note of were:
- If possible try and had tables provided for the people taking part so they can put their documentation/equipment down while they are checking keys etc. - Have some people helping out when people don?t know what?s involved.
- Think about capping the maximum amount of people able to attend, or think about having two sessions.
I thought it interesting even those who looked like ?seasoned? key signing party goers needed to stop and think about what they should do in certain circumstances.
Only because of the kindness of one party goer I managed to get as far as I did. While the Fosdem party webpage technically had 99% of the information needed, it was not very user-friendly, particularly to a non-seasoned KSP person. I really hope they can redesign it to be easier to read.
If you need some help, please let me know as I?d happily help out.
All the best,

@_subject: how do I use gnupg? 
GPGSuite is (possibly) the most popular GPG implementation for Mac OS X. [1]
It bundles GPGMail, GPG Keychain, GPG Services, MacGPG into one package, and works pretty well.
I have used it to create keys to be used on Android devices as would be expected..

@_subject: BoF at FOSDEM ?  
Hello all,
I?ll be attending FOSDEM, and would be very interested in that.
My interest in general is usability of PETs in general, mainly GPG and OTR enabled IM. I am interested in talking about a redesign of the HKP web interface presented to users. From reading the RFC it seems relatively straight forward in terms of interactions and so I?d like to make is slightly more informative to the lay GPG user.
Saturday seems like a good day.
All the best,
Bernard / bluboxthief / ei8fdb
