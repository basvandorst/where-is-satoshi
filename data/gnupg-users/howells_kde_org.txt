I encrypted a file using gpg, but unfortunately the file now become encrypt=
seemingly caused by a hard disk error. Is there any way of recovering from=
this? When I try to decrypt the file, I get this:
gpg: block_filter 0x80e9d28: read error (size=3D12440,a->size=3D12440)
gpg: Problem reading source (147331799 bytes remaining)
gpg: handle plaintext failed: file read error
gpg: WARNING: encrypted message has been manipulated!
gpg: block_filter: pending bytes!
Thanks for any help...
