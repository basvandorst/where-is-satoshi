Yes. I also did it in the past. It works.
Do you ask if WinPT still supports W95? Not really. It works without
any problems but I won't add any W95 specific code. A company which name
I forgot even stopped to maintain W98 so I don't see a reason to support
W95. And on the other hand I don't think _much_ people still use it.

I see you still use GPG 1.2.x. The plugin requires 1.4 and we will
provide an more informative error message with the next version of
the plugin.
BTW, the newest WinPT version also requires GPG 1.4.x.         Timo

In the case of the GPG Outlook plugin, it's no problem. Just register
the new version of gpgexch.dll and the procedure is done. Or if you
just overwrite the old gpgexch.dll, you even don't need to do this.
(make sure you also overwrite libgpgmedlgs.dll!)
Do you use the version 0.99.4? It is known that earlier version of
the plugin can crash O2003/SP1.
I can't confirm this right now, but I suggest to update to 0.99.4
and then try again. We will provide a new version of the plugin in
the next week.
For users who uses the plugin and it crashes Outlook, it would be
useful to have the debug output of Dr. Watson. Please compress it
before you send it because it's very large. You can either send these
reports to outlgpg or to me (twoaday directly.

This is an error in the code. We already fixed it.
Another user told me about similar problems, currently the plugin
assumes you have enough privileges to write to the registry. This
could be also the problem with the crash.
As I said, I use special debugging programs. But I will see what I can
do to find it out.

The primary site for downloads is ftp.g10code.com/pub/outlgpg.
I thought Windows offers it by default. When it crashes you have some

Then it's propably a bug. But I never got such a message so it is

@_subject: [outlgpg] Questions on installing and using with Outlook 2003. 
What Windows version do you use? I've never seen that this step is needed and I tested it on 98 and XP.
What is the error or why do you think you have to copy it to this
place also?
What does this exactly means?
gpgexch.dll can be stored at any place. regsvr32 stores the path of
the current directory in the registry for you.
If you enabled 'GPGExch' in the Outlook Extension dialog, you just
need to click on the new tabbed pane 'GnuPG' and set the gpg binary.
Currently only WinPT is supported for key management. Just enter the
WinPT path plus --keymanager. Example "c:\winpt\winpt.exe --keymanager".
The plugin is currently in a beta stadium. When we release the first
stable version, it will contain more documentation how to use and to
install it.
Anyway I guess it's also a good idea to provide some more details for
the beta version right now.

IIRC, the example in the README is like "regsvr32 gpgexch" but in
any case we need to improve the documentation.
Yes. This feature is not 100% ready yet. And I guess we need to
reword it a little so the user knows a key ID is expected.
And with these settings the plugin should work. Please make sure you
use 0.99.4 because there I fixed a lot of Outlook 2003 related things.
I currently use Outlook 2003 on my laptop and it works pretty well.

First please note that the plugin is still beta. But I got a lot of
feedback from persons who said it works. There seem to be some problems
with some Outlook (+ SP X) versions and we are working on it.
But the latest beta (0.99.2) solved a lot of problems which were reported
from users. It seems that Outlook 2000 + SP3 is one of the candidates of
causes some trouble. I test it myself successfully with Outlook 2000 (no SP)
and Outlook 2003 (also no SP).
I would be glad if you could send me a 'Dr. Watson' Logfile after the
crash occurred. Or any other stack backtrace like logfile.
And no, there are no special install instructions. Just copy the libgpgmedlgs.dll into your c:\$win\system32 directory and run
regsv32 gpgexch.dll. That's it.

After years in the frozen state, I decided to reawake GPGoe again.
For those who don't know GPGoe, it's a GPG plug-in for the Outlook
Express mailer. It provides inline-PGP operations (sign, encrypt, both)
and some features to make replies to encrypted mails a lot of easier.
And of course it's free software under the terms of the LGPL.
Maybe some users are forced to use OE and they want at least use
inline-PGP to secure and/or verify messages. In this case, GPGoe
might be the right choice.
The program (and also the source) can be downloaded here:

No. If you deleted all existing (older versions) of PTD.dll, libgpgme-11.dll
and replace WinPT.exe and all DLL's in the WinPT folder it should work. I
tested it myself without any problems.
Maybe you can check out the latest CVS snapshot, it contains some fixes:

The WinPT program never openes any keyring in write-mode. For the
backup, just the pubring.gpg will be copied to pubring-bak-%d.gpg.
And this means, the pubring.bak was not even created by WinPT, because
this extension is never used.
Maybe any other program had access to the keyrings?

Actually I work on WinPT mobile support. In this mode, WinPT would avoid to store global settings and/or to use the registry. It would

The problem is that the code need to be changed at several places

When the feature does not work with _any_ window on
your system, the answer is yes. Otherwise no. The
current window mode should work for almost every window
but in reality it doesn't work for some windows. There
is, IMHO, nothing I can do about it.
But it is a good idea always to use the newest
WinPT version (1.0.1) because each new release
contains bug fixes and possible improvment of
existing features.

Just unzip the ZIP archive and overwrite the ptd.dll

The current window mode can be strange. But from what I've heard,
it works on most machines with most windows.

Use the hotkeys instead. With them you can focus the
window you want to extract data from. Use the hotkey
and it will be encrypted and pasted back to this window.

Actually WinPT does not install any shell extensions.
(Windows Privacy Tray, not the obsolete SF.net project!)
And furthermore, I currently work on WinPT Mobile which does not depend
on any hardwired config and thus perfect for an USB stick. Indeed it
does not use the Windows registry or create any files on the harddisk.
As a result you may put all needed binaries on the stick, plus the
keyrings and you can use WinPT on any machine.
But I still need some time for tests.

IIRC, it is not possible to change the capabilities of an
existing key with GPG. Somebody might correct me if I'm wrong.
And yes, the only way to encrypt to this key is to add an
encryption subkey to it.
It is also possible that people have separate keys for
certifying/signing and encryption.

@_date: 2007-03-02 13:54:59

@_subject: Error with encrypting: unusable public key 
But if I see it correctly, it's _no_ v3 key so you can
add a subkey to this key even if it is RSA (which is
no limitation in OpenPGP).
