@_subject: Help with --encrypt-files 
I have tried using the -encrypt-files option with limited success.  If I
write the line like this:
D:\GnuPG>gpg --recipient "Client Key" --encrypt-files
d:\directory\sub\test_file_1 d:\directory\sub\test_file_2
It encrypts the 2 files without an issue.
If I write it the way I see on a few different posts I get an error:
D:\GnuPG>gpg --recipient "Client Key" --encrypt-files d:\directory\sub\*
The error I get is:
gpg: can't open `D:\directory\sub\*': No such file or directory
gpg: encryption of `D:\ directory\sub\*' failed: file open error
I've tried with just the * and putting the executable in the same
directory, putting the path in quotes, etc.  Nothing seems to make it
work except listing all the files in the directory.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
