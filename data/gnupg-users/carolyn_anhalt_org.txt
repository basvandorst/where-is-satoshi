So true... Mailpile has actually managed to capture the simplicity at
just about the right level, I think. It has a great interface to walk
you through creating your key and setting it up to work with just
about any existing mail account. It's not quite ready for general
release, but the beta has been working pretty well for a while now.
Definitely support them if you can!
Until it's ready, I've found Mailvelope to be fairly simple as well
for webmail interfaces, which is about as simple as email gets these
days. Would either of those work for you?
