@_subject: GPG gives wierd data when trying to decrypt 
When i try to decrypt a file the letters in the terminal window get
its like they become encrypted, or maybe the terminal is displaying the
encrypted file in the window, i really don't know.
all i know is i can't decrypt any files that i've encrpyted.
using gpg --decrypt filename
on Unbuntu Dapper

@_subject: Generating and storeing keys on usb pen 
I want to generate a new key pair, but i want to save it to a usb pen drive so i can keep it safe.
I don't want any gpg keys stored on my laptop, in case it gets
lost or stolen, the culprits won't have access to my gpg keys.
So my questions is how do i tell gpg to look for my keys on a usb pen drive so i can encrypt and decrypt files on my laptop?
I looked in the 'How To's' and 'Guides' but didn't see anything
on generating keys on a pen drive.
Can i envoke a 'path' to my keys when i run gpg?
"gpg --encrypt path_to_keys_on_usb_drive filename"

@_subject: Can't generate new keys 
When i try to make a new key i get the following error:
gpg: no writable public keyring found: eof
Key generation failed: eof
I'm using Ubuntu 7.04 and logged on as regular user.
I've generated a key before but i used: sudo gpg --gen-key
that works fine.
I just can't seem to do it as regular user.
Do i have to be root to gen a new key pair?
