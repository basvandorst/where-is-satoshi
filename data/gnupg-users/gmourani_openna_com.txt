@_subject: gpg: keyblock resource `/root/.gnupg': file open error 
OS is as follow: RH 70, Kernel 2.4test8 GCC 2.96, GLIBC 2.1.91
Compile time is as follow:
CFLAGS=-static -O3 march=i686 funroll-loops fomit-frame-pointer \
./configure \
--prefix=/usr \
--mandir=/usr/share/man \
--enable-static-rnd=linux \
--disable-nls \
Compilation and installation success without problem.
The make check command return the following error: "expect" needed but
not found - test skipped / All tests passed
Now the problem is that I get the following errors from --gen-key:
gpg: keyblock resource `/root/.gnupg': file open error
gpg: keyblock resource `/root/.gnupg': file open error
