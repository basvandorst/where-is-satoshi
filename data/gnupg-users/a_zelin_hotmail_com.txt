@_subject: Integrity Protected Data Packet 
Hello all,
Currently I use gnupg 1.0.6 under linux. The new style of packet headers is used for Symmetrically Encrypted Integrity Protected Data Packet (Tag 18). I've faced a situation when the packet's length is 233 bytes which is more than 192 so two bytes shall be used for length representation according to the RFC, but I get only one byte that contains the length. According to the RFC it means that three bytes were used for length (233>223). So some receiving programs cannot interpret the packet well.
Could someone comment please: is it a bug or a feature of gpg and is it applied for all new style headers or just the packet in question.
Best regards and many thanks for your help.

Hi again,
Just found out that I faced with the partial body length.
Please ignore the previous post.
Best regards
