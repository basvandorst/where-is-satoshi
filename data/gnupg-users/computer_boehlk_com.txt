I totally agree to both statements
I do not agree with this one. IMHO the verification with a trusted GPG-Key is absolutely sufficiant and the checksum-proof is not needed at all.

The use cases are clear and I myself and some of my clients use them.
And when I speak from my point of view it is enough work to take care of
one key store and I personally do not want to have a second one; and
this second one has to be synchronized on every single endpoint as well.
That is twice the work.
From then on PGP and the second key store will be mandatory for the
purpose of signing and decrypting.
Yes, I got that of course.
It is just my lack of understanding TB's decision to not trying to adapt
a running system in a proper way.

Hello Patrick,

The standard user will not be able to work with that "solution".
Compared to the "enigmail-solution" this is the hell and bound to fail.
That is correct, but nevertheless it is mandatory to have and use a
single key-store.
As I stated before: This is a real problem. Multiple keys-stores are not
manageable and this planned solution is much more complicated than the
current with enigmail. Therefore it is bound to be a non-starter.

Hello Mark,
I totally agree. It is not possible to have more than one key store.
Synchronization always fails some time and the standard user cannot
handle it. So the only solution for TB will be to use GNUPG, because it
has the only key store for all platforms and has proved to work for
years. That results in the only possible solution for TB to integrate
the enigmail functionality into the code directly or live with the
enigmail plug-in. All other solutions are defective by design from start.
