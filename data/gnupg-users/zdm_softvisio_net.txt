@_subject: How to export private ed25519 subkey to the SSH format 
I want to use gpg as my primary keyring to store all keys.
But sometimes I need to get private key in SSH format to use directly
with SSH.
For example - deployment keys, to access private projects on github via
git from docker containers.
Is it currently possible to get private key in SSH format?
