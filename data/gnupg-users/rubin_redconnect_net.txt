@_subject: can't encrypt doc to myself 
I created a DSA/ElG key pair using --gen-key and then I tried to encrypt a
message to myself, getting the following errors:
[rubin gpg -ea -r rubin secret
gpg: No key for user ID
gpg: rubin skipped: public key not found
gpg: secret: encryption failed: public key not found
I don't understand why I can't access my own public key (the ID is correct as
far as --list-keys is concerned). I need help!
