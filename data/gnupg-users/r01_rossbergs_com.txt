@_subject: PGP or GnuPG 
I am trying to decide if I should use GnuPG or PGP and I got confused when
I read point nine in the PGP whitepaper
" To
me this say that "easy data recovery" is only a matter of money. Am I
right or where can I read about how ADK and key reconstruction etc
actually works.
Best regards,
