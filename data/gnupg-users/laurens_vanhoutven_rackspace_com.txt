@_subject: Generating  
I just acquired an OpenPGP v2.0 SmartCard. Works beautifully, except for one thing: no 4096 bit keys. I thought this would be supported, but when I try to generate a key with gpg ?card-edit, I can only select up to 3072 bits. I thought 4096 was supported on the v2 card, as long as you had GnuPG 2.0.18+, which I do:
gpg (GnuPG/MacGPG2) 2.0.26
libgcrypt 1.6.2
