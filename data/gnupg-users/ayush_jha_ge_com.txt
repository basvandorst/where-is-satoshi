@_subject: Error using wildcards in gnupg 
I am using gnupg version 1.2.1 .
I am able to decrypt files in a folder if I specify the file name in the
command for eg:
gpg -o c:\decryption\spacs.txt --decrypt "c:\decryption\wild
but if I use
gpg -o c:\decryption\spacs.txt --decrypt "c:\decryption\wild card\*.pgp"
I get file open error.
Point to be noted is that, the wildcard thing works if the file path is
continous for eg: gpg -o c:\decryption\spacs.txt --decrypt "c:\decryption\*.pgp"
works for me fine! but as soon as there is any included space in the file
path, it stops working.
I have tried with quotes , without quotes.
Any suggestions will be more than welcome.
