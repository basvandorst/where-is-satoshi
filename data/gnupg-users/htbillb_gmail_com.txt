@_subject: HP-UX and GnuPG 
We are on HP-UX ver 11.11 U 9000/800. GnuPG 2 was installed at
it: /usr/local/bin/gpg2. I can list keys and import keys. However, when
trying to generate keys or encrypt, we get this error: "no entropy
gathering module detected?. I was under the impression that EGD is part of
GPG, is there some reason why it isn?t seeing it? Or is it just not there?
