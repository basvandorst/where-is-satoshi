Hi all users of GnuPG.
This is my second question about gnupg and enigmail and LDAP keyserver.
When I wish search public key on my corporate  PGP keyserver  ( Version
7.0 for Windows NT/2000 and UNIX Copyright (c) 1998-2000 by Networks
Associates technology, Inc., and its Affiliated Companies)
I see:
--------------------begin cut---------------------------------------
C:\gnupg>gpg --keyserver ldap://ws2195.mncp.net --search-key chsv
gpg: searching for "chsv" from ldap server ws2195.mncp.net
(1)     Stanislav Chernyshev           2048 bit DSA key D2031C82, created: 2005-01-04
Keys 1-1 of 1 for "chsv".  Enter number(s), N)ext, or Q)uit > 1
gpg: requesting key D2031C82 from ldap server ws2195.mncp.net
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: Total number processed: 0
------------- end cut ------------------------------------------------
The key created with GNUPG v. 1.4.0 but  PGP  keyserver  change  header
on  my public  key
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: GnuPG v1.4.0 (MingW32)
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: PGPsdk 2.0.1 Copyright (C) 2000 Networks Associates Technology,

When, I wrote this letter on mailing-list "enigmail
to me have answered
------------ begin cut------------------------
I can only imagine that the keyserver you're using is not fully OpenPGP
compliant. For more details, you better ask the GnuPG users list
; there are several experts on key servers
subscribed to that list.
------------ end cut -------------------------
What can I do or where is find fully OpenPGP complaint keyserver?
What is this " no valid OpenPGP data found"?
Best regards
Stanislav Chernyshev.

Hi all users of GnuPG.
When I run GPG with options --keep-temp-file,
I has noticed, that by transfer of a key on a server
the service information and symbol CR is added
To the end of each line.
In initial armor  it is not present.
At import of this file, when I clean all CR and service information, all is good.
