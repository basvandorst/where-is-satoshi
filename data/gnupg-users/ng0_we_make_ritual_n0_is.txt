Okay, thanks. I'll read up on this.
Indeed, I did not see this the first time. Thanks, I'll address
questions I might have in the future to gnupg-devel.
We solved the packaging of gnupg-2.1.14 now to let gpgscm run and not
package it on its own like I first intended. Many packages depend on
this, so the updates did not make it into the recent 0.11 release image
of GuixSD and guix, but they are going to be built soon.
Thanks for taking the time to reply,

I'm one of the developers involved in Guix.
While doing the update of gnupg from 2.1.13 to 2.1.14 I found out
that you now include a modified version of tinyscheme for running
your tests/opengpg/ tests.
Are the changes you apply to tinyscheme generic enough to
contribute to upstream, so that we can just include a modified
tinyscheme software to run tests/opengpg/ tests during the check
phase of GnuPG?
If they aren't, could you move the gpgscm binary outside of the
source of gnupg to not include bundled dependencies, or in some
more convinient way for you?
As there seems to be no general developer list for GnuPG I'll use
this list, we can move the discussion elsewhere if it does not
fit in here.

@_subject: unable to decrypt a mail coming from apple mail 
I've just got an email where the X-Mailer is Apple Mail. It adds some
bits and pieces, is a 7bit Content-Transfer-Encoding and I fail to
decrypt it with gpg --decrypt (applied to the email as a file and also
when applied to the BEGIN/END PGP block).
The key is imported, still valid and yet I get:
gpg: decryption failed: No secret key
I'm running an unaltered Guix build here:
ng0 at shadowwalker ~$ gpg --version
gpg (GnuPG) 2.1.13
libgcrypt 1.7.3
Help is welcome
