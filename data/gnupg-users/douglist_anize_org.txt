@_subject: on topic (was: OT) 
Let's keep things rational: Engage in the human rights movement.
War is a neccessary evil, this war might not be a neccessary war but
there are times when politics must be carried out by other means.
Blanket, unequivocal statements like no war are frivolous and do nothing
to furthur the intellectual discourse...

@_subject: export single UID of a key 
He really only proves that he has the secret key on his disk and that he
brute forced the password to the key. For most purposes this seems
reasonable. However if you rely on an encrypted challenge and then sign
the key you could improve it a little more by having a time limit. Three
or four days does not seem like enough time to brute force a reasonable
passphrase (~10 characters). But this is all napkin math...

@_subject: CA Cert (cacert.org) - a new, non-profit CA 
You have to give them a national ID number? And they use it as your
personal identifier? I could go register every combination of NYS
drivers licenses right now and no one from NY would be able to register
for this. This would probably be a plus for NYS but this site is a
little nuts...

@_subject: subkey types and preferences... 
Is there any consensus about which signing subkey type is better, RSA
or DSA? And or for that matter El Gamal vs. RSA for encryption? What are
the merits/drawbacks of the different key types?
 The next questions are about the preferences for keys:

Why does my image uid have different preferences than my first UID? I
imagine that it is because the uid was added with a newer version of
gnupg. Should I update the preferences of ID 1 to match those of UID2?
And while we are on the subject of preferences are there any other
preferences that I should update? I generated a test key with 1.2.4 and
the default preferences are:
(1). default default      Cipher: AES256, AES192, AES, CAST5, 3DES
     Digest: SHA1, RIPEMD160
     Compression: ZLIB, ZIP, Uncompressed
     Features: MDC
I generated a new key with 1.3.6 and the preferences are the same except
for the addition of the keyserver no-modify setting. I am most concerned about security and the overwhelming majority of my
communications are with people who use gnupg. With that in mind should I
go with the default updpref or is there a set of preferences that would
match my tin-foil hat better?
Finally, I noticed that werner's key 57548DCD, has more than the normal
two digest prefs that I have run across. Out of curiosity is there a
good reason to have a short or long list of preferred ciphers/digests? Thanks a lot...
