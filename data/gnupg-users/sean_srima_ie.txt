Hello Gnupg-users,
 I      am      playing      with      auto-key-locate     (as     per
    however   this  is  under
 Vista.  Does the Windows port not have pka lookup enabled during the
 build, I see ldap works but pka and cert don't

[Sorry last should have gone to list only)
Hello Werner,
I  have  both gpg 1 and 2 installed and neither seem to include it. mI
was trying to build gpg myself but hitting a problem with libcurl.
The command line I am using is:
gpg2 --no-default-keyring --keyring /temp/gpg --encrypt --armor --auto-key-locate pka -r sean at srima.eu
The return is
gpg: invalid auto-key-locate list

A friend on the pgpnet mailing list is using a hushmail.com gpg key but
when I import it, I get:
C:\Users\Sean Rima>gpg --import < test.txt
gpg: key C4E23A82: accepted non self-signed user ID
""********* <---- at hushmail.com>"
gpg: key C4E23A82: public key ""---- at hushmail.com" "
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1  (RSA: 1)
If I edit the key, I see:

I see there is no encrytion subkey.
If I look at the key with --list-packets, I see

{think I sent my last wrong}
Ok, on this, I unstalled gpg 2.0.10 and installed 1.4.10b and I can
import and encrypt to Hushmail keys. Does this mean that gpg 2.0.10 is
broken or is it correctly handling the key where 1.4.10b is not

Yes the key is generated by hushmail.com. Not sure if they will listen
to me, but I will forward this to the list where the problem
Thanks for the help and sorry for top posting, on my BlackBerry (and
sadly no gnupg)

I downloaded and installed gpg4win-2.0.2rc1. I then tested my pka setup
echo "foo" | gpg2 --no-default-keyring --keyring c:\temp\gpg --encrypt

I am a long time SuSE user but due to various hardware constraints, I
cannot use it on my main pc. I have 2 linux boxes running other apps
I did put Linux on the main box but lost use of my iPod Touch. Now I am
changing to a general MP3 player so will try again

I tried dan's link and then uploaded a copy to my fastmail.fm account
C:\Users\Sean>echo "foo" | gpg2 --no-default-keyring --keyring
c:\temp\gpg --encrypt --armour --auto-key-locate pka -r sean at srima.ie
gpg: requesting key 688B7D98 from http server thecivvie.fastmail.fm
gpg: key 688B7D98: public key "Sean Rima (Sean's Key) "
gpg: no need for a trustdb check with `always' trust model
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
gpg: automatically retrieved `sean at srima.ie' via PKA
So I have have PKA working, and now to setup CERT :)
I will continue to test
Thanks to all
