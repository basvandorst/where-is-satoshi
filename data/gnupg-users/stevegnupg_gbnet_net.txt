No, sensible list software leaves the From: alone, so when someone
posts to the list, replies go to that person.

I used the patch posted to the list by Dr.Stefan.Dalibor
which seemed to work, I'll try this one as soon as the tests have
finished (also failed on 1024 test).

Sorry meant to say forcing it BigEndian worked fine.

I think David Shaw posted a fix for 1.2.2 but I've lost it, whatever it
was should probably go into the release.

OK, actually found the mail archives and worked it out, but as you point
out it's a bug ...

@_subject: Two convicted in U.K. for refusal to decrypt data 
I think the point is that they were done under RIP and you can be
prosecuted for refusing to hand over keys to encrypted systems.
It's unlikely a judge would find you guilty (or a jury) if you didn't
have the keys).
All in the name of terrorism though ...

Currently encryption isn't banned, however say you encrypt an email and
send it to someone and the 'authorities' want to read it, they can then
force you to hand over the keys and if you refuse, you go to jail until
you do ...
There are other major issues like equipment interference and bulk
interception to name a few.

Unfortunately it doesn't matter if it's needed, it's becoming law (well
it's already law under RIP, but DRIP 'expires' this year, so now
enshrined under IP Act).
It's a blanked law to ensure what's being done already is now legalised.

Have a look on Google Streetview around Bude (in Cornwall), what was C&W
land all their cables there (very pretty little cove, with a concrete
hut at the top). 'Oddly' there's a GCHQ 'listening' station right next
door and allegedly they don't even need to tap the cables, they're just
given a splice. (Again allegedly) they have the capability to store 30
days worth of traffic while they do any analysis of stuff and can then
move any interesting data elsewhere for further analysis.
Already doing bulk intercept, now just legitimising it ...
