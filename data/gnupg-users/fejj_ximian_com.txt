not necessarily, but it is possible that we will fail in that case, yes.
Since Mutt implements rfc3156 (which has quite possibly the largest
userbase for people actually interested in signing their messages), we
decided it was better for us to support rfc3156 rather than the older
rfc2015 like we did in Evolution 1.0.x
Although, if you want to, you should be able to modify Evolution sources
to conform to rfc2015 instead of rfc3156 by removing just a few lines of
code (the code that adds an additional stream filter to chomp excess
Out of curiosity, what clients support rfc2015 but not rfc3156?
Mutt can verify afaict.

Well, now it is my turn to appologise :-)
I now see how you reached your conclusion. I should have been more
precise I guess.
good good :-)
Aha, it seems it does set the CANON_STRIP flag when verifying as well.
This should probably be considered a bug. I will send a patch in for
review right away.
We should only be using CANON_CRLF.
seems there is also a bug in Evolution :-)
All is forgiven :-)
