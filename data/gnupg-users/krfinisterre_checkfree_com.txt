I am not subscribed to this list so please mail me directly at
Does anyone know of a company that will do commercial support of gnupg for
people that live in the usa. There are several German based companies but
not many willing to support the US.
It is possible that I will need support on at least 2 tiers... possibly
customer / end user level and positively an administrative level support .
Please advise.

Currently we provide the following pricing model for overseas support:
 2nd. Level Support: 50 Euro per incident prepaid in blocks of 10
                     incidents. In total 500 Euro.  Email only, no
                     phone support. Support provided by us (OpenIT
                     GmbH, Germany).
 3rd. Level Support: 110 Euro per hour with a minimum charge of one
                        hour.  Alternatively 100 Euro per hour for a
                        prepaid budget of at least 5 hours.  Email only
                        but depending on the problem we might call you
                        back.  Actual Support will be handled by g10 Code
                        GmbH, Germany.
As I told you some time ago, we are in contact with serveral US
companies in order to setup a support network in the US.  When
everything is on the run in the US you may choose to get your support
there; your prepayments will then be transferred.

Quality of service and response time still need to be worked out but this
is a very good start. This came straight down the pipe from Werner Koch who
is the author of the program... and this will be the best we can do until
the get their us base of operations going.
