@_subject: Retrieving public key from smartcard 
Hi everyone, I am using one of these g10code/PPC OpenPGP cards.
Works (nearly) perfectly at home (where I created my keypair). Now I would like to use the card with another PC.
Unfortunately I have only my OpenPGP card and no
copy of my public key. How is it possible to retrieve the public key
from the card and set up GnuPG to work with
this card that is already set up (I do not
want to create a new key pair!)
Any help appreciated! Thanks very much!

Isn't it possible to create the public key again with the card?

If it isn't possible a short note should be added to the documentation to
remind everyone to backup the public key immediately after creation. Kind regards
