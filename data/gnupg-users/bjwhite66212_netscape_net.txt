@_subject: Secure memory setuid 
GPG 1.2.0 is installed on my computer with Linux 2.4.18-10.  When starting gpg I get:
gpg: WARNING: using insecure memory!  I have tried to setuid(root) for gpg with the command:  chmod a+s gpg.  The directory reads:  -rws--x--x   1 root  root  619833 Feb 22  2002 /usr/bin/gpg
What else needs to be done to setuid for root?
