Please consider KMail, too. It has the best OpenPGP integration you will find in any (Linux) mailer. Furthermore, the right people for the job are working to make it even better for KDE3.1 (ie. adding PGP/MIME support).
For the organizer part, consider KOrganizer and for the palm pilot part consider KPilot ;-)

Nope. Lost is lost.
You can revoke the self-signature of the UID you want to "delete". Like=20
with whole keys, there's almost nothing that you can delete on=20

You shouldn't even sign keys of persons that haven't given their key's=20

Depends. If you went to a keysigning event, you most likely exchanged=20
sheets of paper with key fingerprints on them. The other person will=20
download your key from a keyserver, sign the key, and either
1. upload it to one or more keyservers again.
   (in this case, you'd just need a gpg --recv-keys )

2. send it to you in private mail.
