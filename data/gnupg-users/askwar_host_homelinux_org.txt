Jabber allows you to connect to it thru a SSL connection.  And further,
you can easily install your own Jabber server in your intranet.  See
 for more details.
In case you wonder, jabber is an OpenSource IM system.  If you want to,
you can also have it connect to AIM, ICQ, MSN, Yahoo and thus chat to
users of these systems from your Jabber client.
