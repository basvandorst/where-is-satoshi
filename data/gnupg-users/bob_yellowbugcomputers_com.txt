@_subject: gpg vs gpgv default keyring directory... 
Hello Everyone. I'm hoping someone can clear up some confusion for me. I'm running gnupg-1.2.3-3.1.92.mdk on Mandrake 9.2.
I see that gpg stores the public keys in ~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg
I also noticed the gpgv command, which is supposed to be a short hand way of verifying a file? It appears that the gpgv command stores or is looking for the public keys here:
Why are there two different spots to store the keyrings? If the gpgv command is supposed to be a subset of the gpg command why is there a difference? It seems like the gpgv command does not see any of the keys I have in my keyring.
Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated!!

Thanks for the help so far. I did some further searching on this list and others. Here is one answer I found to my question of the difference between gpg and gpgv:
"GPG works fine, but GPGV is unusable! I cannot make it find my keyring when verifying signatures and thus I get an errormessage.
It works OK verifying the signatures with GPG instead.
Why does not GPGV use the same settings as used by GPG?"
"gpgv uses a different trust model and stores its keys in a separate
file under a different name."
So if my goal is to only every verify files and not ever encrypt anything I would stick with the gpgv tool? If my goal is to be able to both verify files and encrypt files I would go with the more robust tool of gpg?
For a moment I thought the two tools were related, but they appear to be two different tools that store the keys in two different places, and they are not really compatible with each other.
Does all this sound right? I'm just trying to puzzle this out. Thanks for the help. ---------- Original Message ----------------------------------
