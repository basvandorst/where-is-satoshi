@_subject: UID of secret key gone! 
after trying to import my old PGP 2.6.3 key in GPG, I had to discover that
my GPG secret key had lost it's User ID (so that I can't sign with it in
most applications):
joerg > gpg --list-secret-key
pub  1024D/68FBD67F 2000-01-18 Joerg Ziefle sub  1024g/CB70CD4D 2000-01-18
Is there a way to recover the secret key, that means to edit the secret
key to get back its User ID?
Many thanks in advance,

Now I can generate a revocation certificate, but the key server doesn't
accept it. Here follows the error message which I get after sending the
key to the server:
Public Key Server -- Add
Key block in add request contained no new
keys, userid's, or signatures.
Your key block contained 1 format errors,
which were treated as if the erroneous elements
hadn't been part of your submission.
The errors were outside of any PGP public key;
maybe you didn't send a public key block at all.
Anyway, the last error encountered was:
Key block corrupt: signature without key
The local copy of the keys has exactly the same UIDs & sigs as the key on
the server.
Please help!
