@_subject: Technical  help please re: installing GnuPG... 
OK...so I am up to Installation on Wiundows NT/2000/XP (my program is Windows Home/Professional XP).
Now I have just extracted GnuPG files and am looking at them  in my GnuPG file in C:/Program Files.  The installation guide I am following here, point 3, states that if I used GnuPG zip, I will have a directory full of files which need sorting out.!  Well, until I went to explore this file, there was only one file which was:  gnupg-1.2.6.  When I went to explore this file I found several files and, what appears to be some pages.  Now the installation instructions said I should make two subdirectories.  I already had a file cal Doc in the files I opened; but, di make a locale file.  Then I went to try to sort out .mo file and .exe files; but, none of the files that I saw had such extensions.  The file icons themselves showed now extensions and the icons that look like pages had either no extensions on their names or were called .logfile,  or .sh ; but, I see no .mo files or .exe to sort these files by.
Help pleasse.

@_subject: Failed installation test of GnuPG 
To Whom It May Concern:
So I have very patiently spent most of this day following the installation directions for GnuPG; and, now that I go to test its installation the command prompt window says:
'gpg is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
Help pleases....
