@_subject: import key to spefic keyring 
Hi all, bit of a newbie here with gpg.
I have imported a public key onto the root user keyring (because I was
logged in a root) using the basic:
gpg --import < samson.asc But I would like to specifically import the same keyring for user apache,
who of course, does not have a usera ccount that I can log in to.  Like I
said, I am a bit of a newbie here.  I'm guess I'm trying to do something
gpg -u apache --import < samson.asc So that the public is added to apache's keyring, and not root's.  Then I
want to specify trust for that public key on apache's keyring, again from
root's login.
I am doing this so that a php script can call gpg through with user apache
permissions.  Thanks in adance for any help you an offer!

Thanks so much!  Just to clarify for the list archives, the option is
--homedir /home/username
(no - between home and dir)
I had to use this option for on all commands related to user apache,
including the encrypt command specified in my PHP script (even though PHP is
running under apache, and usre apache already).
There are so many arguments, options and commands involved with gpg, and
they all sound so similar that I was getting confused reading them all!

Hash: SHA1
gpg --home-dir /home/apache --import < samson.asc
This should work, but I am not sure how the permissions are set for user
same thing, as long as you use the --home-dir option, you should be
working on the keyring for that user.  AFAIK.
