@_subject: Signature, fingerprint or public key? 
Sorry if this question is going to be too basic for some of you.
I have generated my set of keys and have also uploaded them to the
keyserver.net server. The very basic questions are,
1. What is the commonly used means of identification? This is for email
   identification and document/Web Pages authetication etc.? Is it public key,
   Signature or fingerprint?
2. How do you request Mutt to show if the email has a GPG/PGP authentication/
   identification key attached to it?
At this time I am more interested in authentication rather than encryption.
When I run the command,
I get my public key listed. At the default key size (1024 bits), the output
is rather large. I would hesitate to add my public key as a means of
identification, for a 2 or 3 line email note.
Any advice as to what is the best method of identification is appreciated for
email and other documents.
Thank you in advance.

@_subject: Password Prompt 
How do I avoid password prompt to --clearsign a document? How do I do the
same for email? It would become really annoying to type a password each time
you want to send a signed email.
Thank you for any help.

@_subject: Mutt and signing email 
I have the following setting in my .muttrc and I am trying to sign the email
in clear text before sending it out.
When I send myself a test message, Mutt prompts me for PGP password. I am using
GPG and typed in the GPG password, then the following error message shows up,
"Can't open PGP subprocess!: No such file or directory (errno = 2)"
I am using the "Mutt-i, GnuPG and PGP Howto" document to sign my email. In the
document (section 6.5), it recommends the use of the following command,
When I insert this command in .muttrc, Mutt complains that the command doesn't
exist. I do not see it in the Mutt manual either.
Is there any other howto or manual that explains, how to sign the email and
how to verify received email?
Thank you in advance.

@_subject: Which Keyserver??? 
I am trying to verify the keys from a signed email. Mutt seems to be trying
to connect to the  but always get the following error,
[-- PGP output follows (current time: Fri Apr 13 20:00:48 2001) --]
gpg: Signature made Tue Apr 10 01:15:43 2001 /etc/localtime using RSA key ID

gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: Can't check signature: public key not found
[-- End of PGP output --]
The key id here has been changed. When I try to verify the key manually at the
 there is no key to be found. What are the commonly used
key servers? Are they different for GPG and PGP?
Thank you in advance for any info.

@_subject: Which Keyserver??? 
Thank you for replying and the server info. In the options file, there is a
command to list the keyservers.
   $ host -l pgp.net | grep www
I have tried this and got a long list of servers along with the some of the
servers you mentioned. Do I need to upload my public key to all these servers
or do the key servers exchange the new/updated keys? The main server I relied
on until now was  It looks like you need to add you public
key ID AND the keyserver name as part of the signature. If there is better
and transparent solution, please do let me know.
Thank you once again.

@_subject: Password reset 
I have created my keys a while ago but have not used it as much as I wanted
to. The worst part of it is that now I am begining to exchange some work
files with my team and I cannot remember my password. Now I cannot sign the
keys they sent to me. Everytime I use the "--sign-key" option, I am prompted
for a password. I have tried all from the set of passwords I use.
Is there any way to reset the password on this key? I would like to avoid
creating a new key.
Thanks for any help.

True and I did think about it. Again, countering good security, I wanted the
flexability. Next time I will be more careful with my keys password.
My key was set to expire at the end of September. Will the public on the
key servers become completely obsolete to sign or encrypt anything? I would
hate to have a key hanging out there. I do have revocation certificate for them.
If I need password to revoke a certificate, then I might as well forget
those keys for good.
Thanks to all the repliers input.

What about the revoked key? I have revoked my old key and send it to the
keyservers. Can a revoked key be used to sign a document or email? If you can,
then isn't that something that could be used to mislead a user about the
authenticity of the document or email?

@_subject: Key syntax 
I have a question about the items in the first column when I list my keys,
secret or public. I understand the "sec" is "secret" and "pub" is "public" key.
What are the "ssb" and "sub" part of the key?

@_subject: Signing your own key 
Some of the keys used by several folks for their email, the email client (Mutt)
says something like "key is good but it is not signed". What is the purpose
of signing a key? If I were to sign the key, is it applied to the public as well
as the private key?
Thank you for any info.

@_subject: Port # of the keyserver 
What port does gpg connect to on the keyserver to receive keys? Users on the
the internal network are not able to import keys from the key servers. If I
know the port I can configure the routers to allow outbound access for the
specific port. Would the port # on the keyserver be different for GPG and PGP?
Thanks for any info.

I don't know how often everyone regenerates a new key. I tend to have a key
for atleast one year (similar to the password policy). Is it possible to edit
the expiration date of the current key? (possibly to extend the expiration

Can you elaborate? AFAIK resetting expiry time requires new self-signature
so it is not a flaw..

Why is it a flaw? All I want is to extend the key without having to revoke and
regenerating a key.

I have installed the plugin but do not find any help pages on how to use

It is no more flaw that the one lately announced about not-signing date,
originator and recipients of the message.
By definition if an attacker have your secret key, he can do anything. You
may call it a flaw in whole pulic key cryptography concept.
