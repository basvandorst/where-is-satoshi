@_subject: Compiling libgcrypt with ECC 
Hi all,
I want to compile a lightweight version of libgcrypt with Public Key
encryption using Elliptic curve cipher, but what do I feed on the
./configure command line for " --enable-ciphers" parameter? Is there a list
of ciphers? Can't find this info in README, INSTALL or the html docs.
If Elliptic curve public key cryptography is not yet implemented what
cipher would you recommend me to use so the compiled library would be of
the smallest possible size?
Thanks in advance
