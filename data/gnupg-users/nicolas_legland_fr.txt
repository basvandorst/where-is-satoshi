@_subject: Key-binding signature notation 
Dear list.
I have a perfectly functional key for certification, with an
encryption sub-key and one other for signature. How could I add a
notation to the key-binding signatures?
I could generate a new sub-key, with a key-binding signature notation:
  gpg --cert-notation  --edit-key  addkey
But given my existing key and sub-keys, how do I add a new notation?
How can I generate a new key-binding signature with the notation I
want? Likewise, how could I add a preferred keyserver? Or a policy URI
like 0xFFCE1C9A4FADF197 has?
Thank you in advance.
