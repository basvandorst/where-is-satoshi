@_subject: Sendmail and GnuPG wrapper 
Hi all,
I have the following scenario:
Anybody knows about an encription wrapper through GnuPG and Sendmail to a=
the sending and receiving of encrypted/signed messages?
I have read that Baltimore have an encription solution:
That give you the following advantages:
Anybody knows any GPL solution to provide similar functionality with Send=
and GnuPG? It's a bad solution? It's good?
I think that the implementation can be easy, but I'm not a hacker of send=
'cos you only need a linux box with sendmail and gpg, and filter the inpu=
t from
SMTP port to a script, to find the sender and the receiver from the gpg k=
database and then sign, encrypt (if we have private and public keys) or d=
modify the mail message.
The incoming messages can be parsed through the same script to decrypt de=
 mail
or verify the signature, giving the result to the destination user.

The only "intuitive" interface is the nipple.
After that, it's all learned.
