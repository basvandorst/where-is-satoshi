@_subject: Manually seeding CSPRNG? 
Hello everybody,
I have a simple question. I've been reading the "Random Numbers" chapter
from the Libgcrypt Reference Manual and I haven't seen a way to manually
establishing the seed of the CSPRNG algorithms (may be because that
could make a CSPRNG produce not Cryptographically Secure random
sequences if the seed is not adequate?), so, my question is if it would
be possible to manual-seed any libgcrypt CSPRNG algorithm (and if there
is a "quick" way -a function or similar- for doing so) or if it is not
Thank you.

I'm not a Windows user, so I'll explain what I'll do in Linux, but I
suppose it'll be pretty similar and you shouldn't have much problems...
If I'm mistaken in something, I'm sure somebody will correct me.
If you lose your private key and you don't have a backup, then it means
you won't be able to decipher messages ciphered with your public key or
sign messages (at least not with the keypair you lost). You can burn it
to a CD/DVD or copy it to any other storage device if you previously
export it to a file, but, and quoting from gpg man page, that might not
be a good idea (in security terms):
       --export-secret-keys
       --export-secret-subkeys
              Same as --export, but exports the secret keys instead.
        	      This is normally not very useful and a security risk.
So, if you are going to copy it somewhere, first make sure that the
CD/DVD or whatever will be safe (in a degree depending on your needs, of
You can list all the keys you have in your system with gpg --list-keys
option, once you've identified the key you want to export, you can
export it with gpg --output  --export  (for the public
key) and gpg --ouput  --export-private-keys  for the
private key.
With the OpenPGP plugin for Thunderbird, if you go to "OpenPGP > Key
Management", you can see the keys OpenPGP is aware of, and you can
export any one of them right clicking on it, and you can import a new
key from a file in "File > Import Keys from File".
Hope that helps.
