@_subject: Using single subkey for both signing and encryption? 
Hi, I just have a basic question about subkeys.  When I create an RSA
subkey I only have the option to create one for signing or encryption,
not both.  Why is that?  There's nothing different about the keys
themselves, is there?  Is there supposed to be some increased security
to doing it this way?
