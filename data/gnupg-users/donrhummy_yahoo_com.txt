All the examples of using GnuPG are of giving it a local filename to encrypt or decrypt. How do I pass it data, either as a stream or byte by byte?

OK, so I need to put the data into the out stream. Can you give some sample code from C doing this? I'm not 100% clear on the order, etc of calling gpg and sending the data to "out." Thanks!

What does GPG have to recover my data if i forgot my password?

thanks. One question on the revocation certificate:
If I use it to "revoke" the key, does that mean i cna then create a new key and thus retrieve everything stored under the previous password/key with the new one? What does revoking it do?
