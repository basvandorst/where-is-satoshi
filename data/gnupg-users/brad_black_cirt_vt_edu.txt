@_subject: Combining Secret Keys 
OK, thanks for the tip. So, I won't need to change anything publicly? Currently, I publish the public keys on a website... nothing to change there? To go from three to one, I will import two of the private keys into the remaining private key. Is it then OK to delete the individual secret keys that I imported? What about revocation certs... are the ones I have now OK, or should they be re-generated?
I apologize for all the questions... just don't wan t to screw this up.
Thanks again,

Tar it up and symmetrically encrypt it. Use a strong pass phrase.
Store the encrypted tar file in various places (USB, gmail, bank
safety deposit box, lawyers office, girlfriend's house, etc.) Write
the pass phrase down and keep it in your bank box.
I (personally) don't do this. I just tar up .gnupg with no symmetric
encryption. In theory, this is a bad idea.  With a good pass phrase
however, in practice, there is nothing wrong with it. The weak link is
the pass phrase, so use a good one and don't worry too much.
