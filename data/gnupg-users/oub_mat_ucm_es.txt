@_subject: same key: pgp 2.6 version and gpg version: keyserver 
Several years ago I submitted my pgp 2.6 to the key server
Now I successfully exported that key to gpg. (The key as in both
program the same ID)
I would like to submit  both version of the same  key to a more
recent key server like sks.keyserver.penguin.de.
Is this possible, or would the same key in different flavours cause
problems and confusions?
Thanks Uwe Brauer

I am confused.  From what I read pgp 2.6 and gpg are not compatible,  [1]
I cannot as a gpg user use the pgp public key in order to send a
message. Do you agree?
So if there are then "two versions" of the same key, which is to submit?
[1] as a matter of fact I  had to erase the  password for the pgp
    key before importing, because otherwise it did not work, that
    is I could not use my imported pgp key withing gpg.

Aha, I asked some weeks ago about how to import my pgp 2.6 to gpg,
because following the rules mentioned above
gpg --import private.pgp and the alike did NOT work, that is I used the imported key and tried
to send myself a message using enigmail and failed, the reason seems to be IDEA (well you can compile IDEA support into
gpg however this is not standard.)
See the messages:
and especially Where Werner advice to empty the pass-phrase in pgp2.6 import it to gpg
and then introduce a pass-phrase.
So I conclude from that that a pgp2.6 with IDEA protected pass-phrase
is NOT the same as the imported key into gpg, where the pass phrase is
protected by other algorithm.

Since it seems my original message did not arrive, I resend it and

So this message is sent to a (virtual) newsgroup, and maybe

I think it would make it easier to interchange public keys.
I have tried over many years to encourage my friends to use pgp, one of
the obstacles was the extraction and interchange of the public keys.
I started to use smime recently and besides its flaws I have to admit
that the key interchange is easier (most likely be more insecure)    > You could do all of this within the existing OpenPGP specification, but

Your point being?
I presume it goes like this: NSA is  "a government based
organisation" doing, among other things, violations of civil rights.
So any other government based organisation cannot be trust, end of
Well I just talked  about a service, which provides certificates to its
citizen. That means it signs a public/private key pair, which is
generated by the, hopefully open source, crypto module of your browser.
So either you claim to have evidence that this modules have been hacked
and the key pair is transferred to some of these evil organisations or I
really don't see your point.

Ok let me try to answer this point by point. Before doing I want to
emphasise that I am taking a very pragmatic point of view here.[1]
    -  NSA (among others) has abused its resource to read email
       worldwide at a very large scale.
    -  so if a lot of people, say 30 % of all users would encrypt their
       email, then NSA statistical approach would *not* work that smooth
       and this is a good thing.
    -  so encrypting email should be easy and look trustful for a
       majority of users     -  usually public/private key based methods are considered relative
       secure (Even Snowden claimed that you could rely on them), this
       does not mean that the NSA could not read your email. They would
       usually try to enter your machine installing a keylogger or
       something like this. But this is beyond the statistical method I
       mentioned above.
    -  if I understand correctly the real problem is not security of the
       the cipher but the authenticity of the sender and so the most
       common attack is a man in the middle attack. This is true for
       both smime and gpg. So comparing fingerprints of public key is a
       good thing, which most of us, I presume, don't do.
    -  from my own experience I am convinced that smime is much easier
       than gpg[2] for reasons  I am not going to repeat here. (I got 7
       out of 10 of my friends/colleagues to use smime, but 0 of 10 to
       use gpg.)
    -  one of the reasons some of them hesitated was the fact that the
       certificates were offered by some commercial company they did not
       know and trust.[3]
       They would have had installed it from a government based
       organisation, say the ministry of justice though.
    -  so if some government based organisation would do what say commodo
       does it would send a signal to the public that it takes privacy
       seriously and I think it would encourage more people  to use smime.
    -  Private certificates, are unfortunately no solution. Yes it is
       possible with openssl to generate them, I have done that
       myself. However it is very difficult till impossible to convince
       the main email programs, such as outlook, thunderbird or Apple
       mail to use them or to use public keys sent by such
       certificates. [4]
Uwe Brauer [1]  I must add that I don't share your general view about government
     based organisations. I still hope that abuse is the exception not
     the  rule..
[2]  although pgp seems technically better, since some implementations of
     smime allow a relative short symmetric key
[3] (Besides these companies have a certain business model and their
       free certificates last short and expire usually after one year.)
[4]  I finally managed to use them in thunderbird, but is was
     complicated not something the regular user would like to do.

Well take for example iOs: using pgp is a sort of a nightmare.
The reasons why I think smime is easier to use for the average user are:
smime is already installed in most MUA (so no additional software+plugin)
keypairs are generated and signed  by the "trust center".
Public keys are automatically embedded in the signatures.

Aha I see you use the BAT, an email program I have not seen in use, for
almost a decade.
Good and bad news. Gpgsm allowed my to use your public keys after having
fireing up a series of questions, iOs also, (if you don't mind I send
you to test messages later privately) However thunderbird refuses to
use yoru public key claiming it cannot be trusted. So I am afraid the issue is to persuade the not only the people but also the software.

Well I was referring to the following 10 years old bug
I have the feeling this is a design decision by  "philosophy":
thunderbird/semonkey don't encourage the use of self-signed certificates
(BTW I just learn that there is a add-on, key-manager which generates
self-signed certificates, similar as it seems to me to the BAT.
At first I thought that I need to use openssl in order to extract your
cert and import in under authorities openssl pkcs7 -in MFPA.p7 -inform DER -print_certs > out.cert
(Which would be bad, because command line openssl is not what the
average user would call, comfortable and windows users have to install
openssl a part)
However it is not necessary I just export our signature as a pem file
and import in under authorities. Still this is very uncomfortable...
Uwe Brauer BTW, I see you switched back to pgp, but why do you use old inline mode
and not pgpmine?

That is really odd, I have successfully interchanged s/mime emails, with
users using thunderbird or outlook + windows + Comodo certificates.
None of them had to install the root certificates. It seems to me that
the BAT does not support Comodo CA.

Good, so if I understand that correctly once I have the new certificate
then I only have to import it into gpgsm and gpgsm will know by the date of the
certificate which certificate to use for which message?
    -  old for old messages
    -  the new for the new messages

Now I am confused. Most likely my knowledge of certificates is not
correct. (I played around with openssl to generate my own, useless,
I thought a certificate consists of a key pair (private/public) which is
signed by the Authority (here comodo).
When I apply for a certificate, the keypair is generated by the crypto
module of the browser and then signed.
So I thought when I apply for a new certificate  a new key pair
is generated which gets signed again.
But your comment above seems to indicate that the old pair gets a new
signature. Is this correct?  But what if I apply with a different
browser I applied the last time.

So gpgsm (and others) will also figure out which private key to use for
signing: that is the new one, once the old certificate is expired? Which means in the case of smime, also to embedd the corresponding
new public key in the signature.

Well comodo is free (still) and to prolong the certificate  seems free to for
the moment, but I agree I would prefer a government based organisation

I don't want to enter a flame war here and in principle I'd prefer gpg
over smime but in reality I have to use smime, because
    -  it is implemented in almost all MUA while gpg is not[1]
    -  it is so much easier to install for the people I communicate with
       than gpg. I recall that I tried to convince gpg and after some hours he almost
yelled at me, while he was able to set up smime in 5 minutes.
The reasons for this are the following.
    -  As I said smime is already installed in almost all MUA, so no
       need to install gpg and to install a plugin for the MUA
    -  the user does not have to generate a keypair. Well this is not
       entirely true, as we mentioned earlier, but the user applies for
       a certificate picks it up and he is set.
    -  the user does not have to exchange public keys, he just sends a
       signed message which includes his public key.
So if the big MUAS and not only thunderbird, but at least outlook apple
mail, and iOS mail, would
    -  support gpg natively
    -  when use gpg in the mailreader for the first time, it would
       silently generate a key pair
    -  when sending a signed message it would always embed the public
       key in the signature
Then a think gpg would be as easy to use as smime, but till then....

Right there is a misunderstanding. What you say is of course correct so during exportation and importation no password is asked, however when
I want to *use* the key then I must provide the password.
However it seems that the application expects for some reason another a
password during the import process.

Well, first of all the university decided to use (as a understand,
without charge) gmail services, since they could not effort to run their
own server.
Now to the question s/mime versus gnupg.
There are the following points which make s/mime easier.
    1. Key generation. In s/mime you apply for a certificate and don't
       have to generate the key by yourself.
    2. Key interchange. This is in my experience the biggest problem for
       most users. In s/mime it is sufficient to send a sign message, it
       contains the public key of the sender (I don't want now to enter
       the technical details)
    3. Software: if you use a proper MTA s/mime is usually included,
       while pgp is not, but a plugin has to be installed.
If the user is using gmail's webinterface, which, unfortunately more and
more users are doing, things get more complicated. You mentioned
mailvelop, but again this is a plugin to be installed, while now gmail
(at least for its business/academic suite) offers s/mime support
Last but not least, a lot of people in my university now posses a first
class certificate anyhow, provided by the Spanish administration, which can be
used for all sort of things, one of them to use it for encrypted emails.
I hope that makes it clear why s/mime is preferred of pgp.

You are not going to belive that. I deactivated the s/mime support of

I suspect that this internal s/mime support decrypts the message and
copies it in my folder, which is really bad. Unfortunately I cannot investigate this issue, since my university lacks
experts in that matter.

Ah, sorry for the sloppy formulation. You are completely right.
The process is, usually[1], as follows
    1. For example using Comodo, you apply for a certificate.
    2. Your keypair is generated by your own crypt module of the
       browser (quite some time ago I had a look at the corresponding
       javascript and it did not look suspicious).
    3. You receive a link via email, which you have to open with the
       same browser and the same computer and your keys get signed.
However the user usually does not notice all these steps, and this is
what I meant.
In the case for pgp the user has to generate a keypair him/herself and
believe me, for most users this is much more complicated than 'applying
for a certicate in comodo'.
[1]  there is one exception      they really generate a keypair and send it to you, no kidding. That
     seems to me a mayor security breach, to say the least

I think this is a severe security breach. The private key should never
leave your computer.

Comodo does not offer this any more. At the beginning of the year they
reduced the smime cerificates validity from 1 year to 1 month, now they
withdraw it all together.

Well yes sort of, but I can tell you from my own experience PGP is more for
hackers while smime is not. I have convinced 6 of my friends to use
smime, but only one to pgp.
Self signed smime certificates are basically useless, because then you
have to tell the other user either to install a root certificate or to
trust the certificate, in which case smime looses its convenience
(compared to pgp)

Hi I received a smime signed message, however it turns out that I cannot
use it for encrypting my responsce
Since    > gpgsm: issuer certificate:  GlobalRoot Class 2,OU=T-Systems Trust Center,O=T-Systems Enterprise Services GmbH,C=DE
Is not found
I have drmngr installed (Ubuntu 16.06) and run gpgconf --launch dirmngr
However the root certificate is still not found. Thunderbird provides
this certificate so I could install it manually.
However I would prefer an automated solution.
Any hints?
Thanks and regards
