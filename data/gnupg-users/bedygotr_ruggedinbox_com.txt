@_subject: Unattended/batch key signing 
I need to do key signing via script.  This command:
Shows me the key being signed and the key being used to sign, and exits
with no errors, exit code 0. If I add --no-tty no output is shown and it
also exits without errors. So I expected it would work, but the keyring
seems unchanged.
Is this impossible? If so, why no errors?
This is with gpg2, which I'd like to stick with if possible.
