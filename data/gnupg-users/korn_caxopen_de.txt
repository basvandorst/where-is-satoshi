@_subject: verify after export/import of secret key 
when I generate a key pair, import the public key of a friend, sign his
public key and verify a signed mail of him this works fine.
But when I export my public and secret keys (gpg --export / gpg
--export-secret-keys), empty the keyrings (rm ~/.gnupg/*), import them
again (gpg --import) and then do the same a before (import pub-key of
friend, sign it, verify mail) the verification fails. gpg always tells
me that it is a good signature but untrusted:
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the
I thought that the keyrings should be in the same state afterwards, no
matter if I generate a new key pair or import the secret and public key.
What's wrong?
This occured on RH-8 with gpg 1.0.7
