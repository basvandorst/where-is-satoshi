@_subject: Singing a key with a subkey 
I've exported a crippled version of my private keyset for use at
work...I did not include the primary/master key in the export, only a
signing subkey and an encryption subkey. Now I've imported them on a
different system and want to sign a co-workers key with the subkey,
but gpg complains that:
gpg: secret key parts are not available
gpg: signing failed: general error
I'm able to sign files using the subkey (on the same system), so I'm
not clear why I wouldn't be able to sign a key with it as well. Is
there something I'm missing, is there a way around this, or is there
something fundamental about this limitation?
I'm using gpg 1.4.9 on Windows XP.
Thanks for any help

@_subject: Etiquette for other people's signatures in responses 
Hey, I'm relatively new to PGP and I just wanted to get some feedback
on the proper etiquette for quoting signed messages in responses.
Clearly, it's inappropriate to edit a person's response if they're
signed it, but is it considered rude to remove their signature from
the message in the response? For instance, if I did just want to
include part of their message in the response, could I clip that part
out and delete the signature?

@_subject: Bad signatures on Gmail messages 
Hash: SHA1
I just wanted to let people know that I finally woke up and realized that
messages I was signing and sending with Gmail are bad because the mail client
is inserting linebreaks in order to wrap lines. This is standard behavior for
a lot of MUAs so that certain mail readers don't have problems displaying
them. From now on, any messages I sign will be written offline with short
lines, signed, and then pasted into my mail client, so that the signed message
already contains the correct line breaks.

@_subject: Looking for a good port80 static-DNS keyserver 
So I've been "advertising" keys.gnupg.net as the place to get my key
for a while now, but the round-robin DNS is kind of bugging me. I
understand the purpose of it, but it's kind of a crap shoot: not
infrequently, the address maps to a server that's down or buggy. I'd
rather have one dedicated address for an sks I can use and refer
others to, preferably one that's available on port 80. Any

Thanks, John. I was unaware of the status page, I think that will be
helpful. I'm not sure offhand which servers have been "buggy", but I
believe I've connected to  in the past and been
presented with a blank page, for instance.
Is it considered impolite to advertise one specific keyserver (like
gingerbear, for instance) in my sig?

@_subject: Opinions on RIPEMD vs SHA? 
I'm considering making my default hash RIPEMD160: does anyone have any
opinions on how this compares to SHA-2 algorithms in terms of both
security and availability? I like the idea that RIPEMD was developed
in an academic community instead of the NSA, but if there are genuine
benefits to using SHA, I have no problem looking past this bit of
romanticism. I'm especially curious if RIPEMD160 is commonly available
in popular PGP clients.

Sorry, this is a bit of topic. But I wonder if anyone knows of a
public key system that can realistically be done by pencil and paper.
I realize anything a computer can calculate could conceivably be done
by hand, but I'm looking for something realistic. I don't consider
raising very large numbers to very large powers realistic.

Thanks, Harry. Interesting page, but I don't think primes on the
order of 3 and 11 really qualify as secure, which was pretty much
what I figured would be the case: anything that can reasonably be
done by hand wouldn't be secure.
Oh well. Pad locks it is. =)

@_subject: Plaintext attack vulnerabilities? 
Are there any known vulnerabilities associated with an attacker who
can provide plaintext and receive a signature for it? I'm planning a
simple computer-auth system where a client sends a random token to the
server, and then the server signs and returns it to prove that the
server has the private key. I'm wondering if a malicious client could
provide a certain plain text such it could learn something about the
private key based on the returned signature.
Similar attacks have happened on the APOP authentication scheme which
uses md5: a fake server presents a token to the client which gets
hashed with the client's password and sent back: by using certain
tokens, the server is able to drastically narrow down the range of a
brute force attack on the password, and after several such attacks,
people have actually been able to recover the first few characters of
the password. So now I'm wondering if any similar vulnerability is
known for OpenPGP signatures.

@_subject: Plaintext attack vulnerabilities? 
Thanks for the response, Daniel.
The man-in-the-middle attack isn't a concern for me because the server
is behind a firewall. The setup here is that the client is a laptop
and I'm looking for a simple, automatic way to determine whether or
not it's on a particular network by sending a string to a certain LAN
IP address (192.168.*.*), and confirming that it comes back signed
with the correct key. This isn't actually for secure communications,
so a man in the middle who's also behind the firewall is no big deal:
the "attack" will only work if we're all on the same LAN, so it will
still confirm what I want it to.
The attack I'm worried about (which I've learned is called a "chosen
plain-text attack") is that a malicious client on the LAN will send
particular strings to the server and be able to learn about the
server's key based on the response. To avoid this, I thought I could
have the server concat it's own random string to the one sent by the
client, then send back a digest of the combined string along with a
signature. That way, the client can guarantee (more or less) that it's
a unique string (so someone couldn't spoof the response from the
server), but cannot reasonably choose the plain text. I think this is
pretty much how the TLS handshake works, anyway.
The reason I'm rolling my own is, well for one I have a bad habit of
doing exactly that (reinventing wheels), plus I want something simpler
than a full TLS session, specifically, I want to use UDP instead of
TCP to reduce network traffic, and I want it to just be a
two-transmission operation, also to reduce network traffic.

@_subject: Verify signature by specific key 
I'm looking for an automated way to verify that a signature was made
by a specific key. It's not sufficient to just verify that the
signature is valid and known to my keyring, I want to confirm who it
belongs to. I was hoping the -u option would work, but it doesn't seem
to. The only work-arounds I've come up with are parsing the message
sent to stderr ("Signature made ... using ... key ..."), or creating a
separate key ring containing only desired key. But both of these
options kind of suck. Any other ideas?

@_subject: Random password experiment 
Hash: SHA1
Hey folks,
Sorry, this is off-topic, but I thought all the security folks who
lurk and participate on this list might be interested.
I'm doing a little investigation, and I could use some experimental
data. For those who would like to participate, I'd like you to
generate some random passwords and send them to me. I need 5
passwords per person, but you should generate them one at a time,
then wait at least an hour before generating the next, to keep them
pretty much independent. The passwords should be *random* strings of
characters that you just pull out of your head, no words or birthdays
or anything like that, just sit down and come up with a random
string that: a) you think makes a secure** random password, and b)
you think you could memorize within a few days or a week and use as
your main password (for instance, for logging in to your computer).
The only limitation is the passwords can only contain upper- and
lower- case letters, the digits 0-9, and the following punctuation
marks: a dot (.), and dash (-), and an underscore (_). It doesn't
have to contain all of those characters, of course, but that's your
working alphabet.
If you want to participate, please send the "passwords" to me by
email. You can feel free to encrypt them if you'd like, my key-id
is listed in the signature. I'm hoping to have some interesting
results to report in the next few weeks. (And no, I'm not going to
try to break into anyone's system, but you obviously shouldn't be
sending me passwords you actually use or will use anyway).

@_subject: Manual verification of PGP-Mime signatures 
I'd like manually verify attached application/pgp-signature signatures
in email. I have access to the raw (undecoded) email, and I read
through RFC 3156, but I'm still getting BAD signatures. I've tried
verifying a couple of different signatures from various lists, and the
example given in the RFC, but they all fail. I'm not sure what I'm
doing wrong. For instance, the RFC example message is (between the two
The rfc says the leading '&' "indicate the portion of the data over
which the signature was calculated.", so I'm not sure if he meant them
to be included in the signature or not, but I've tried it with and
without them, and with and without the space that follows them. I've
confirmed that the line endings are CR+LF.
Does somebody know how to do this? If you do, it would be really
helpful if you could explain it, and maybe show a GPG Clearsigned
equivalent. For instance, this is how I've been interpretting it (and
it doesn't work):

@_subject: Details of signature verification status-fd lines 
Just a quick question on the --status-fd output from a --verify
operation: if EXPSIG, EXPKEYSIG, or REVKEYSIG are given, could
VALIDSIG or GOODSIG also show up? In other words, are these just for
more information on why a signature failed, or can they qualify the
"GOOD" and "VALID" outputs?

@_date: 2009-09-22 11:50:14
@_author: Brian Mearns 
@_subject: Details of signature verification status-fd lines 
Thanks for the response. So EXPKEYSIG doesn't mean the key was expired
when the signature was made, right? If that shows up along with
VALIDSIG, it's ok to trust the signature, correct? What about
REVKEYSIG? If a key is revoked, is there an easy way to know if the
signature was made prior to revocation, or would it be necessary to
just compare the stamps on the signature and the revocation?

Sorry, I know this is only somewhat on topic: if someone can suggest

I want to use rngd to increase my entropy pool for use with GnuPG, but
I don't have a hardware random device. I've seen a lot of references
to using /dev/urandom as the input source for rngd, which claim that
rngd's randomness test is sufficient for ensuring that the entropy
pool remains random. But there's something that really doesn't sit
well about that for me. Can anyone offer informed insight on this?
