I'm looking at sharing an encrypted file, Linux to 64 bit windows.
It seems that a Windows version isn't available, is this right please?
Lots of "similar" names, nothing from GNU?

@_subject: Linux and windows mix? 
I asked a few weeks ago about sharing an encrypted
file between windows and Linux boxes.
Lots of hassle uninstalling an old version of gpg4win (I had to stop
the service prior to deleting / uninstalling), but now
working well.
Thanks for the suggestion.
Bash/shell scripts available if wanted.

Hi Werner.
1. I knew nothing about this smart card.
2 Searched on Google. Found from there I see For more information, please visit this products webpage.
Sadly that page is 404
Where can I read a user view of this product and software please?

@_subject: OpenPGP card (Was Re: GnuPG and g10 code) 
Which links on to the GNU pgp page?
all written by techies, for techies?
Nothing to explain what it's all about, how it might be used,
why it is useful etc?
IMHO that class of  information would help to raise interest.
My first question was, can I install a reader and use 'my' card
to log on to my computer? No idea.
Next? What else can I use a card/card reader for? Not answered.

@_subject: GnuPG and g10 code 
(IMHO) pure geekery copied from one of the other pages?
Note how quickly it gets into using GPG? Then into software installation?
Missing, the layer above this, the marketing 'spiel'.
OK, it could be me (I don't think it is).
Simple question, WTF is thing all about? I have lots of credit cards
(are they smart? No idea).
I know what to do with them. I think this thing is different, so my
first question is what is it for?
Why should I be interested, what can it do (especially as it
costs....?80 Euro with reader?)
As if you are talking to your little sister (big sister, anyone one
non-geek :-) tell me (us)
what it offers?
I'll shut up now

Not meant as a critique of the content, just pointing out that
it does not explain 'why' and 'what' the card and software (as a system) do
for the reader new to the idea. It may be accurate technically.

@_subject: File Encryption 
Hi Gus. Using symmetrical encryption I do just that
on Linux, without the GUI?
With a small bash script, you could filter out just the entry you want too.
  I currently do it with Python and their encryption, but want it for
my windows box and Linux, hence gpg.
e.g. unlock is
source lockp.sh # parameters
 $0  #  creates $plnfile.txt"
if [[ ! -f ${target}/${encfile} ]]
    then
    echo Unable to find  $1
    exit 2
# File $1 exists, has .gpg extension, create .txt
echo "Decrypt CAST5 encrypted file $1"
echo gpg --output ${target}/${plnfile}  --decrypt ${target}/${encfile}
gpg --output ${target}/${plnfile}  --decrypt ${target}/${encfile}
ckexit gpg
echo "Created ${target}/${plnfile}"
more ${target}/${plnfile}
with params shared (encrypt / decrypt) as
# params for lock.sh and unlock.sh
source ~/bin/dpFunctions.sh
nb dpfunctions are pure bash.
Let me know if you want more.

@_subject: Symmetrical encryption or ... 
Two machines (one Linux, one Windows).
I want a secure file 'shared' between them, as a pwd-safe.
Only I use the two machines, but need the file encrypted.
Any alternatives to symmetrical encryption of a file?

1. A matter of trust (low)
2. One mc is Linux, the other windows - they tend not to mix?
Tks, Dave

Thanks Doug
typically Secure access requires n items, login/pwd/mothers maiden
name/ inside leg measurement etc... Can keepassx store a list of
key:value pairs?
  I know some systems are restrictive in this area. I'm currently
running Python code which dumps the dictionary content for use, direct
from the decryption.
So where do you store the data? Online for access from 3 machines? Dropbox?
   Seems an unnecessary exposure. I'll have a look.
Another exposure? At least with a symmetrical encryption the files are
only local... (Am I being too cautious?)
Thanks Doug. More options.

I installed keepassx. Not much use to me.
1. Illegible with my eyesight (reported to them)
2. Insufficient fields (seems to be non expandable).

Not found for Fedora.
I'll stick with symmetric for now.

I was hoping that long thread might suggest the same.
Quite willing to support GPG via a purchase,
but so little information is available...

@_subject: Symmetric encrypt many files (batch mode) 
If you can get a list (comma, space separated) of the files, bash
would do it nicely?
  whatever you do, you'll need that?
then obtain the basename, $bn and use a for each on the list?
