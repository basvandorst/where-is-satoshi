This parts looks good...
This will never be accepted by the IETF because:
 - DNS is not a directory for random information
 - Don't overload TXT records (though you can go the SPF
   way and just make a record called SPF which is a TXT)
I've been thinking about the above quite a bit and I would actually want
to solve it somewhat similar but a bit different.
What about a DNS RR that looks like;
These two records basically are the same as specifying:
keyserver keyserver hkp://keyserver.example.net
in the gpg.conf
This thus allows one to specify the keyserver location for that domain,
which one could point to pgp.mit.edu too if wanted.
Another approach would be DNS-SD, but they don't allow multiple
protocols at the moment. Which is why I brought up:
but the folks tripped heavily over the word anycast there, I should have
avoided that part. A simple:
_pka.example.org TXT "
also does the trick, but we need a standard for this.
Btw I specified https above, which is something I would really like to
see implemented and usable in gpg. This allows everybody, who has access
to their DNS that is, to specify a keyserver of their choice for that
domain. The HTTPS, which implies SSL, makes it able for gnupg to have a
secure transfer of this data and verification of the SSL certificate to
know that you are really talking to the correct host in the first place.
(DNSSEC might then also be nice to have, but we'll have to wait a bit
for that to be deployed everywhere...)
$ dig _pgpkey._service.unfix.org any
_pgpkey._service.unfix.org. 3600 IN     PTR     _pgpkey-http._tcp.unfix.org.
_pgpkey._service.unfix.org. 3600 IN     PTR
$ dig _pgpkey-https._tcp.unfix.org. any
_pgpkey-https._tcp.unfix.org. 3600 IN   TXT     "path=/pks/"
_pgpkey-https._tcp.unfix.org. 3600 IN   SRV     13 100 443
As to a note from somebody else "what about domains that people don't
have access to and thus can't configure the above". One might make an
extra uid, to a domain that does support the above trick, the key can
then also be automatically fetched. eg:
gpg -s -Npka-address foo
while you send the mail from tester example.com doesn't
have a keyserver, example.org has. test is a (sub)key, but
both keys are in the same set.
Another note is that this all indeed still does not imply any trust,
that needs to come from a lot of users signing your key, one way to
solve it would be to have the domain admin have a trusted key, thus
someone who has been verified, and have this key sign the keys in that
domain, could even been done semi-automatically, this way the user key
becomes quite trusted too. This might be good for larger installation.

Which is why Werner responded in german (see * which you cut out), which
is apparently a language you did not understand, and then in english and
nicely pointed this person to the german version of the list in case the
person didn't command or didn't want to use the english language...
It would be rude if he indeed wrote only the above, but he did not do

I just have to mention that I like this idea a *LOT*.
It also aligns quite well with what I had in mind for it.
Of course repudiation folks will not like PGP signed messages at all as
they can't say anymore that they didn't write it ;)
I thought a bit about the deployment, fingerprints fortunately don't
change (much), (DNS) caching is thus not a problem either. The uri=
field is only used to get the key when one doesn't have it yet. Thus a
single TXT lookup per the single source address is efficient and gets
cached. Thus this should work pretty well. DNS folks will not like it
though as DNS will be used as a generic directory and they claim it to
not be one, though there are numerous examples that it is.
One concern though is for folks who can't configure their dns and having
providers of this system not wanting to do it, for various reasons.
Would it be a good thing to have, say ._pka.verified.gnupg.org where
these folks can register eg user.example.org._pka.verified.gnupg.org ?
gpg could then check first if the domain itself has records, if it
doesn't have _pka. at all it can be configured to fall back to
the verified domain. The latter can be automated quite well with a
webinterface that mails folks with a unique code to verify them, similar
to biglumber. DNS + Web resource is the only issue here though, but I
guess there will be enough offers to host such a dns server to overcome
this. This service can then also be a public code which allows folks to
have a reference to how they can set it up for their own domain. Using
PowerDNS to interface directly with SQL comes to my mind.
What values can be stuck in the uri field? hkp and http seem to map both
to hkp. Both don't support HTTP/1.1's Host: header, which would limit
running a HKP/HTTP keyserver for only one virtual host, thus excluding
most simple hosts. Another idea here would be to support https, then one
also knows that the server one fetches the key from is really
authoritative, DNS, with DNSSEC, points to the server and the server has
a valid certificate, thus the key must be valid (unless the box is
Having a non-TXT record for this would also be very useful, though the
difference with a TXT record won't be too much I guess. I would suggest
changing the format of the TXT record though for this purpose into:
(64 bytes)
Skipping the 'tags', if there are new tags to be added, upgrade the
version number or make the fourth field contain a tag to do so. The
difference then with a special DNS RR is almost gone:
[version] [fingerprint-length] [fingerprint] [uri-length] [uri]
01 28 A4 D9 4E 92 B0 98 6A B5 EE 9D CD 75 5D E2 49 96 5B 03 58 A2 15
which is a total of 63 bytes (did I count correctly?) he length fields,
making parsing easier, where formerly the separator tags. The version
number can also be skipped entirely if there is a decision that this is
all we need. Which most likely is the case for the purpose of this
record. Any additional data can be fetched from the URI.
BTW is there a more "static" version of PKA documentation available than
the  message? A "How to set it up and use it" document would be nice, I
think I get & understand most of the concept thus if you want me to
submit something just yell.
BTW2, someone should update
 to not point to CVS
but the subversion repos...

There is a very simple way to solve all of this: Get enough signatures
so that your key is in the strong set. This will automatically approve
of most (if not all) of the Debian keys as they are also in the strong set.
To check how 'strong' your key is, and to figure out how to get your key
a bit stronger so that it belongs in the strong set check the following
URL's and contact folks which are near you. Dropping in at events always
has a very good effect on these as there are always some people with a
very strong key and in effect in you only need one of those to be fully
