@_subject: Question about --passphrase-fd 
Please CC me with a response...
I installed GnuPG 1.0.4 using the precompiled binaries for MS-Windows.  I
would like to use the --passphrase-fd option since I am scripting and
cannot manually type in the passphrase.  The --passphrase-fd option asks
for a file descriptor.  How do I use this, i.e. relate a file
(passphrase.txt) to a file descriptor in Windows NT?  Or if this doesn't
work (in NT) what else can I do?  In unix I would redirect stdin, but do I
have any options if using NT?
Any help would be appreciated...
