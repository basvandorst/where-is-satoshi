@_subject: gnupg windows, per user homedir on a terminal server 
hello folks,
i am trying to install gnupg for windows in a terminal server (2003) env with multiple users. My idea is to have one installation of the binarys, but allow each user to have his/her own keyring in theyr userdir.
I understand gnupg support the homedir variable for this purpose:
I tried to set homedir to the folowing value
"C:\Documents and Settings\%user%\gnupg\"
tests showd me that a fresh set of keyrings is no longer installed to c:\gnupg\, but neither is it installed to the userdir.. it seems its not picking up that setting correctly. or i am simply not providing it in the correct manner. :(
What is the suggested procedure to use gnupg in a multi-user env based on Windows?
best regards
