Why when I say I'm Magnus B=E4ckstr=F6m do I turn out as Magnus B=C3=A4ckst=
gpg pretends nothing has happened and prints the correct name, but
e g keyservers get it wrong, and when I run gpg --list-packets on my
public key I get (excerpt):
:user ID packet: "Magnus B\xc3\xa4ckstr\xc3\xb6m "
Magnus Bckstrm

Nevermind, y'all!
What I stumbled upon is that gpg correctly uses utf8 encoding,
which apparently nobody else does.  I propose the following
addition to the FAQ list:
* 6.17  Why do my national characters go wrong when using other
        software?  My name looks funny and isn't found by searches
        on the keyserver.
        GnuPG encodes user id strings (and other things) using UTF-8.
        In this encoding, most national characters get encoded as
        two- or three-byte sequences.  For example, å (0xE5 in
        ISO-8859-1) becomes Ã¥ (0xC3, 0xA5).
