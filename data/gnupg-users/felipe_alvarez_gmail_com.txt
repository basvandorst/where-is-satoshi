Hi all. I'm new here, so please be gentle =). I've read the information
about getting gpg-agent to work. I don't use X, but I login remotely with
ssh (publickey authentication). My gpg-agent is acting funny. after ssh
login, I get this error
felipe at suse-amd:~> gpg-agent

@_subject: trying to understand UID and subkeys 
Me again. Sorry to sound newbish. I've googled, but I haven't found anything
quite as detailed enough for me to grasp the 'whole forest' (so to speak).
My question is regarding 'subkeys.' Let me know if I am getting the
wording/terminology incorrect.
I understand that when I 'gen-key' I create a 'signing' key (to identify
tampering/modification) and an 'encryption' key (shouldn't this be a
DEcryption key? Wouldn't I use this for DEcrypting docs encrypted with my
public key? But I digress).
I am also able to add extra UIDs to my public key, so I can have, say 4
different email addresses, all attached to the same public key. Does this
mean I have several SIGNING keys, or several DEcryption keys? How do other
people use my extra UIDs? Can they pick one to use for encryption, and I
must use the "twin" (private) key matching that UID to decrypt it?
Why would I want to create new 'subkeys?' Of what benefit to have, say 5
subkeys belonging to one (master)(private)(signing) key?
What do the letters to the right of the words "usage" mean? (S,C,A,E) I can
only guess |S|ign, |E|ncrypt, ....

"S" means this key permits the owner to sign things
"C" means that "I (felipe) have signed this key" ??
"E" means owner can encrypt to himself ??

@_subject: cloudy understanding of asymmetric cryptography 
Hash: SHA1
Someone today shook my understanding of asymmetric ciphers.
_Bob performs symmetric encryption on message with_
_key "K" (generated randomly). He then encrypts "K" _
_with Alice's public key, and sends both the symetrically _
_encrypted message and asymmetrically encrypted key to Alice_
Is this what happens during most/some/all of public-key
communications? I had always thought that the message is encrypted
with public key, and decrypted with secret key. I was not aware that
key "K" was encrypted with public key, but message encrypted with
To help my understanding a little futher, if this does not always
occur, or does not usually occur, when does it occur (not occur)?
Using what ciphers (algorithms)?
I was unable to find adequate explanations online.

I learned a lot thanks for explaining it so quickly and easily. I had
thought that the entire message was encrypted with (say) RSA! Is there
a way to "force" gpg to encrypt an entire message with (example) RSA
(just for time-testing purposes?)

@_subject: public key not found, but it is there! 
I am trying to play around with keys Alice and Bob for showing to my
employer on how to improve security.  "Alice" is the employer, and
"bob" the employee.
I created a key for each, on separate machines. Alice runs RedHat 4,
and gpg v1.2.6. Bob runs Cygwin and GnuPG v.1.4.11.
Alice's key was giving problems, so, on Alice's machine (which
contains her private key), i did `rm -fr $HOME/.gnupg`, then generated
a new key.
On Bob's machine, I deleted Alice's key (using WinPT's GUI interface,
which should not matter much), and imported her "new" public key.
now, whenever I try to encrypt to user "alice" It fails, saying
    encryption failed: public key not found
The public key is there! But it has a different fingerprint
(17D11744). GPG is looking for Alice's Old hash fingerprint
(DE0155B3). How can I remedy this?

@_subject: windows front end to GnuPG 
I've currently begun getting everyone in the office using GnuPG on
windows. We're using WinPT as the front end. However there are several
deficiencies with this program that we have encountered. Further, it
is no longer being developed (last version 1.4.3 release sept 2009).
Are there any other windows front ends that are easy to use, WRT
single file en/de/cryption? The main requirements would possibly
- sits on the task tray
- low mem footprint
- still in development

Looks a bit 'heavy' (fancy GUI and a bunch of programs I know that I
will not be using) but I'll give it a try.
