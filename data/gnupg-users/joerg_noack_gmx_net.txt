@_subject: gnupg and IRIX 6.5.6 
I'm new user of gnupg. Under my linux box gnupg works fine and
without problems. Now my question. Is it possible to compile
and run gnupg successful under IRIX 6.5.6. I have compiled
the sources gnupg-1.0.1d with
# rm config.h config.cache g10defs.h
# CC=cc CFLAGS=-mips3 ./configure --prefix=/yatmp/freeware/gnupg \
--enable-static-rnd=none --disable-dev-random --disable-dynload  \
but during the key generation gnupg dies with a "Bus error" :-(.
