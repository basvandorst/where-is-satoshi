hello there,
i'm sorry for my stupid questions at first, i'm quite new rabbit. i
understand how it works, but i've got small problem.
I'd like to build a smal GUI for gnupg. i need to create a new id for
exmple. the question is if it is possible to do it using
single command. something like:
gpg --gen-key -user usama -ksize 1024  ....... blabla
i'd like to do it in this way, that user fills text fields in some window
and id is created after some button click.
the same procedure for edit id. or is there some other way how to do it?
i've no experience but i'd like to learn it.
thanx for help.
