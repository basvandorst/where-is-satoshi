@_subject: unblock PIN: Permission denied 
Hello all,
i have a question regarding unblocking PINs on a gnupg card (from g10code).
I entered three times the wrong PIN (*sigh*) and now the PIN is blocked.
If i try to unblock it with
gnupg --card-edit
and then choosing "2. unblock PIN", i get the respone "Error unblocking
the PIN: permission denied".
I used this command as the card-owning user and also as root (to try if
os-specific issues are the reason for this message) to no avail.
So, by now i'm unable to unblock my PIN. Does anyone have a hint for
this issue?
Thanks and best regards.
