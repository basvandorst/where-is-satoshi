@_subject: unattended revocation certificate generation? 
hi all,
I try to
- generate a key
- generate a revocation certificate
- and export the key in a skript.
The problem is, that what ever I try, the generation of the revocation
certificate is interactive. I always have to give the input by hand. Up to
now I tried the following:

It's easy: You just have to proof, that you are the owner of the key
good luck

Hi all
I am playing with the idea to change the sources of gpg, so that
 - a revocation certificate can be made in batch mode (after creating the
key in batch mode)
 - keys can be edited in batch mode (trust, sign, ...), controlled by
another application
I tried it out and (with relatively little changes) have a test-version,
that is behaving like this. It reads from an input file that can be defined.
What I had to do for this: Create a sub-key (for signing only) without a
Now my question: Why was this not possible up to now? Is it a security issue
to revoce and edit automatically (aside of creating a sub-key for signing
without a passphrase)?
Thanks for any input

Hi all
I am playing with the idea to change the sources of gpg, so that
 - a revoke-certificate can be made in batch mode (after creating the key in
batch mode)
 - keys can be edited in batch mode (trust, sign, passwd, ...), controlled
by another application
I tried it out and (with relatively little changes) have a test-version,
that is behaving like this. It reads from an input file that can be defined.
I have created a sub-key (for signing only) without a passphrase, therefore
I don't have to store the passphrase for my private key on the disk.
Now my question: Why is this not possible in the (unchanged) gnuPG? Is it a
security issue to revoke and edit automatically (I mean: where are the risks
aside of creating a sub-key for signing without a passphrase)?
Thanks for any input
