@_subject: A question about the status of the keyserver structure 
I hope this is the correct list for this question:
I tried to follow the instructions of  were it says you can import the key to verify the iso.
But kleopatra stays without reaction (no matter how many pools I join) and entropia at roadrunner:~> gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys EDCA7A90 Now I remember time ago there was an issue of keyservers abused and the structure was halted. What is the current status and how can one download a signature as of today? Manually or with a "keyserverpage" on https or how does it work now?
Thank you in advance. [1]
