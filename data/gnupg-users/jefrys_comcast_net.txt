@_subject: help with GPGShell and path 
Having set path already (it even _shows_ in the Path display box _in the shell_!), i can't seem to get the shell to recognise or accept the locations. Previously, i could select the buttons and browse to the site, but buttons are now greyed out. Using the 'install from archive' button on the bottom doesn't work either, i get> 'Run-time errror '383': 'Text' property is read-only< The man isn't very helpful, and the directions for install on the shell site don't work; the reg entry can't be imported and i'm unclear as to how to set values and labels. Any help would be _enormously_ appreciated.

@_subject: Maxine 
I had only one or two opportunities to communicate with Maxine, but she was eager to help me, a complete stranger, with some newbie setup issues. She laughed with me as i struggled and made life much easier, seemingly as a matter of course. My heart goes out to friends and family. With the little contact i've had with her i know that she will be much missed, and that the world is a poorer place for her departure.
