@_subject: gpg hangs when decrypting/verifying signatures 
Hash: SHA1
Please note that this may or may not have something to do with all of
the newsgroups/mailing lists above in the header.  Cygwin provides the
DLL so gpg can run; enigmail utilizes gpg to do its thing in emails; and
gpg is the backbone of this.
After updating my Thunderbird nightly (2.0b1) for a couple of days,
something went strange with gpg and enigmail.  Thunderbird kept hanging
forever just because it was trying to decrypt/verify a signature by
using a hung gpg process. I know this from looking in Sysinternals
Process Explorer, because there was a gpg process in the tree of
thunderbird.exe.  In order to get away from this problem, I have to kill
gpg one or more times, since it might just pop back up again.
Fortunately, though, I can still sign and encrypt messages, just like
this one.  As mentioned above, this message/thread may have something to
do with all of the above (mail header), so please send any replies to
the newsgroups/mailing lists above.  (Cygwinners, please don't send
email to my *other* email address!)
