To delete your key from your keyring, do:
=09gpg --delete-secret-and-public-key name
If you are on UNIX, you can also just delete the ~/.gnupg directory.
If you've sent your public key to a public key server, then it's a bit mo=
complicated.  You can just leave it there, of course, but to tidy things =
you should create a revocation certification for your key, import that=20
certificate, then send the revoked key to the public key server:
=09gpg -o revoke.txt --gen-revoke name
=09gpg --import revoke.txt
=09gpg --keyserver server --send-keys name
