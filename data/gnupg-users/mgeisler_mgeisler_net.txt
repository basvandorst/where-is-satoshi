@_subject: How to delete superceded self signatures? 
I think you've just discovered a feature of the keyservers: they don't
delete stuff, they will only append new signatures and in your case
new revocation certificates.
So you cannot delete a key from the keyservers, you can only mark it
as revoked by uploading it with a revocation certificate. Similarly I
believe you cannot delete a user id, you can just make it unusable by
revoking the self signature on it.
(This how I think things work --- please correct me if I'm wrong.)

@_subject: GnuPG Clearsign vs. PGP/MIME Signing 
The only thing I've come across is people using Outlook Express: they
will see an empty mail with two attachments: your message as one
attachment and the signature as another.
I don't know how Outlook (not Express) handles things.

@_subject: Passphrase Encoding and Entropy 
When you have 64 different possibilities, all of equal likelyhood,
then you can code them using 6 bit. This is what the entropy tells
The fact that A in the 7-bit ASCII standard is 01000001 is just a
coincedence --- they could just as well have put your chosen 64
characters into the lower 6 bits, and then have the other 64 available
characters use the high bit.
In general it doesn't change anything if you encode your message (a
passphrase in your example) in a different encoding: the amount of
information stays the same if you still just select your characters
From the same subset.
So making a passphrase of ASCII characters, and then encoding it using
UTF-16 doesn't make it more secure. Sure, with UTF-16 gives you the
potential to encode something like 2^16-1 characters, but to calculate
the entropy you can disregard all characters which you will never
The formula for entropy explains this:
  H(X) = - sum_{i=1}^n p(i) * log_2(p(i))
Here the p(i)'s are the probability that your message will be "i".
With a bigger space of possible messages (a bigger n) then the sum
contains more terms, but if you still select your message from the
same small set, then most of the terms will be zero. So if a message
of value "j" is, say, a Chinese passphrase, then p(j) = 0 would mean
that know that you'll never such a passphrase. And thus the term
disappears from the sum (well, actually you get a problem with taking
the logarighm of zerolet's not go into that).
See  for more on how
to calculate the entropy, but I hope this helped a bit.
