@_subject: twofish keysize 
refering to the source code, the twofish implementation is able to handle 128 and 256 Bit keys.
But how do I specify the size?

is there a (simple) patch available? I fact, I don't have time to dig into the sources, I just read the comment...

@_subject: incrementel asymetric encryption? 
in order to protect some sensitive log on a server, I encrypt the log via. GPG
( | gpg -e -a -r logger |).
This creates an ascii-File full of gpg-messages. But if I try to decrypt the log, I just get the first message and some warning about a changed / corrputed messages.
If I delete the first one, I get the second one, and a warning, if a delelete the first n-1 messages (assuming n messages are encrypted) I get the n-th messages without any warning.
But how  can I decrypt the whole log at once - or how can I encrypt the log incremental, to create one big GPG Message?

Well, by that, I can either use a key without a passphrase or I have to enter the passphrase several times.  But I want to decrypt the whole log at once without not having any passphrase and without entering some a dozen times.

well, this takes me to a difficult question:
How much more are to come? (Have you begun a code audit? How long will it take I haven't been following the gnupg development so far, but imho the recent development of actions rater is rather disturbing - and these kind of bugs tend to disqualify gnupg from mission critical use. Please don't get me wrong, I really like gnupg and  appreciate what you've done so far, but the recent development worries me.
