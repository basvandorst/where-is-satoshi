@_subject: Pinentry Problem 
I have the following problem with pinentry 0.6.9-133 under SuSE Professional
9.0, installation from scratch:
When I want to sign an email (for example) I always get the error message,
that the passphrase is wrong. As I'am absolutley sure that the entered
phrase is correct I checked what pinentry gives back by using "pinentry-qt"
and "getpin". Some key combinations (like shift-3 or shift-5) produce wrong
results (like %25 for shift-5). I guess that's te reason why the passphrase
dialogue fails. Other key combinations (like shift-2) gives back the correct
Any ideas?
Gru? / Sincerely
Andreas Woithon
