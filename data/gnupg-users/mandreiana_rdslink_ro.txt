@_subject: encrypted string always the same 
I saw everytime a text is encrypted with the same public key, the result
is different.
I'm trying to store gpg-encrypted values in a database, but would like
to be able to tell if a user-entered value matches the encrypted one in
database (by crypting it with the same public key).
Is it possible? Any options I could pass to gpg so it always encrypts
with the same result? I realize this makes it vulnerable to brute-force attack (I encrypt
short 4-digit strings and other short stuff).

Hi Atom, thank you for the very helpful reply.
For security, we'll give up search on those items and store it encrypted
with gnupg.
