Hash: SHA512
Hi all.
I've been reading some "best practises" documents, and it was suggested that
I not use SHA-1 as my self-signature digest algorithm:
This says, "To fix this, you will need to regenerate a key after setting the
following in your ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf" and then tells me to set something
What I cannot figure out is how to remove my signature from my key and
re-sign it with the new digest algorithm. I delete my signature, or at least
I think I do, and it lets me sign my key again, but when I check using their
suggested pipeline:
gpg --export-options export-minimal --export  | gpg --list-packets | grep 'pref-hash-algos'
...I see algorithm 2 still there.
My understanding is that I have a key pair, and I sign it by unlocking the
secret half, and the signature is distinct from the key pair, so I should be
able to generate a new signature with a different digest algorithm. But
clearly that's not happening, so either my method is wrong or my under-
standing of something is wrong, and I'd be grateful for help either way.
I created a new key, and the new key seems to have done the right thing, but
it really seems as thought I'd ought to have been able to convert my old
key's signature.
Thanks in advance for clues!

While I agree with what you're saying, the big difference between this
situation and your example is that it's trivially easy for me to say "use
this digest method instead of this other one" and then forget about it. The
coffee pot will take care of itself. The question becomes invisible to me as
soon as I've set the default, and if the effort is so low to do it, I don't
see any real reason *not* to do it. Security is about nudging up the bar.
Now, that said, I still don't understand why I was seemingly unable to change
the digest algorithm I'm using for my old key. I'd be grateful if someone
could enlighten me on that point, as I really want to grasp what was

Yes, you're both right - I was confusedly mixing up my grep arguments,
despite my certainty that I was not.
Thank you for the help!
