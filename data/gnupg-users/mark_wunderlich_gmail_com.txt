I would like gpg to be able, when using symmetric ciphers, to produce
`anonymous' output -- that is, output such that one cannot be sure that
gpg produced it, or that a given passphrase does not successfully decode
it.  (That is, if you enter the wrong passphrase, you get garbage
instead of an error message.)
I would like to be able to do this so that, for example, I could run gpg
repeatedly, and someone who was decoding the data would not know whether
he was on the right track.  I also might want to combine gpg with
another approach, e.g., XOR-ing the target file against another file.
Again, the idea would be that `anonymizing' gpg's output would make it
more difficult for someone to untangle such combined approaches; the
general idea is that the ability to produce `anonymous' output would
make gpg a more flexible part of a larger toolkit.
I am very new to gpg, and I have no idea what would be involved in
adding such a feature -- but I was hoping for a command-line switch for
`anonymous' mode (and I take it that when deciphering in `anonymous'
mode, one would have to specify the desired algorithm).  Would this be
