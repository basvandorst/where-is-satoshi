@_subject: decrypt stdin with passphrase in command line 
Hi all,
Does anyone know how to decrypt stdin with passphrase in command line?
The problem is most solutions on the net assumes the information to decrypt is in a file. I would like to decrypt data from stdin as well as supplying a passphrase (which is also via stdin using --passphrase-fd 0) Many thanks, Excalibur
