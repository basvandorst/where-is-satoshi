@_subject: Suddenly unable to use gpg-agent with putty 
I'm using putty 0.66, just upgrading to latest 0.67 and problem still, and I found that pageant tray not appear in my taskbar (I remember it's there when I using gpg2.0) right now if Iexecute pageant manually without open putty, it will shows, but if I opened putty, I can't find pagaent in my process list and even after I close putty, excute pageant will give me pageant is alreay running error. No idea what's happening here, should this be normal case?

Putty gives me disconnected no supported authentication methods error, and
not asking me for pinentry pin, but I could do git sign without problem. I
didn't change server settings all my server can't ssh with putty now, and I
double check sshcontrol file, it doesn't change and correctly configured,
also enable-putty-support is in my gpg-agent.conf. I tried everything I
could do, re-plug my keys, reboot, reinstall & configure gnupg, restart
gpg-agent...my settings always works well on the past few months. Right now
I completely can't figure out what's happened here, I'm running gpg 2.1.14
on windows 10, below are the detailed log for gpg-agent:
? gpg-agent --daemon --verbose --debug-level guru --enable-putty-support

Much appreciate if someone could help me or give me some advice on how to
debug this.
