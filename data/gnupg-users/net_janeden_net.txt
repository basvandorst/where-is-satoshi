@_subject: Why OpenPGP is not wanted - stupid is in vogue right now 
Well... most people in 1940 were not capable of cracking the Enigma or
even aware of encryption technology.  In fact, most human beings are
"stupid" in that they do not seek to understand the inner workings of
systems around them.
This is simply a pragmatic approach: As long as something works as
expected, it will not be questioned. This is true for technical,
political and economic systems.
Media coverage of Prism or Facebook's, Google's etc. data handling will
not increase demand for encryption significantly unless many people are
affected directly (i.e. questioned by the FBI regarding some message
they sent).
On the other hand, ordinary people have adapted at remarkable speed to a
society which is much more complex and intellectualy demanding than 200
years ago. I would not underestimate the potential of the homo sapiens.
Kind regards,
Jan Eden

@_subject: Pinentry does not appear when importing keys with gpgsm 
using GnuPG 2.0.19 and pinentry 0.8.3, I cannot import certificates with
private keys. There seems to be a problem between gpg-agent and
pinentry (excerpt from gpg-agent.log):
gpg-agent[22502]: chan_8 -> GETINFO pid
gpg-agent[22502]: chan_8 <- D 22503
gpg-agent[22502]: chan_8 <- OK
gpg-agent[22502]: chan_6 -> INQUIRE PINENTRY_LAUNCHED 22503
gpg-agent[22502]: chan_6 <- END
gpg-agent[22502]: chan_8 -> SETDESC Please enter the passphrase to unprotect the PKCS object.
gpg-agent[22502]: chan_8 <- OK
gpg-agent[22502]: chan_8 -> SETPROMPT Passphrase:
gpg-agent[22502]: chan_8 <- OK
gpg-agent[22502]: chan_8 -> [[Confidential data not shown]]
gpg-agent[22502]: chan_8 <- [[Confidential data not shown]]
gpg-agent[22502]: chan_8 -> BYE
2013-05-24 12:40:34 gpg-agent[22502] command get_passphrase failed: Invalid IPC response
gpg-agent[22502]: chan_6 -> ERR 67109124 Invalid IPC response gpg-agent[22502]: chan_6 <- [eof]
gpg-agent[22499]: chan_6 <- [eof]
This is what is displayed in my shell:
gpgsm --import mycert.de.p12 gpg-agent[22499]: enabled debug flags: command mpi crypto memory cache memstat hashing assuan
gpgsm: gpg-agent[22502]: enabled debug flags: command mpi crypto memory cache memstat hashing assuan
gpgsm: gpg-protect-tool: error while asking for the passphrase: Invalid IPC response
gpgsm: error running `/usr/local/libexec/gpg-protect-tool': exit status 2
gpgsm: total number processed: 0
Strangely enough, when generating certificate requests with gpgsm,
pinentry shows up properly, and the certificate request is created. Fom
gpg-agent.log (this is just the last of several pinentry instances):
gpg-agent[22594]: chan_10 -> GETINFO pid
gpg-agent[22594]: chan_10 <- D 22599
gpg-agent[22594]: chan_10 <- OK
gpg-agent[22594]: chan_6 -> INQUIRE PINENTRY_LAUNCHED 22599
gpg-agent[22594]: chan_6 <- END
gpg-agent[22594]: chan_10 -> SETDESC To complete this certificate request please enter the passphrase for the key you just created once more.%0A
gpg-agent[22594]: chan_10 <- OK

@_subject: certificat for a key pair 
Sounds like your MUA supports S/MIME, you need a X.509 cert instead of a PGP keypair.
Kind regards,
