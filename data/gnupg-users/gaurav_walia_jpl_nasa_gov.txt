@_subject: gpg-preset-passphrase installation and usage 
Very new to gpg.   I?m attempting to use gpg-preset-passphrase.  But uncertain how to go about enabling it for usage.  Could someone direct me or provide me some instructions in how to go about enabling gpg-preset-passphrase?
I have the following version installed:
gpg --version
gpg (GnuPG) 2.0.22
libgcrypt 1.5.3

Ok.  Did some googling came up with the following.  Could someone confirm that I?m doing this correctly?
Objective: To save passphrase in cache to an unattended machine so that it doesn?t time out the credentials.  Specifically, using  with setup use gpg-preset-passphrase
Current Setup
  *   ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
     *   pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry-curses
     *   max-cache-ttl 60480000
     *   default-cache-ttl 60480000
     *   allow-preset-passphrase
  *   gpg --version
     *   gpg (GnuPG) 2.0.22
     *   libgcrypt 1.5.3
     *   Copyright (C) 2013 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     *   License GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later      *   This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
     *   There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.

     *   Pubkey: RSA, ?, ?, ELG, DSA
     *   Cipher: IDEA, 3DES, CAST5, BLOWFISH, AES, AES192, AES256, TWOFISH,
     *           CAMELLIA128, CAMELLIA192, CAMELLIA256
     *   Hash: MD5, SHA1, RIPEMD160, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, SHA224
     *   Compression: Uncompressed, ZIP, ZLIB, BZIP2
  *   gpg2 --fingerprint --fingerprint name at domain.com
     *   pub   2048R/12312312 2019-03-23
     *         Key fingerprint = 4567 4567 4567 4567 4567  4567 4567 4567 4567 4567
     *   uid                  Name      *   sub   2048R/11121314 2019-03-23
     *         Key fingerprint = 8910 8910 8910 8910 8910  8910 8910 8910 8910 8910
Updated Setup using gpg-preset-passphrase only
  *   ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
     *   We should be able to remove the first 3 line items since we are only using gpg-preset-passphrase
     *   Final file contents
        *   allow-preset-passphrase
  *   Reload gpa-agent.conf file
     *   gpg-connect-agent reloadagent /bye
  *   Setup gpg-preset-passphrase
     *   gpg-preset-passphrase --preset 8910891089108910891089108910891089108910
  *   Now when you login to that key and enter the passphrase It should cache it until you issue the following command to remove it.
     *   gpg-preset-passphrase ?forget 8910891089108910891089108910891089108910
  1.  Is the updated setup correct in my assumption for the setup?
Thank you in advance for taking the time to help, it is greatly appreciated.
