Hash: SHA1
I believe posible exploits are if $sensitiveinfo contains things like
"blah; mail someone.evil  "echo $sensitiveinfo|gpg  --homedir /my/home/dir --always-trust -ear me|mail

It takes binary (and text) input and uses A-Za-z0-9 and = to encode the
data in one long string. It is equivalent to uuencoding.  It is a clean
way to bandy about 'dirty' strings.  PHP has a function base64_encode()
and base64_decode() to handle this. I recommend you encode the data as
such before handing it off to gpg.  Decoding can be done with any number
of tools, one being 'mimencode -u' under linux. uudecode -m can probably
do it too.

@_subject: --command-fd 
Hash: SHA1
Has anyone figured out how to use --command-fd?  The docs say look in the
DETAILS file about it, but I can't find any listing of the actual commands
that can be used, nor did a quick grep of the source locate anything.
I'm trying to implement a Thawte-like PGP signing system. For those that
don't know about that (now defunct) system, it would sign a key if the
user could prove they had control of the email address, and the email
address was included in the UserID.  Obviously this is by no means
bulletproof, but it seems like an interesting project.
The problem right now is how to programatically sign a key.  Does anyone
know how that works?

@_subject: how to read sent & encrypted mails 
Hash: SHA1
This is actually a feature, since then you can't be compelled to show what
you sent someone, and if your secret  key is compromised it can't be used
to decrypt what you sent other people. However, not everybody likes this,
so there is a workaround.
Essentially yes.  Depending on how mutt handles the gpg invocation, you
could add a default for it to encrypt it to your key as well. This will
make the message a little longer, as the session key is encrypted to
yourself and added to the message, meaning it is in the message twice. I wouldn't think so, as the 'average' user only cares if they can decrypt
the messagel I suspect correctly setting the 'default key' or something
like that will make the no-secret-key message go away.
See above.

Aha! This is a different problem. Have *you* signed this key?  A key is
not 'valid' until someone (such as yourself, or someone you trust) has
signed it. You can't trust an invalid key. True, PGP's wording is a bit
bad; too bad they don't say "Unvalidated" or "Unconfirmed", etc.

@_subject: File size limit in GnuPG??? 
Hash: SHA1
A couple of things to think about:
How much physical ram do you have? Perhaps GPG is trying to do the whole
process in 'locked' memory.  Or, how much disk space do you have on /tmp?
If not the above, GPG might be creating temp file somewhere and running
out of physical space.  Just a couple of guesses..
