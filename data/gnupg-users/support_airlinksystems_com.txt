@_subject: password only encryption used in a cron 
I am trying to decrypt a file that I am getting in a daily email using a
cron daemon.  The file is only encrypted by a password. CRON is giving me an
error message:
gpg: /home/al1/.gnupg/options:112: deprecated option "honor-http-proxy"
gpg: please use "keyserver-options honor-http-proxy" instead
gpg: WARNING: using insecure memory!
gpg: please see  for more information
gpg: cannot open /dev/tty: No such device or address
when I run the command from the command line I do not get the same message:
gpg: /u/al1/.gnupg/options:112: deprecated option "honor-http-proxy"
gpg: please use "keyserver-options honor-http-proxy" instead
gpg: WARNING: using insecure memory!
gpg: please see  for more information
Reading passphrase from file descriptor 0
gpg: assuming IDEA encrypted data
gpg: WARNING: message was not integrity protected
Here is the command I am trying to run:
where /u/bin/ppf is the password
The cron is set up for the same non-root user that I run the command line.
Any suggestions on what I am doing wrong?
