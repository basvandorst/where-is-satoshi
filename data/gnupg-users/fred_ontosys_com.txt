Thanks for the pointer.  But those modules seem to depend on "SysV
compatible shared memory" and I want to use GnuPG on both GNU/Linux
and Windows NT.  I've got it working fine on Linux, including being
able to use it via the Emacs crypt++ package.  I want to do the same
on WinNT, but I haven't been able to get a wrapper working that can
pass the passphrase to gpg.
To the GnuPG developers:
I understand the security risk of putting the passphrase on the
command line, and I want to do it anyway.  It's my system, let _me_
decide how secure I want it.  Keep the FD interface for those who want
it, but please provide a command-line passphrase option for oddballs
like me.
If I can't get GnuPG to work on WinNT from Emacs, then I'm just going
to revert to PGP, which did work fine since it does allow passing a
passphrase on the command line

Concerning my suggestion to add a command-line option to provide the
passphrase ...
I certainly could.  Or I could write my own PGP-equivalent -- it's
only software after all.  But I've got better things to do, so I'm
heading back to PGP, regretting only that I wasted my time with
