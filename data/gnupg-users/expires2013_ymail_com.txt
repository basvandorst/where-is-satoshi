That's not something that needs "fixing." It provides the user with a
greater level of security if they need to make their own informed
decision to "trust" a certificate, rather than the browser developers
making that decision without any user input.

You could look at the certificate your browser doesn't trust and
follow up the information it contains. You could also search the
internet (and other sources) for information about Intevation GmbH,
and see if it matches what the certificate says. Depending how
paranoid, you could even turn up at their offices and ask relevant
Decide on the trust level you wish to establish for your intended use
of the site. Then take whatever precautions you think are commensurate
with that level of trust.
Blindly clicking to dismiss the browser's "untrusted" warning is
arguably no more irresponsible than blindly having the browser accept
a certificate signed by a "certification authority" it recognises. I
suspect if you were to look at the list of CAs trusted by your
browser, you would encounter plenty that you see no reason to trust.

People have used payment cards insecurely in person and over the phone
for decades. Many are even daft enough to hand over cards to be kept
behind the counter against open food/drink tabs. The currently-used
systems for card payments over the internet are certainly also
insufficiently secure. But I have no compelling reason to believe
there is more of a problem now than in times gone by, rather than just
greater awareness.
In technical terms, I haven't a clue about the differing problems. But
in my experience credit card purchases are usually secured by https,
with certificates trusted by my browser manufacturer rather than by
me. This contrasts with email encryption using GnuPG, where the
decision to trust keys is nobody's but my own.
As far as I can tell, the ease of use comes from a blind trust in
browser developers' CA choices. I put it to you that this would be an
undesirable model for securing email communications.

The only thing I could get Encreep to do was create a new key. The
result was a 2048-bit RSA key with a 2048-bit RSA subkey. The subkey
is flagged to encrypt, sign, and authenticate, the main key can
encrypt, sign, authenticate and certify. Why have you chosen not to go
with the GnuPG default capabilities: encrypt only for the subkey and
sign+certify for the master.
The interface says entering a name, an email address, and a
password are optional - I chose not to exercise that option, and got
(as expected) a key with an empty passphrase. But the key has the
unexpected UID of "Alice Bob 4234 ."

I can't quite see the point of this. Surely you could just paste the
image of your signature into the document yourself, save it as a PDF
(for example), and email it to the intended recipient.
I also question whether I would want to give somebody else an image of
my handwritten signature, especially a website that requires you to
enable scripts from about a dozen domains.
A quick skim through that document suggests to me the basic intention
of the directive is for electronic signatures to have the same legal
status as handwritten signatures. I'm not convinced that document is
hugely relevant.
I see no reason why the image of your signature placed into the
document should have any different status than:-
    * typing your name and making clear it constituted a signature, or
    * one of those rubber-stamp signatures that solicitors used to use
      on cheques, or
    * an actual handwritten signature.
Of course, I am not legally trained. Anybody taking the advice of
anonymous strangers over the internet does so at their own risk.
Yes. Although the document does mention on page 215: "An e-signature in
the form of a computer-generated facsimile would have satisfied the
requirements of the Insolvency Act in terms of signing a proxy voting
form." That sounds very much like adding an image to a document as an
electronic signature.
There is certainly a lot in the linked EC document that has nothing to
do with the service offered by hellosign.com.

Experiences of people I know, together with footage broadcast on the
"reality TV" programmes where TV crews follow real police going about
their business, lead me to the conclusion they routinely practice
guilt by suspicion/guilt by association. If that approach fails to
find somebody the circumstantial evidence doesn't rule out, they will
switch to a genuine investigation if the matter is serious enough to
warrant the man-hours, or if it affects high-profile individuals.
No slur intended on any individual police personnel, just public
perception of the police forces' corporate approach. (And for the
record, I know many people who have formed a similar impression as
well as plenty who have formed a very different impression.)
Unfortunately, police sometimes influence the determination of guilt
by being selective in their presentation of information to the courts.
In the UK any withholding of evidence by the police has constituted
grounds for appeal since R v Fellows in July 1985.[1]

Simply stated, it is established that government based organisations
sometimes act in a nefarious manner, contrary to the law and contrary
to the interests of the population. I view that as a reason not to
trust government based organisations. And if I don't trust government
based organisations, I cannot trust a certification issued by one.
Of course, private companies or individuals who issue certifications
are susceptible to coercion. Whether issued by government or by
private sector, a single certification on a public key represents a
single point of failure. It does not provide any great level of
assurance the corresponding private key is controlled by the identity
it claims. Such assurance could potentially be derived from numerous
certifications that are independent from each other, but how do you
tell which are truly independent?
Where actual identity is not required, just continuity of
communication, I see no value in obtaining any certification at all.

Why do you describe it as a statistical approach? I guess 30% was plucked out of the air. It would seem self-evident that if a sizeable proportion of emails travelled encrypted, the NSA etc. would have to do more work to read them. I like the idea, but have a bit of an issue with security made too easy. Security has to be inconvenient; just a lot more so for a would-be attacker than for the person using the security.
Hopefully, if it was more effort and more cost to read an individual's
mail, that individual might be left alone unless they are a suspect.
But what about an individual two or three communication hops from a
For most people's communication, it is not encrypted so the main
problem is simply being read in transit, and/or stored. Once you start
encrypting, even without putting the effort in for sender
authentication, it takes more effort to snoop on your mail than on the
majority of people's.
Depending on the software people are using. I'm willing to accept that there are probably more people for whom S/MIME is easier to use.
I think "know" is the key factor, but "know and trust" is even better.
I suspect a whole lot of people would also be perfectly comfortable if
a certificate were available from the company that supplied their
operating system, or their email application or webmail account. Or
maybe from their bank or ISP.
The actions of governments and government organisations in so many
countries send signals that they are anti-privacy, or at least not
pro-privacy. I think this small contradictory signal would be in severe danger of being drowned out. But now I understand what you The email app I am using to write this message can (almost trivially)

So I have heard.
But all the hordes who use webmail are pretty-much still out of luck,
though. (With certain exceptions, such as hushmail.)
I don't know about the "trust centre." The Bat! gives me the choice
of its own internal implementation or Microsoft Crypto-API, which is
part of Windows. (The Bat! and Windows are closed-source proprietary
products that we probably shouldn't discuss too much on this list.)
That is simpler and avoids the web-bug-like effect you have if you
choose to auto-retrieve OpenPGP keys from keyservers for new contacts.
But must waste a lot of bandwidth between regular correspondents.
I have used it myself for over nine years.
I don't mind.
Fair enough. Using its internal implementation, The Bat! accepts
signatures from the S/MIME certificate I created last night (because I
added it to the trusted root CA address book) and does not accept your
S/MIME signature (because Comodo's root certificate is not in the
trusted root CA address book - but adding it would be just a few
clicks). MS Crypto-API is fine with Comodo's root cert, but says my
certificate has an invalid signature algorithm specified.
I just searched and found [1] about Thunderbird, which says you can
import a copy of other people's self-signed S/MIME certificate from a
".cer" file into your "Authorities" tab. So much for "being easier
because keys are automatically embedded in the signatures."
As I said, getting other people to persuade their MUA to accept it.

If the owner doesn't revoke one, you could always disable one.
One approach might be to contact the owner and ask which key to use.
Or use the newest available key. Or just pick at random. Or encrypt to

You want the files encrypted but but don't want to keep entering a
passphrase to decrypt them.
One way to achieve this is to encrypt them to an OpenPGP key that has
an empty passphrase.
Another suggestion is to store the files on an encrypted disk instead
of using GnuPG. This would require disk encryption software, of which
one example is TrueCrypt (see ).

When you said you would be messaging "bob at corporate.domain" I
interpreted that in the context of a discussion about OpenPGP keys to
mean you were exchanging encrypted communications with that email
address. It appears you probably meant the communication with
"bob at corporate.domain" was the out-of-band channel by which you and
Bob told each other your OpenPGP key fingerprints, and that being able
to send emails from those corporate accounts also doubled as identity
verification (because only the individual knows the relevant
credentials to send from "their" corporate email address, and the
company is required to verify government-issued ID documents when
engaging staff).
The bit about the employer having to verify people's ID may lead me to
accept a corporate ID card as an alternative to government-issued ID.
As for use of a corporate email address, could I be sure that Bob
locked his computer every time he left his desk? Or that nobody else
would ever have access to a written record of Bob's passwords? Or
that, in Bob's absence, a substitute would never use Bob's email
address when covering his work?

I have often seen mention of (but not personally used) CA - Fire and
Forget (CAFF)
       "CA Fire and Forget is a script that helps you in keysigning.  It takes
       a list of keyids on the command line, fetches them from a keyserver and
       calls GnuPG so that you can sign it.  It then mails each key to all its
       email addresses - only including the one UID that we send to in each
       mail, pruned from all but self sigs and sigs done by you.  The mailed
       key is encrypted with itself as a means to verify that key belongs to
       the recipient."

What, in your opinion, makes a UID "not valid?"
I thought that as soon as a public key is published or shared, the
person who created it no longer has control.

Doesn't the CAFF method (emailing the key with your signature on just
one uid in an encrypted message to the email address in that uid) take
care of that for you? Unless the same person has access to
both the secret key and the email address, they don't have access to
your signature on that uid.

It doesn't sound that onerous to me. But I have to wonder what is
actually gained by selectively signing the uids? Doesn't GnuPG
calculate key validity based on all the certifications on a key,
rather than taking into account only the signatures on an
individual uid? So keeping track of selectively-signed uids on other
people's keys on an ongoing basis might be very burdensome indeed.

Encrypted or not, a message you receive may not come from the
purported sender. Witness all the social engineering "phishing" emails
purporting to be from banks who have mislaid your login details.
OpenPGP's mitigation against this is signing emails, and the web of
trust to give assurance who signed.
You mean the recipient has 2 keys, one of which the adversary has
compromised? And the adversary intercepts and decrypts mail that is
encrypted to the compromised key, then sends it on its way encrypted
to the non-compromised key? Again, this would be flagged up if the
sender was in the habit of signing outgoing messages (as you stated).
Is that better than the usual signing and encryption carried out
Both your examples seem to involve encrypted-only and not signed
messages, so would be unaffected by introducing additional signature
options. Unless signing were compulsory rather than an option.

Most "signed and encrypted" messages created with PGP or GnuPG have
the two processes applied together - you do not normally decrypt a
message and then see a signed message as the output. An exception is
"signed and encrypted" messages created in the Hushmail web interface.

I think the thread you linked to [1] says it is possible using
GnuPG's --show-session-key and --override-session-key options. And at
the end of the thread, Werner says PGP/MIME signs and encrypts using
separate MIME containers, which makes it easy to strip off the
encryption layer.
[1] I did. Gpg --list-packets output starts the same. But to get all of
the info on the two-step signed then encrypted, I have to run gpg
