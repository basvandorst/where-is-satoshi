@_subject: Encrypting and decrypting directories under Linux 
Hi all
I'd like to ask the question: is this possible to encrypt and decrypt whole directories under linux using GnuPG. I'm right now working on the idea of securing users home directories  using some exisitng encryption method. PGP keys looks like interesting method for me but I don't know if my idea can be physicaly performed.
Please let me know your thoughts and/or maybe some resources. I'm also thinking that maybe someone knows the better method of encrypting directories and files than GnuPG (this is maybe a little off-topic of this mailing list so please send me private message about that if you have any ideas)
huge thanks in advance

Ok sorry that I didn't make myself clear. I'm preparing the CD bootable
distribution of Linux. Lets not fall in the details but generally speaking
user have possibility to write data to this cd-rw that contains the
distribution. If the users home directory will not be encrypted someone
might moutn the disk under linux and browse the home directory freely!
Dennis you sugestion with crypt seems fitting my need, thanks a lot. Typing
only password seems to be better choice for user that remembering his
private key :D.
Maybe someone got some other ideas, huh?
