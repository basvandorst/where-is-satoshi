@_subject: Special characters in passphrase not being recognized 
Hi, I am complety new to GnuPG, currently I am playing with version 1.2.1. With "Windows Privacy Tools"  I managed to create a key where
the passprhase contains special characters (accented characters and so
on), when I do my tests using WPT everything works ok, but when I use
gpg.exe (Windows 2K) it just doesn't recognize my passphrase.
I hace done many tests changin the passphrase (through WPT) to include
and excluse special characters, and the behavios looks consistent.
There is no CAPS LOCK problem, etc.
I have searched through the lists messages, faqs, etc. But I havent
found anything useful.

But I have no proble using WPT, the problem arises when I use gpg.exe
via the DOS console, I suppose it is related to the encoding but I use
the DOS window with special characters without any other problem.

Umm, interesting DOS Code Pages. I'll be checking my configuration and
post my experience here. Thanks Timo.
