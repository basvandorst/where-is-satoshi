@_subject: two out of three keys.gnupg.net keyservers down? 
After struggling with sending and retrieving keys for several days I
finally noticed that keys.gnupg.net uses DNS round robin to provide you
with a keyserver. But two out of the three servers are down.
$ host keys.gnupg.net
keys.gnupg.net has address 209.234.253.170
keys.gnupg.net has address 129.128.98.22
keys.gnupg.net has address 193.174.13.74
209.234.170 (zimmermann.mayfirst.org) works.
129.128.98.22 (pgp.srv.ualberta.ca) and 193.174.13.74
(pgpkeys.pca.dfn.de) are both down.
Since keys.gnupg.net is the default keyserver name used could the broken
keyservers be removed from the DNS round robin pool?
The gnupg user experience is really bad otherwise. If you are lucky to
hit the one that works everything is fine, but two out of three times
you hit a bad one and things just stall and hang for ages.
