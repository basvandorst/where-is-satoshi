Get version 1.95 aka geheimnis_2, that one is for KDE 2.
For Geheimnis 1.x, you will need both QT 1.4x and KDE 1.x libraries installed. If you intend to rebuild from the sources or source RPMs, you will need to also have installed all headers for QT and KDE.
For Geheimnis 2.x, you will need QT 2.0 and KDE 2.0 libraries installed. If you intend to build from sources or source packages, you will also need their headers (often called -devel packages)
To me, 2.x isn't older than 1.x :)
