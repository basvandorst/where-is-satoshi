@_subject: GnuPG 1.4.15 RAM EATER? Or just a bug? 
I noticed that this 1.4.15 version consumes much more RAM than previous versions.My Linux desktop background wallpaper turns blank(dark) when encrypting/decrypting operations (which is a novelty,and that is why I detected this "problem") and when I execute the free command to analyse RAM the used RAM reaches the maximum level of my system(from a relatively low level).Is it a bug? Does it have any implications to the encryption effectiveness?
