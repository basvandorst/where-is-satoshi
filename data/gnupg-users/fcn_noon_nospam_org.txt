@_subject: cygwin gcc options for modules 
The "canonical" way to compile a module (e.g., rsa.c) is:
  gcc -Wall -O2 -shared -fPIC -o rsa rsa.c
But this doesn't work at all under CygWin.  What are the preferred
options there?

@_subject: mailcrypt error msg 
The following message is a courtesy copy of an article
that has been posted to gnu.emacs.help as well.
I'm trying to use mailcrypt for the first time, and am running into a
mysterious message which, by grepping .el files, seems to be emanating
from ange-ftp of all things:
Removing old name: no such file or directory, \
                              c:/tmp/mailcrypt-gpg-stderr-1036x4x
(And, of course, c:/tmp *does* exist.)  This happens when I try to
sign or encrypt, after I enter my passphrase, and nothing ends up
happening in the buffer.  Any ideas about what I might do to correct
My setup:
  OS: Windows 2000 sp1
  nt emacs: GNU Emacs 20.7.1 (i386-*-nt5.0.2195) of Tue Jun 13 \
                              2000 on buffy
  mailcrypt: 3.5.5
  GnuPG: 1.0.4-1
Thanks for any assistance!
