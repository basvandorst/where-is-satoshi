Couldn't I check this by looking at the public keys they published at

Hash: SHA1
Is there any way to properly fetch keys automatically if you are on a machine where only HTTP to port 80 and HTTPS to port 443 are allowed?
(I.e. you are behind a firewall/proxy that checks not only ports but
protocols also).

No luck although I even tried broken-http-proxy.
It's always:
gpg: requesting key 89074FAD from http server keyserver.pramberger.at
[or whatever keyserver I try]
gpgkeys: http fetch error 7: couldn't connect: No error
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: Total number processed: 0
Normal http requests (wget etc.) work through this proxy.

This works as designed, as far as I know.
Else an attacker might be able to remove signatures from your key.

It is possible to do so if you check "Always use PGP/MIME" in the
OpenPGP Preferences of Enigmail, section PGP/MIME.
How much this is compatible to PGP, I don't know.

They are two tools sharing the principles of public-key encryption.
PGP was implemented first. Sadly being non-free, many people considered
it not usable for security tasks.
Thus, a Free Software implementation was started, that's GnuPG.
Further, a standard [1] was drafted so other tools could be created
which share the same principles. Or maybe this is nonsense and someone
can correct me. ;)
Should be answered above. :)

Have you ever tried
hkp://subkeys.pgp.net or hkp://sks.keyserver.penguin.de ?
Broken keyservers have serious problems with subkeys.
