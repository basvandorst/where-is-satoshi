@_subject: Problem with Smart Card/scdaemon 
I just received my first OpenPGP smart card
( and I'm trying to use it with GPG.
My environment: Arch Linux, GnuPG 2.0.15; the reader is a Reiner SCT
cyberJack pinpad. pcscd is running.
See what happens when I try to access the card:
That is, after the initial listing of the card's content, I cannot
access it anymore due to the "Broken pipe".
Using GnuPG 1.4.10, I don't have this problem (no surprise, since it
doesn't use scdaemon, after all).
Any ideas what's going on and how to fix it?
Many thanks,
    Edmond

that problem was fixed after a reboot. I have no idea what might have
caused it ... Anyway, it's gone now. :)

@_subject: PIN input via cyberJack pinpad 
I would really like to use my card reader's PIN pad to enter the PIN
for my keys stored on an OpenPGP smart card. I have a cyberJack
pinpad(a). Currently, when I'm required to enter my PIN, pinentry pops
up and the reader's pad is ignored.
Unfortunately, in a >4 years old message, somebody stated regarding
those cyberJack readers and PCSC:
I'm not sure whether things have changed since then, or if I'm just
doing something wrong. I am using pcsc-lite and GPG 2.
If there is really no way to use my reader's PIN pad, could you please
recommend me some well-supported reader to replace my current one?
    Edmond.
