@_subject: key different in gpg 1.0? 
I just upgraded to vesion 1.0 of gpg from .9.5 and my key is different.
After installing 1.0, I did an export of my key and it was much longer than
the key from the prior version.  why is this?  does the old key still work
with stuff i encrypt with version 1?
thank you,
