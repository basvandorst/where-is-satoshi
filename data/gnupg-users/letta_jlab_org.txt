@_subject: gpg API ? 
Hello.  Are there any resources that could help me get started using gpg
in my own C programs ?  I would like the ability to encrypt and decrypt
text from within my own programs.

@_subject: gpg from cronjobs 
If I want to have process (say from a cronjob) decrypt files with no
interaction, what is the best way ?  I have created a keypair for this
purpose and did not put in a passphase.  This worked, but I know this
isn't very secure.  So I also made a keypair with a passphase, but I
haven't found a way to supply the passphrase on the command line (which
is also insecure).
Any thought on which is the lesser of two evils? Or perhaps a better
solution to this?
