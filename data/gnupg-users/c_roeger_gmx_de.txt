@_subject: Always-trust ? 
I'm using an automatism to import some keys and then create some
encrypted messages for any of theses keys. It's not important in this
case to really sign and trust all of these keys, so I tried to encrypt
the messages through a pipe with "gpg --always-trust -ear UserID". But
it still prompts me and asks, if I want to use this key.
Is always-trust the wrong option to avoid it or what else could I do to
simply encrypt the data, without being prompted?
Thanx in advance,
