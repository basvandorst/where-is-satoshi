@_subject: GnuPG public key vulnerability? 
Hi Murphy,
This email refers to the ROCA vulnerability (
public/papers/rsa_ccs17), which affects a number of hardware devices
including some versions of the Yubikey 4-nano (
keycheck/). I believe Yubico are offering to replace affected Yubikeys.
One aspect of this vulnerability is that RSA public keys can be very easily
checked to determine if they are vulnerable - so at Facebook, we checked
the public keys that have been uploaded to people's profiles, and notified
people whose keys are affected. Unfortunately it seems like you were one of
the unlucky ones! Details here: Hope that helps,
