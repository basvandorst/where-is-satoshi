Would it be feasible to have a signature notation for use when
signing other keys you own, that could potentially be parsed by
GnuPG? It would have to be reciprocal to prevent abuse.
Say a user has two keys, 0x0123456789abcdef and 0xfedcba9876543210. I
propose each key could sign the other with a signature notation
something like:-
siblings-0x0123456789abcdef-0xfedcba9876543210 at example.org.
If there were more than two keys it could be extended, or maybe each
pair would have to cross-sign. When GnuPG encountered "siblings" from
the same set that had cross-signatures with this notation, the
"family" could be counted only once in trust calculations.

A key on my keyring is "valid" if it is not expired or revoked and it
bears one signature from one of my keys, or several signatures from
other keys to which I have granted marginal authority to validate
"Valid" in this context means that my copy of GnuPG will accept it as
an encryption key. It is not necessarily related to the purported
identity of the person or persons who are thought to have access to
the corresponding private key. (I may, for example, locally sign a key
that works for exchanging with a particular email address. That does
not mean I have any clue who controls that key or that email address.)
What is somebody's "true" identity? Many (or even most) people have
more than one identity, some long-lasting and others ephemeral. A
professional versus a personal identity. Multiple social identities
depending on context. A professional identity in each of several
occupations, either simultaneously or changing over time. The name on
their birth certificate versus the name by which they are actually
known. Etc.
GnuPG *can* inspect the signatures present on a key to determine
validity. Validity does not equate to ownership or identity.
No it was not. The key is "valid" by virtue of the signatures it
carries. It is a simple mechanism.
Validity is just counting the relevant signatures. It only becomes
confusing when you consider the meaning of those signatures.
I disagree. Validity in GnuPG is a perfectly clear descriptive name
for a simple, mechanistic concept.
Once the user establishes the question of ownership/identity/control,
they *could* then choose to validate the key by signing it. But the
choice is theirs alone: simply knowing does not make their copy of
GnuPG accept the key as "valid."
Mine says it remains the property of the government and may be
withdrawn at any time. So whoever uses the passport when they travel,
it is never the owner.

I don't personally like "authenticity" or "authentic" here but no
sensible alternative suggestion comes to mind. "Authenticated" would
better fit my understanding.
The presence of my local signature on a key allows GnuPG to determine
validity, but could not be said to indicate I have started to build a
OK. The key is "valid" because it is not expired or revoked. If it
bears no WoT signatures (and no exportable signatures from any of my
keys), it seems wrong to say it is "authenticated." If it is only
accepted by GnuPG due to my local signature, maybe a better word is
In my experience it is commonplace for signatures to indicate either,
depending on context. You sign a statement to the Police to indicate
its authenticity. You sign a bank card to confer validity. (At least
where I come from, above the signature strip on most bank cards it
still says "not valid unless signed.")

Fair enough.
I take your point, but would prefer such a fundamental statement about
shared genesis of multiple keys to reference those keys directly.
After all, as well as claiming "this other key is also mine"
(corroborated by cross-signing), you would also be indicating your
intention that your set of keys should be treated as one key for the
purpose of trust calculations. It needs to be as deliberate and
explicit as reasonably possible, with room for error minimised.
I can see the point of differentiating between a certification on the
key of somebody you actually know and on the key of somebody you don't
know but checked id. But I agree with DKG that "This is my
sister/neighbour/work-colleague/friend-since-childhood" etc is too
much information that could backfire on people.

Interesting. Why not?
Why non-exportable? If I were making such a declaration about the
relationship between my multiple keys, I would want to declare it to
others. This could be useful for key transitions, but also for an
individual who chooses to use different keys with different email
addresses (so may not have a "identical-valid-user-id" across
different keys).
Or do you envisage somebody else with my public keys on their keyring
would make that non-exportable certification themselves, in order to
clean up their own WoT calculations? Actually, on thinking about it,
that option also would be useful.
A certification directly on the primary key itself would make sense,
because it is a statement about the key itself, not just the key and
it's current set of UIDs. But having it over the UIDs, so
requiring a re-certification from my other key to cover any new
user-ids, maybe adds a certain amount of security. How do you make a
certification directly on the primary key itself.
Isn't that kind of a "chicken and egg" statement? Would it not be an
idea to discuss a standardised notation, so that if anybody chooses to
put the information out there, it could be interpreted by an algorithm
that might get written in the future.
Maybe "identical" should be expanded to cover such things as different
capitalisation, etc.

Why? If people re-upload their keys to servers to publish additional
UIDs and certifications, I see no reason why this should be rare at
all. Plenty of people change email addresses frequently, or use
several. If they have added an email address since some certifications
were obtained on their key, that user-id will bear fewer
certifications so will likely appear "valid" to fewer users.

I would love to do this for both email addresses and names, for

Probably quicker and easier for spammers to just randomly generate
addresses. And there will be so many out-of-date email addresses on
the keyservers that it would not be worth the effort to scrape them.
I have a key on the servers for just over four years now with a valid
address that has been used for no other purpose and has not received a
single email. OK, not a statistically valid experiment but I'm sure
plenty of others have done similar.

Does the email address really need to "leak" to spammers at all? I
have a couple of domains set up with catch-all email forwarding;
occasionally for about a couple of weeks one or other domain receives
spam messages addressed to (or bounces to messages spoofed to be
"from") random names at the domain, then it stops and doesn't happen
again for months or years.
For a couple of weeks until the spammer moves onto a new set of email
addresses. But, just maybe, it becomes an ongoing problem and makes
the address unuseable. In that case, somebody who uses a unique email
address to correspond with each contact simply tells that contact a
new address and retires the old one.

Yes, she can.
The revocation is a signature over the specific uid (or uids) that
were selected when the "revuid" command was issued. And, as you say,
she would not be able to re-use signatures she collected on her "old"
UID2 on her "new" one.
Alice would need to come to a specific arrangement with the sender for
that to be possible. In general, if Alice has shared multiple
encryption keys with the same email address in the uids, the sender
might encrypt to any one of them (or any subset).
What do you mean by a "subordinate key?" A subkey? Or another,
completely unrelated key?
In either case, one option is to simply edit the expiry date and keep
the existing key.
In the case of a subkey, allowing it to expire and creating a new one
makes no difference to the existing signatures.
If you just mean another, unrelated key, switch to a new key and the
new one starts without a collection of signatures.
Are you asking just the meaning, or what the signature is calculated
The trite answer is Bob's signature means whatever Bob wants it to
mean. He might even publish a key signing policy to tell people what
he means. Put "key signing policy" (without the quotes) into your
favourite search engine to see some examples.
Typically, Bob's signature might mean Bob asserts:-
(1)        that Alice is known by the name she claims in the UID (or
           has documentation that Bob trusts that supports her claim to that name)
(2)        that Alice has control of (or at least access to) any email
           address contained in that uid
(3)        that Alice has control of the corresponding private key
           (can read a message encrypted to that key and can produce a
           signature using that key).
Bob's signature says nothing about any UIDs other that the one(s) that
Bob has signed.
As to "subordinate keys." If you mean subkeys, they are part of
Alice's key. See (3) above.
Or some identities on one key together, plus some other identities on
their own keys.
Yes. But also more effort for you. And if people know more than one of
your identities, slightly more effort for them.
Once you have given somebody else a copy of your public key, do you
have *any* control over how they use it?
Not that I am aware of.
I'll leave that one to somebody who has chosen to participate in the

I had created a new UID with exactly the same UID string as the

    They know you rang a phone sex service at 2:24 am and spoke
    for 18 minutes. But they don't know what you talked about.
    They know you called the suicide prevention hotline from the
    Golden Gate Bridge. But the topic of the call remains a secret.
    They know you spoke with an HIV testing service, then your doctor,
    then your health insurance company in the same hour. But they
    don't know what was discussed.
    They know you received a call from the local NRA office while it
    was having a campaign against gun legislation, and then called
    your senators and congressional representatives immediately after.
    But the content of those calls remains safe from government
    intrusion.
    They know you called a gynecologist, spoke for a half hour, and
    then called the local Planned Parenthood's number later that day.
    But nobody knows what you spoke about.
    Sorry, your phone records?oops, "so-called metadata"?can reveal a
    lot more about the content of your calls than the government is
    implying. Metadata provides enough context to know some of the

- From (possibly inaccurate) memory, PGP was up to somewhere around
version 8.x before it supported signing subkeys.
IIRC, older PGP versions would choke on trying to encrypt to a key
whose newest subkey was flagged for signing but not encryption, and
would use the main key to sign with. (I have no recollection of what
happened trying to verify signatures.)

Is there a way to get GnuPG 1.4 to use one gpg.conf file and GnuPG 2.1
to use a different gpg.conf file? (Other than state it on the command
line every time.) Under Windows XP, in case it matters.
Alternatively, can you include a line in a gpg.conf file that will be
parsed by 2.1 and not by 1.4?
What I am trying to do is use an RSA key that has an ECC signing
subkey (newer) and an RSA signing subkey (older). The idea is that if
I use GnuPG version 2.1 it will sign with both subkeys, but if I use
version 1.4 it signs with just the RSA subkey.
"local-user 0xMainKeyID" in gpg.conf gets me a signature from the RSA
subkey if using 1.4 and a signature from the ECC subkey if using 2.1.
"local-user 0xRSAsubKeyID!" gets me an RSA signature from both GnuPG
"local-user 0xECCsubKeyID!" gets me an ECC signature from 2.1 but

I suspect when Kristian said "per-device signing keys" the inference
was that each device might have its own signing subkey but they would
share the encryption subkey. I don't know what they meant by
"cellphone substitution." However, I have seen previous discussions
that suggested the use of different encryption keys on things like
mobile phones, which would indeed mean going to your other device to
decrypt. I think the assertion is that a key held on a mobile phone is
possibly less secure.

Recommended by whom and against what threat model? And, really, the
same lifespan for signing keys as for encryption keys?
I use the supermarket approach to advice: only pick up what I need at
the time. My take on the advice I have most often seen in previous
discussions is to set fairly short expiry dates, and make the decision
whether to replace it or extend its life when the expiry date is
approaching. This gives you an opportunity to review the current state
of your tools, and best practices.
OK, it would, but do you really need them all? If you use subkeys for
each of those three capabilities, have you determined that in all
three cases your threat model requires a new subkey every two years?
Because they do not follow the recommendations you have taken on
A lot of keys are created without expiry date. This is the GnuPG
default; we are frequently exhorted that the defaults are chosen to be
sensible for most users, and to only deviate if you know what you are
doing _and_why_.
A large proportion of keys do not have a signing subkey (certainly of
the 32 we currently encrypt messages to for the PGPNET discussion

encryption has no need of an authentication key. That is probably a
large percentage of users.

Unable rather than unwilling?
PGP 8.0.3 and 8.1 definitely did not handle signing subkeys, and
choked if it happened to be the newest subkey.
After trying and not liking PGP 9.x I switched to using GnuPG. I think
it was the UI and the removal of support for encrypting to groups that
prompted the switch, so I can't comment on signing subkey support.
However, Tom McCune [0] says:-
    "GPG began using subkeys for signing before PGP. Until PGP 8.1,
    PGP had no support for this, and could not verify signatures made
    with such a signing subkey. PGP 9.x adds signing subkey
    functioning. With PGP 9.x, you can now generate and use signing
    subkeys - this allows you to continue using your original signing
    key ID and fingerprint for continuity purposes, while being able
    to enhance your signing security with key replacement."

I'm confused. You seemed to be making quite a point of it. (-:
Or there are new ideas/standards/technology/exploits such that a
particular key size or algorithm is no longer considered safe, or
something is available with a smaller signature size, for example.
Examples include the introduction of subkeys, larger key sizes (2048
instead of 1024), DSA or DSA2 vs RSA, ...
There are others on this list better placed to answer this. As far as
I know, the only thing actually encrypted to your secret key is the
session key for each message.
I did not know that. I guess the Enigmail developers must know what
they are doing _and_why_.
You were asking why most keys seem to have far fewer subkeys (in use
or expired/revoked) than the advice you were following would lead you
to expect. I was saying that one reason is because a large proportion
of keys do not have a signing subkey. (-;
My old key was a v3 key that didn't support subkeys, and that lasted
me about 11 years. My new key has signing subkeys of both RSA and
EDDSA varieties.
I understand the idea of offline main keys, but don't see how the use
case fits my threat model.

Each key pair consists of a private key and a public key that are

Each user shares their public key with other people, but keeps their
private key to themself and protects it with a passphrase.
A signature is made with your own private key, which you need the
passphrase to use. The person verifying your signature needs only your
public key and does not need your passphrase.

If several signing keys match the "From" email address, my email
client manages to get GnuPG to return a list so that I can choose
which key to use for signing. Conversely, if I sign a file from the
commandline using the --local-user option with a string that matches
several signing keys, I am not presented with this choice.
If several encryption keys match the "To" address of an email, there
is no such choice of keys offered by my MUA and GnuPG picks one to use
for encryption. GnuPG also picks the key itself when I encrypt from
the commandline and use a non-unique pattern.

I'll take that to mean your problem with the web of trust.
The pedantry about verifying government-issued identity is perhaps
necessary if you have the need to be confident the government knows
the other person as "John Smith" and that they are the right one of
the many "John Smiths" in existence. If that is not needed, the
name by which any government knows the person is irrelevant.
That's right, each context in which a person presents themself is
effectively a distinct identity or persona. If the contexts overlap,
there is a certain amount of blending between the distinct personas.
Your certification on a key means exactly what you want it to mean.
If your certification is published with a key, it is up to each user
to interpret that certification as they see fit (or to ignore it
Is that so different from the person you don't actually know, but they
are sometimes on the train when you are commuting, and just

If I didn't know their name or address, depending on the amount
involved I may not accept the cheque.
Is what the signature means? Are they not simply saying, in effect,
"Yeah I've used that key for that _email address_?"
Depends on the conversation. (-;
There is no standard threat model. But the NSA and others are, at
least anecdotally, monitoring all communications and retaining copies
if they are encrypted. And any person could come under scrutiny as a

Mail encryption is vastly superior to HashCash, in my opinion, since

speaking, auto-replies of the type "you sent an email to

By the way, I tried to send a test message to myself from

Yes, I wasn't promoting it. Just replying to Steve's post about
keyservers verifying UIDs by sending emails being a "nice solution"
and had it been discussed - by showing him that it had actually been
tried and there is an instance publicly available. I was hoping that
Steve would then search for discussions on "PGP Global Directory" to
see arguments for and against, or maybe that somebody would briefly
summarise here.
And I guess these have been leaked onto the networked keyservers,
rather than being confined to PGP Global Directory? I never really saw
the point of those signatures from the directory: if it was listed
there, it had been verified in the last six months, and once a user
had downloaded and used it for communication, they knew whether or not

I'm not sure about "official" in this context, but agree the rest is
at least desirable.
Indeed. When I was doing my physics A-level (a long time ago now), for
certain subject areas we used elderly textbooks that covered the
material much better than the more modern references. In one
particular case, the books were over 40 years old. The style of
writing was very dated and the units described had been superceded
several times, but it was still a very useful reference.
A single, joined-up documentation providing what you mentioned would
be a valuable resource, if people with the appropriate expertise and
profile could be induced to produce it and to revise/update it from
time to time. And the plethora of existing and third-party
documentation would still be available for broader reference.
I would say providing a good tutorial on email security could easily
be seen to fall within the documentation set you seek. But I would
also say it should be a broad-brush approach, because detailed
specifics about a range of related applications should fall outwith
the scope of a documentation project such as you suggest. That said,
there might be merit in including one or two case studies that did go
into such specifics.
For the documentation to be useful to beginners, it is important to
also have input from people who recently were beginners. Experts in
any field tend not to have a reasonably fresh memory of the
difficulties and doubts they had as beginners.

There is ambiguity in using the word "accept" and that is why I prefer

What would you verify? For any encrypted mail I send, all that really
matters is the person controlling the email address I am sending to

Why not? If they are determined, they will get around the safeguards
anyway. If they were simply unwittingly going to do something
potentially harmful, the safeguards were worth it.
But either of those two is better than somebody who leaks it without
having considered all angles and formed an opinion, and without
considering the interests of others who may be harmed by his leaking.
The leaking of personal and/or social information cannot be made
impossible but it needs to be a deliberate choice. We should get as
close as we can to making _accidental_ leaking impossible.
It is nothing like a simple "He leaks, you don't" when he is leaking
information relating to others as well as to himself. (More "He leaks,
you don't - so you avoid him like the plague. Oops, he already leaked
information about you before you found out he was leaky and started to

The email client will have told GnuPG to search for a key with a UID
containing , which it found. I suspect
 was reported by the email client as the signing
identity due to being set as the default UID.
Anybody could look at the key using GnuPG or something like PGPdump
and see all the IDs. In fact, simply checking the signature with GnuPG
should display something like:-
gpg: Good signature from "... " [unknown]
gpg:                 aka "... " [unknown]
[a unique key for each persona]
GnuPG can't manage your passphrases for you, but there are various
password managers available to do just that.
Not leaking the identity information can be achieved by not putting it
in your UIDs.
For example, my key has only one UID: "MFPA "
However, not having the email address in my UID makes it harder for
people to use my key.
Anybody who receives signed emails that I sent from different
addresses can see they were signed with the same key and deduce they
are likely to be from the same person. But they cannot look at the key
and enumerate what other addresses or names I might use.
You could use the same password for several keys, or use a password
manager such as you might use to remember website login details.
To enable my email client to locate my key by email address, I make
use of group lines in my gpg.conf. For example:-
group <2014-667rhzu3dc-lists-groups at riseup.net>=0xA8A90B8EAD0C6E69
For my email client, this only works if the email address in the group
line is surrounded by angle brackets. Other people report that they
need to omit the angle brackets, and still others report that it does
not matter for them.

I think the discussion has been of some use in aiding some of us's
understanding, but has gone at least as far as it usefully could.
Provided words/phrases are not recycled in a UI and its FAQ/manual to
mean something different to an already-accepted meaning in the context
of GnuPG/OpenPGP, I think it matters little which words are used to
get across what needs to be conveyed.
That is an interesting thought. I wonder how what proportion of the
population would know what it meant, unless it appeared in a book they
studied at school or a film/TV programme they saw last week.
I would propose a third question: Was the message/file altered in
Why ask the certification level? What is this information used for?
Unless it actually has a real use, the user should not be asked to
spend time considering it, it should not be recorded, and certainly
should not be published. If somebody thinks they need this, and knows
why, they should be able to find it in an "expert" mode.
The basic user (and in my opinion, most users) should just have one
question but need to answer it in respect of each UID, something
"I accept this key for communication with . Yes/No"
                                      aka . Yes/No"
                                      aka . Yes/No"
I think this should also be in an "expert" mode, or at least absent
from a "basic" mode.
And I would prefer something more like "I hereby publicly state that
this key belongs to . Yes/No" With a Yes/No selector for each
of the UIDs on the key.
The active copy on the user's keyring should get a non-exportable
signature whatever the answer, and for each UID where the user
answered "Yes" a copy bearing the exportable signature on that UID
only should be placed in a message encrypted to that key and
pre-addressed to the email address in that UID.
Another I think should possibly not be in the "basic" mode. Does an
absolute beginner really need to be able to nominate trusted

Combining is good. Back to two simple questions.
But I disagree with the premise that the third question would usually
have had the opposite answer to the second: emails are frequently
slightly altered in transit, breaking the signature, but still came
from the purported sender.
I refer you to an article on Daniel Kahn Gillmor's blog.
Yes. Exactly what you would get by default from applying a
non-exportable signature with GnuPG.
The existing default of an 0x10 "Generic certification" is a good
GnuPG only prompts you to pick a certification level if you enable the
"--ask-cert-level" option, which is disabled by default. As far as I
know, the level doesn't affect WoT calculations.
"To whom it may concern" is much more subtle than "I hereby publicly
state," but a letter of introduction that was not specifically
addressed could be considered a form of public declaration. I still
think there is merit in making the user choose which UIDs to include
in the letter of introduction: some of them may include email
addresses, roles, or personas outwith the user's knowledge of the key

Generally speaking, why would the public need to know if *you* trust

Anyway, if you use "--ask-cert-level" when signing, and tell GnuPG
when it asks "I have not checked at all," you will make a "persona"
certification. I'm not sure if that works/makes sense with a trust
signature, since 0x11 (persona) certifications are generally ignored
in WoT calculations.

Sounds like an updated version of the rubber-stamp signatures that
used to be on some company cheques and other documents.
In either case, if it can be shown that a third party has at least
once done so, then everything bearing my signature is now
questionable. However much somebody may trust me, they can no longer
assume a particular instance of my signature was put there by me
rather than the third party. (Unless the signature was witnessed by
trusted individuals whose signatures have not been compromised.)
So why not just follow the standard practice of the trusted secretary
signing the document himself and annotating it was signed for and on
behalf of his boss?
If the "autopen" signature looks just like the real deal then, unless
the document is annotated to indicate it is machine-generated by

possible to convert a v3 key to a v4 key. But I am not optimistic that
such a converted key could be used to check signatures made by, or
decrypt data encrypted to, the original v3 key.

Newly-added ECC signing and encryption subkeys would be used in
preference by GnuPG 2.1; older GnuPG versions would ignore them and
use the older subkeys. And you can configure GnuPG 2.1 to sign with
both signing subkeys (or just the older subkey, but then what's the
point of the newer one?), so that contacts using older versions would
be able to verify your signatures.

Each key is refreshed using a unique Tor circuit rather than a random

The downside that I didn't remember is that it picks a key at random
to refresh each time, so it can't guarantee that every key actually

So, it would seem that adding ECC signing subkeys to an RSA key does
not completely break compatibility with GnuPG 1.4.18: the 1.4.x user
can still encrypt to the non-ecc subkey and can sign with the main
key. Obviously ECC signatures could not be checked with 1.4.x.

Hash: SHA512
On Monday 6 April 2015 at 5:04:09 PM, in
I was referring to the way the email address is passed by an MUA to
GnuPG to search for a key, which I don't imagine involves a shell.
Specifically, I asked the OP to reconsider his decision not to include
angle brackets around the email address in his "email address only"
simplified UID format. He reconsidered and added the angle brackets.
DKG has raised a broader issue: keys exist with a UID containing an
email address not surrounded by the conventional angle brackets, which
causes searching for an exact match on the email address in the way
the GnuPG man-page prescribes (by enclosing that email address in
angle brackets) to fail. He has simply proposed that the absence of
angle brackets in the UID should not cause the email address match to
fail. I see that as entirely reasonable.
Fair enough. But they are not all equivalent. The string being
searched for by numbers one and three does not contain opening and
closing angle brackets, whereas the string number four is trying to
match does include them.
And as you say, the second is not valid because < and > are special
characters; presumably they should be escaped with a backslash, or the
whole string enclosed in quotes as in number four.
I think DKG's suggestion will fix it within GPG.

Or, indeed, using batch mode.
Don't know about "shocked", but unintended consequences for a
non-standard UID scheme was indeed the issue.
The OP started this thread with a plug for his version of the GnuPG
smart card. Part of his scheme was to generate keys with a simplified
UID format that contained just an email address.
I pointed out that at least one MUA sends the email address enclosed
in angle brackets as the search string for GnuPG to locate the key. No
angle brackets around the email address means no key found. The OP
reconsidered his scheme and added the angle brackets. Issue resolved.
Nor would I. But if somebody creates a key UID with just a bare email
address, is it sensible to accept that email address as a match when
selecting keys?

If GnuPG were modified in this way the key could still be signed
using an old GnuPG version, or any other OpenPGP application.
I guess a modification would be possible that allowed a GnuPG user to
sign acceptance or rejection over a third-party signature, but I'm not
convinced there would be any point. Firstly, would such acceptance or
rejection be dropped by the keyservers? Secondly, any signature on a
key is only meaningful if you recognise (or have a trust path to) the
key that made that signature; the rest is meaningless background noise
that disappears if you use "keyserver-options import-clean" in your
gpg.conf or on your command line. (My local copy of Facebook's public
key has only self-signatures, and refreshing from a keyserver does not
change this).

For the time being, forget keys and think about people in the real

know the name of anybody who does not know your name?
None: if you know each other and have verified each other's keys, you
do not need a certification from anybody else. In that case all
signatures are just "noise".
What about somebody who has not verified your key, but has verified
one or more of the keys that have signed your key? They can use the
presence of those signatures as a factor in deciding whether to trust
your key. In that case, signatures from keys that person has verified
are useful _to_that_person_ but any other signatures are "noise"
_to_that_person_. The signatures that have been found useful in this
case won't necessarily be signatures from keys that you have verified,

Interesting use of "simply". That procedure sounds far more
complicated than storing your various secret keys on your keyring and
having GnuPG use them in the normal way. I'm not sure what you gain in
return for the increased complexity.
I did a quick search for "hierarchical deterministic keys" and found
Which tells me that if the parent public key is published and one of
the child secret keys is leaked, the parent secret key can be
calculated. So the parent key and all possible child keys are
compromised by the compromise of just one child secret key.

One of the members of PGPNET reports getting that error
message when verifying the signatures on my signed and encrypted

0x1712BC461AF778E4, and says he uses GnuGP 2.1.8.

Which GnuPG version are you using?
I have two "local-user" lines in my gpg.conf file, 0x1712BC461AF778E4!
and 0x6B7C74CEB31F25F0!. The aim is a signature from EDDSA subkey
0x1712BC461AF778E4, but also a signature from my RSA subkey
0x6B7C74CEB31F25F0 that can be verified by GnuPG 1.4 or 2.0 versions.
On 6th December I switched the order of these lines, so that the RSA
signature comes last. An Enigmail and GnuPG 2.0 user told me he was
not seeing the "good" signature from 0x6B7C74CEB31F25F0. It appears
that if there are multiple signatures present, Enigmail only passes on
the GnuPG output for the last one.
Maybe if there are multiple signatures present, your MUA only passes on the GnuPG output for the first one? I just switched them back round to see what happens.

I was referring to the threat "the host computer might be infected
with malware".
If they have control of your computer, do they really need to steal
the private keys? Maybe they can achieve their aims remotely, using
the keys in situ on the smartcard. And, of course, a smartcard is a
physical item that can be stolen.
I guess a smartcard reader that can only accept the key via its own
keypad would help here. If we can be sure it cannot be modified to
cache the PIN or accept it via the host computer.
Always best practice to keep a backup. Even without foul-play it would
be needed if the smartcard was lost or broken.
Or making your system sign/decrypt more than one message at a time,
when you were aware of just the one?
As has already been mentioned, an "offline" main key stops this.
Protecting the private key material is the goal. Use of smartcard and
reader is an example of a strategy to follow in pursuit of that goal.
Use of an offline main key is another example.
As always, it depends on your threat model.

Yes, I get "gpg: BAD signature from "Xavier Maillard

simply a report on how the signature verification went.
The preceding lines in the GnuPG output say otherwise:-
gpg: Signature made 12/02/2015 22:46:15 GMT Standard Time
gpg:                using RSA key 0xDE2FFC869AFA5165
gpg: using subkey 0xDE2FFC869AFA5165 instead of primary key 0xBA4909B78F04DE1B
which matches with both the key that GnuPG fetches and the key
identified in Xavier's message kludges.
I do not know what subset of the GnuPG output Enigmail reports.
When I tried to follow the link in Xavier's "X-GPG-Key" header it
timed out. And when I put "wwwkeys.pgp.net" into the box on
 it told me the site was down.
The link to that keyserver's web interface still times out for me in
two different browsers, but the "downforeveryoneorjustme.com" response

That should be the case. But the key you attached has only one subkey
(0x1181AAE315915635), and that is all I can see in the web interface
of three different keyservers. I also do not pick up any additional
subkeys in GnuPG if I refresh your key from a keyserver.
If that is the reason, there must be an awful lot of keys that would
not work with that service. However, in the absence of error messages
it is hard to diagnose the reason. Maybe the people who run encrypt.to
might be willing to help you.
My current and previous keys don't work there, and nor do a couple of
test keys I have knocking around. Two of the four cause the page to
freeze and block input to the message compose window, with no error
message at all - just like yours does. One generates a message saying
there is no key id associated with that email address, or there is no
email address associated with that key id - yet I can retrieved it
from a keyserver by searching on the email address. The fourth one
encrypts the message in the box, then (because the UID intentionally
intentionally contains an unrouteable address) produces the rather
uninformative error message "Oops! Something went wrong. Please try

Quoting from [0]:-
        When you generate a key pair, you do so with:
             1. a deterministic procedure;
             2. a source of random bits.
        For instance, with RSA, you generate p and q by creating
        random odd numbers of the right size and looping until a prime
        number is found. For a given random source, the whole process
        is deterministic: given the same random bits, this will find
        the same primes p and q.
        Hence you can develop a PRNG seeded by a secret key K and use
        it as random source for the key generation process. Whenever
        you need the private key, you run the key generation process
        again, using K as input. And voil?! Your private key, the one
        you need to store, is now K.

We only *suspect* that: we saw him holding a smoking gun but did not

trying to disarm fled or hid, or maybe they are the body on the

or more years, but provides only supposition about the events that
just occurred before we saw the smoking gun.

To me, that is tantamount to saying "If we think he did this but can't
prove it; let's pull his life apart just in case we can pin something
on him."
If there is compelling evidence it should be followed up, sensibly and
in proportion to the weight of that evidence rather than the
accusation. Beyond that and regardless of the seriousness of the
matter under investigation, the individual should not be hounded by
the authorities.
He is placed at the scene with the smoking gun but there is not yet
any evidence that *he* fired it. It is a bit of a leap from that
position to an investigation of what food he bought yesterday, how he
travels to work, where he lives... As I said, "Fractions of an identity"
that are not relevant to the specific identity enquiry.
That's better than "we have no evidence so we will investigate the
minutiae of everybody in the vicinity's lives."
And if I were to wind up murdered on a city street, I'd be dead so I
wouldn't care.
Anyway, we have gone *way* off-topic. My original comment was intended
to convey my general opinion that a publicly-known dossier of
unrelated "identity" events sounds far too invasive to be comfortable.
And later in my posting, the corollary that keybase does not sound
like something attractive to people who, like me, prefer to
compartmentalise the facets of their life as separate "fractions".

We know he was standing with a smoking gun, close to a body on the
ground. We should be investigating what happened, not wasting our time
with yesterday's food and the last three years' commuting habits.
"Who they are" in the sense of "what their name is" is obviously
irrelevant to whether they fired the gun. And I contend the vast
majority of "choices this person has made over time" would be
similarly unconnected to that night's events.
Probably more to do with context. My comment about sounding too
invasive to be comfortable would, in hindsight, have sat better at the
beginning of my final paragraph.
Probably most.
The authorities need to prove guilt. The suspect does not need to
prove innocence.
There are those who disagree, and insist on Criminal Record checks
when an individual interacts with them in a context completely
unrelated to any crime - such as a job application.
If the suspicion went to court but was not proven, that is a matter of
public record. If it never went to court, it would often be in the
individual's interest to not draw attention to having been a suspect.
That is right. Each person sees only the subset of labels relevant to
mutual interaction, plus any additional that the subject chooses to
reveal or the associate happens to stumble upon.
(What if each of these labels mapped to a UID on an OpenPGP key, but
anybody who didn't see that particular label on you could not read the
corresponding UID on your key?)

Including more than one of your online identities on the same keybase
profile damages the compartmentalisation between those identities.
Would there be much point in having a separate keybase profile for
each separate online identity? I guess it would have some value as a
kind of surrogate keyserver. A quick look at a few random keybase
profiles showed me some that had only a person's name and a link to a
key. And one with no identity links at all but 20 trackers.
Does that mean Gravatar can track your activity (or popularity?)

Aside from only demonstrating possible earlier intent rather later
actions, the fraction of comments of "I'll kill you" that actually convert to
murders is vanishingly small. If I were a juror, this evidence would
tell me nothing about guilt or otherwise.
I'm not sure the "why" matters, unless for mitigation. But connected
crimes makes sense.
The reference is lost on me. Neither is exactly an uncommon name.
I read recently that under Napoleonic law in France, the accused has
to disprove state accusations. But I never gave it any credence.
CRB checks (in the UK) also include non-public records held by police
forces and other organisations.
And of course it is a privacy invasion to go delving into records of
past events if the subject has not shared them with you and does not
generally broadcast them. When the penalty has been paid, the debt to
society is discharged and it is no longer anybody else's business.

Indeed. In some places the label of "Murder" applies to the crime with
premeditation and malice aforethought, otherwise there is a different
label such as "Manslaughter".
Fair enough, but I do not believe a throw-away comment heard in
arguments thousands of times per day throws any light on the
offender?s state of mind.
In some contexts there is [0]. But I was not referring to any right to
be forgotten, simply to rehabilitation of offenders. Once the offender
has paid their "debt to society" they are rehabilitated and should not
be hindered from playing a full part in that society.
Absolutely; it is something to be striven towards but unlikely to be

Comments in no particular order, just as they occurred to me when
looking through your paper:-
If a key is validated by the proxy, then subsequently uploaded again
with a new UID, does the new UID get a validation expiry date that
matches the rest of the key? Or does it get a standard 12-month
validation period, but still get re-validated the next time one of the
other UIDs needs it, so that all UIDs' validation expiry dates are
brought back into sync? And what if the upload with an extra UID hits
a different validation server?
If a third party has uploaded my key, or if the validation server is
automatically validating existing keys in response to certain events,
the validation emails are unsolicited by me. Most people will not
click a link in such an email.
If a third party who can intercept my emails has generated a key
containing my email address in a UID, all bets are off.
If an email provider provides public keys for their customers,
presumably those keys are unsuitable for mail encryption because the
provider may have access to the private key.
The configuration changes for email clients that you mention, things
like which keyserver to use and which keys to trust, need to be set in
GnuPG.conf (or maybe some form of GnuPG wrapper or plugin) so that
they are used by an email client that simply calls GnuPG and therefore
honours GnuPG's own settings. Same for trust models; maybe you should
consider suggesting a modified trust model for GnuPG that includes
options for handling validation signatures.
Blacklists should not be used *anywhere* as they are a form of
censorship and can be used for DOS attacks.
In your proposal for listing validation signatures in GnuPG:
"?!? after sig signals successful validation" - why is this needed?

I just think if I was to receive revalidation requests all at the same
time I would be less likely to overlook those for little-used email
addresses I do not often check. It also keeps it neat.
Nothing is perfect. Even meeting up and verifying government-issued ID
documents can be defeated by good quality fake documents.
We have the Web of Trust to demonstrate that. But those are generally
one-off signatures on a key, and may be quite a few years old. Some
email providers recycle addresses, so an address Bob used a few months
or years ago could now be under Alice's, or even Mallory's, control.
As far as I see it, your scheme adds two things: periodic
revalidation, and an easy way to get a signature on your key without
having to meet anybody.
Indeed. I think an annual revalidation period strikes a reasonable
balance, although maybe there are email services that recycle
addresses more quickly than that.
Are there really many "faked" keys, rather than keys that are no
longer used, forgotten passphrase, lost private key, etc.?
How does this help to detect interception of emails?
Company email servers, I would expect companies as a matter of course
to have a means to decrypt their employees' emails.
I'm shocked to read [0] that Riseup once had a webmail option that
stored the user's public and private keys. Riseup now tells [1] users
who want to use encrypted email to utilize an email client to send and
receive email, while keeping their private key stored safely on their
local machine.
[0] [1] Startmail sounds like a similar concept to Hushmail, which was
compromised by a court order obtained through a mutual assistance
treaty. It is not clear to me why Startmail would not be expected to
suffer the same fate.
Posteo looks interesting. But their overview says end-to-end
encryption is done by the user in addition to Posteo's own security
measures, so the user would have to generate and store their own keys.
And Google make a living out of exploiting data mined from users'
emails and search activities. Why would anybody trust them?
Fair enough. The mere presence of a validation signature from the
validation server indicates successful validation of the email address
in the UID. The "!" after "sig" in the output of --check-sigs
indicates the signature has been checked and found to be "good" or

Would this one-week PoW pause when the user shuts down and continue
when they boot it up? There are plenty of email users who do not leave
their computer running all the time.
It also eliminates any attempt to to establish a link between the key
and the email address in the UID.

I understand what you are saying. I cannot help but think they are
making a mountain out of a molehill by characterising this minor
irritation as a "show stopper". Putting something in place to
counteract the issue is one approach. Would it not be an equally-valid
approach to educate them as to why it is a non-issue, which they could
then disseminate through their magazine?
They can, however, search on keyservers for the key to which the
message was encrypted. Or ask the sender where they got it and to
forward a copy for inspection.
Fair enough.
The provider could claim the user's password must have been
compromised and that was how the validation occurred without the
user's knowledge. They could even make the user jump through password
reset and security question hoops the next time they log in. Anyway,
after ten minutes public attention will switch to something else.

How would this require a special email client?
OpenPGP-aware email clients I have used have a simple way to save a
key from a message to the keyring by clicking a button or selecting a
menu option. And if the user's email client is not OpenPGP-aware, or
they use webmail, there is always copy and paste.
I only suggested simplification of the workflow for actually
validating/signing the keys. The user can still just switch their
keyserver of choice to the validating proxy.
Yes. And for automatic re-validations, before my step 1 (key reaches
validation server) the proxy server would consult its list of which
keys it signed when and fetch them for revalidation.
No. Step 5 is that the user receives an encrypted email to each
relevant email address containing a copy of their key with the
additional signature on just that UID, much as they might receive from
other attendees at a keysigning. If they wish, the user saves the
updated key to their keyring. And, again if they wish, the user
uploads their updated key to a keyserver.
For each UID, the copy of the key containing a validation signature
over only that UID would be sent in an encrypted email to the email
address in that UID.
Receipt of the email containing the signed key confirms the ability to
receive messages sent to that email address.
And decryption of that email confirms access to the private key.
What else do you need to confirm?
It's the user's key. Denying them the choice by uploading your changes
directly to keyservers is pretty arrogant. Maybe you could have the
validating proxy upload the changes itself in the event the the key
you are validating does not have the keyserver no-modify flag set?

Fair enough if it is just to signify the key is in current usage. But
I think it does have to be per-email address if the point is to
address the same issue as Nico's scheme.
The key announcements in Mike Ingle's Confidant Mail include a Proof
of Work, and I think they are done every few days. If you stop
using the key, it stops being announced and over time disappears from
the DHT. But the keys there do not have multiple addresses. (They
don't really even *need* an address, the fingerprint will suffice.)
Yes, PoW has none of that.
If you went for a per-UID PoW and a common validation signature
notation with Nico's scheme ("type": "ProofOfWork" instead of
"enc-email"), the schemes could operate together as compatible

I would expect each time they got "no secret key" they would spend a

That's my understanding, too. You can hope so, but is it reasonable to expect? And anybody who doesn't trust Proof of Work as a validation could trust only encrypted-mail validations. It would be simple, as PoW validation signatures would be self-certs whereas enc-mail validation certs would come from a validation server's key.
I think a week of computing for the PoW is excessive. But if the
troll's CPU time is on a botnet, they won't care about the cost or
about slowing down their machine for a week.
I prefer this method rather than clicking a link in an email. But people are used to that scenario from website registrations, as  long as the email arrives within a couple of minutes of them registering on the website.
Surely, all signatures from keys that you do not already trust are
just ambient noise.
If it can be done without Big Brother creating a whitelist, it should I imagine it would not be much of a problem for a troll to automate most of the work. But unless they compromise some keys from genuine validators, it's all in vain if people bother to check signatures.
Hold on, the magazine writer's problem is that people encrypt his emails to the wrong key because they do not bother to check signatures.

Depends on the threat model. If Alice knows Bobs email address and
there is a matching key on the keyservers, isn't it likely to be
better to opportunistically encrypt to that key rather than to send
the message unencrypted?

Most are so obvious that we are talking fractions of a second per

Likewise, it is not just my computer that would be wasting orders of
magnitude more energy on "proof of work" for all outgoing messages
than it currently wastes on downloading a little spam.
I do not use spam filters because I have always regarded a single
missed important message due to a "false positive" from a spam filter
to be a more serious problem than any number of spam messages
received. And if an email provider I use has spam filters that I
cannot effectively opt out of, I still don't pay the electric bill for
their processing power.
I would wager that needless use of HTML in emails probably contributes
far more to un-necessary server load and storage requirements than is
contributed by than spam.
If the spam messages were not obvious, far more man-hours would be
wasted in spotting and deleting them. And people's time is the most
precious resource of all.
I don't see corporate iT and data security policies giving up
corporate email servers to allow peer-to-peer communication between
staff's workstations and the outside world anytime soon. I would
expect them to still want to know what staff were sending out, and
maybe encrypt it at the network boundary.

First [OT], I'll point out that your message didn't thread below my
message to which you replied. Your message arrived missing the
"In-Reply-To:" and "References:" headers, which would have enabled
this to happen.
Fair enough, the user needs a password for the password manager. But
it is no extra effort to have the password manager remember a complex
password for the key.
Pretty much any system *could* be compromised. Should we say all bets
are off because there is a possibility the system might be
Good point. We are told that smartcard design precludes copying the
key material without physically destroying the card and applying some
pretty heavy-duty forensics. But do we *know* this to be true, or is
it just collective wishful thinking?
The secret key material is safe if it is protected by a
suitably-strong passphrase. Passphrase-compromise is the issue on any
networked device (even an air-gapped device that occasionally
receives/sends files by sneakernet).
Sounds like less of an issue than NFC payments from credit/debit cards
with no requirement for a PIN or a signature.
PIN-entry being on the Android device you are using presumably means
that an attacker who managed to evesdrop your NFC connection would be
able to record the signal containing the PIN. Which they may then be
able to re-send, hypothetically allowing them to continue signing or
decrypting so long as your card was within range of their equipment.

Although I don't really like email addresses in the UIDs of my keys, I
quite like the simplicity of your "email address only" simplified UID
format. However, I would urge you to reconsider your decision to drop
the angle brackets. At least one MUA (the MUA I am using to write this
message) sends the email address enclosed in angle brackets as the
search string for GnuPG to locate the key. No angle brackets around
the email address means no key found.
Your proposed "automated email verification service" will beat the PGP
Global Directory's verification check by encrypting the verification
message to confirm that the user is in control of the key as well as
the email address. But it retains the problem of relatively frequent
verification signatures accumulating; I don't know a solution to that.
If a user has multiple email addresses, does the "automated email
verification service" send a different encrypted verification link to
each address, and then only sign the UIDs that the user verified? And
is there the option to reply to email rather than click a link?
Finally, if the person at the other end is able to decrypt my message
and reply to me, then the key and the email address are controlled by
the same person. What assurance does the verification service add?

Thinking about it, you don't need the user to click a link or to reply
to an email at all. If you sign the UID and enclose the signed copy of
the key in an encrypted email to the address in the UID, they don't
get access to the certification unless they control both the email
address and the key.

Keyservers seem to do that.
GnuPG locating keys on the local keyring does not.
A user with GnuPG configured to automatically fetch keys from a
keyserver when not found locally might end up needlessly
re-downloading a correspondent's key each time they encrypted to (or
verified a signature from) . But they would be
stuffed when the email client was trying to match their own key to

The user has two weeks to react to the verification email. Once the

I am opening communication with the Person A at that address today. I

SMTP MUAs that interface with PGP or GnuPG (or use S/MIME) display
signature verification results (and actual signatures in the message
body if signed PGP-inline). And they invoke GnuPG etc. to find keys.
If more than one key on my GnuPG keyring matches on an email address,
the MUA I use displays a dialog box allowing me to choose. An older
version used to just pick the first match it came to.
OK, that sounds like something extra it has to accommodate. But maybe
an SMTP proxy could treat the hash as part of the display name:-
"Mike Ingle d2b89e6f95e72e26e0c917d0...cd0c2" - From an MUA UI perspective, does size matter when handling
attachments? All the user tends to see is an icon, a filename, and a

You are the one stating that the user can keep their existing SMTP

I think it is a good idea to re-phrase it so that you are not stating
the user can keep their existing SMTP email address, and also to make
it clear this identifier is used only for key look-up and not for
message delivery.
It is also true that some email providers recycle email addresses that
have fallen out of use. Out of seven yahoo addresses I used for
consecutive periods between 2004 and 2009, six are currently available
to be registered. (The odd-one-out is from 2006.) I have left each one
active with an auto-forward to the next.
That is re-assuring to hear. See also my first comment, above.
In a similar way to a file that has not been requested for a

Or subsequently received a message from the imposter, then goes back
to look at the message that was not from the imposter, presumably.
Is there a way to incorporate some sort of challenge/response at key
creation time before the key is uploaded to the peer-to-peer system?
Or could the challenge/response be handled by a number of
"verification agents" incorporated into the peer-to-peer network?

Yes, it seemed like a great suggestion until I tried to construct in
my mind a way in which it would be useful. (I think the idea occurred
to me when I was reading the discussion about whether GnuPG logging
how often I received emails from a particular sender was problematic.)
Another thought. New signatures from a key that has long been inactive
may arouse suspicion. Perhaps it would be useful to output how long
ago was the last message verified. For example:-
"66 messages signed over the past 3 years. The last was 1 year 10
months ago."

I suspect I would use it, configured to ask my decision each time it
encountered a new key/UID combination. My use of GnuPG is fairly
limited: mainly participation in the PGPNET encrypted discussion
group, occasional other encrypted email discussions, and signatures on
a couple of discussion lists.
I would think that was quite important, for users whose email client
uses GPGME.

Hash: SHA512
While writing in the "TOFU for GnuPG" thread it occurred to me that
GnuPG does not look at whether we "trust" the other keys to which an
incoming message was encrypted.
GnuPG looks at whether we "trust" keys we are about to encrypt to, and
whether we "trust" keys that signed messages we have received.
Wouldn't it be reasonable to also look at whether we "trust" other
keys that are seen to be a party to the conversation?
Of course, this could only work for keys that were not obscured by the
use of throw-keyids or hidden-recipient or hidden-encrypt-to. And if
another copy were encrypted separately, we know nothing about it.

In that case, there must be some option or setting I have missed.
When decrypting incoming messages that were encrypted to multiple
keys, for keys other than my own GnuPG tells me the key-id and a few
other pieces of information such as size and algorithm:-
   :pubkey enc packet: version 3, algo 1, keyid 0123456789012345
        data: [2047 bits]
   # off=271 ctb=85 tag=1 hlen=3 plen=524
GnuPG also tells me (for keys not on my keyring):-
    gpg: encrypted with RSA key, ID 0x0123456789012345
Or if the key is on my keyring, GnuPG adds the primary key this
encryption key is a subkey of, creation date and user-id:-
gpg: using subkey 0x0123456789012345 instead of primary key
gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit RSA key, ID 0x0123456789012345, created
      "Bob Alice Mallory"
As far as I know, none of that says whether GnuPG thinks I "trust"
the key. Or am I missing something?
I know. My original post included the line "GnuPG looks at whether we
"trust" keys we are about to encrypt to". (-;
I'll partially go along with that. It was reasonable for the sender to
encrypt to those keys because the sender "trusts" them; fair enough.
But that doesn't address my question of "Is it reasonable for the
recipient to want to check whether or not *they* "trust" the other
keys to which the sender encrypted the message?" or my assertion that
GnuPG does not perform this check.
Sound advice.
Some of the detail there is beyond me, but I think I get the gist.
Presumably, the packets Mallory is tampering with are not covered by
the message signature?
OK. Doesn't that apply to all keys for which I don't have the secret
part? Wouldn't that mean any key shown on the message's encryption
list is potentially suspicious, except my own (and presumably the
sender's, so long as it was used to sign the message)?
For me, GnuPG would flag up Mallory's key if I had it, as you stated
above. I may tell it to go ahead, or may not. If doing it in my email
client, it would simply refuse to encrypt to an "invalid" key, and I
would have to look into which it was.
The recipient might already "trust" some of the other recipient keys
themself without having to rely on "trusting" the sender's "trust". Or
they may know a reason not to "trust" one of the keys the sender was
OK with. Especially if the latter applies, wouldn't it be better to
check this on receipt of the message, rather than only if sending a

At least that's better than the usual line from such devices, which
reads more like an advert than a warning. (-;
Yes, anybody who was a party to the communication can share the
information outside of the encrypted messages that were exchanged. We
can't do anything about that, so should not worry about it. We should
only worry about the security of the specific messages that we send or
For messages we send, in your own words "You should encrypt only to
keys you trust". That is an active measure controlled by the sender.
For messages we receive, we cannot control which keys were included in
the encryption list. But we *could* check to see if any of them gives
us cause for concern. Maybe there is a good reason this check is not
currently done. The fact that information is available and *could* be
used does not mean it necessarily *should* be used.

Sometimes it makes a great deal of difference. Emails on mailing lists
often arrive out of sequence, and some mailing list members may
auto-delete messages from certain other members. The person reading
your posting may not have seen the message that is being answered.
Even if they have seen it, it may not be clear to which part of the
message a top-posted comment refers. Bottom-posting is just as bad in
this respect.
Judicious quoting and inline quoting automatically precludes this.
For a list or organisation where top-posting is the norm, top-posting
works despite its inefficiency. In fact, in such situations any other
way of replying is liable to confuse.
Where it is not the norm, it is confusing. It is a bit like driving on

Does that mean you sent the email from the  address, but
because you happened to be logged in with the  address
Google took it upon themselves to change the from address? I wouldn't
like that: it is not up to the email provider to choose which of my
email addresses I expose to which contacts.
Rejecting with a clear message indicating the reason makes more sense
to me.
Even if they have such measures in place, the account may have extra
addresses or aliases configured to send messages (GMX, Gmail, Yahoo,
Riesup all allow this in slightly differing forms). Presumably a
signature from a provider that allows this would have lower value than
one from a provider that does not, but higher valve than one from a
provider who was not known to have anti-spoofing measures in place?
In that case, what attacks involving reply-to are you wishing to

And, from your previous post, Google takes it upon themselves to

insert a new "X-Google-Original-From:" header containing the detail
from your original "From:" header. So Google chooses to expose two of
your email addresses to the recipient instead of just the one you used
for that message. To me that is not good. But to bring it back
on-topic, would a DKIM signature on such a message be for the
gmail.com domain or the twopif.net domain?
You're right. The DKIM signature says that the email was sent from
_an_ authorised account at that domaim but not _which_ authorised

If I try with GnuPG version 2.1.10 instead of 2.1.12, the only thing

Subsequent attempts give:-
gpg: error searching keyserver: Input/output error

I get that, plus similar lines for "trusted-certs" and "extra-certs".
(Windows Explorer also doesn't find "ldapservers.conf" at all, and

Then I get:-

And it proceeds to create it. There is already a "crls.d\DIR.txt"

Hash: SHA512
I recently created a new Curve 25519 encryption subkey. One of the
other PGPNET members tells me GnuPG 2.1.12 reports the subkey size as
0 and will not encrypt to this subkey,instead giving the error:-
gpg: pubkey_encrypt failed: Provided object is too short
gpg: test: encryption failed: Provided object is too short
I get that error using GnuPG 2.1.11 but not 2.1.12 (and I do not see a
key size for an ECC key in my key listing).
Any ideas why he cannot encrypt to this Curve 25519 encryption subkey?
(Subkey 0xA11C7EE5DA49DC12 on main key 0x251BCCEB547B7194)

By contrast, I am 100% certain that none of it is needed. If "the

deception to have undercover agents worm their way in and get
themselves trusted and included in the encryption list.

If Windows has an application associated with the file extension, the
file will be shown with that application's icon. And double-clicking
the file will cause that application to perform a default action on
that file, for example double-clicking a .txt file on a Windows
machine will usually open the file using Notepad.
You could try right-clicking one of your .gpg files and selecting
"open with", keeping the "always use this app" box ticked, click "more
apps", and select GnuPG. (It might show as "GnuPG's OpenPGP Tool".)

I have encountered a problem with 2.1.20 writing to my public keyring.
I was using the pre-compiled binaries on Windows 10.
When editing/refreshing keys, or running gpg --check-trustdb, at the
end of the operation the command window gradually fills up with
repeated lines of:-
gpg: waiting for file 'C:/[path]/gnupg/pubring.kbx' to become
accessible ...
These lines keep coming until I close the command window, or CTRL C
then RETURN, or terminate "GnuPG's OpenPGP tool (32 bit)" in Task
Oddly, creating new keys does not seem to trigger this. (Or else the
problem is intermittent.)
The problem went away when I switched back to GnuPG 2.1.19.

I guess I should have trimmed my quote less severely. Using a password
manager would enable somebody who says they cannot remember multiple
decent-quality unique passwords to not share passwords between
different keys.
Extra steps to open the password manager. Once open there are no extra
steps for subsequent unlocking of the user's GnuPG key; it may even
speed things up in the event that the password manager types
passphrases quicker than the user can type them.
The single point of failure stops being a passphrase used across
multiple keys; it becomes the password required to open the password
manager that protects the multiple passphrases.

A user can use hashed instead of human-readable forms of their name
and/or their email address in a key's user-ids. The email address (or
name) cannot be determined from simple inspection of the UID. Just a
defence against casual snooping on the information in user-ids, not a
security measure but the "incident" that gave rise to this thread is
prevented. The downside is that using the cleartext email address (or
name) as your search string doesn't find the key from a keyserver and
the email client fails to match the key by email address, rendering
those UIDs largely useless.
It has been discussed here before, and dismissed by people cleverer
than me, that the hashed version could be searched for as well as the
readable version to locate a key from the local keyring or from
keyservers. A member of PGPNET produced some Python scripts as an
exercise in seeing what might go into this, when we last discussed the
idea over there about three years ago.

Fair enough. "In transit" was not the best choice of words. But "good

not been altered since it was signed. Or maybe that the original

GnuPG presumably has a reason for defaulting to SHA-1 signatures on a
lot of the messages encrypted to the 30 members' keys on PGPNET. Some
people whose PGPNET group messages have SHA-1 signatures report that
non-group messages they sign and encrypt have SHA-256 signatures.
For what its worth, forcing SHA-256 signatures with a "digest-algo"
