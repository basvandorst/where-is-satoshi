@_subject: Looking for an encrypted list 
I'd like to get on an encrypted email list run by something like
pgpdomo. I really don't care what the topic is, I just want some way to practice without trying to train someone about how to use
encryption. If there are several, my favorite would be a joke list using GnuPG.
If anyone know of one, please let me know. It may be of general
interest, so if you know of one, I suppose you could post it here.

Hopefully, you configure the "path to PGP", and instead use GnuPG,
and it'll work just fine.
After all, GnuPG is a "Full replacement of PGP" ;-)

Depending on what you're teaching and what kind of collaboration you do
in your writing, you may feel that you're stuck using MS Windows.  If
so, CYGWIN is a FREE set of tools that you can use on Windows that'll
give you a lot of *NIX functionality while still running Windows. (After
you get familiar with *NIX this way, you'll probably realize that you
are NOT stuck with MS Windows, and you'll want to do as Horacio suggests
I haven't check into the status of GnuPG on CYGWIN, but I've had good
luck compiling other *NIX tools on CYGWIN. I'd suspect that, if pre-
compiled binaries for GnuPG on CYGWIN aren't available, you could compile
the sources yourself pretty easily (gcc comes with the "full" CYGWIN

That is also much preferable in terms of getting gnupg out there amoung
the public.
A cygwin version should require little mods from the standard *NIX
release, if any, and is sort of a quick-and-dirty way to get it without
having to commit to a totally non-MS Windows environment.
I see cygwin as primarily a way to wean future *NIX users off of MS
Windows. Once they are comfortable with, and see the power of, *NIX,
and realize what a tremendous waste it is to run on top of Windows,
they can dump Windows and go with a free *NIX.
