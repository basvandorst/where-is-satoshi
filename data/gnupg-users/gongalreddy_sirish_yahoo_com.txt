I am trying to decrypt the file using gpg and I am getting the following
stderr=gpg: protection algorithm 3 is not supported gpg: encrypted with
2048-bit RSA key, ID 00754B14, created 2012-09-27 "Key Name (4508073) " gpg:
public key decryption failed: Invalid cipher algorithm gpg: decryption
failed: No secret key
GPG Version
gpg (GnuPG) 2.0.14
libgcrypt 1.4.5
Home: ~/.gnupg Supported algorithms:
Pubkey: RSA, ELG, DSA Cipher: 3DES, AES, AES192, AES256
Hash: MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, SHA224
Compression: Uncompressed, ZIP, ZLIB, BZIP2
What is algorithm 3? How can I enable support for algorithm 3?
Thanks in advance!

Hi, Actually it's issue with the Custom Adapter we use with our Integration
Product. I was able to fix it now. Everything is working fine. Thank you. View this message in context: Sent from the GnuPG - User mailing list archive at Nabble.com.
