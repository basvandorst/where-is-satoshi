@_subject: revoking user id 
I recently attempted to revoke an invalid user ID from my public
key, using "revsig" in the --edit-keys menu.  The revocation failed,
with the following error message:
gpg: fatal: idea encryption failed
I had signed the user ID with my old RSA key.  I ended up using PGP5
to revoke the invalid user ID, and re-importing the key into gpg.
Should it have been possible to revoke the user ID in gpg?

I haven't been able to find an explanation for this in the gpg man

key, "list" shows my user IDs, with a "." next to one:
    pub  1024D/75B33A09  created: 1998-07-19 [...]
    sub  2048g/AB4EB5BF  created: 1998-07-19 [...]
    (1)  David M. Ellement     (2)  David M. Ellement     (3). David M. Ellement     (4)  [revoked] David M. Ellement User ID (3) appears as the ID for my signature, so I suppose there's
a connection with the "." in the listing.  What does it mean?  How
do I associate it with one of the other user IDs?

@_subject: compiling gpg 1.2.0 on HP-UX 
I encountered a couple of problems getting gpg 1.2.0 to compile on HP-UX
with gcc (3.1.1).
The compile failed in the mpi directory, due to assembler errors.  Some
of the assembly code generated had instructions that lacked a leading
tab character.  Jay Dawes realized the problematic assembler code was in
mpi/longlong.h.  After adding leading tabs to all the assembler
instructions in the HP-UX section, the compile succeeded and all the
checks passed.
The keyserver/Makefile only includes -lldap in gpgkeys_ldap_LDADD, so
gpgkeys_ldap is unable to resolve host names.  By adding -llber, it is
able to resolve host names.  (On my linux system at home, I saw the same
problem, and needed to add -llber -lresolv).
Has the format for keyserver name changed?  The manual still says:
    `scheme:[//]keyservername[:port]'
but it seems the `//' is now required, at least for the hkp scheme.

It compiled, but it didn't resolve host names; it worked with IP

I don't claim to understand.  I didn't SOCKSify.
After compiling, checking and installing, I tried fetching a key from an
ldap keyserver.  It failed with a bind error, so I tried your eariler
ldaptest: that worked.  Fetching with 1.0.7 worked, so I ran 'chatr' on
both the 1.0.7 gpgkeys_ldap and the 1.2.0.  I noticed the 1.0.7 version
was linked against lber, but the 1.2.0 version wasn't.  So I ran 'make
clean' in the keysever directory, added -llber to LDOPTS, and ran make
again.  After re-installing, the ldap key fetch worked.
I saw the same symptoms (compiled ok, but no DNS).  I don't know of a
Linux equivalent for chatr, but I checked the 1.2.0 keyserver/Makefile,
ran strings on the 1.0.7 and 1.2.0 gpgkeys_ldap files; remaking
gpgkeys_ldap with LDFLAGS set to '-lber -lresolv' seemed to make it
The Linux box is RH 7.2, with the ldap stuff from the distribution rpms.
The box sits behind a Linksys router/switch.

Just curious: what do you do about inline signatures?  They aren't

Actually, I was referring to the fact that MTAs can (and do) alter
messages an break the signatures.  It shows up all the time on mailing
lists: someone sends an inline signed message, and some fraction of the
list can't verify it while others on the list can.  Since neither the
sender nor the recipients have control of the path the message follows,
there's no guarantee a "good" message and signature will arrive.

Here 'breaks' means the recipient won't be able to verify the signature,
and whether or not it breaks on the MTAs between you and the recipient.
So, if it is really important that your recipient be able to able to
verify your signature (probably not so for a mail list), you'll want to
use PGP/MIME for the signature, unless your recipient doesn't have a
mail client that supports PGP/MIME.  In that case you'll need to "bury"
the signed text by sending it uuencoded or as zip'd attachment.
