sorry for a simple question.
how do Bob verify that an encrypted and signed file send was signed by
Alice ?
the gpg --verify did not work if the file is encrypted.
any suggestion ?
%gpg --verify a.es
gpg: verify signatures failed: unexpected data

Thanks Lars Geiger and Werner Koch.
that solve it.
But i still think we should have an option to first verify the person who
signed the file
before decrypting them, may be in future release ?

@_subject: need help : problem decrypting with GnuPG-0.09. 
i'm new to gpg and am having problem with my perl script which uses
to decrypt a file encrypted with gpg 1.0.6.
I did this because i've wanted to have the decryption done
The error was :
"wrong response from gnupg (expected SHM_INFO):"
I'm very surprise since it was working fine since few days back.
I've tried to search the web for any solution but to no avail.
Anybody having the same problem ? Am i missing something ? i would like
to know how do you solve this problem.
any suggestion is greatly appreciated.

i meant i used perl module, GnuPG-0.09 i'd downloaded from CPAN.
Testing by decrypting directly with gpg -d , there is nothing wrong with gnupg
1.0.6 that i am using but when i use inside my perl script with the module
mentioned above, i got the error.
my apologize if this is a wrong place to ask about this module.
I soon found that the error was due to the file that will be decrypted was
not found by the script, wrong path.
I then found another problem, it cannot decrypt messages which has been signed.
i got below error :
protocol error: expected ENC_TO got SIG_ID:

@_subject: how to verify (only) signed and encrypted file. 
I am having problem verifying file which was signed and also encrypted.
Attached below is error received.
% gpg --verify file.signed_only
gpg: Signature made Sat Jun 30 10:43:31 2001 MYT using DSA key ID
gpg: Good signature from "fgerik (fg) "
% gpg --verify file.signed_and_encrypt
gpg: verify signatures failed: unexpected data
i can see the output saying that the file is signed by ... if i decrypt
it with eg
"gpg -o /dev/null -d file.signed_and_encrypt".
But is there a short cut or better way to verify without having to
decrypt it
