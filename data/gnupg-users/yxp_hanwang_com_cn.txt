@_subject: How to verify a signed&encrypted file in script 
I create a signed&encrypted file use the following command:
    gpg -o file.gpg -r recipient -s -e file
the recipient must first verify that the file is signed by me and then decrypt it,
all of this is done by a bash script, but I find the command
    gpg --verify file.gpg
doesn't work with the error "unexpected data", and the command
    gpg -o file -d file.gpg
can decrypt and verify the file, but the script doesn't know whether the have a valid signature by checking the return value.
Is there any easy way to verify the file?
