@_subject: When will be precompiled binaries for v2.0.x and Windows available? 
on the GnuPG download page it is written that GnuPG v2.0.12 is already available.
However the latest available precompiled binary version for Windows seems to be only v1.4.9
Ok there are instructions on how to compile the source with MingW.
But I am not used to setup the whole compiling development and it seems to me very cumbersome
especially if every user has to brew its own binary.
Is there really no precompiled binary version for Windows (maybe on another page) ?

@_subject: How to turn off mail delivery but NOT unsubscribe? Nabble forum 
I would like to use this mailing-list through the forum emulation of Nabble
I don't need any posting delivery by email any more but would like to stay
subscribed to be able to post questions.
However when I go to I don't find an option to turn off mail delivery.
How can I achieve this?
How can turn back on later?
Thank you

@_subject: Difference Kleopatra vs WinPT 
As far as I can see Kleopatra and WinPT are similar, competing tools for the same purpose:
Management of pgp keys & certificates.
What are the differences in details?
Which one is better/more used?

@_subject: disable/prevent start of gpg-agent service? 
Asi found out after having installed the latest gnupg release on Windows 7 a gnupg service "gpg-agent" always is running (now) in background.
It seems to be installed automatically without letting the user a choice.
Can I disable this service?
Can I de-install this service permanently?
I need gnupg only occasionally for on-demand en-/de-cryption.
Thank you
