I'm trying to install GPG on my Laptop running XP Home. After the
install process I run CMD and write "GPG --version". This seems to be
OK. After that I write "GPG --list-keys and receive following message:
gpg: checking the trustdb

Does not GPG4win support Windows XP? Any suggestions?

Thanks for Your answer John,
I will try to explain my problem in detail. I'm myself is using GPG,
Thunderbird and Enigmail. I want to use GPG4Win to communicate with a
friend using Windows. To be able to tell him how to use it I tried to
install on a Laptop using Windows XP Home.
As I have problems I have installed and uninstalled a couple of times.
After last uninstall I also deleted all keys for GPG from registry and
finished with a reboot.
The install process of GPG4Win seems to be normal. After the install I
tried to use GPA to create a Keypair for a new user and import my public
key. Starting GPA I get a message box telling me:
"Fatal Error in GPGME library
(invoked from file
line 1447):
Unsupported protocol
The application will be terminated"
As GPA depends on GPG I want to first determinate if GPG works.
Therefore I tried some commands from the commandline. I don't think
there is old keyringfiles left on the laptop but I'm not sure. Do You
have any suggestions how I can go on?
