Perhaps you find this relevant. I don't even begin to see why you are
interested in this. But who knows.

@_subject: 1.4.12 beta installer for Windows 
Hello Werner,
My friend and I, aer working on a easy to use front-end for GPG for Windows
and Mac.
On Windews we are using the 1.4.11 because it only requires two files
(.exe, .dll)
I have not been able to find a small Mac command line program  that would
correspond to GnuPG 1.4.
I only found the huge package called GPGTools.
Thank you in advance for your help.

@_subject: How to add only specified public key from an asc file containing many 
Please consider this situation.
The user has a file containing some 30 public keys.
He/she lists the keys and only wants to import only 2 of these keys.
How can he/she do that?
Is there a command that allows to specify the keys to import?
Also, would the same method work with adding keys from a public keyring
Thank you in advance for you assistance.
