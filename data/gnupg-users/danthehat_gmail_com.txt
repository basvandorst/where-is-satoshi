@_subject: Paranoid People's User Group? 
Hi everyone,
Almost-but-not-quite my first post to this list.  I am very interested
in encryption technologies, and PGP in particular.  Of course, this is
only a hobby and I don't have any trade secrets or international
intrigues to protect, so that leaves me at a bit of a disadvantage when
it comes to playing around with such a fascinating piece of technology.
After some googling, I decided this would be the best place to start. What I'm after is a mailing list or user group that exchanges encrypted
communications with each other.  Or, if no such mailing list exists, I
wonder if I might be able to pick up a pen-pal or two that wants to use
PGP to communicate.

@_subject: Confirmation for cached passphrases useful? 
I use a program called KeePass to keep track of my passwords.  It has a
linux port called KeePassX, as well.  It stores the password in an
encrypted database and when the user requests it, copies it to the
clipboard.  After 20 seconds, the clipboard is cleared.  KeePass can
also be configured to lock the workspace after a certain period of time

@_subject: Changing secret key encryption algorithms 
Hash: SHA1
I was inspired by a thread on a friend's mishap with his secret key to
look into the various ways that a GnuPG secret key can be encrypted
prior to its storage on disk.
I poked around the documentation a bit and confirmed that the default
cipher is CAST5 (GnuPG seems to prefer it when it needs a symmetric key
cipher).  After further digging, I found a way to change the symmetric
key cipher used on the secret key from the default CAST5.  You can
discover the algorithms included in your GnuPG version by using gpg

@_subject: Security considerations: CAST-128 
Hash: SHA1
I understand that there are *some* security considerations when using
CAST-128 (CAST5, as used in GnuPG), but this is typical of many ciphers
in use today.  In particular, a paper[1] on the linear cryptanalysis of
reduced round versions of CAST-128 (used in GPG) and CAST-256 have
produced successful known-plaintext and ciphertext-only attacks, though
I'm not sure how computationally feasible they are.  According to the
paper, successful attacks were conducted on a 4 and 6 round version of
Given that resources on the subject appear to be quite scarce, I come to
you, O list.  If anyone can clarify or elaborate on the security
considerations of CAST-128, it would be greatly appreciated.
