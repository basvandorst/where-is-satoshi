@_subject: "--clearsign" bug? 
I would like to know if this is happens to everyone else, and
therefore, if it is a bug:
If i save a mail message to a file, and it has a signature at the end
(such as the one at the bottom of this message); with a "--" and then
proceeding signature text, and I clearsign this message/file via
$ gpg --clearsign message
the resulting file is signed correctly, but the signed text gets
mangled. any line (inside the signature) that is "--", (the text right
before one's signature) gets turned into "- --".
is this a gnupg bug?
GnuPG 1.0.1, on a GNU/linux x86 system. please CC any replies, as I am
not part of the mailing list!
