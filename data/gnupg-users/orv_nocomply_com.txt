Hi, I am a new user to GnuPG plugin for Outlook and I have a small problem.
Whenever I send a PGP encrypted email, it arrives completely empty and the
sent item is also empty.
Does anyone have any suggestions?
I followed the setup instructions here:
My current software is:
Windows XP SP1
Outlook 2003
GnuPG Plugin v0.91
WinPT v0.7.96rc1
GnuPG v1.2.1

I don't want to sound ungrateful for your suggestion, but I kinda thought
the purpose of this mailing list would be to resolve problems, not work
around them :) Hash: SHA1
I had a similar problem using the G-Data plugin for Outlook with Outlook
2003 Beta. In my case it went through the motions of signing but never
signed the message. If I open the message in the outbox and re-sign it there
it would work fine.
Gave up with the plugin and just use GPGShell to sign current window. You
can do the same thing with WinPT and at least you know it is done before you
hit send.

I don't want to sound , but the purpose =
this mailing list is to resolve problems with the free software product
GnuPG but not with all GnuPG related software and especially not with
proprietary, closed source plugins from third parties.
