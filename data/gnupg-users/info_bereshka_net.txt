@_subject: help with gnupg 
Hello, Dear Creators :) I will very appreciate if you can help me, because I was surfing a lot in the internet looking for an answer, and read tones of forums, but did not find solution.
So I installed gnupg 2 , command gpg didn?t work in Terminal. I was confused and decided to try Gnupg tools suite, I installed that and created my keys and passphrase. Later I knew that I should type gpg2 in Terminal to work with that. So I got encrypted message and I tried to decrypt it, but it just didn?t show a result, it said that by whom it was encrypted and to whom, that?s all. We decided that it might be a problem because go GPG tools suite, maybe it causes conflict. So I decided to deinstall GPG Tools. Before to do that I exported my public, private, rev certificate, then I deinstalled this software. I located all keys to a folder ?keys? at my user root folder). Then I imported all keys through terminal. To check I do ?list-keys and I see my imported key and my husband?s key that was imported as well. 1. The problem is that I can encrypt message and send it to him and that he can decrypt it. But when I get encrypted message from him I can?t decrypt it. It does?t ask my passphrase. It asked when I had GPG Tools, but even with asked passpharase with GPG Tools being installed i didn?t get a decrypted message
Now I don?t have GPG Tools and when I do command gpg2 Enter and insert his message I get this gpg: public key decryption failed: No pinentry
gpg: decryption failed: No secret key
2. Then, I decided that if there is so much mess with this email, I will create keys with other one (ytsan86 at mail.ru) , but I still get same error on the step of creation
gpg: public key decryption failed: No pinentry
gpg: decryption failed: No secret key
3. Also I found on one forum that file gpg-agent.conf should be edited with adding this line - pinentry-program /bereshka/bin/pinentry-qt
but it didn?t help
Below I pasted a piece of the process from my terminal. Last login: Tue Aug 15 20:37:38 on ttys000

Mario, I know about reply all :) but didn?t want to be annoying with all one hundred questions that I was going to ask :)) But I agree that it may help to somebody else to solve the same issue. I  used this website to download and install  It was my guess too, that there is a conflict between the original gnupg and that third-part GnuPG, that after deinstallation caused misunderstood in the system, causing some parameters, that it could not give anymore. Then I tried few times to uninstall gnupg using the command sudo apt-get install gnupg in Terminal. I edited this file gpg-agent.conf  previously, adding this line - pinentry-program /bereshka/bin/pinentry-qt . But it didn?t help and I removed it. Actually when I opened it first time, this file, it was empty and it?s empty today too, so there is noting to comment. I was struggling with that about two weeks ago and read tones of information in the internet and nothing helped. But after I asked that question and got all your kind advices I decided what if a miracle happens and I just try to decrypt a message again. And I was very surprised, because it works. I didn?t do any changes today, I just opened again that file config to look at. And I restarted my laptop many times right after all that changes that I did two weeks ago, but it didn?t help at that time. But today it just starts to work. Thank ya?ll
Best regards,
Anastasiia

============================== START ==============================
it happens all the time, solution is of itself as soon as I ask it on a forum
or like John Robbins said ?My cat, as it turns out, is an excellent debugger, and she has helped me solve a number of nasty bugs when I talked to her about them? :) not exact situation, but little bit similar )
