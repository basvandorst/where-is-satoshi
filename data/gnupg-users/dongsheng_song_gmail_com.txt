Thanks for your great work!
Any news on pinentry ? pinentry-0.9.4 (pinentry-w32.exe) works good on
windows, but both pinentry-0.9.5 and pinentry-0.9.5-13-g1532bf3 broken
on 32bit or 64 bit Windows.
ERR 67108949 No pinentry

Thanks, I like gpg4win-vanilla, because Qt or Gtk+ is too fat for me.

@_subject: signing failed with master key when I have stronger subkeys 
Here is my keyring status after I removed the secret key of these
stronger subkeys:
    sec   rsa2048/46D397FF 2008-02-02
    ssb   rsa2048/7547A8A9 2008-02-02
    ssb#  brainpoolP512r1/DD1C5659 2015-06-24
    ssb#  brainpoolP512r1/24BEAC25 2015-06-24
    ssb#  rsa4096/F7BC1BF1 2015-06-24
Then I can not signing anymore even when I use --default-key or
--local-user to specify 46D397FF or 7547A8A9:
    gpg: signing failed: No secret key
After I delete these stronger subkeys completely:
    sec   rsa2048/46D397FF 2008-02-02
    ssb   rsa2048/7547A8A9 2008-02-02
Then signing action succeeded. Bugs, features, or misused ?

@_subject: The best practice of master/sub key capabilities 
Hi all,
When I create new master/sub key, in the following 2 choice, I'm
wondering which is better?
1) master key have SCEA capabilities
sec  rsa4096/A19676A1
     created: 2015-08-20  expires: never       usage: SCEA
     trust: ultimate      validity: ultimate
ssb  rsa4096/27ADD750
     created: 2015-08-20  expires: never       usage: SEA
2) master key have only Certify capability
sec  rsa4096/1F8AFCAD
     created: 2015-08-20  expires: never       usage: C
     trust: ultimate      validity: ultimate
ssb  rsa4096/8E1D2A87
     created: 2015-08-20  expires: never       usage: SEA

Thanks, now I see why I should use a exclusively subkey for
authenticate capability.
But I still did't know why the master key have sign and certify
capabilities in the default ? I think the sign capability should move
to a exclusively subkey.

Maybe create more subkey need more entropy, gain enough entropy need
very long time ?
Now I want to create my new key like this:
sec   rsa4096/93D374EB 2015-08-22 [C]
uid         [ultimate] example ssb   rsa2048/466D08E1 2015-08-22 [S]
ssb   rsa2048/AD92E667 2015-08-22 [E]
ssb   rsa2048/07DEFA25 2015-08-22 [A]
ssb   ed25519/AE83BE7C 2015-08-22 [S]
ssb   cv25519/0FACE148 2015-08-22 [E]
ssb   ed25519/610E5096 2015-08-22 [A]
If something bad happened to my subkeys, I can create new subkeys as well.

@_subject: GnuPG modern can't genereate keys on my Windows 
Yes, I build gnupg 2.1.7 for 32 bit and 64 bit Windows with the latest
libgcrypt and pinentry.
Both them can create key for Curve25519 encryption on my Windows 10 2015

It's really works, you can check my building results:

Why not trust Windows CryptoAPI (CryptGenRandom) like libressl ?
If you do not trust CryptoAPI (CryptGenRandom), you can use CNG
(BCryptGenRandom) instead.
CryptGenRandom  [Windows XP/2003 or later]
BCryptGenRandom [Windows Vista/2008 or later] [Cryptography API: Next
In theory, you are right. But ALL Windows kernel object include HANDLE
lower than 2^24.
Then if these cast is safe for 64 bit Linux, then safe for Windows too.
Thanks, fixed.

Yes, when we running 64 bit Windows, use 64 bit binary is naturally requirement.
WoW64 is optional component for Windows server, for those servers without WoW64,
running 64 bit binaries is the only choice.
