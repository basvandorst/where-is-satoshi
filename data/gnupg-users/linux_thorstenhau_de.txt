Well, it may very well matter if the error is with the source, not
with your system. The sympton points to some problem on a Unix/Windows
boundary, and my guess is that you see this error only with mails from
Windows MUAs.

- What do you see in a mail sent by your own system?

Do you mean attaching as in MIME?
If you talk about quoting like I did with this mail: That's what
proved to be the most effective thing to do.
This may depend on the MUA you use. I sometimes read these kind of
mails without color support and they are less clear then. Make sure
your MUA supports either colors or has some other way to highlight the
different quote levels.
That's almost what I do. We might have different views on what's need
including, and we might use different quoting markers, but that's all.
For a longer discussion, see learn.to/quote.

Mutt adds a 'Content-Disposition: inline' to the MIME part containing
the signature. This seems to work, I don't remember any bouncing
mails. (Pipermail has a problem with signed attachments though.)

* Chris wrote (2005-12-25 20:29):
No, you misunderstood me. The way you sign your mails now is indeed
deprecated, I don't use it and I don't recommend it.
I use PGP/MIME signatures, which Mutt tags as inline MIME elements
following RFC 2183:
- - - Schnipp - - -
2.1  The Inline Disposition Type
   A bodypart should be marked `inline' if it is intended to be
   displayed automatically upon display of the message.  Inline
   bodyparts should be presented in the order in which they occur,
   subject to the normal semantics of multipart messages.
- - - Schnapp - - -
So a smart mail handler (eg. a mailing list software) that does not
know about PGP/MIME can at least gracefully fall back.
KMail does not set this field for the signature (it does for the mail
text), so this is a KMail bug. I'm not sure how receiving MUAs are
expected to cope with a non-existing Content-Disposition field, but
there is a hint in the RFC: "Unrecognized disposition types should be
treated as `attachment'."
Here is a rough outline of the MIME headers of our mails:
- - - Schnipp - - -
KMail, signed mail (ie. wrapper around mail text + signature):
    boundary="nextPart2829039.id6uN21AOM";
    protocol="application/pgp-signature";
    micalg=pgp-sha1

Standard unvalid signature then, ok.
This is from a single mail, before and after it got munged by the
mailing list software? If not, *are* the mails changed that way? In
what way are they changed? If possible, attach one of your mails from
your outbound folder and from the list folder. (I'm not sure the
others would approve though, so send the mails to me privately. Let's
keep the discussion on the list though.)
So whack it over the head. These things can be changed. What software
do they use? What does the list provider say? What does the creator of
the mailing list say?

Nope, only sign what you *know*. If the data you mentioned above (key

and there is no point in signing it.
I'm only talking about non-local signatures of course. Locally, do
whatever makes you smile the most.
No signature from me unless I know them personally.

So the problem is indeed QP-reencoding, but not in a way I would have
expected. The last part of the body of your mails are different:
- - - Schnipp - - -
So, again, just what is causing the 'bad' signature? =20
Question for anyone, what mailing list software is being used?
- - - Schnapp - - -

I'm not too sure about QP, the bad version might even have the
cleaner encoding (Why is the dash encoded?), but it should never have
touched the signed part anway. Either pass is through, or, if it is
considered dangerous, block it.
I tried to search Sympa's bug tracker, but it doesn't work (at least
not the way I used it). So my next step would be to contact the Sympa
guys to let them know, through the bug tracker and/or through one of
their mailing lists. Let me know if I can be of any help.

Yes, a far as I know. Anyway, damage done, you can't delete the key
AFAIK. I hear that Thunderbird's spam filters are very good, so you
shouldn't have too much trouble.
This could be awkward for your email partners. For example, my mail
program automatically looks for the key based on the email address.
Only to GnuPG and most PGP users.
Well, I hope you proceed anyway. It's IMHO currently overall the best
solution by far.

This seems to be the run-of-the-mill traditional signature with

I also picked the vote mail from the trashcan. In my case wasn't so

The vote mail was the third or so HTML-only mail which proved to be
ham, this served as a very good yardstick in the past.
Maybe you don't regularly have votes by people thinking a lot about
email communication.
