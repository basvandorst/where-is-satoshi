Hash: SHA1
Hi everyone.  I just signed up to this list and thought to introduce
myself.  I've been aware of gpg for a long time, but seldom have I had
occasion to actually use it.  Well, now I do, so I'm all signed up and
introducing myself.  As you can probably see, my name is Christ.  I
work in the web development industry and have ties to the security
sector.  Surprising as it is, most people I communicate with simply
don't use GPG, so I've never had occasion to use it beyond the
occasional verification of a package or download.  Well, now I have my
own key, 389B07F6, published to the local keyservers, and I joined the
list.  I have a few minor issues I'll post about separately as
occasion arises.

@_subject: Key server long propagation delays? 
Hash: SHA1
I was recently setting up my new keys along with some other people,
and I discovered that as soon as one of my cohorts sent their keys and
recieved confirmation, I could retrieve the keys and they showed up.
When I sent stuff to the key servers, however, they couldn't retrieve
them for upwards of several minutes.  Later in the evening, we both
sent each other's signed certificates back to the key servers, and
that propagation delay was several HOURS in duration.  We made sure to
both send to the same key servers, and we tried multiple different
keyservers, but ultimately the only solution was to wait.
Furthermore, I failed in attempts to google this problem, and couldn't
find any documentation on key server change propagation delays.  I
wanted to know if what we've observed is Normal, and if so, if there's
any way we can reduce the time it takes our keys to be visible to each
Thanks in advance!

@_subject: how to do 
Depending on how many users are expected to have access to this file, you
can just maintain a public keyring that everyone has.  You then have
everyone encrypt to the list of everyone, and then anyone can decrypt it
with their private key and password and re encrypt to everyone.  This
solution scales poorly, and so should be used only on a small scale.
For a larger scale, you probably want a more robust solution.

Verify, strip, resign. Of course each person would have to configure their

inbound mail to them, or spoof out bound mail as them. Dependent on which

@_subject: DSA key sizes 
I'm going to go out on a limb and suggest that gpg should support
government sponsored cryptographic standards whenever possible, but should
consider the highest government sponsored requirement as a minimum
requirement to actually implement. DSA 4096, 5120, and 8192 should be
available when governments advocate 3072. Governments are notorious for
understating cryptography requirements. I also find the rainbow table
fairly probable. Someone on this list should start a project to compute one
on Amazon s3 and see how long it would take and how much it would cost.
Given the recent demonstration of an md5 break for less than a dollar on s3
gpu nodes, I'd not be surprised to see it in under a year.

I'm proposing, or supporting the hypothesis at least, that a government

private key, and vice versa. Given the amount of time and the amount of
resources at their disposal, it's not that improbable for a 1024 bit

Most of the technical reasons can be bypassed by making a single subscriber

I wouldn't say invite only. Contrarywise, when you send the subscribe
email, in the immediate, automatic response would be the public and private
key, optionally encrypted to the recipient. Open enrollment, public
availability. Just making the data obfuscated in transit.

There's nothing preventing a list server or mail client from intentionally
adding a pseudo random quantity of invalid or junk keys to the recipient
list, thus obfuscating the number of additional recipients, only providing
an upper bound to the estimate.

I know some encryption schemes reveal more information about the keys used
when an attacker has both the plaintext and the ciphertext.  In general,
how much information does GPG reveal in such situations?
How much plaintext/ciphertext matched data would an attacker need (An order
of magnitude is fine) before being able to reverse enough of the key to be
meaningful on fairly modern computers?

So to summarize, the best way to try this attack would be to encrypt lots
of small messages to a dummy key and a target key because the only knowable
plaintext is the session key. However, there's no known or reasonably
suspected method of plaintext attack anyway, so all this data is believed
to be a waste. Correct me if I'm wrong, and thank you all for the prompt

Perhaps a future version of the pgp specification should say something akin
to gpg should always add a number of junk keys, perhaps to pad the key list
out to one from a list of constant sizes, just to ensure that nobody can
know for sure how many recipients there are (except the sender), and can at
best place an upper bound. Perhaps the valid keys should be placed
pseudorandomly throughout the constant sized key table

@_subject: protecting pub-keys from unwanted signatures 
I'll reiterate that there's really no such thing as unwanted signatures.
The more signatures on a key,  the stronger the Web of Trust. End of story.
Please try to understand that no signature is inherently unwanted. Your
proposal, in any form,  would weaken gpg on the whole by increasing the
already high burden on users to maintain their keys.

@_subject: protecting pub-keys from unwanted signatures 
People are stupid. Not necessarily any individual person, but people at
large are.
If you rounded up all the signatures on a key server,  and just started
deleting them at random,  any given deletion is significantly more likely
to weaken the Web of Trust than to make no change, therefore,
mathematically, every signature strengthens the WoT on average.
Let's assign a value if 0 to every irrelevant signature, and a value of 1
to every relevant signature.  The total strength of the Web is the sum of
the keys in the Web.   Then the expected value of any given key's deletion
is in fact a negative value greater than 0, and if we rebuild the Web from
those signatures,  the addition of any key has an expected value greater
than 0, therefore, every key strengthens the Web

As a gpg user, I've been using the gpg 2.1.x releases for a while.  as
of 2.1.1, gpg for windows included gpa and gpgex.  I used them.  newer
releases didn't remove these features, but didn't upgrade or include
them either.  Now it's difficult if not impossible to install gpa and
gpgex with gnupg 2.1.x series.  Can we get these nearly essential
features added back into the 2.1.x releases going forward please?  If
not, can we have them made into an add-on package so that downloading
them is easy?  Even if they're not fully or properly supported, the
existing functionality like clipboard, and basic key use are quite
important for day to day use of gpg on windows.  Not everybody uses a
dedicated e-mail client, or cares to install one.

@_subject: PAM authentication with gpg or ssh key 
Hello list.  I know this isn't exactly on topic, but I think it's
asymptotically close enough to justify asking here.  I'm looking for a
way to authenticate myself to PAM (Specifically sudo) on a remote
server over SSH, though possibly also on a local server using
ssh-agent. if my gpg key is unlocked.  This is particularly relevant
as I store my gpg key in a smart card, and use it to authenticate to
the servers initially.  It would be nice if, while I was out and about
doing remote administrative tasks, I didn't have to take the security
risk of typing in my password where people could shoulder-surf it.  As
I'm using a hardware crypto token (Yubikey Neo actually), I could
actually enable static passwords, or other crypto measures alongside
my yubikey, however, the two best alternative options have less
desirable side-effects.  namely the yubikey-pam module requires
communication with the yubico servers to authenticate a key, and the
static password option can easily accidentally dump the plaintext
password into, say, an e-mail or notepad.  Therefore, I'm looking for
a way to have PAM query the ssh-agent remotely, or optionally locally
in rare instances if possible, for authentication.  I've tried
googling for this, but was unable to come up with anything, and was
hoping someone here would know a way.
If it's possible to redirect gpg-agent over ssh as a gpg agent instead
of an ssh agent, it would also be more than sufficient, if not
preferable, so long as it can authenticate to PAM effectively.  It's
worth noting that my primary use case is connecting from windows +
gpg2.1 + putty --> Linux + whatever version of gpg comes from repos.
Current platforms include deb 7,8, and ubuntu 14.04 and 15.04, but in
the future plan to incldue freebsd and openbsd.

Top posting is easier for some, bottom posting for others. Also, a sane mda
will show all new messages at the bottom, meaning you see the previous
messages above the current message. Leaving the full quote in for those who
aren't using a sane mda to be able to read through and find previous
messages, indented to show threading, is a matter of courtesy.
The only time inline responses make any sense at all is when there are
multiple separate points to respond to, and the only time a bottom post
makes sense is when you want your recipients to have to scroll through the
previous context *twice*, and get annoyed.
