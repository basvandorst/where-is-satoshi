@_subject: Problem using GemSage 16k Smartcards 
Have tried to get GemSafe 16k cards to work together with OpenPGP /
GnuPG (using Windows XP SP2 / Thunderbird 1.5 /
gnupt-2.6.2.1_gpg1.4.1-wpt0.9.92-gpgrelay0.959-int) and it won't work at
all. Currently I'm using the OpenPGP card from g10code.de and it works
fine. But when trying to create keys on GemSafe via OpenPGP plugin for
Thunderbird I get following error:
gpg: detected reader 'Gemplus GemPC400 0'
gpg: pcsc_connect failed: sharing violation (0x8010000b)
gpg: card reader not available
gpg: OpenPGP card bot available: general error
Does the card work; well yes since I then tried with the same card to
create keypair using PGP Desktop and that works fine. So kind of stuck here.
Also tried to use the g10code.de card together with PGP Desktop and that
card isn't accepted since PGP has hard coded what cards they support.

@_subject: Startup problem with WinPT (missing keys after couple of weeks). 
No for while and usually on a system (running Win XP Pro SP2) that has
been in use for couple of weeks WinPT suddenly starts up and claims
following "The keycache was not initialized or is empty. Please check
your PGP config (keyrings, pathes...) and I'm then asked to identify and
locate the keyrings. So when checking the directory where the keyring is
located I found that the pubring.gpg has been copied to pubring.bak and
pubring.gpg is now empty?! What went wrong here?
