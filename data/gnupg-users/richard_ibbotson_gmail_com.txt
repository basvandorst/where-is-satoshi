I get the same thing when I run 'gpg --refresh-keys'.  GnuPG version 1.4.7 and 1.4.6 ......
gpg: requesting key 5706A4B4 from hkp server subkeys.pgp.net
gpg: waiting for lock (held by 1945 - probably dead) ...
gpg: waiting for lock (held by 1945 - probably dead) ...
gpg: waiting for lock (held by 1945 - probably dead) ...
gpg: waiting for lock (held by 1945 - probably dead) ...
So, if it's reproducible then it has to be a bug of some sort ?
