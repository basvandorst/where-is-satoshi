@_subject: Possible to specify acceptable KeyID for signature verification? 
Is it possible to specify that only a valid signature from a specific
KeyID should be considered as success?
I need is to run GnuPG non-interactively and verify that a message
is signed by a specific key.
Thanks for any advice..
