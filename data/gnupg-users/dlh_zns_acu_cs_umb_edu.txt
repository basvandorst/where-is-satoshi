I occasionally get an error similar to the following:
gpg: Signature made Sat Aug  7 09:46:39 1999 EDT using RSAREF key ID
 65E8C1A7
gpg: requesting key 65E8C1A7 from pgp.ai.mit.edu ...
gpg: fatal: Key length is too large for RSAREFsecmem usage: 1408/1408
 bytes in 2/2 blocks of pool 1408/16384
Is this a misconfiguration on my part?  or is it merely something that's
not 'up & running' yet?

It seems to me that being able to decrypt without interaction defeats (to
a degree) the intent of having it encrypted in the first place.  That
being that your interaction is required to decrypt it, and thus reveal its
contents .

Both true.
I believe there is a batch mode which can read the passphrase from a file.
I suppose you could also tie some scripts together to accomplish this.
Perl by itself might be able to, or perhaps you can use excpect.  Either
of these, in fact any solution, will involve either putting the passphrase
in one kind of file or another, or leaving no passphrase on the key.

I have GPG 0.9.8 on an Alpha (Linux), [VERY speedy :)) ] and generating

I am in a very similar situation, saving that I use pine instead of elm,
and that I do not use gpgpgp wrapper.  I simply edited the .pinerc file to
use GPG as a filter for messages that contain the standard PGP markings.
According to the documentation, `gpg --decrypt` takes the message from
stdin, decrypts, and hands it back to stdout.  `gpg --verify` takes the
messages from stdin, checks the sig, and /does not/ hand anything back to
stdout, which is why your mail client shows a blank screen.  Pine did
exactly the same thing for me.  To avoid having to suspend pine every time
I wanted to check a sig (which loses its novelty /very/ quickly), I put
together a small Perl script, which you are welcome to use.  If anyone
cares to comment on it, feel free.
