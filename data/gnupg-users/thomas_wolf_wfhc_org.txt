@_subject: GNU privacy guard on AIX 
Hello, I need to install GNU Privacy Guard (gnupg) 2.0.9 on several AIX
5.2 systems.
Before I can install gnupg, the following dependent packages need to be
installed. *	libgpg-error *	libgcrypt    *	libksba      *	libassuan    I'm having problems installing the first package, libgpg-error (1.5).
I'm able to successfully configure it using the following command:
 AWK=/usr/bin/awk CC=/opt/freeware/bin/gcc
GREP=/opt/freeware/bin/grep LD=/opt/freeware/bin/gld
However, I keep getting the following error when make is executed:
if /opt/freeware/bin/gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I..
-DLOCALEDIR=\"/usr/local/share/locale\"   -g -O2 -MT
gpg_error-gpg-error.o -MD -MP -MF ".deps/gpg_error-gpg-error.Tpo" -c -o
gpg_error-gpg-error.o `test -f 'gpg-error.c' || echo './'`gpg-error.c;
then mv -f " .deps/gpg_error-gpg-error.Tpo"
".deps/gpg_error-gpg-error.Po"; else rm -f
".deps/gpg_error-gpg-error.Tpo"; exit 1; fi
        /bin/sh ../libtool --tag=CC --mode=link /opt/freeware/bin/gcc
-g -O2    -o gpg-error  gpg_error-strsource-sym.o  gpg_error-stre
rror-sym.o gpg_error-gpg-error.o
./libgpg-error.la/opt/freeware/bin/gcc -g -O2 -o .libs/gpg-error
gpg_error-strsource-sym.o gpg_error-strerror-sym.o gpg_error-gpg-error.o
-L./.libs -lgp g-error
collect2: library libgpg-error not found
make: 1254-004 The error code from the last command is 1.
make: 1254-004 The error code from the last command is 2.
make: 1254-004 The error code from the last command is 1.
Since I'm trying to install the libgpg-error package, I don't understand
how one of its libraries, which I assume would be generated as part of
the install, is causing the make process to fail.
Any suggestions for clearing this error would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you.
