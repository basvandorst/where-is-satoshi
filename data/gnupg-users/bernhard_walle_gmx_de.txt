@_subject: Unrevoke revoked uid 
is it possible to revert a revocation of a UID without simply adding
the same UID again?

I sent the key to keyservers. Resigning is just what I thought because
revoking a UID only means revoking the signature of the UID.
But how can I perform resigning? Just selecting a UID and the "sign"
command didn't work.

* Johan Wevers  [2004-09-20 00:31]:
same in Germany, the reason is following: IDEA is patended in
Switzerland as European patent, so it's valid in Germany and the
Netherlands, too.

@_subject: OpenPGP card and gpgme 
Hash: SHA1
I use a OpenPGP card for signing and encrypting mails together with
Sylpheed Claws which uses gpgme. It works fine with two exceptions:
 - If the card is not inserted before the passphrase should be entered,
   Sylpheed hangs. So I have to insert the card first (which I normally
   do, anyway).
   In console, gpg asks to insert the card in the reader.
 - The User-ID is not diplayed but the string "[no user id]").
   From the source code I expect it's missing in the uid_hint
   parameter of the gpgme_passphrase_cb_t function.
The sylpheed developers told me to ask here.

Yes. I would like to use gpg-agent, but it does not work. I wrote a
mail at Mon, 21 Nov 2005 22:10:38 +0100 in this mailinglist, but nobody
could help me.

@_subject: Using OpenPGP smartcards with Sylpheed/gpgme 
I'm using a OpenPGP smartcard. Whenever Sylpheed should ask for the
password, it hangs. I found server threads about this, all ending with
a request from Werner Koch to send him logfiles.
Is there any solution? Of course, I can provide logfiles.

@_subject: Problem with gpg-agent 
after having no success with gpg and Sylpheed with the OpenPGP card, I
tried gpg-agent.
I do:
  $ eval `gpg-agent --daemon`
  $ gpg --sign --default-key ...... file
and get
sending command `SCD PKSIGN' to agent failed: ec=6.32817
 [...]
 use-agent

  $ gpg --version
  gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.2
Same smartcard settings and drivers in ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf works without
problems. I also do homebanking with that cardreader and this driver.

Bernhard Walle  [2005-11-21]:
Works now with gpgme 1.0.3.
One problem remains: If I forget to insert the card before sending the
mail, the UI hangs. Should I blame gpgme for that or the mail client
(Sylpheed)? If latter, can you shortly describe how to fix it so that I
can forward this to the GPG plugin maintainer of Sylpheed Claws? Thanks!

@_subject: OpenPGP card 
two question:
 1. After key creation on the card, I can enter a passphrase. I left it
    empty because I thought the PIN is sufficient. Is this usual?
 2. Is it possible to read out the private key only after creation or
    every time?
