@_subject: Security doubts on 3DES default 
Hello List
I'm new to this list and joined because I have some security doubts
regarding encryption preferences (setpref/showpref).
According to the gpg2 man page, 3DES is added always as kind of least
common denominator:
When setting preferences, you should list the algorithms in the order
which you'd like to see them used by someone else when encrypting a
message to your key.  If you don't include 3DES, it will be
automatically added at the end.  Note that there are  many  factors that
go into choosing an algorithm (for example, your key may not be the only
recipient), and so the remote OpenPGP application being used to send to
you may or may not follow your exact chosen order for a given message.
It will, however, only  choose  an  algorithm that  is  present  on  the
preference list of every recipient key.  See also the INTEROPERABILITY
WITH OTHER OPENPGP PROGRAMS section below.
In my opinion this design decision can lead to serious security
troubles. If someone, knowingly or not, removed all his/her symmetric
encryption algorithms in his/her public key, our conversation would only
be 3DES encrypted.
In a situation in which there are several recipients, e.g. a encrypted
mailing list, one participating public key/person can downgrade the
whole encrypted conversation to every recipient to 3DES instead of lets
say AES256.
I think the same goes for the hashing algorithm SHA1.
Is my understanding correct or do I miss an important fact? What are
your thoughts about this behaviour?
Wouldn't it be great to raise the minimum encryption and hashing level
to a more secure cipher?
Thanks in advance and best regards

Thank you Robert for your response and point of view.
Just because it's required behaviour doesn't mean it's (still) good. ;-)
But I will try contact them.
Apart from that, as GnuPG is in a kind of symbiosis with
OpenPGP/RFC4880, I think it's important to discuss this on this mailing
list (as well).
I agree with you, we have better options than 3DES so we should switch
to better ciphers as soon as possible.
I think it's a question of time till 3DES is broken, like it was with
SHA-1. To be at least one step ahead of such a mess should be the goal.
As mentioned, I'll try to reach them. The support from the GnuPG
community, on this topic, would be appreciated.
Where have you found this information? I only found this draft[0] which
still contains 3DES and SHA-1.
Thanks in advance and best regards

@_subject: Errors at ECC key generation in non-interactive mode 
Hi List
I get these errors while trying to create a new ECC key:
$ gpg --batch --gen-key Desktop/params-ecc.txt
gpg: key ABCDEFABCDEFABCD marked as ultimately trusted
gpg: error reading rest of packet: Invalid argument
gpg: error reading rest of packet: Invalid argument
gpg: can't encode a 256 bit MD into a 88 bits frame, algo=8
gpg: can't encode a 256 bit MD into a 88 bits frame, algo=8
gpg: revocation certificate stored as
My parameters are:
$ cat params-ecc.txt
Key-Type: EdDSA
Key-Curve: Curve25519
Key-Length: 256
Subkey-Type: ECC
Subkey-Curve: Curve25519
Subkey-Length: 256
Name-Real: Name-Comment: Name-Email: Passphrase: Preferences: S9 S13 S8 S12 S7 S11 S10 H10 H9 H8 Z3 Z2 Z1
gnupg creates a key though, but I could not find any hints regarding the
errors. Do I use wrong parameters?
Thanks and regards

Hi Daniel,
I was not aware of this syntax style. Thank you.
  fpr=$(gpg --with-colons --quick-gen-key "Test user "
ed25519 | awk -F: '/^fpr:/{ print $10 }')
This immediately runs gpg and ask for a password and creates an EdDSA
signing key without any errors.
I run GnuPG 2.1.15 on Ubuntu 17.04. It is also possible to create an ECC
keypair with gpg --expert --full-gen-key without any errors. I just
would prefer to have a paramter file for later/future use.
Thank you.
