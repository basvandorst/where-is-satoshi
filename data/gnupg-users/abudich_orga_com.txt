@_subject: Installation in Windows environment 
because pgp is a little bit suspicious to me I wanted to use GnuPG in t=
he future. Unfortunately (at this time) my OS is Windows  and I haven't=
 any experience with Linux.
After downloading and unpacking the files I tried to run "gnupg.exe". A=
 window opended and I got the message: "Go ahead and type your message.=
And then...?
It would be very kind if  you could give me support how to run GnuPG on=
 a windows system (and perhaps a newsgroup to find additional infos)
Thanks in advance!
Yours sincerely
