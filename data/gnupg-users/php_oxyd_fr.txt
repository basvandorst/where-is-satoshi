@_subject: GnuPG and PHP 
I'm trying to set up a script to send PngPG signed mail with PHP.
I succeed in sending encrypted mail but it's not working with signed mail.
file.txt = original file / crypted.txt = crypted file
system("/path/bin/gpg --encrypt -ao /path/crypted.txt /path/file.txt");
this command works fine but i need to sign ...
file.txt = original file / crypted.txt = crypted file / pass.gpg = file containing the passphrase
system("/path/bin/gpg --clearsign --passphrase-fd 0 -
ao /path/crypted.txt /path/file.txt < /path/pass.gpg");
this one is NOT working... Can s/o help me... ?
Thanks
