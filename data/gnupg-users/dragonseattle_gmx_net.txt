@_subject: Howto import more than one key from a keyserver at a time 
Hey list,
was wondering if it was possible to import many keys at the same time from a
keyserver. Had imported a key with a lot of sigs and most of them can't be
checked as I don't have the keys the key was signed with. So my question is to
import all the signing keys at once, perhaps even with the keys which I don't
have signing *these* keys.
Thanks for reading and your answers.

Or I just export my keyrings from my WinPT and import it in my gpg under
Ubuntu and it'll work.
This will check all sigs of all keys in my ring, doesn't it?
The keys would be the last thing befor the |?
Somehow this is what i wanted...
