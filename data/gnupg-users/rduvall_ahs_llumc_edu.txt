I am using gpg to build an automated encryption server.  I can give the
details if anyone is interested, but here is a specific problem.
I have set this up to add a "master key" recipient in addition to the
selected recipient.  I am testing the automated decryption feature and can't
decrypt to the second recipient when multiple recipients are present.  I am
running under Windows.  I tried using the --local-user option and it still
goes after the first recipient.

Did you try just moving the key ring files to the new box?

I was trying to migrate my gpg setup on box_a to =
box_b. I'm using gpg 1.0.6 on both boxes. When trying to import the secret key =
on box_b, it complains of "no user ID", even if I import my =
public key first. Am I doing something wrong? Things that don't seem to help:
-removing passphrase from secret key
-exporting from box_a with --no-comment
-specifying secret keyring with =
-using the hex id rather than userid to specify =
which key to export
Here's a pseudo-transcript of my activities:
[jimbo ~]$ gpg -a --export-secret-keys jimbo =
~]$ scp test.asc jimbo
[jimbo ~]$ ssh box_b
[jimbo ~]$ gpg --allow-secret-key-import =
--import test.asc

Let me re-state my previous question another way.
what do I add to the command: gpg --decrypt --output oufile.txt outfile.gpg  to indicate which of the multiple recipients I wish to decrypt as.
I am running under Windows.  I may have more than one of the require secret
keys available on the key ring.
I have tried the --local-user  option and it doesn't seem to work.

This message is in MIME format. Since your mail reader does not understand

I am trying to get GPG approved for use in our corporate network.  However
the general reluctance to use free-ware open source has come up.  I have
been asked to provide a white-paper or some other document showing that for
the features implemented GPG is true and faithful to the openPGP standard.
I have a document from our PGP rep which highlights the lack of support
inherent in open source.  The only functionality missing (according to the
PGP document) is stuff PGP added above and beyond the openPGP spec.
Can anyone point to anything written by someone I can take to my management?

@_subject: Passphrase as parameter in the command line 
This message is in MIME format. Since your mail reader does not understand

The solution (recommended in the documentation) is to change the passphrase
to nothing to that automatic decryption can occur.

@_subject: GPG and ADK 
I have implemented ADK for outbound stuff by scripting the process and hard coding the ADK as an additional recipient.  This is our internal ADK.  I'm not sure how to do this when the external recipient requires an ADK.

Am I correct in that it is not possible to get GPG to encrypt to a
persons public key and their "Big Brother/ADK" key?  I don't see it in
the FAQ and in testing I am unable to get it to work.  I have a feeling
that this is "as designed" however a response is appreciated.
