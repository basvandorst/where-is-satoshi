@_subject: Non-deterministic behavior using GnuPG and a smart-card 
Maybe there is an algorithm that the Yubukey can't handle?
Or, maybe Enigmail is calling "gpg" instead of "gpg2"?
I'm just brainstorming.

Is it always the same files that aren't decrypting, or is it truly random?

@_subject: Is NFC Appropriate? 
Good Morning,
As a very happy Yubikey 4[2] user, where my latop does not contain any
secret keys, I would now like to enjoy secure email on my smart phone
and tablet(s). Enter an NFC-capable SmartCard.
I have nowhere near the depth of understanding required to evaluate
this. Is it reasonable and appropriate to use a sub-key on an
NFC-capable SmartCard, such as the YubiKey Neo[3], in conjunction with
K9 Mail[4]?
This has been discussed at least once[1].
Thank you for your input,

Re-reading my own post, I realize that I was not clear on my actual
question. Let me rephrase:
Is using an NFC Smart Card with a smart phone for PGP secure? What
pitfalls exist?
Thank you,

How do you do that? Is there a type of sub-key you use?

@_subject: Full Workflow with Smart Card(s) 
Good Afternoon All,
I would like to put together a full workflow for creating and using GPG.
Having read a few articles about using air-gapped systems and
Smartcards, I'm almost there.
I currently have a setup where the master key is on a USB key, which is
only inserted into an air-gapped system when required. Day-to-day
subkeys are stored on a Yubikey for regular use. This works.
But, using an air-gapped system to sign keys that you trust seems rather
unwieldy, particularly when you include in the process the need to copy
the public keys to media accessible by the air-gapped system.
Could a second smartcard be used to generate and store the master key,
What do others do?
Thanks for your input,

@_subject: Homedir & scdaemon 
I would like to be able to do the occasional operation from an alternate
home directory. And I'm using a SmartCard.
So, gpg2 itself has the --homedir option, which works. But you need to
kill existing agents before hand, or things get confusing.
But, scdaemon seems more stubborn, and doesn't respect gpg2's homedir
option. And trying to start it manually, beforehand, with the --homedir
option, fails with:
$ /usr/lib/gnupg2/scdaemon -v --homedir /media/asherman/TailsData/gnupg/
scdaemon[5944]: invalid option "--homedir"
Any tips? Or is there a much better way to keep some of my secret keys

That does not appear to be the case:
scdaemon (GnuPG) 2.1.11
libgcrypt 1.6.5
libksba 1.3.3-unknown
