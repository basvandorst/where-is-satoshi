@_subject: Optimal setup for corporate keys 
We exchange sensitive files with multiple corporate partners and would like
to set our keys up so that a single private key compromise does not require
generating new keys for all partners.
1) Should we generate separate pub / priv key pairs for all partners?
2) Generate a single pub / priv key for signing and multiple sub-keys for

Thanks. Does it make sense to use a key-server? The public key will only be
use by a single partner organization. We were thinking about exchanging it
over e-mail.

The partners will generate their own keys so we can send them files. We're
generating separate pub/priv keys for each partner to receive files from
them. My question was that if we should generate separate pub/priv keys or
generate subkeys under a single signing key. Looks like the consensus is
that we should use entirely separate pub/priv keys.
We will have decryption processes on multiple servers. So if one server
happens to get compromised, I want to avoid the disruption of reaching out
to 40 partners to exchange keys again. We would only reach out to the
affected partners with new keys.
Thanks for the input everyone!

Does anyone use a GPG library to embed file encryption processes within
python code? Which libraries do you use? Any recommendations?
We looked at the ones below which are basically wrappers for the GnuPG

If IMAP or ActiveSync are enabled for that Gmail ("Gmail for Work")
account, you may continue using whatever client you're using today.

Probably out-of-scope for this list but, if the process is automated you'd
want to reduce the number of people with access to the keys to only staff
with need-to-know. Usually that translates to IT support / administrators.
Beyond that safeguards against people (specifically administrators) cannot
be technical controls. They have to be policies, procedures, and
monitoring/audit. You should demonstrate that:
   - You are doing background checks against employees with access to the
   keys
   - Those background checks look at issues like debt
   - You have security policies and procedures that dictate use of
   well-known security best practices
   - You have a security awareness program that ensures that employees are
   reminded of best practices
   - You keep a log of whoever is logging into the system to access the key
You just have to trust your employees at some point. None of this mitigates
a rogue insider with access to the keys.

Oh man.. check a few of the previous list emails on this subject. They're
fairly detailed.
