@_subject: gnupg error msg 
I am trying to compile gnupg-1.0.2 on a HP9000-K200 system running 10.20.  I
finally resolved some compilation errors but can not get past this bad
system call problem
I run configure with the following options.
./configure --disable-nls --enable-static-rnd=egd hppa1.1-hp-hpux10.20
I have included the config.log as an attachment.  Any assistance with this
problem will be highly appreciated.  I thank you in adance =========================  End of the gmake
