@_subject: Decryption failed error 
Hello Everyone,
We sent our RSA 2048-bit public key to a customer (key id: CBD20614) which they were able to import into their key-ring. They sent us their RSA 2048-bit public key (Key id: A1C09977), which I have imported into the key-ring & given it the ultimate trust and have also signed it. The customer encrypted a test file using our public key & signed it using their key.
When I try to decrypt the file at our end, I get the following error:
I tried ./gpg --list-keys & I see only the CBD20614 & A1C09977 keys. I also ./gpg --list-secret-keys, but I only see the CBD20614 key. I don't see the 6A4285DA key id at all.
I also tried ./gpg --verify & I get the following message:
It seems to me that the customer used the wrong key to encrypt the file & send it to us. Am I correct or am I missing something?
Can someone give me any suggestions as to why this could be happening?
Thanks for any help.
