@_subject: PGP 7.1 Decryption failed bad key 
Created new key pair in 1.4. Exported the public key
to pgp 7.1. It now works. pubkey enc packet: version 3, algo 16,        data: [2048 bits]
       data: [2048 bits]
Why does pgp 7.1 not work with the old public key?
Looking for help with additional directions to solve
this problem. Using gnupg 1.4. exported keys from old keyring imported into 1.4
keyring. Old version 1.0.3
looked on gnupg-users for anything related, did not
find any particular solution. I have other customers that use pgp that I am not
having a problem with even with 1.0.3
Is it possible that the character set is an issue. My
software is running under hpux11.
Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. The other
party also indicated that they encrypt files that are
used by their customers running gunpg. Don't
particularly want to create a new secret and public
key for
these guys but will if that is the solution.
