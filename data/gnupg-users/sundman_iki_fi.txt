@_subject: which revoke? 
How can I find out which key a revoke file revokes?
I'm very new to gpg. I played around with it and thought that my keys
were only on my own computer so when I was finished I deleted all but
one. Turned out they were on a public server, and since I deleted the
secret keys I guess there's no way to remove them. However, I found a
file named "revoke.txt" in ~/.gnupg/ and I'd like to use it to revoke
at least one of the test-keys unless the revoke is for the only key I
still have the secret key for, but how can I know?
