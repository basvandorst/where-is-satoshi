@_subject: unattended key deletion GnuPG 2.1 
============================== START ==============================
I try to delete a public and it's secret key via gpgme. The problem is
that it always pops a pinentry confirmation dialog. Since I want do the
action unattended this is a problem.
By looking at the gpg-agent code it seems that there is currently no way
to do this. But maybe I missed something.
There are two possibly workarounds I have think of
1) use a fake pinentry which always says yes.
2) delete the key in private-keys-v1.d
but those are obviously crude hacks.
Thank you.
