@_subject: What does "sig!3" mean? 
I'm using gpg 1.2.4. When I checked signatures on my own key, I'vefound that one of my self-sig is marked as "sig!3". What does thismean? A valid v3 self-signature?
This new user id as well as the self-sig was generated by gpg 1.2.4, while the other user id was generated by PGP 7 and has a self-sigmarked as "sig!" only.
Does GPG generate a v3 self-sig by default when no expiration date is specified? Or did I indicate this in options?
This is my gpg.conf file:
keyserver ldap://keyserver.pgp.com
digest-algo RIPEMD160
compress-algo 2
load-extension d:\utility\gnupg\idea
charset utf-8
Thank you.

@_subject: Why can't I upload my pubkey? 
When I upload it through a web page I always get the error message "Error decoding keyblock". However, this keyblock was generated by GPG and GPG accepted it without complaint.
