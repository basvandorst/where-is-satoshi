@_subject: Revoked keys and past signatures 
I revoked my gpg key yesterday because it was superceded by a newer one.
Now recepients of my messages during the last few years are getting a warning
that the key is invalid - even though it was perfectly valid the date the
messages were signed:
  gpg: Signature made 2015-02-05T19:28:21 ART using RSA key ID 1BFBED44
  gpg: Good signature from "Hugo Osvaldo Barrera " [unknown]
  gpg: WARNING: This key has been revoked by its owner!
  gpg:          This could mean that the signature is forged.
  gpg: reason for revocation: Key is superseded
  gpg: revocation comment: Superseded by 0x28C61189.
  gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
  gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
  Primary key fingerprint: AA73 5C33 E081 E0D2 C945  5B12 873C F207 1BFB ED44
Did I do something wrong? Isn't the revokation date compared to the signature
Does this mean that if someone revokes their key today, *all past* signatures
become invalid?

Only on older versions of gpg, according to the man pages:
   ~/.gnupg/secring.gpg
            A secret keyring as used by GnuPG versions before 2.1.  It is not
            used by GnuPG 2.1 and later.

@_subject: Key keeps showing unknown trust 
Yes, you're right in that sense. I just wanted to put it in slightly less trust
so as to recognize it more easily. I don't want to sign my *old* key with my
new one either.
I'll have to rethink how I organize myself a bit in that aspect.
However, the issue at hand is another: even if I set a trust of 5 (ultimate),
the next screen still shows it as unknown and that doesn't change.
If I delete my keyring, and re-import both secret keys, only the first of both
that I set to ultimate is actually shown as ultimate, and the second is always
shown as unknown.

Oh, that was informative. It's a shame, but I seem to have asked too late and
this is already on keyservers.
I had not thought that the time could just be forged if it had been stolen.
Out of curiosity: is the revocation reason even saved? Would it be possible for
gpg to actually use it in future?

I haven't read the RFC, so I don't know if something is define in this exact
scenario, but it does sound like a bug.
I imagine that recipients of all my emails for the past four years now looking
at their archives will find that my messages have no valid signature, and that
must be slightly disturbing.
I'll read the RFC if I have time and see if something specific is defined.
Thanks for testing this thuroughly.
Also, thanks Daniel for confirming that the reason *is* stored.

@_subject: (bug?) Revoked keys and past signatures 
There is no reason to assume that the signature has been forged if the key has
not been compromised.
Also, I see no reason why I should not be able to assign a trust to a revoked
key - I might trust it even if the author revoked it as superseded:
  $ gpg --edit 1BFBED44
  [... info on revoked key ...]
  gpg> lsign
  Key is revoked.  Unable to sign.
I believe the reason matters. I can even sit down with the owner of the key and
verify his ID and fingerprint and sign it, meaning "this key belongs to this
person, but was superseeded a week ago". If actually influences the validity of
anything he signed up to a week ago.

@_subject: MIME or inline signature ? 
This is a bit of a bikeshed discussion, but I'll still chime in.
Pros of GPG/Mime:
* It's a lot less ugly for users with no gpg support. The large signature block
  at the end and the gpg marks are hard to ignore.
* AFAIK, inline gpg has issues with non-ascii characters. ? Correct me if I'm
  wrong.
* Inline-gpg includes a signature for each attachment. This allows third
  parties to count how many files are attached (and their filenames, I
  believe). gpg/mime include one huge blob, so third parties can't tell this
  sort of metadata.
In the end, I'd suggest you go with what you prefer on a whim, more than
techinical reasons. I like gpg/mime because of the above reasons (the first two
are pretty important to me). But from a techinical point of view, you'll find
plenty clients that don't support one or the other. Some clients support one
with relative ease and require tweaking for the other.  The truth is, none of the two deprecates the other, so there's no strong
convergence, IMHO.

@_subject: MIME or inline signature ? 
Not necesarily. Writing and testing the code to support non-standard traffic
takes time and effort, and may increase the likelyhood of introducing some bug.
In proyects that don't have a lot of manpower, implementing such compatibility
may be a dealbreaker.

@_subject: MIME or inline signature ? 
I've no way of determining who has gpg support and who has not really and I
prefer to sign by default. Validating (or not) the signature is up to the
They may also gain gpg support in future, and can back-validate previous
Ah, I'm sorry for the misinformation in that case. I may never have been
updated to the latest on this, and I appreciate the correction - I'll avoid
repeating this again.
From my experience, pgp/mime emails with encrypted into a  are a single
msg.asc, which needs to be decrypted to determine the mime parts inside. Is
this inaccurate?
The (admitedly few) clients I've tried with gpg-inline attached a single
additional mime part per attachment when encrypting, making attachment count
and filenames visible. There may be a way to do this differently, but no email
client seems to do it, so it's sort of a moot point. Expecting users to do this
manually is a bit burdensome, compared to gpg/mime.
There will always be people who can handle one and not the other (and let's not
forget you'll probably know more people in future). There's no single mechanism
that'll work for everyone.
Yes, thanks for the insight. Especially on the non-ascii related information,
for which it seems I was out-of-date.

Sure, I've heard the arguments like:
* Let's use a globally trusted authority instead: There's no such thing and
  never will be. Someone will always have a valid reason to distrust it.
* Set up your own keyexchange server: Ok, so we're back to GPG and keyrings
  where users need to manually retrieve keys from different places and
  determine if they're the right one or not.
Please, stop spreading the iMessage falacy, it's system offers privacy only
from *some* parties, but not from everyone.

Of course iMessage is a lot more usable: it's not a challenge to create very
usable and friendly IM UIs. The challenge is about creating easily usable
*secure* communication software.
Sure, lower the bar *on how secure what you're using is*, and most it's easier
to user.
S/MIME isn't *really* safe. It requires trusting a bunch of CAs, and is
can basically receive the same criticism as TLS applied to the web.

in paying for something you can have for free with the same quality.

Modern browsers can handle this. Some websites embed base64 uri-encoded images
of several kb in length and all browsers handle this properly.
The same happens with several other quite standard protocols. Even some of
those listed on rfc3986. This is a firefox issue, IMHO.
This is configured via about:preferences since firefox does not
respect OS settings in this aspect at all.
That sounds like the expected behaviour if there's no registered handler. The
same would happen with things like "mailto:" if you had none.
Yeah, this seems to invalidate the strongest use-case for this specification.
On some scenarios. But we need some sort of glue to import something from a
vCard into gnupg's keyring. I don't think we need a new spec for this though.
