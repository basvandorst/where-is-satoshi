At the risk of trolling myself, Jason's reading appears to me at first
blush to be right.  It says, hash the entire public key packet,
starting with the version field.  It seems like a mistake to calculate
the fingerprint of a "corrected" version of the key.
That said, I do appear to be alone in PGP implementations to handle it
this way. That said, I'm not eager to fix it, since the keys in
question are clearly broken, and, I'm hoping, quite rare.
