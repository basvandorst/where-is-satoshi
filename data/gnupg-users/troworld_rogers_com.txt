If I'm not mistaken you should be able to update your public key from
the keyserver (assuming that whoever signed your key uploaded it to that
same server) and the signatures would be integrated into your keyring.

A lot of servers synchronize with each other, so I would have to say no,
but you should have your key on the main PGP server and one of others so
they could synchronize.

Yes, you can:
gpg --import C:\Keys\pubring.pkr
gpg --import C:\Keys\secring.skr
Change the directory accordingly.
You will need to edit the trust settings, since, I believe, it's not
Hope this helps.

Hash: SHA1
It really depends on the type of the file. .txt and .asc are for ASCII
files (armored). .gpg and .pgp are for binaries.
I don't think there is a fixed rule about this. .txt and .asc are the
most common, I believe. I use .asc because of its integration with PGP.
Hope this helps.

Thanks for the encrypted message :)
I'm sure it would be very informative, if I could read it.
Resend unecrypted, please?

news.gmane.org provides mirrors for many mailing lists. This particular
mailing list is available on
news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.user. This is what I use.
Hope that helped.

Gmane keeps their newsservers spam-free by requiring email address
verification before posting. I don't know about spam-collectors.
At least this keeps my mailbox clean

And by spam-collectors I meant spam robots that collect email addresses.
Sorry. Very sleepy.

Is that a different server from wwwkeys.pgp.net? If yes, why do you
recommend subkeys over wwwkeys?

@_subject: Export the smallest possible version of a public key 
Hash: SHA1
Hi, list.
I'd like to send someone the smallest possible version (armored) of my public key containing only the primary key/primary uid/self sig.
At the moment, I don't see any way to do this, other than deleting all extra data locally, exporting the key, and then re(stor/fetch)ing it from a I've looked through the FAQ on gnupg.org, but couldn't find anything relevant. There was a section on restoring a public key from a private one, but that seems to be more complicated than the way described above.
Is there an easier way?
