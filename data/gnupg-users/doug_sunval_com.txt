@_subject: gpg can't decrypt with PGP 7 secret key 
I have installed GPG on my Mac OS X system and then imported a PGP 7 public and secret key pair into my gpgp keyrings. Now I can encrypt to that key but when I try to decrypt with it I get the error unknown cipher algorithm and no secret key.
as you can see below,  I do in fact have the secret key on my keyring, but it won't decrypt. Any suggestions???
Thanks, please cc me as I am not on the list.
