Maybe this is off-topic, but I hope nobody will kill me.
I want to work with XFMail, because of the GnuPG-patch. Every time I compile
and install the source code I get an ERROR altough I do it exacly the same way
the README.file tells me. Does anybody work with XFMail or are there other
EMail-Clients which work with GnuPG?
Regards and Thanx
