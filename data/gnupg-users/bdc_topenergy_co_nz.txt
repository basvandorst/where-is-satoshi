@_subject: public keys newbie question 
As I understand it, people only need my public key if they are going to encrypt a file for me.  If I will only be sending them encrypted files, then I need their public key but they don't need mine.  Is this correct?

@_subject: GPG4Win keys not appearing 
I'm using GPG4win 1.0.8.  I have imported a key and have used it for encrypting a few times.  I notice that sometimes when I right click on a file, this key doesn't appear in the key lists and sometimes it does.  Has anyone else experienced this?  Do we know why it does this?

Hi Kurt,
Yes it is GPGee I'm using.  Thanks for the explanation.  I'll see if I can produce the keyrings.  Failing that, I guess we'll just keep trying until the key reappears or use GPG commands.
Thanks again.
Hi Bruce,
I'm the author of GPGee (GPG Explorer Extensions), which from what you
have described, seems to be the component you're having problems with.
I've had several reports of keys disappearing at odd times.  I've never
been able to duplicate the problem myself, so I haven't been able to
track it down completely.
My GPGee program ran into problems because it has to deal with an issue
with GnuPG where specifying the same key ring more than once causes keys
to duplicate in its output.  It's quite easy to mis-configure the
gpg.conf file to cause GPG to do this, so I had to write in code in the
explorer extension that filtered this out.  I am fairly certain it is
this code that is, in certain cases, misbehaving, but I've not been able
to work out exactly how.
Several times I've requested a change to GPG to cause it to not
duplicate keyring output, but this has not been done.
If you can produce a sample keyring that exhibits the disappearing key
behavior, I'll try again to track the problem down.  Failing that, I
suppose enough people will just have to step up and ask for GPG to change.

@_subject: PGP Desktop and GPG 
If I have generated a key using PGP Desktop, would I be able to import and use that key with GnuPG?  Our subscription to PGP Desktop is about to expire and it says the functionality will be reduced to that of PGP Freeware.  All we do with it is encrypt files (not emails), so I think this is ok.  I'm not sure if the PGP Desktop gui interface will stop working or not, so thought we could use GnuPG and Gpg4Win which we currently use on another project to replace PGP Desktop.
Thanks for any help.

Thanks David.  But if I'm only encrypting files for others (and not decrypting any), then I only need to export their public key, right?  My private key doesn't come into it, does it?
Thanks again.
The short answer is yes, any key you generate with a roughly recent
PGP Desktop can be used with GnuPG, and vice versa.  Just export it
from one (remember to export the secret key too) and import it into
the other.

Cool, thanks everyone!
The PGP GUI in freeware mode should continue working. The paid elements include
the email plugins and PGPdisk.
It is fairly easy to import your entire keyring set to GnuPG
The above works at this time (PGP 9.x and GnuPG 1.4). It will quire possibly
change at some future date. The canonical method is to export the keys from PGP
and import them into GnuPG. Adding '--import-options import-local-sigs' to the
command line will import local signatures.

@_subject: more than one recipient 
This is probably a dumb, basic question but is it possible to list more
than one key name for the -recipient option when encrypting a file?

Cool, thanks everyone for the responses.
Yes.  Most people encrypt to two (themselves and the intended
recipient) as a matter of course.  Just repeat -r for each one:
  gpg -r person-1 -r person-2 -r person-3 ...
