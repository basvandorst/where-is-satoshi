@_subject: scdaemon lockup with Yubikey NEO 
I?ve noticed several other problem reports that seem similar, hopefully
they?re all related and there?s a simple fix.
The problem:
After an indeterminate amount of time (sometimes minutes, sometimes hours),
any GPG operation that uses my Yubikey NEO device hangs.  The two most
common operations are SSH authentication and git signing.  The following
sequence gets things going again:
$ killall -SIGKILL scdaemon
$ gpg2 ?card-status
System particulars:
   - Host OS is OS-X Yosemite, although it is also present on Mavericks
   (haven?t tried El Capitan yet)
   - GPG 2.1.5
   - Using the Yubikey?s authentication subkey to login to remote Linux
   hosts
   - Using the Yubikey?s signing subkey for git signing operations, both
   local and remote
   - Using gpg-agent for forwarding both GPG and SSH (great features, BTW!)
GPG configuration file:
$ cat ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
default-cache-ttl 1
max-cache-ttl 1
extra-socket ${HOME}/.gnupg/S.gpg-extra-agent
log-file ${HOME}/.gnupg/mygpglogfile.log
I?ll be happy to help debug this, but need some guidance.
