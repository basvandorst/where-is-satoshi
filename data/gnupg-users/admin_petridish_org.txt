@_subject: Weird scenario garbage key on keyserver can it be removed?  
So if I am reading the documentation correctly, if I lost my private key (theft of laptop: fat lot of good it did them with an encrypted $HOME and the need for a boot floppy and 12 char root password) )
and the offsite backup of the private key is gone too (bloddy breakup w/ philandering-g-friend) then there is no way to get the key off the keyserver list? what is the protocol in that case just generate a new key and hope people use the new one?

@_subject: pgp 8.3 invalid armor header 
I have someone new to this who generated a 4096 key ( I told him that was into the realm of tinfoil but he's a nooB and is excited about it) I can verify the key because I physically saw it generated and handed to me.  Now when I go to import it into my keyring the error message is invalid armor header.  So I thought about it a while and opened the asc in vi and deleted the second line of the header which just said " on it and tried again and the key imported without errors.  With that in mind, my question is, isin't it a security violation to alter an armor header?  I thought that messing with the header would break the key but it didn't, is there a danger of this contributing to a spoof of cleartext signing?  It's kind of incidental because I told him I'm not using idea and that as soon as he gets a feel for the process he is going to have to use an algo that is _free_ but it piqued my interest and I began to wonder if I had a full comprehension for the structu!
re of a cleartext key.

Hello, I was wondring if someone could point me to an online doc on how to set a different hash algo in gpg
I spent a while sniffing around on the net - to no avail.  If there isisnt a manual or faq that explains it, would someone mind laying out a thumbnail sketch of how to do it? I have heard that sha1 has been broken and I wanted to begin using md5

I am sorry I sent this on another thread by mistake.  Please forgive me (won't happen again) (posting b4 coffee)
here was my question, now that it has a more aptly named title

I heard if from a friend I made on another mailing list that has nothing to do with encryption.
He brought it up because my clear armored signature indicated that I was using sha1
but he was sincere enough that I figured I would go to 'source' and as this list. I can't find any evidence of Sha1 being compromised on the net and I appreciate the reassurance that Sha1 is the better hashing method.  As I understand it, even with the birthday attack roughly equalizing the brute force needed the sha1 hash is still more secure. again, thank you for the clarification.

@_subject: question regarding relative security of md5 vs sha1 
Hash: SHA1
so let me get this straight, if moore's law is 'true' than a mathmetical analysis of hash sizes will result in it being ~30 years before md5 will be susceptible to bf/dict/b-day attacks, but it will be about about 80 before sha1 will be susceptible to cracks of that level.  I know this is sort of OT but I couldn't think of anyone more qualified than the experts of the crypto software I am using.
