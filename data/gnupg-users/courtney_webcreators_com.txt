@_subject: errors and misc. 
I am using script to automate some gpg functions for interserver
communications..and I am running into a few problems...
I am getting invalid packet errors on occasions when verifying
signed files...this seems to be random occuring problem.
Also, is there a way I can force GPG to never ask for user
input...like if it needs me to verify something it either does yes or
just fails...besides --batch.  Randomly the gpg process will hang
around.  Im assuming waiting for user input...but since it is run in
the background I cant really put input.   These cases dont
happen that often so its not worth me manually doing it to reproduce
it...maybe once every 1000 uses.
Any other automation information not in the manual would be
