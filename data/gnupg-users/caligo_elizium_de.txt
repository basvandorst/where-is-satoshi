@_subject: can't change the primary uid on a RSA key 
I'm mailing this again, cuz none of my previous mails were replied so I
think they might got lost or whatever nasty things can happen to a mail.
Would be fine if someone will take notice of this report. TIA
I have a RSA key which is made with pgp-6.5.8, because gnupg-1.2.1
generates singing only RSA keys. So I imported that key into my gpg
here, added a uid and now I can't change the primary uid. The second uid
I added was automatically set as primary uid. I tried to change the
primary uid as described with:
pub  2048R/89BC559F  created: 2003-02-16 expires: never      trust: u/u
(1)  Clemens Buchmann (2). Clemens Buchmann Command> uid 1
pub  2048R/89BC559F  created: 2003-02-16 expires: never      trust: u/u
(1)* Clemens Buchmann (2). Clemens Buchmann Command> primary
gpg: skipping v3 self-signature on user id "Clemens Buchmann
gpg: skipping v3 self-signature on user id "Clemens Buchmann
Command> uid 0
pub  2048R/89BC559F  created: 2003-02-16 expires: never      trust: u/u
(1)  Clemens Buchmann (2). Clemens Buchmann As you can see the primary uid is not changed to uid 1 as I 'commanded'.
I tried that with a DSA key and it worked as it should, but not with
this RSA key. I couldn't find anything on that topic so far so it might
be a bug. - Maybe you can help me out here. Mayn thanks in advance!
