@_subject: ElGamal: key length vs performance 
As I understand, by default, GunPG uses ElGamal to encrypt/decrypt files,
and the recommended key length is 1024 bit. Is there any information on how
encryption/decryption time changes with the key length? Thanks a lot,

@_subject: Filename is not embedded when using redirection 
My environment is Windows XP, gpg 1.4.2.2. I just found out that the
following are different:
1) gpg -o a.gpg -e a.txt
2) gpg -e < a.txt > a.gpg
When using -o, the gpg file embeds the original filename, thus
  gpg --use-embedded-filenmae a.gpg is valid. However, 2) does not embed the filename, and
  gpg --use-embedded-filenmae a.gpg
prints to stdout. My question is how I can embed the filename using Method 2 (< >)? The reason
I hate Method 1 (-o) is that it fails for large (~5G) files in Windows XP.
Thanks a lot!

@_subject: Non-ascii embedded filename 
Sorry for my last post. --set-filename sets the filename.
But it seems gpg has some problem with some Chinese characters. For =
it interprets '=82S' as '\x8S':=20
  gpg --set-filename "A=82S.txt" -e < d.txt > c.gpg
  gpg --use-embedded-filename -v c.gpg=20
  gpg: original file name=3D'A=82S.txt'
  gpg: error creating `A\x8S.txt': No such file or directory
Thanks for your attention.

@_subject: Can I see the checksum when I sign/verify a file? 
I wonder if I can actually see the sha1/md5 checksum when I sign/verify a
file. That is, when
  gpg -s -e somefile
  gpg -d somefile.gpg
is there an option to print out the checksum when signing/verifying the
file? (not --print-mds to calculate it again)
And how can I choose the hash method (sha1 or md5) when signing?
Thanks a million.

@_subject: List embedded filename 
I am wondering if it is possible add a command to list embedded filename,
for example, --list-filename. Currently, the only way I know to get the
embedded filename is to decrypt the whole file in verbose mode. Also, it
would be great if other information is embedded, say file size and
timestamp, and can be extracted easily.

@_subject: list-packets: raw data: unknown length 
If the size of an encrypted file is large, say, 5G, --list-packets will show
"literal data packet: raw data: unknown length" and does not show any
information of the next packet (signature packet). Is this a bug? There must
be some way for gpg to tell the length of a packet.
:pubkey enc packet: version 3, algo 16, keyid xx
:encrypted data packet:
:onepass_sig packet: keyid xx
:literal data packet:
