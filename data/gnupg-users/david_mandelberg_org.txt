@_subject: gpg-agent UI when waiting for smart card touch? 
I'm using gpg-agent with Yubikeys configured to require a physical touch before performing operations. Is there any way to get gpg-agent to display something on screen when it's waiting for me to touch the Yubikey? (Otherwise, I sometimes don't realize it's waiting for anything, and the operation times out.)
