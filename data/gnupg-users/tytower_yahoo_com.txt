I am trying to install GnuPg
I have the latest libgpg-error installed and have tried with various libraries from 1.11 up. I still get the below error message  on all of them . The script seems to look for " gpg-error-config"  script and I have checked and found it where it should be and the system can find it OK but the configure script appears not to recognise it Any help appreciated
*** You need libgpg-error to build this program.
**  This library is for example available at
***   ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgpg-error
*** (at least version 1.11 is required.)
configure: error: configure: error: *** Required libraries not found. Please consult the above messages
*** and install them before running configure again.

Further to my last email I ran the script  sh gpg-error-config --version and it gave 1.10  so this is why its not being accepted ?
I have installed version 1.13?  I don't know how this happens but what should i do to get an installation of gpg-error-config of 1.11 or greater ?
