@_subject: Passphrase in Perl script? 
How do you send the passphrase (for symmetric encryption) in a Perl
script on Windows (or in DOS batch file)?
On Windows, pipes are not a (real) option, AFAIK, and I'm not sure you
can pass DOS *.* results to gpg?
I want to prompt the user for the passphrase once and then encrypt all
files given a certain pattern. I did this in Perl, and currently, the
user is prompted twice for every file.
What I'm missing is how to send the passphrase in a variable to gpg.

@_subject: Passphrase from external program, script, or batch file 
Since there were no replies on how to send the passphrase via the
command line in Windows/DOS, how does it work on Unix?
I saw something like --passphrase-fd in the archive, but I don't
understand what it means or is really doing. Can anybody explain?
Maybe with that I can ask some Perl people how it might be done in Perl
on Windows.
Btw, I looked at the Perl modules for GPG and they all seem very Unix
specific, using pipes and forking which I don't think will work on
Windows. One module failed because it reads the Unix path variable, and
couldn't read the path on Windows correctly. Marcus Friedlaender

@_subject: Windows shell woes (was: Passphrase from external program...) 
Thanks, I understand how it works now. The only thing I've got working
on Windows is to use a file containing the passphrase. The script could
create a temporary file, but I don't feel too pleased about having a
password stored in a file at all. I guess one could encrypt the temp
file before it's written. This is it in Perl:
system "gpg.exe -o $file.gpg --passphrase-fd 0 -c $file < pass.txt";
Windows will only accept a file as input, grrr. Does anybody know how
to pass the input from stdin?
The only workaround I can think of is to piping through an fd...
I'll take a peek.
Yes please.

Replying to my own question.
I was given a simple way to send the passphrase for use in Perl
scripts. Here it is for the archives if nobody else needs it at the
open(PIPE, "| gpg.exe -o $file.gpg --passphrase-fd 0 -c $file") or die
print PIPE $passphrase;
Alternatively, Windows will pipe, it just wants an "echo" first. The
following is a system command via Perl.
echo $passphrase | gpg.exe -o $file.gpg --passphrase-fd 0 -c $file
You can adjust the variable syntax for other uses.
Btw, how about adding these kinds of examples to a FAQ document?

@_subject: [OT] U.S. encryption export regulations 
Hi, this is partly OT, but I think it's quite likely some of you may
have dealt with the issue. I have written a program using encryption
and wish to upload it to simtel.net. They adhere to U.S. export
restrictions. Do you know where I can find the facts on which methods
are allowed and to what key length?
On the subject, Werner once mentioned there's a small version of gpg
for software authors which they can ship with their programs. Does
anybody remember the details?

I'd like to use gnupg as an external encryption program for a shareware

gnupg. Is this okay license-wise?
Are there any commercial products using gnupg as a third-party utility?

I'm using a pipe.
I'd like to be sure about it though, is there a GNU or FSF list for

While on the subject, I'd like to support various external encryption
packages, so users can choose their favourite/most trusted one. Does
anybody have any recommendations of other encryption packages apart
from GnuPG and PGP?

@_subject: GnuPG Email reader... 
I just discovered Sylpheed, which runs on both Linux and Windows. How
about that, then you could both use the same reader. The Windows
version is available at:
There are English and German builds. I can't say how far it is in its
development, but I installed it today and sent and received mail. Nice
GUI. I've not setup use with GnuPG yet. It didn't recognise it
automatically, but I guess that can be fixed.
