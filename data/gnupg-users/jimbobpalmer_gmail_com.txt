@_subject: What is the benefit of signing an encrypted email 
In Firefox I can sign or encrypt or encrypt+sign an e-mail.
In what case would I want my encrypted emails also signed? Does it
provide any additional benefit over a pure encrypted email?

2011/1/11 Martin Gollowitzer :
So encrypting an e-mail only provides a guarantee that the recipient
can read the message. It provides no guarantees about the sender.
Signing the message guarantees the sender.
Okay, I understand this. The question is, why on earth is the default
for encrypted email not to sign too (I'm talking about anything that
talks to gpg, like thunderbird). I suppose this might take me off
and would dkim be enough instead of signing the encrypted e-mails?
