Hash: SHA512
I can only speak for myself.  I don't find the 1.4.x / 2.0.x version numbering
thing confusing at all.  They each serve a different purpose and a different
audience.  I note that, currently, 1.4.x needs to be patched to compile in
support for IDEA, while 2.0.x has it, and a lot of other capabilities already
I have compiled both on both GNU/Linux and Win32, and found that, as long as I
have the appropriate libraries, they both will compile and work correctly.  Of
course, I am a programmer, so I am used to separate versions of the same program.

Even though I would prefer not renaming anything (except maybe randomly
renaming all of the streets in big cities on a weekly basis...lol), I do have
an idea on what GnuPG 2.0.x could be called.
My idea is to call it GnuPG+ or GnuPG++, as each would show that it has more
capabilities than GnuPG 1.4.x.  The executable could be called 'gpg++', though
this would be close to g++ which is the GCC program for compiling c++ files.

I hate to tell you this, but the F.B.I. Computer Forensics Laboratory has
successfully recovered data from a drive, where the platters were shot multiple
times with a shotgun.
The only sure way to make sure no one can recover your data is to put it into a
blast furnace (this would be hot enough to melt the whole thing into a puddle,
and would cause substantial mixing between the ferro-magnetic alloy and the
titanium internal structure.

Hey, it wasn't an attack - just an observation...  Besides, if the information
you have is that sensitive, you probably work for a government (or against
one).  Certainly, I would agree that physical destruction of the drive is the
only certain means of making recovery of your data difficult, if not
impossible.  I'll leave the means up to those who want such a thing, as I don't...

Don't really know.  You'd have to ask the F.B.I.  Reducing the entire drive
(including the chips) to dust would probably do about what I suggested would.
That is, it would likely make it impossible for anyone to recover data from the
drive.  As would placing it in a nuclear reactor, and probably doing a thousand
other things.  I just like my method, because once it congealed, you'd have
modern art.  LOL.

Let's not confuse a *key* and a *passphrase*.  This discussion came up on the
Gentoo user forum not too long ago.  If you just have a key and you store it on
another disk (or flash drive, etc.), it would be possible for someone with
access to you, your home, and your computer to find the key and decrypt the
data.  It would be a tad hard to memorize a key or set of them - if they are
good, they are random.
Passphrases are the most insecure form of data encryption.  It *has* to either
be something you can remember, or it has to be stored somewhere.  Weak
passphrases mean that your data can be decrypted with more simple attacks
against your passphrase.  Even it is is strong, and can not conceivably be
cracked in, say 50 years, certain entities have methods of getting you to give
them the passphrase.
Oh, and one more thing.  If you encrypt your whole disk, you will need
something like a boot CD to be able to decrypt your drive and use it.

I agree, this is a purely theoretical discussion for me.  I don't have such
sensitive data on my drives to want to nuke them.
Ah, yes.  The obligatory warning.  One method that I suggested would get the
gold star for dangerous, foolhardy, do not do:  Placing your hard drive in the
core of an active nuclear reactor.  Acid is not safe either - I started off in
chemistry...  I would sooner use 30 M hydrochloric acid than sulfuric acid -
why?  It is easier to obtain - the problem is disposing of what is left, as if
you pour it down the drain, it will start corroding your sink (unless it is
ceramic), and your pipes.  Not a pretty picture.

As interesting as this discussion has become, I think it is time to let it end.
If anyone knows of any *good* shred utilities, I'd be interested.  I have one
final comment, XFS, Reiser and JFS are all journaling filesystems, and
shredding files on such systems is useless, since the file or a large part of
it can be recovered from the journal.  And if your data are so sensitive that
you need to totally destroy the disk to rid yourself of it, maybe you should
rethink what you are storing, eh?
Anyhow, I'd rather talk about gnupg.  The part of this thread talking about
whole disk encryption is actually closer to that topic than most of the other
things I've seen and said, since loop-aes can use gpg-encrypted passphrases and
that is one way to encrypt files and partitions on Linux-based systems.

Hash: SHA512
As has already been mentioned, this has nothing to do with salt.  It has to do
with the fact that the session key - used to encrypt the plaintext - is random,
so it will produce different ciphertext each time to encrypt a file.  This is a
good thing, as it makes it much harder to apply a certain type of attack on the
ciphertext.  I'm not sure why you would want to disable this security feature.
I will say that I wouldn't use an encryption program that did not use random
session keys.

Hash: SHA512
Hi Sven,
I agree with you, especially with cryptography, but with compression, as well.
 I am assuming that you are talking about filesystem errors and the degradation
of data on magnetic media.  This can mess a person up with image files -
especially compressed formats like JPEG and PNG, even without encryption added
to the mix.
That's why it would be a good idea, in my opinion, to use a public key pair,
and a weaker cipher than AES to encrypt data like family photos.  I would also
hash every file using a good hash algorithm, like SHA2, RIPEMD160, etc.
Additionally, I would keep at least 3 copies on HDD media, and replace your HDD
every 2 years or so, and copy everything to the new one (after testing it for
bad blocks, etc.), as well as storing it on optical media.  A good backup
schedule is essential for all data.  One last thing, I would recommend against
compressing the image files into .ZIP, or other archives - for JPG and PNG
files, they are already compressed and compression will likely only make them
larger.  For BMP files, I would suggest compressing each one separately with a
RAR format, with a recovery record.  If you use GnuPG, it will compress by
default and with the key pair suggestion, you can encrypt+sign each one
separately, so at most, you'll lose one or two files, rather than all of them.
Personally, I'd just keep them on removable media (like ZipDisks, CD/DVD+-R,
USB port hard disk drives, etc.), and view them from there.  It is not like
we're talking about information vital to national security, here...  I only
encrypt things I absolutely don't want others to see (personal financial,
medical, etc. information).
As for your worst case, you can end up with a file you cannot decrypt, if the
first part of the encrypted file is destroyed.  If the error is in the data
packet, most of the time, it will be detected, especially so if you sign it
with a your secret key.  In that case, the normal or average case will be that
you'll either lose one or more files, or they will be corrupted - possibly
still readable.  You would have to run some form of zipfix on the archive to
read it, though.

I did, later in my message.
I come from the early days of Fidonet, and BBS's.  It is possible for a CRC32c
checksum to show "OK" when there have been changes.  Has always been this way.
If you use an archiver to "archive" 200 files around 2 mb in length, then
encrypt the archive, you could easily lose all 200 files, if the session key is
lost.  Keeping the files separate and hashing them, would be a way to tell if
there are any problems.
The F.B.I. could recover data from your hard drive, as well - even if it
crashes.  Hard drive can crash within 1 or 2 years, especially if they get too
hot.  And just why is it overkill?  With the costs of hard drives coming down,
as they are, you can call it an upgrade.
Actually JPEG is older than 10 years, IIRC, but it is still lossy compression
followed by lossless compression.  ZIP is much older than 10 years old, and
offers far from the best compression.  JPEG-2000 is newer and can have better
compression than the original...  So far, even using experimental archivers, I
have not been able to reduce the size of a raw image file or raw music file to
the size of a JPEG (even set to almost no compression at all), or MP3 (set to
the highest bit rate).
So tell me, what compression software are *you* talking about?

@_subject: Hard Drive Prices... 
Just an FYI for the interested.  You can get USB/Firewire external hard disk
drives for between $60 and $90 US depending on where you go.  You can get
internal ones (EIDE or SATA) for $30 and up (I found a 500 GB HDD for $75 with
less than 2 minutes of searching online).  You can buy a case or converter to
use your internal HDD with USB or Firewire (this would make them cheaper).
I saw some nice RAID arrays for $300 and up, but no real hard disk drives.  The
cost would really depend on your storage needs (the fewer the GB and RPM, the
lower the price).  If you follow Werner's advice, you could reasonably store
that data on a thumb drive (or several of them, if you are paranoid).
PS:  I still recommend at least one for backup, because hard disk drives can
crash - I had it happen to me, and both times it happened in less than 2 years.

I thought I would start a new thread because of the thread confusion.  I first
want to say that I use Enigmail with Thunderbird, and check the To: and CC:
lines of any replies before I send my reply to any list, to avoid people
receiving unwanted private email from me.
On the issue of signing:  I do sign my messages, and have uploaded my public
keys to key servers, so they are available to check that no one has changed my
message.  In reply to the concept that it is meaningless, I will say that I
feel that it adds a layer of trust (perhaps more than one, if you have one or
more lines of trust to the poster) that the message was, in fact, posted by the
person signing it, and that person stands behind what they say.
OpenPGP's PGP/MIME vs. S/MIME:  I have always used Enigmail with Thunderbird on
Windows, and GNU/Linux systems (I dual boot, so I use both).  I do not use
S/MIME, have never done so, do not intend to start.
On inline vs. PGP/MIME signed messages:  I post to several lists, forums and
groups.  Some strip attachments, by default, and since my signature is sent as
an attachment when using PGP/MIME, it is stripped from my message.  Also, some
of my contacts have set ups that automatically strip attachments (e.g. my
signature).  Therefore, I decided that it is best for all to use the plain text
only type of posting and an inline signature so that everyone on all lists can
at least verify that I have taken the time to install GnuPG on my system,
generate a key pair with my name and email address, upload my public key to a
widely used key server, and enter my passphrase to sign the message.
Those are my thoughts on this matter.

Nothing, true.
However, I disagree with your statement that there is no way to check: one can
check the headers of each message to see from where they originated.  If one
says it came from (my email name @ my ISP) and originated from my ISP, and the
other shows a different origin, then the one showing a different origin would
be suspect, while the one showing an IP address from my ISP, and showing that
it came from my username, would be more able to be trusted.  If neither
originated from my ISP, then both are suspect.  That is, unless you met the
real me, verified that I am who I say I am, and signed my key - then it would
add some very strong trust if you had signed one of those keys.  If they both
came from my ISP, and neither was signed by you or someone you trust, they
would both be suspect.  Before you mention it, I know that headers can be
spoofed, however, I very much doubt that a troll or spammer would go to the
trouble of creating a key-pair in my name to sign messages, as well as the
trouble to spoof the headers.
That is your opinion, and I can respect that.  However, in showing the flaw in
your argument that "there is no way to check", I cannot agree with your
conclusion.  I could have understood and agreed with your argument if you had said:
1. I have never met you.
2. By the standard of trust I use, I have to meet you to sign your public key.
3. No one I have met, who uses my standard of trust, has signed your key.
Therefore, I do not know you well enough for your signature to have any meaning
to me.
To simply state that "the way you're going about it has some glaring and
obvious flaws", when the only argument you used against it has its own flaws,
does not meet my standard of logic in reasoned argument.
I am always open to logical arguments.  However, in using logic alone, one must
realize that two opposing logical arguments can be equally valid.  As for
arguing with a feeling, I see people doing that all the time and it's usually
not pretty. ;)
I do not believe there is *One True and Correct Answer* to this issue.  I do
feel it germane to point out that this IS the gnupg-users list, and if anywhere
would be appropriate to sign messages, it would be here.
P.S.  I could show a proof of concept very easily, to support my premise that
the headers can be used to check which one is valid.  However, it is a good
deal of work for me, and it is really up to you to refute my argument.

While it is generally considered good policy to use any cryptographic software on a computer you do not trust, given your reason for wanting to use GnuPG on the untrusted university computer, I have a suggestion.
Make a Live GnuPG USB thumb drive - make sure that you set the default path to be the USB drive, and not the HDD of the university computer.  Thus all of your keys would be on the USB drive and none on the untrusted computer.  If your private keys are already on the untrusted computer, then I can only suggest revoking them and creating new ones on a trusted computer - with the keyrings stored on the Live GnuPG USB drive.

It does, which is why I prefaced my suggestion with a warning against using an untrusted computer.  However, a keylogger alone, would not be enough to compromise a key on a Live USB drive.  That would give an attacker a passphrase without a secret key.  The attacker would need to find and copy the keyring files from the USB drive.
That could be defeated by using a Live CD/DVD of an arguably more secure kernel/OS, such as GNU/Linux or *BSD with the USB drive for storing the keyrings.  That way, so long as you trust the Live CD/DVD distribution, what is on the untrusted computer's HDD would not matter.

Hello Philipp,
You said that you do not trust the security of the university computer, so we were taking your assessment as a starting point.
Okay, I get that.  Presumably TOPSECRET is your own computer which you believe to be the most secure, and SECRET is the university computer.  My amended suggestion would provide the best security for both computers, however, it would likely be hard if not impossible to implement on a smart phone.
If you are using a smart phone to receive exams from students, there is a big security problem with that.  Especially, if you are using a proprietary OS.  I will let others explain why that is a bad idea, for the sake of brevity.
Other posters have answered with a way this can be done.  Create one key (for TOPSECRET presumably), and add subkeys for your phone and your university computer.  This would allow people to only have to sign one key, as you've As for security, any chain is only as strong as its weakest link - security is no different.  If others you do not trust have access to one of the devices (for example, SECRET), then that is the weakest link in the chain.  If you have your whole secret keyring on all three devices, then it is likely that an attacker who has physical access to SECRET would have access to your key any all subkeys, and would only need a simple keylogger.
One way to avoid this problem is to have your keyrings stored, with a strong passphrase (almost goes without saying), in one location a (potentially encrypted USB drive), and to access your mail, GnuPG and other necessary applications using a secure and trusted Live CD or DVD (e.g. Knoppix, or RIPLinuX).  This would avoid any security problems on computers, as long as you can access the network through the Live CD.  You clearly could not use a Live CD on a smart phone.  As long as you could carry the USB stick drive with you, and it was not stolen from you (especially if you encrypt the file systems on the USB stick drive), then the relative security of each computer would not matter, since anyone who got a hold of your USB stick drive would have to decrypt it before they could begin attacking your passphrase(s).
If CONFIDENTIAL is your smart phone, then you'd need at least two main keys, and one would have to be stored on the phone.  If it were a computer, my suggestion may be of some use to you.

Exactly.  My suggestion would grant more control over what may be run on a computer, and would keep the keys of from all the computers.  However, it is not a perfect fix - while it would likely defeat keyloggers on any of the computers, I can think of a few ways that an attacker who knows what you use to access your account to steal and use your key(s).
I am not familiar with the software used in Norway by universities.  I am only familiar with Blackboard, which is used by many universities in the USA, and I would not trust it for transmitting or receiving personal or confidential material.

No apology necessary.
I also must apologize, as my original reply got sent to Robert J. Hansen, when it was intended for the list.
This is true, and NATO countries have very specific and well defined ways of dealing with data with those titles, depending on the country.
I'll have to look that up and read up on it, when I have the time.
That was my conclusion, as well.  That is why I suggested the bootable GNU/Linux or *BSD Live CD  (with some vital tools on it, of course) and a USB thumb drive - with an encrypted filesystem for storing the keys (I'm not familiar with the smart card's capabilities, and as every smart card reader I have is non-functional, I cannot test it out).
My suggestion went beyond OpenPGP and GnuPG to try to solve the problem Philipp

Not likely in the near term...  Maybe in 5000 years or so, but by then I suspect computing as we know it will be ancient history (actually it *would* be)...
That's a LOT of zeroes.  Maybe my initial estimate was off by several dozen orders of magnitude...
LMAO!  I got a good laugh out of this one.  Thanks, I needed that...

Believe it or not, I did read your message.  I did not mean to accuse you of telling him to post elsewhere or that it was off-topic for the list.  I am sorry if you got that impression. I just feel the the issue is very important, and needs to be "shouted from the roof tops", as the saying goes.
Again, my message was nothing personal against you.  I just thought I'd provide more information on the bug.
My message has not shown up on the list, yet.  Is the list moderated, or is it just an issue of a reply to a message showing up before the actual message does?

@_subject: Heartbleed attack on Openssl / Pertinent?  I say yes. 
You're right in the respect that this list is only for GnuPG and OpenPGP RFC However, the Heartbleed vulnerability is such a pervasive Internet security issue that everyone needs to be made aware of it, so that they may become educated on it.  In my experience, the majority of Internet users take for granted that their Internet banking, shopping, and all other "secure" uses of the Internet are, in fact, truly *secure*.  This vulnerability affect the entire SSL of the Internet (since the majority of clients and servers use OpenSSL) - that makes every site vulnerable to spoofing, and everyone who uses the Internet for any secure transactions vulnerable to identity theft.
This bug *should* have been reported across the whole Internet when it was discovered about 2 years ago, but even now, no one wants to talk or hear about it anywhere.
Imagine if ALL companies that produce locks, safes, and provide home security had a security problem that would allow anyone who knew about the problem to anonymously get keys (or even master keys) to any lock, and to override any home security system, and get the combination to any safe.  How would you protect your home and valuables then?  That is the type of problem that Heartbleed is, and it IMO needs to be posted EVERYWHERE, so that people can at least try to protect themselves.

I, for one, admit that I am not an expert on OpenSSL.  *IF* I were, I would be posting on the OpenSSL mailing lists about the bug.
I doubt that ANYONE, including the OpenSSL community and developers know just how serious this bug has compromised the general security of the Internet, or what sites were actually (not theoretically could be) compromised.  There is just not enough information to make any definitive statements on that issue, and there probably never will be given all of the other bugs (known and unknown) that can compromise a server's security.
As for regular users, from what I've read, there is really no additional risk to what you face from spyware, keyloggers, other malware and upstream bugs. That is UNLESS you either use a vulnerable version of OpenSSL with a data storage / encryption application to store site user names and passwords, credit vulnerable version of OpenSSL.
In any case, I have to agree with you, Robert, the best place for information is the official heartbleed site and the OpenSSL mailing lists.

I tried to post a message on that certain bug to this list yesterday, and it has never shown up.  I had two sources that suggested that said bug is far more severe than most people think.  So this message is a test.

So, is there a keyword block on the name of that bug?  This message posted, but the other one (I tried posting it twice - once yesterday, and once today), never showed up.

The discussion on the Heatbleed bug has apparently stopped here, and just about everywhere else, but I found (courtesy of another mailing list), some more reports on it, that you may have not seen.  These reports suggest the the NSA knew about and exploited the bug for "at least" two years, and may have even worked to stop it from being reported and fixed.

The NSA, or course, denies any knowledge, or exploitation of the bug, but you can read the article and make your own decisions on that.

Are you the list owner?  Did you put a "subject line block" on this list?  If so, you should have said so, if not, then the list owner should have said so.
I do NOT believe that this is off topic for this list, if the list owner believes that it is, and put such a block in place, that was the list owner's responsibility to tell everyone on list not to post about it anymore on THIS list.
And finally, no.  My messages not showing up on this list did not give me any clue as to the list owners' intentions, as it could've been a problem with the email getting to the list.

It is not just this list.  That message has not shown up on other lists I have posted it to.
Well, you can read the links and decide for yourself if they have any value.
As the Great One, Doug Barton stated (paraphrasing), this topic is totally off-topic for this list, and I have violated the owners' wishes by posting on it, and, of course I should have known this, and not even tried to post on this topic on this list.

I tend to agree, actually.  As to Snowden, how exactly could a private contractor have that level of security clearance, anyway?  I said that the report "suggests" NSA involvement - not that I agree.  The anonymous sources are a major problem for believability.  The NSA has gotten a lot of bad press lately, and it looks to me like Bloomberg (not the best source of information, in general, IMHO) has jumped on the bandwagon.
Since I have NO security clearance with the NSA, I cannot comment on any involvement, and I doubt anyone on this list, or the 'sources' have such clearance to comment on it, either.  So, I retain my disbelief.
Note:  I only wanted to post those articles for people to be able to read and make up their own minds.  I will post no more here on this bug.
