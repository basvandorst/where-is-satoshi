@_subject: use of --passphrase-fd in batch symmetric encryption 
page, faq, and other docs at the gnupg site, to no useful avail. I can't seem to figure out how to symmetrically encrypt a batch of files at once, using the same passphrase, and entering the passphrase only once for the whole batch. I tried the following (and I am no pearl programmer, beware):
 -w
open ( FILE  , '</home/cbinkle1/.gnupg/pass' ) or die "Can't find passfile\n";
$j = fileno FILE;
 = glob "$ARGV[0]";
$numberofelements = for  ( $i = 0; $i <= $numberofelements - 1; $i++) {
close  FILE;
Reading passphrase from file descriptor 3 ...
  (and then stops for me to enter the passphrase from the xterm, for each file passed thru to the perl script - it is not being read from the file opened and specified in the --passphrase-fd file descriptor argument).  Apparently I do not grasp the subtleties of using this argument.
PS- I don't really want to use public key encryption for this task, and I know I will need to encrypt the password file ("pass") except when being actively used for encryption / decryption.  I have gnupg V 1.04, which came with my mandrake 8.
--Bill   -thanks!
