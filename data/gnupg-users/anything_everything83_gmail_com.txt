@_subject: How can I send a public key exported with --armour option? 
Hello everybody, I'm a beginner of Gpg and encryption's world in general,
so I apologize if my questions will be so banal.
I created a new pair of public-private keys and now I'm trying to export
the public one.
I read the "How-To" and it describe the more useful option --armour. I
can't understand how to send a ASCII text print on my screen to an other
Is not more useful the --output options?
Thanks a lot to everybody!

I'm glad to know that. :-) Yep, another thing... My English is scholastic, so not always I will be clear in my exposition, I also apologize of that. Anyway you are right, Gnupg recognize only "armor" :-) Perfect, this is what I needed! We are talking of some Kbytes, I think this cost will be absolutely sosteinable ;-) Thank you for All

@_subject: Some doubts about signature procedure 
Hi, here I come back to ask you some clarification about the signature
The purpose of signature procedure is making sure of anybody can't modify
the file you're trying to send.
Many times they use also the check of Md5sum or SHA512Sum, but anyway my
question is:
if any spiteful person succeed in tapping a file transmission of mine, he
surely succeed in signing the modified file. So how can my addressee
realize of that?
In other words, if this spiteful person succeed in replacing a modified
file in a server he also succeed in replacing also the signature file,
doesnt' he?
In this case I can't understand the benefit of signing procedure.
I'm sorry if my exposure was not as good as an english professor :p but I
promise next times it wil be better and better.
Thank you for your patience.
