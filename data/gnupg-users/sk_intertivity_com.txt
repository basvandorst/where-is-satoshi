Hi everyone,
I have WinXp SP2 and gnupg 1.4.0a (compileted myself using MinGW).
Why is --yes not always working. I used following call:
gpg --dry-run --yes --default-key XYZ --passphrase-fd 0 --command-fd 0
--status-fd 2 --sign-key ABC
It still asks me "Really sign all user Ids?" or "Really sign?".
Is it a security reason or my own stupidy :) ?

If your wall is 100 meters (i dont how to calculate in foot) high,

Well, i have an automated system where you are able to define some policies
e.g. use just AES256 for encryption.
Now, my system has to check whether or not the key i use to encrypt is able
to do AES256.
Will i see that the public key (i probably will not have the secret key) is
able to do AES256?

@_date: 2005-06-01 21:56:30
@_author: Kiefer, Sascha 
@_subject: Pref 
Not really. Only if i change the pref for the key i use.
My system is similar to the PGP universal system which runs on a server.
Let's think about SHA-1. Right now, it will be the preferred hash alg
for most of the keys. But it's broke, so the administrator what's to
use RIPEMD instead. Instead of changing all prefs of all keys, he just
sets the policy, that RIPEMD is the preferred algorithm (or maybe sets that at least SHA256 must be used and keys that do not support it will
Not be used)
Get the point?
But maybe there is a easier way.
There are so many switches, maybe i'm missing something.

@_date: 2005-06-02 01:17:48
@_author: Kiefer, Sascha 
@_subject: Pref 
Of course.
What i did is the following.
The administrator as the option to rearange the supported algorithms
of gnupg. By the default the order may be like
3DES, CAST5, BLOWFISH, AES, AES192, AES256, TWOFISH
But the policy forces him to have the following order
TWOFISH, AES256, AES192, AES, -3DES, -CAST5, BLOWFISH   (the minus means,
that this algorithm should not be used at all).
Now, A sends an email to B and the capavilities of B's public key are
AES, IDEA, BLOWFISH, AES192, BLOWFISH
Now my program will encrypt the mail using AES192 (because it is the highest
algorithm forced by the policy which is accepted by B
In the cas the public key supports only
IDEA, 3DES
my program will raise an error because the those algorithms are not
permitted by the policy

Of course, on a 32-bit maschine, the size of a ptr is 4 which is the same as
the size of a DWORD but i think you meant
(*add) ( &minimumWorkingSetSize,
(*add) ( &maximumWorkingSetSize,
Line 691:
(*add) (&performanceCount, sizeof (&performanceCount), requester);
Here you just add LowPart of the LARGE_INTEGER (which makes sense since it
changes the most)
but then I would prefer
(*add) (&performanceCount.LowPart, sizeof (performanceCount.LowPart),

@_subject: OT: Salted Hashes and dictionary attacks 
I'm i right:
We calculate the salted hash d of the password p and the salt s using the
hash-function H like this:
d = H( p + s ) + s
This will have the affect that d != H( p + s' ) + s' (only if s != s') but
will not protect us against a dictionary attack since
we can easily precompute H( w_i ) where w_i is the ith word of our
dictionary and then just have to validate d == H( H( w_i ) + s ) !?!

@_subject: Detached signature that is not one 
I wrote an programm, which automatically decrypt/verifies incoming parts of
an email.
Actually, works pretty good. I just parse the mail, decompose it in several
files, give it gpg,
verify output and rebuild the email.
Today there was this spam email. It only had an body which gpg recognized as
an detached signature
and asked me for the datafile. Which of course, i didn`t have. Please find
the body of the email attached.
Is this a bug in gpg? (tried ver. 1.4 and 1.4.7)
How can i prevent gpg to ask for the datafile but just failing?
Thank you for answers.

i actually use "--status-fd 1" but there is nothing on that that tells me that something is waiting for the datafile. in that case i would just handle that status and kill gpg if i dont have any datafile.

Hi peter,
i'm not aware of all file formats but you should stick with PKCS format
for symmetric encryption.
It's an open standard, so I'm sure openssl and windows encryption can handle

I back-up my photos to remote storage. At the moment I don't encrypt
them - I don't understand encryption and I'm nervous of using something
I don't understand. They're just family snaps, but I'd prefer they
stayed private. Symmetric encryption seems a good route - all I have to
remember is a single password (the only risk seems to be senility).
However, who knows what OS or tools I'll be using in the future? I ran a
few tests encrypting and decrypting using the same algorithm/password
but different tools (gpg, openssl, mcrypt). They were unsuccessful. My
question is do I always have to use the same tool to decrypt as I used
to encrypt? Are the file formats tool specific? Is the way the tool
derives a key from the "key" I input variable? Probably there are other
issues I'm unaware of. I'd feel more comfortable knowing that recovery
of my data wasn't dependent on the availability of a specific tool (or
even worse a specific version of a tool).
Hope this is clear,

Yes, that is right.
Asymmetric encryption is a slow process. Encrypting the whole message would
take forever.
So, symmetric keys a quite small, that's why the described technique is
Hash: SHA1
Someone today shook my understanding of asymmetric ciphers.
_Bob performs symmetric encryption on message with_
_key "K" (generated randomly). He then encrypts "K" _
_with Alice's public key, and sends both the symetrically _
_encrypted message and asymmetrically encrypted key to Alice_
Is this what happens during most/some/all of public-key
communications? I had always thought that the message is encrypted
with public key, and decrypted with secret key. I was not aware that
key "K" was encrypted with public key, but message encrypted with
