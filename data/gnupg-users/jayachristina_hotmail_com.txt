@_subject: 1024 or 2048?? 
Hi all,
I posted this qn b4 and i am sorry abt this MIME format and all that in the
prev mail. And so i am posting it again.
Will using a 2048  bit key offer more security than a 1024 bit key.. or is
it not going to make any difference??

@_subject: GnuPG + Java 
Hi *,
The following code is giving an error
        usage: gpg [options] [filename]
        when the -r is jaya christina in double quotes.
When I give same in single quotes also I get the same error.Same error for
without quotes.Any idea anybody??
If the -r is a single name in double or single quotes like 'jaya' the error
is : A recepient with name "jaya" is available.
        gpg: 'Kalibra'--armor: skipped: public key not found
        gpg: input.txt: encryption failed: public key not found
import java.io.*;
public class GnuPGTest{
 public static void main(String[] arg){
      Process p;
          try{
               String exec = "gpg -r Kalibra On
Web --armor --yes --batch --output output.gpg --encrypt input.txt"  ;
               p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(exec);
               p.waitFor();
               InputStream is = p.getErrorStream();
               String stream = "";
               while(is.available()!=0){
                    stream += (char)is.read();
               }
               System.out.println(stream );
              }catch(Exception io){
                   System.out.println("Error creating process. IOException
encrypt" + io);
              }

@_subject: GnuPG + Java + JNI 
Hi all.
Basically I intend to use Java + GnuPG using JNI.
It will be of much help if someone could help me with this tiny problem  I
have here.
I need to know where I can get the source files which drive GnuPG on
windows. I assume I can get them from the CVS.But I dont understand which
specific files are required...And which is the main file which actually does
the work(like calling other sub.files)
something like the public Java class with the -***public static void
main(){}*** method.
Or is there no methods which can be directly called as encrypt(*,*) and
decrypt(*,*) etc.... and I might have to access the files in a different
Any pointers wud be of great help.
Or if anyone has any library as such for the same Help plz..
Thanx and ciao
