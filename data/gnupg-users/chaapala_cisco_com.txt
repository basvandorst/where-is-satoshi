@_subject: Format errors on key blocks 
Content-Disposition: inline
When I upload one of my keys to wwwkeys.us.pgp.net, I get notice of a
format error:
  Key block corrupt: more than one signature on subkey
The key in question has the 1024D key, and 1024g key, as usual.  I also
added a 2048G key.  There are two UIDs also associated with the entry,
which happens to be 1024/C89240AD (signing this message).
I've also been told by someone running PGP that they couldn't encrypt
to this key, so I imagine this could be related.
I've done all my keywork with GNUPG.
Info or pointers to info on this would be much appreciated.
