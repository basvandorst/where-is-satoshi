@_subject: What happens to the original files after encryption? 
i'm going to encrypt sensitive data with gpg and i'm unsure about the  way it handles the original files. Does it securely wipe or just  shallowly remove them?
Can I trust gpg that the only oddment is the encrypted file?
Thanks  a lot,
