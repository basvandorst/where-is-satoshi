@_subject: GPG self signature missing error 
Hi All,
I have GNUPG versions 1.2 and 1.4 installed on two servers A and B
I got a gpg key from a client, i imported it on Server B with out any error
messages and I am able to encrypt and decrypt data.
but on server A iam getting many errors.
gpg: key DFEB876D: no valid user IDs
gpg: this may be caused by a missing self-signature
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:           w/o user IDs: 1
then i tried usr/local/bin/gpg --homedir /root/.gnupg --allow-non-selfsigned-uid --import
client_name.pkr this time it worked..
but when i try to encrypt the data it is giving me an error
usr/local/bin/gpg --homedir /root/.gnupg --output a.txt.gpg "gpg_key"
--encrypt a.txt
gpg: missing self-signature
i don know why it is behaving like this.. bcoz on B i have no such issues.
is this bcoz of the version differences? is there anyother command to solve
this error. or do i need to upgrade the gpg version on A? please advice.

@_subject: gpg trust from command line 
I have done the trusting part automated on my linux box like the following.
Give a try anyways and let me know whether it was helpful or not. I did many
google search and could not find any method described for this. The
following method worked gr8 for me and is the one which I created myself
For trusting it as 3, use 4 and for 5, use 6 and so on...
   1. gpg --import key.pk - Import your key
   2. echo $(gpg --list-keys --with-fingerprint --with-colons | tail -2 |
   head -1 | tr -s ":" ":"| cut -d ":" -f2):4: > /tmp/somefile1 - take the
   finger print and copy to a temp file.
   3.  gpg --import-ownertrust < /tmp/somefile1 - import the finger print to
   the trust data base. Done!!!!
You can check the trusting part by typing the below command
   1.  gpg --export-ownertrust

@_subject: Digitally Sign a key 
Hi GPG Experts,
I have a request from one of my client that they need me to digitally sign
their files in my server with my gpg key after encrypting it with their key.
I am not familiar with this. ie encrypting a file with a key and digitally
sign it with another key.
The process that we are trying to perform is to encrypt the file with the
customer?s public key and then sign the file with our private key.
Can any body from this group help me in finding a way?
