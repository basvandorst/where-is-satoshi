Having perceived others as dishonest people who would steal your money
(which in this context is simply information held by the bank), it is
inconsistent to trust them not to steal the rest of your information.
But if I use a postcard, there's no notepaper to pay for. And in some
countries postage is cheaper for postcards. I think most people use
envelopes because they perceive it as the common practice.
Envelopes require no tools to open, so they barely inconvenience the
recipient. The envelope is analogous to a self-decrypting message that
the recipient can trivially open on their PC or phone without
installing any special tool.

Since key compromise is possible however careful you intend to be,
isn't it better for the non-expiring main key to have the minimum
possible capability set?
There is no real limitation here. If a need arose for "higher
security" signing or encryption keys, new subkeys with those
capabilities could be created and circulated, and the secret subkeys
stored offline just like the main key.
Maybe because encryption uses the public key, so no passphrase or PIN
would be required?
Really? In many countries it is traditional for one or or both
partner(s) to change their name on marriage. And it is not all that
rare for people to change their name at other times for personal or
professional reasons.
But it could happen. How do you know what email addresses and domain
names will look like in several decades? Or whether somebody may offer
to purchase your domain name for a vast sum of money? Or whether you
may at some point forget to renew the domain, or have it stolen from
you by illicit action on behalf of some corporate or government
That strikes me as good advice even if your main key is not stored
Sounds like a sensible precaution if work policy allows.

Convenience. (Which is often the opposite of security.)
They can, and some people routinely are (such as solicitors who use

It sounds like you value the flavour of privacy that could be afforded
by a scheme involving the use of hashes in UIDs to protect names and
email addresses. Such a scheme would (for example) allow somebody with
one of your email addresses to locate your key, but would not allow
somebody to devine your names or email addresses by inspecting your
key. An extension would be required to allow GnuPG to locate keys
using both the hash and the plaintext string simultaneously.
Suggestions like this tend to get lambasted because they do not
enhance security, and privacy appears to be seen as unimportant.

Or do I send the hash to one keyserver and the plaintext to another,

Definitely limited; I think of it as little more than a

As I see it, you either:-
include the UIDs in non-human-readable form (e.g. hashed) in the key

or you distribute UIDs separately from their key.

Is "without requiring any extensions" a necessary requirement?
If a solution were feasible that required an extension or a local
proxy to handle the keyserver queries, why should it be discarded?
Why would a spammer network bother to generate email addresses and
submit them as keyserver queries, rather than just sending spam out to
them all?
I guess the day *could* arrive when we start receiving spam that is
encrypted to the right key(s) for the email address(es) it goes to,
but I currently see that more as a possibility than a probability.
I think that what you say is impossible, is more than I am looking for
from this scheme. That strength of protection would be brilliant but
rather pointless in the context.
Lets assume for a moment the goal you have stated above has been
reached, including an airtight solution to the key enumeration issue.
What do we really have? I have names and email addresses in blinded
User IDs on my key and they are believed to be safe for a long time
given the current technology.
For want of a better analogy, the names and email addresses readable
from User IDs on the keyservers are akin to listings in the phone
book. The names and email addresses that cannot be read because they
are obscured in blinded User IDs are akin to unlisted phone numbers.
There is a certain level of protection afforded by choosing not to have
your number listed, but you can still tell anybody the number yourself
and they might accidentally or deliberately pass it on.
I don't know.
For telephone numbers, as I posted in a thread here in July 2010, the
owners of 78% of the non-business landline numbers in my address book
at the time had made the effort to not have their numbers listed in
the phone books. Mobile phone numbers are unlisted by default; not a
single person had arranged a listing for their non-business mobile.

Is the idea that email addresses in the latter form contain
enough entropy to render enumeration infeasible, so they could
usefully be hashed and the digest placed in a UID? If so, it is a
small enough price to pay.
The scheme to use the fingerprint in the email address is interesting
because it neatly avoids the need for keysigning. I'm not sure what it
adds towards obscuring searchable information in UIDs - does the fact
that the fingerprint is known for the specific key mean it doesn't
really add much entropy? Or is the point that searching on the email
address doesn't find the key, you have to search for the fingerprint
(and the UID doesn't contain the email address at all, not even
The requirement I stated (or thought I had) was that the email address
(or name) could not be determined from the UID but searching a
keyserver for the email address (or name) would find the key.
Using the fingerprint is an interesting workaround. Would a search for
"dkg--noenum-0EE5BE979282D80B9F7540F1CCD2ED94D21739E9 at fifthhorseman.net

Random spamming is quite another thing from actually knowing an
individual's personal contact details: their email addresses, the
names they use, which email address is used with which name.
At least they are calling random numbers rather than specifically
targeting you personally.
In the UK, these unsolicited calls are massively reduced by
registering the number with the telephone preference service. You
still get occasional calls from organisations not covered or not
complying, and you get some silent calls because some callers'
equipment checks the numbers they generate against the list only if
the call is answered. I believe you have something similar in the US

Is there a GnuPG command to show the number of keys on a keyring?
Or one which includes this as part of its output?
I have looked through the gpg.man file and also at the output from
gpg --dump-options for this and nothing leaps out at me.
I know there are GUI frontends that show this info in their key
management windows, but wondered if there is a GnuPG command to get it

Thanks Rob. On PGPNET I was also given the answer
"gpg --export -a|gpg --import"
which gives me an answer more directly on Windows than your way does.

And your comment in a post on another thread, saying there's a
grep-like tool on Windows, prompted me to do a little research in that
direction. It seems (at least on Windows XP) a broadly equivalent
command is:-
gpg --with-colons --list-keys|find /c "pub:"
I could not find a way to check the string "pub:" was at the start of
the line, so the figure will be inaccurate as a key count in the event
any user-ids contain that string.
Thanks to everybody who helped me with this question.

The OP was maybe referring to the comment in UIDs of the form
Name (Comment) .
The comment can only be added when creating the UID. If you wish to
add, remove or edit you can create a new UID and set it as primary. If
the key has not been shared, you can delete the old UIDs, but if it is
already on the keyservers the copies there cannot have bits removed.

Yes. But once you have added OxDECAFBAD as a designated revoker, any
person with access to the private key of OxDECAFBAD needs no further
input from you or your private key to generate a revocation
certificate for your key.

For me, GPGshell runs on my (Windows XP) computer but GPA doesn't.
GPA appears to install but when I try to run it, I get a message about
a fatal error in GPGME Library.
(invoked from ... confdialog.c, line 1447:) Line too long The application will be terminated.
(sometimes the error message says "unsupported protocol" instead of
"line too long" but it always references confdialog.c line 1447)
I just downloaded and installed the version packaged with
gpg4win-light-2.1.0, and it gives me the same error ("line too long")
as with the version I tried in 2009.

Thank you for the suggestion.
If I am reading correctly, that is applied in GPA version 0.9.2, which
is the GPA version included with GPG4Win version 2.1.1-beta1. I just
downloaded this beta version and installed, but unfortunately I still
get the same error message on attempting to run GPA.

an hour ago. (-;
I have installed gpg4win twice in the last few days and my GnuPG
1.4.12 and keyrings etc. appear to have been unaffected by the
installation, removal, installation. Your mileage may vary, so
probably a wise precaution to back things up first.

Doesn't GnuPG list them all? Or did you mean in a GUI key manager?
At least one email client does: The Bat! passes the email address in
angle brackets to GnuPG for key selection. If more than one key
matches, you get a choice. And if the email in the UID is not
surrounded by angle brackets, it does not match.

Routinely encrypting *all* communications would transform the "chore"
into an habitual routine that requires little-to-no intellectual
effort in respect of each individual message sent or file stored. The
value of the encryption would then greatly exceed the effort.
In a surprisingly short time, the "burden" of which you speak would
become barely noticeable.

Searching is not an insurmountable problem: some email clients
(including The Bat!) manage to search in encrypted messages - but you
have to have the passphrase cached at the time (and can only cache one
How is spam any more of a problem in a scenario where all messages are
Creating or restoring?
Some will lose (access to) data through carelessness and/or
misfortune. Two choices: multiple secure backups of the private key
stored in different locations, or don't bother encrypting. Hmm. Which
of the two should we promote?

Fair enough. To me, a problem that is "surmounted" by an effective
solution or work-around ceases to be a problem.
I guess it depends what speeds you are used to. I expect about three
minutes to search around 65,000 messages (including around 3000
encrypted) at home using The Bat!, and a little longer at work to
search through 2000-3000 unencrypted messages using Outlook.
Brilliant! Makes it harder for the service provider who is trying to
censor your mail. Although, the headers are still plaintext...
Most of the spam I receive is pretty obvious from subject line alone.
Google's spam filtering would still have all the headers to work off.
Anyway, I would anticipate spam volumes to be lower if all messages
were encrypted. Would the spammers invest the cpu cycles to encrypt
their messages to each and every recipient? Unless they did it in
fairly small batches, the size of the ciphertext block would be
another spam indicator as they soon grow very large (look at the size
of the messages on PGPNET encrypted to about 40 keys). If they didn't
encrypt at all, their messages would stick out like sore thumbs
because everything else was encrypted. And encrypting the messages but
sending to lots of people who were not included in the encryption
would be completely pointless, since those who can't decrypt it can't
reply or click on links.
I can't say whether or not we should, but most of us spend our lives
promoting things.
At times I recommend things like restaurants, films, holiday destinations, pubs,
books, nightclubs, bands. Nobody elected me for that either

A good point well made.
I take your point, if you look at the strict grammatical meaning of
the two versions. However, I have always heard the second form used
much more than the first, and in my experience people generally do not
appear to perceive it as rude. Rather, it seems to be accepted as a
vernacular shorthand for "You should go to this restaurant: they have
wonderful seafood which I really liked, and feel that you might also
like if you are into seafood."
I disagree. I would say it presumes that the person/people releasing
the software are capable of forming an opinion as to what they
consider to be "safe and sane."

I do not harbour any such doubt. I also don't see how they might be
