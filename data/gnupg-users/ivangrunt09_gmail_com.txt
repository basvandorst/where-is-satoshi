Have you tried to do this without --batch and --passphrase?
Is there any change?

This doesn't resolve the problem of the device being compromised as soon
as it is plugged into a compromised system. There is a lot of malware
that will copy itself to any disk that gets plugged in the instant it is
plugged in.

BSD might have too high a learning curve for most ordinary people. A
custom BSD distro targeted at non-technical people would be useful here.
Perhaps one which took Security and Privacy into account as design goal.
Staying away from flash would be easier if all these people who think
they are web developers would stop using it.

@_subject: searching for keys 
Hash: SHA1
When I search for a key via browser on [1] I get an unencrypted answer
from [2]. This happens for some keys that are onlyavailable on some
servers. The problem is that the info, whose key I am
searching is presented to sniffers in plaintext. I think the encrypted
pool should not forward to unencrypted web interfaces.
[1] [2]  also uses SSL. Is your main t that someone will
see the keys you are looking for or retrieving?
If this is the case then why not have them send them to you encrypted via

Perhaps you should just forward the information in a friendly manner
to the legal departments of all the involved vendors :)

The longer a key is in use the greater the chance of compromise. Just
because you believe it has not been compromised doesn't make it so. By
regenerating keys every so often you drastically lessen the chances of a
key being compromised or of a possible compromise having as much effect
on you. There is a reason things like IPSEC keys are renegotiated after
so many minutes or after so many bytes are transmitted. :)

I have never had any issues moving keys between boxes. In fact I moved my
keys just last week to a box at work.
What exactly is the nature of the problem?
