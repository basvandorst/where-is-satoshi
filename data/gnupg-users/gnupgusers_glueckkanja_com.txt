Glueck & Kanja is very pleased to announce a completely new technology =
based on the OpenPGP and S/MIME standards. To make a long story short: =
We are introducing a virtual keyserver concept and key generation based =
on e-mail traffic analysis. =20
We are posting these news to the GnuPG Users List because we would like =
to start a discussion about this approach and because we are looking for =
corporations wanting to take part in an early bird program. We view the =
new technology as an addition, not a full replacement, of end-to-end =
security, allowing organizations to implement cost-effective e-mail =
security for everyone. Here are the first few paragraphs of the press =
Self-Learning CryptoEx Gateway Introduced
Offenbach, December 18th, 2002 - Glueck & Kanja Technology AG, one of =
Germany's leading manufacturers of security solutions, today announced a =
new product range that will revolutionize the security market for PKI =
solutions. By using a self-learning gateway, all employees of an =
enterprise can immediately take part in PKI-based encryption and =
signature of e-mails. The solution takes information from the =
enterprise's standard communication to automatically generate and =
certify personalized keys for each employee. Each user can send and =
receive OpenPGP and S/MIME encrypted messages straight after the =
installation of the new technology on a single server, without =
increasing the effort for content scanning and virus protection.=20
Conventional decentralized e-mail encryption is mostly just deployed in =
highly sensitive departments that require end-to-end security. CryptoEx =
Gateway provides a cost-effective alternative that makes encryption =
usable for entire corporations. =20
The big difference of the CryptoEx Gateway compared to a conventional =
gateway solution is that it does not require a manual administration of =
keys using a certificate authority. Instead, it works by automatically =
processing all operations, especially the key generation and =
certification. In other words: The key pairs are generated on demand =
rather than having to be maintained manually and in advance by an =

Quite correct, the user will get a "bounce" e-mail when no key is found =
if the gateway is configured to only let out encrypted e-mails. This =
bounce e-mail is similar to the ones you get when the e-mail address is =
incorrect. The company can include customized information on how the =
user should proceed.=20
However, most corporations will only enforce encryption to domains where =
keys are available. It would be foolish to mark a domain as "must =
encrypt" if no or few keys are available. Instead, the administrator can =
flag the domain with "encrypt if possible", so the e-mail could go out =
plaintext if no key is found. However, if the user has marked the e-mail =
to be encrypted (e.g. by including the word "encrypt" in the subject =
line), the mail must be encrypted and MUST NOT leave the corporation as =
Of course, the corporation must decide on what it wants to implement and =
what makes sense before configuring the gateway, otherwise a badly =
configured gateway would be quite a pain for the users. However, if =
configured wisely, the gateway provides an easy and cheap way to offer =
encryption for all users of an enterprise.=20
The way I see it, the gateway solution should be installed for the =
"masses" to enable them to send one or two e-mails without effort at low =
cost while the "heavy users" should still rely on a client-side =
installation which offers more usability by definition.=20
