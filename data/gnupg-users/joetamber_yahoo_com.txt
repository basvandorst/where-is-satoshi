@_subject: PGP decryption and "built-in" integrity checking? 
Hello all,
Let's assume a file was encrypted with PGP, and then subsequently transmitted to another system over the internet. During the transmission, one byte from the PGP file was dropped off... the recipient received everything except one byte from this PGP encrypted file.
When the recipient tries to decrypt the file, would the PGP software detect that there was a data integrity issue and produce an error - or - would it actually output a decrypted file (which I presume would be flawed, since the encrypted source file was missing a byte)?
Thanks in advance for any insight you can provide,
Joe
