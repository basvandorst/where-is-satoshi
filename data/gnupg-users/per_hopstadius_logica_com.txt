Hi David
Thanks for an excellent answer, that made it much clearer for me
We will check if our key has the MDC flag and see if PGP 7.1 has support for
MDC or not.
If not, then we will to use the --no-mdc-warning Otherwise we have to enable the MDC flag on our key and replace the old one.

This has been discussed before and I have an question referring to this.
Short summary:
A customer encrypts data with our public key, we receive the file and we
attempt to decrypt it. The decrypt step seems to work but we get a warning
message while validating the file (gpg: WARNING: message was not integrity
protected).  The question is how to avoid the warning message.
After reading the forum I believe this has to do with mdc, that mdc is not
forced in this case and that is causing the warning message.
I would like to know how you enable mdc. Do I tell the customer to force mdc
or is that controlled from my side, automatic controlled depending on what
cipher method I use? We run GPG version 1.4.9 and customer PGP 7.1
Please advice a noob
