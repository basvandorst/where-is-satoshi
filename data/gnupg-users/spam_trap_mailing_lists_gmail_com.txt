Hi Juergen,
So, yesterday the device arrived and today it was picked up at the DHL bus.
I am really excited about this little MicroPC! It has the highest quality
finishing and looks and feels better than one might expect from the photos.
So 1A quality! The MicroPC is also quite fast, because Ubuntu Mate starts
quickly and you can work smoothly, even in the dark, because the keyboard
is illuminated.
Once time permits, I will install some packages and do further testing.
Best regards

Hi all,
while playing with hashcat, diceware passphrases and entropy
checkers I thought why not try to create a little program that
you can input your passphrase and it gets converted to a random
chars string (40 chars), based either on sha256+base91 or
ripemd-160 output.
The idea here is to use phrases which makes no sense but
can easily been remembered and then get converted so that
you always have IMHO good random input for GnuPG.
For that task I created two little Golang programs which
asks the user to input a phrase that makes no sense and
while the user is typing in his passphrase bullets are
displayed, like in pinentry, and then the random 40 chars
get copied to the clipboard, so that users can paste
the passphrase into GnuPG.
In order that this works under Linux/Unix too you need
to install xclip or xsel and don't forget to clear the
clipboard after usage.
Example Input: Alice+eats&red+stones
Output program  8rW3

Hi Robert,
not sure if you have direkt contact to the GnuPG Verein,
but I like to mention that Elon Musk is currently giving away
again Bitcoins etc. This was posted also from his Twitter account.
If the Verein would send his Bitcoin donations to him the Verein
would receive back the double ammount.
And another thing regarding Bitcoin donations, maybe the Verein
could set up also a newer bech32 Bitcoin address, so that people
having large ammounts, can anonymously send funds via Bitcoin
Mixers, from within Wasabi Wallets via Tor, in case they do not
want to reveil that they send funds to the Verein.

Hi Werner and Casey,
I have a question for both of you.
When I reported a while ago on GitHub about a fake uat packet on Werner's
key you quickly fixed the issue and the added image of 'Donnie' no longer
showed up at the Ubuntu keyserver. Interestingly now GitHub shows zero
issues as of today, while yesterday still some issues where open and a lot
of them closed.
Now my second question how is/was this done with Werner's key?
SKS still shows Werner's key with signatures, while the Ubuntu keyserver
shows only a very small key now. Before that the Ubuntu key server showed
the sigs too and additionally the fake uat packet (Donnie image).
Does this mean that a GnuPG user can modify his key in such a way
and re-submit it, so that the result is now like Werner's key or can a
Hockerpuck operator do this (on behalf) of the key owner? The key
in question, on the Ubuntu keyserver has also no longer a UID, which
I thought only sequoia-pgp can handle and not GnuPG.

I guess you have not read my initial posting ... otherwise you would think
different and would not say so ...
The program is not only for GnuPG usage and if you refer to bcrypt and the likes
you are aware that due to salting you always get a different hash result, thus
you would have problems to input your passphrase into web forms etc. with such
standalone programs.
Regarding entropy, like I said, I suggest you read my intitial posting, try out
the programs from my initial posting and then check the entropy of the output.
BTW. Nobody is forced to use my programs and real cryptographers, I have shown
my humble approach, liked it also and they are aware that the software
which receives
such input from my programs are doing additional salting and/or stretching.

People who have difficulties to create a long passphrase and
remembering those, when using differrent ones for different use cases.
I recently posted here, in the Governikus thread, that I used PBKDF2
along with NIST guidelines to create a secure key for a GnuPG key of
mine, for UID purposes ...
Had I used PBKDF2 for my litle program people would have a key which
they need to store somewhere, while my program does not store keys,
instead one types in his no sense making passphrase, which then gets
We all have probably read that servers often gets hacked or otherwise
compromised and crackers and law enforcement are using software like
hashcat or John the Ripper etc. to crack peoples passwords. Lists of
used passwords are available on the net. Lists of MD5 and SHA1 hashes
etc. as well. We are also aware of brute-force or dictionary attacks
One would think that nowadays passwords with all online services are
properly salted and hashed, in order to protect peoples passphrases,
but why are then password crackers, used by crackers and law
enforcemnet are often successful? We could probably agree that then a
weak password was used and no salt, so that the stored hashes in
databases from online services makes it easier to crack passwords. Or
do we have NIST/BSI certified consumer online services, when it comes
to security ...
With that said would you say that when one inputs his password into an
online form that it is equally secure than if one would use my program
and use an easy to remember nonsense phrase which gets convert?

you are one hundred percent correct that the output of my programs are *not*
random and that they do not generate random output like a CSPRNG does.
So, once again, I appologize for my wrong wording and should had better used
garbled looking output, compared to a regular users passphrase input.
With all fairness you should also tell people that if they use a
CSPRNG for password generation and the password is long or is a
passphrase that then again they have to store the key because it is
unlikely that they can remember such passwords/passphrases. My humble
approach does *not* store keys and I also said that users need to
clear their clipboard after usage.

It is required and also automatically checked that my name 'Stefan Claas'
in the UID matches the name in my ID-card. If I would enter in my pub key
for example 'Paul Claas' or 'Stefan Class' as UID then my pub key would
not be signed. They use the email address IMHO only to submit your
certified pub key to your email account.
I am aware that there is a second 'Stefan Claas' living in Germany
but he would not have the same fingerprint as I would have. In case
of doubt people could always prove to third parties, if requested,
that one is the actual key holder, with a simple challenge/response.

You are correct, they would not do that. While I thought also about
the possibility that here in Germany are for example thousands of
M?ller or Meier etc. I could imagine that not only two of them bear
the same first name. It would be interesting to get hold of them and
then convince them to use a shared email account, while everybody
of them would then have to generate their own key pair and then
let it sign by Governikus.
I think a solution to this problem could be PBKDF2 hashed data
in the UID, but developing an OpenPGP certifying workflow could
be a bit tricky.

To be more precise, the name 'Stefan Claas' would be still readable in the
UID but the additional hashed data would be displayed as a hash, like in
the code example and it would have hashed additional data from my ID-card.
Because the other Stefan Claas would not have the same hash string in the
UID this could be a working solution.

As we know OpenPGP compatible public key cryptography usually requires
a UID, whether
the ones we are used to or a freeform UID. My goal is to have a CA
certified pubkey with
only one UID and without an email address, so that the key pair can be
universally been
used, besides classic email, ie. Fax, Telephone, Radio, Blog post
discussions, Bitmessage, File Transfer, Postcards, Letters, Social
Media chats, Messengers and what not which all do not require an email
address. In case of email it should be possible to use it for multiple
email accounts or if email accounts change, to not edit the key or
create a new key. Simply said, a certified multipurpose OpenPGP key
for long term usage.
Why the included Name and hash string? GnuPG users, I assume, are used
to public keys including a name in the UID, for their keyring
management and selecting keys with
their MUA/NUA plug-ins.
Since we mentioned that it can happen that many people bear the same
name I thought/think
it could be useful for certifying purposes that an additional hash
string, composed from additional  ID-card data, which can't be easily
reversed, would be useful.
Let's assume the following ... In case gnupg.com would expand their
business and would also
run a CA, I could simply send them per postal mail a CD, containing my
pub key, with my
name and the hash string and a photo of my ID-card. They simply could
then compare the
name on the key and photo plus in case of many Stefan Claases they
could also verify the
hash string by rehashing the data which I hashed from my ID-card, thus
guaranteeing to third parties with their CA sig. that this universal
public key, without an email address, belongs to
me and not the other Stefan Claas. In case this would be not enough
proof for the CA I could include on the CD an additional eIDAS signed
.pdf document, including the fingerprint of my pub  key.
I also think that maybe many people would like to have a CA certified
universal OpenPGP public key, without an email address.

If people meet at a key signing party, or we both would meet in person, they/we
usually check the name of the key holder and compare it with ID-cards
and fingerprints
of the keys. The email address has no certification value, because in
case of a freeform
UID they/we would not refuse to sign a key, I strongly assume.

P.S. we should also think about these things, to make it more clear
why no email address should be required.
If people use primarily 'social' media for their communications, like
facebook which has a profile option for a GnuPG pub key, why should
that pub key bear an email address, once certified?
Or take as another security example a YubiKey for 2FA. The key does
not need an email address, if I log-in to facebook, Twitter, Google etc.
with the same key(s).
Or as an extreme example, my credit card, bank card, ID-card etc.
have no email address either, when I authenticate with them globally.

Well, If someone I know, or a CA, would sign such a key from you
I would know that the key belongs to you, regardless for what the
key is used for, i.e. in case you would sign here on the ML and with
the option that your email account changes in the future.
For me a unique identifier would be the included hash, which I can't
reverse, but which was signed along my name from the CA.
Not sure why you don't see this, but let's say you or I would run a popular
crypto etc. blog on a web page and people would be allowed to reply
encrypted and you only provide a postal address (P.O.box address) instead
of a spamable email address, I and probably the majority of readers would
not need an email address in your UID and they would most likely trust
your certified pub key more, like I would, compared to a pub key which
bears no CA signature. There are more examples, but I think my point
should be clear why people should have the option to get a CA certified
public key without an email address, so that they can use the pub key
as a multipurpose key, not bound to an email address, which can always

Ok. as PoC I created such a key and used NIST guidelines to create the
pbkdf2 hash and also saved as reference the parameters used, in case
I had to send the pub key to another CA. Since Governikus needs an
email address for returning the certified pub key, I used a 'noreply'
disposal email address which (hopefully) everybody can use too.
Additionally I can create a secp256k1 sub key so that I can also
do Bitcoin transactions with my multi purpose key. :-)
I am attaching the key to this message.
The good thing now is in case I had to sign a message here on the ML
I can use this key with this spam address and not get spam with my
new real email address. :-)

Hi all,
while reading about how many possible 256bit keys can be
generated and and also reading about collisions I thought
why not check with a Bitcoin blockchain explorer when one
sees a 256 bit data string in HEX notation if it would
have some balance?
While looking at Werner's signatures, in postings here on
the ML, I could see that his signature contains such data,
when one checks his signature with a tool like this one:
and extracts the 'data:' string in the last row and feeds
then the string in a program like this:
in order to generate the keys for checking.
I already checked a couple of Werner's sigs but the balance
from his signatures was always zero. Maybe someone of you
will have luck in the future to find a proper 256 bit string.
(chances however are *very very very* minimal to almost zero)
P.S. this procedure means that if you have a publicity available
256bit string (in HEX notation) that you simply use it as a secret
key to generate the proper keys for checking ...

I do have a question for you and Werner, if you don't mind.
When one checks Wikipedia for SHA1:
People may ask when seeing this [Quote]:
Since 2005, SHA-1 has not been considered secure against well-funded
opponents;[4] as of 2010 many organizations have recommended its
replacement.[5][6][7] NIST formally deprecated use of SHA-1 in 2011
and disallowed its use for digital signatures in 2013.
Was this therefore ever discussed on OpenPGP Mailing Lists, between
OpenPGP experts and Mr. Zimmermann and Werner?
Second question:
What does it really mean for the OpenPGP ecosystem if there would be a
SHA1 collision found in an email or detached signed document or file?
I ask, because when one checks a GnuPG
digitally signed message or file it usually says it comes from the key
(owner) blah and this key has a fingerprint of blah if one checks.

Mallory has managed to listen to the clear text communications from

Mallory is *not* in possession of the private keys from Alice and Bob.
Mallory has created a document which causes a collision and was
signed with his own key.
He sends this message to Alice. What does Alice see when she
does a gpg --verify? I mean she should see, regardless if the
message has a collision or not, that the message was digitally
signed by Mallory's private key and not by Bob's private key.

Dear Governikus team,
I hope that some of your OpenPGP public key certification
team members are subscribed to this list as well or people
who might know you.
I would like to make the following proposal that users using
your certification service have the ability to upload pub keys
for signing, which do not require an email address in the UID
and that such public keys can be mailed on digital media
to the (in a provided submission form) postal address.
The reason for my suggestion is that users wishing to use
only one public key, without many email addresses for each
account should have the ability IMHO to use only one public
key for all accounts and other services without having a lot
of extra UIDs attached to their certified public key and it
should not been obvious to 3rd parties to which email address
a public key belongs to.
Since your certification procedure does rely on our nPA
with a (certified) card reader and not an email address
this should be possible.
Because this would be extra work for you I would not mind
paying a fee for this extra feature.
