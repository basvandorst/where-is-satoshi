Is there some kind of roadmap when 1.4.3 will be available?
Another issue:
gpg tarballs are signed with the following key:
pub 1024D/57548DCD 1998-07-07 [expires: 2005-12-31]
Key fingerprint = 6BD9 050F D8FC 941B 4341 2DCC 68B7 AB89 5754 8DCD
uid Werner Koch (gnupg sig) Is it possible to meet Werner somewhere in personal and exchange keys? Somewhere in Southern-Germany regions would be great.... perhaps at some event or so.
My two cents.

I've seen that one can use different hash algorithms for creating signatures. The default is SHA-1 I think, but (and correct me if I'm wrong) SHA-512 (or even the "smaller" ones) should be more secure.
Ok,.. I've seen that one is able to change the used algorithm with the "--cert-digest-algo" option. For the primary key I could do the following:
1) Set the new algo (gpg.conf or command line).
2) Edit the key.
2a) Set prefered key server URL.
2b) Set some other settings from the primary key self-signature.
2c) Set prefered algorithms.
3) Delete every new self-signature except the last one (which shuld contain all the new settings with the new hash algorithm). (Is this possible/resonable, to delete the others?)
4) Save the key and be happy.
But what can I do with the self-sigs from my existing keys? How can I recreate them (with the new hash algorithm).
Thanks in advance.

Oh I forogt a little detail,.. =)
It was clear to me that I get new selfsigs on the primarykey/userid when changin settings (like prefered algorithms, etc.) and it is also clear to me that the older selfsigs will return from the keyserver (but they should be ignored by other users due to the older creation time).
Was I wanted to know was: How can I get new subkey binding sigs for my subkey (new: with more recent creation time, and of course with the "better" hash algorithm)?
It would be better to wait with doing this until gpg understands backsigs, right?
btw: Do encryption keys get backsigs, too? If not why not?
Best wishes,

I think there are IDs reserved for it,... but not sure if the whole algorithm/system is contained in RFC2440...
