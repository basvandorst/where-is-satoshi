@_subject: Encode problems? 
Hi all,
I have installed gpg in my Windows XP box (at work) and trying to decrypt
some file have this error:
gpg: conversion from `utf-8' to `CP437' failed: Illegal byte sequence
gpg: decifragem falhou: chave secreta n?o dispon?vel
How can I resolve this? :-P
Many thanks for all,
Sharky @ PTNet
