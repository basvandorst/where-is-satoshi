@_subject: Question regards session key error 
Looking for help.  Running PGP 6.02 PGP, 2.6.3ia-multi05 and GNUPG 1.06.  Messages generated with any version of PGP, no problem; however encrypted messages created with GNUPG crash with a "bad session key" error if opened in PGP.  I have RTFM, or FAQ, but I can see nothing about such an error or how to address/fix.
Does this have any relationship to the fact that I am sending test messages to other useids that are also on my secret keyring (from me to me as it were)?
Any ideas as how to fix or explain
Please respond or CC off list.

In a message dated 03/08/02 10:27:50 AM Central Standard Time, Not the problem since PGP uses Cast5 and 3Des.  I have "corrected" the problem using the 6.02 generated keys by adding "emulate-md-encode-bug" to the Options file but still no luck with my old RSA keys.

quickly  that way.
_ ( Let us know if you update. I tried using the zip file and overwriting the  old Winpt files like I have done for years with updates and Winpt 1.3.1 would  NOT work for me.  DOA, nada - totally nothing, no error messages, no crash  - just a void..
I than used their installer which did work but would not install to the  directories as I wanted it to and so I would have had to change my path  statement if I wanted other programs to work or use the command line.   Finally I just restored and went back to 1.3.0 - this all became too much  hassle.

You can have both versions of Gnupg on your system (I do).  The only
problem I ever had was that WinPT used the latest executable
installation irregardless of the defaults set within the program - to
fix this I installed Gnupg 2.* (with whatever utilities you wanted)
and than reinstated Gnupg 1.4.11, which was redundant ,but only so the
front ends would use the version I wanted with them to - actually the
only one that cared was WinPT, Enigmail (used the program settings)
and GPGShell never burped once.
The obvious factor is that the different versions of Gnupg are in
different directories.
