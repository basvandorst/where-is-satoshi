@_subject: problem in decrypting large file 
Hello, When I try to decrypt this file:
27395867626 Feb 16 18:38 dati.tar.gpg
with the command:
gpg --decrypt dati.tar.gpg > dati.tar
I obtain this error:
gpg: fatal: zlib inflate problem: invalid literal/length code
secmem usage: 2048/2048 bytes in 4/4 blocks of pool 2048/32768
And the file dati.tar is 1646067712 byte long
Have you got any Idea ?
Thank you,
                      M A R C O
