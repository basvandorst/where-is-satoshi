I've been googling for this with no luck and hoping to get a firm answer on this.
I'm building a web site for crypto advocacy, and a big chunk of the tool set I'm working on centers around GnuPG.  Because the site is so crypto-intensive, and I'm working with my own limited out-of-pocket funds, I'm hoping to push off some of the GnuPG work to a PCI card.  For example, with OpenBSD I can push IPSec and OpenSSH crypto work off to a Soekris card so the host processor isn't bogged down.  Can I do something like this with GnuPG?  Or is my only hope to have a really really fast host processor(s)?

This is gnupg-users, not gnupg-devel.
Again, see the TO: header.
cryptonly.{com,net,org} (don't bother looking, it's not there yet outside of my laptop) is intended to be a crypto-for-all advocacy site.   When I say all I'm not talking about just little old ladies or the technophobic coworker, but also enough tech there to satisfy sysadmins and developers alike.  I've been learning PHP to put some front end tools together for GnuPG, OpenSSL and other tools.   I don't want to give too much away at this point but I am looking at some of the great work Darxus has done with the web of trust analysis and improving upon that for a web based user.
I've also got a farm of oddball machines that are a little old but still current enough to be relevant for cross-platform development purposes (sparc, sparc64, alpha, vax, hp-parisc, etc).  I've already talked a very little bit with one of the GnuPG developers to gauge interest in using this farm for GnuPG development and it looks like that might come to fruition in a few months.

Will never happen;  I'm a BOFH not a codemonkey.  :-/
I'm not suggesting any dependency by any means, but rather the option to use hardware if it is present (which is precisely how OpenBSD handles its crypto built into the kernel in /dev/crypto)
The idea for using hardware acceleration is for several reasons:
1) Older machines are perfectly good for serving up web pages & email, but choke on crypto.  Crypto cards are cheaper than new machines.
2) The old machines that are out there don't support new CPU's.  So the so-called cheap 3GHz CPU becomes a lot more expensive when you figure in the additional cost of a system board, memory and an ATX case.
3) Even if I had a 3GHz system for the cryptonly.org site, I don't want the heavy GnuPG operations to slow down apache and PHP  considerably if I can help it.
Anyway I guess I'm just being cheap.  I'm building this site with no funding or commercial goals.  I've got a bunch of old hardware to throw at it but not a lot of money for newer hardware (though if you have a box you want to kick into the project and it is reasonably fast, let me know *grin*)

That explains everything;  you're using a broken MUA.
This is a problem MS has had for years and has not addressed.  The mailing list isn't broken; the mail client is.  It makes more sense for the people with broken mail clients to change their clients to suit the list than it does for the list to change headers to suit a broken MUA.

I'm listed under one of the big cities, Philadelphia.  Biglumber.com isn't smart enough unfortunately to group suburbs with their parent city, so what most of the "Philadelphians" did was say they lived in Philadelphia even though they really live in an outlying suburb.
So if you live near a big city, but you listed yourself under your true town of residence outside of that city, you might want to consider adjusting your listing to better represent what OpenPGP users live in your metro area.

This is not a small task.  And it only works for the USA users.
Geolocate users based on their ZIP code, and use the US Census "TIGER" database to group them with the nearest city.
I don't know how to apply this on an international scale unless people are willing/able to provide meaningful GPS coordinates.
Having this capability buys you something else, though;  a user can say what ZIP code they're in and how far they are willing to drive for a keysigning.  This will lead to a lot of overlapping bubbles that people are willing to meet within.  At a "dumb" level you can merely send someone a list of who they can reasonably expect to meet based on mutually convenient travel range.  At a more intelligent level, key analysis could be performed to sort out who is close that has already signed your key vs. who has yet to sign it.

I subscribe to the list so there is no reason to send me two copies.
Anywho, geolocation based on IP address flat out simply doesn't work.  Don't believe me?  Give me a web site to visit and then based on your server logs tell me where in the world I am within 100 miles of accuracy.  You can't.  When you're talking about something like keysignings your accuracy needs to be much greater still.  Most folks are willing to drive only so far to meet someone to swap signatures.  If you're giving them too many false hits for "neighbors" the system will be useless out of the starting gate.
