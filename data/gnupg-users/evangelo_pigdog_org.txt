One value of signatures that you didn't point out is establishing
identity for people who don't meet face to face. When you get an email
from me in two months asking for a loan of $10,000, you'll know that
it was the same guy who sent a gnupg-users list email in Dec 2000,
since the signatures will be the same. Do you need to know who I am
now? No. Will you need to know in the future? Maybe.
Lastly, that semi-political agenda you mentioned? It's
worthwhile. Making signatures and encryption a part of everyday usage
is valuable.

    Thomas> It think so, but I'm not sure.
MEW, an Emacs messaging package, also does PGP/MIME. I think the tm
package (a MIME add-on) can also be configured to create PGP/MIME.
Despite the "deprecation," the old way seems to be the most
portable. Sadly, PGP/MIME doesn't have any built-in backwards
compatibility, so it's not very useful for widespread communication.
[I've actually seen complaints from Eudora users that their mailer
will treat _any_ MIME parts as "attachments" and auto-save them to a
defined directory. So PGP/MIME signatures and those annoying v-card
things just pile up. Not a good reason not to use PGP/MIME, just a
pain in the butt from a widely-used MUA.]

Howdy, folks. I have a real nice mail system running with gpg,

I guess I'm on a hedonic treadmill, though, because _now_ I want to

my mailcrypt settings and has hard-coded "pgp" calls throughout.
Has anyone else worked with the TM code to try and make gpg go? I'm
also looking into using the pgpgpg script, but it seems a little

I think you missed the point. It's not that you don't need GPG from
cron jobs, it's that if you -are- using GPG from cron jobs, you
shouldn't have a passphrase on the key that's used.
I'm not a crypto-whiz, either, but I think I can make an analogy.
It's not any good having a great big padlock on your door if you hide
the key under the doormat. It's a false sense of security to hide the
key, because it's trivial to find it. So, instead, leave the key in
the lock, and don't let people get near the door.
Leaving the key in the lock is -better- than putting it under the mat,
because it will make you nervous and more conscious about who you let
near the door, and what you keep behind it.
Does that make sense? I guess what I'm trying to say is that having
the GPG key and the passphrase stored in the same place is essentially
equivalent to having no passphrase at all. So, don't kid yourself and
go to the trouble of having a passphrase.

Yeah, but it's stupendously high for Windows systems. It's going to be

It's fairly easy to say that GnuPG "only" works on Unix and Unix-like
OSes, but I think that puts us all at a big disadvantage. GnuPG is
essentially a communications tool, and pleasant or not the fact is
that most people don't use Unix for their computer communications (at
least on the MUA side). Getting GnuPG to those people, too, means -we-
can all use it more often. :-)
As a side note, I'm wondering what the policy is for American citizens
to contribute to GnuPG. Could I hack the code (e.g., to make a
separate DLL for Windows) and submit my diffs? Or is that illegal?

@_subject: Decrypt and Leave Signature? 
OK, so here's what I want to do: I want to take a message that is
signed by A and encrypted for B, and make it signed by A and encrypted
for C. In other words, the path is:
 plain -> Encrypted for B, Signed by A -> Signed by A ->
          Signed by A, Encrypted for C
All the steps here are pretty straightforward, EXCEPT for taking a
message that's encrypted for B, signed by A and making it just signed
by A. I can't figure out a way to decrypt a message and leave the
signature on the message.
My particular needs are for a re-encrypting mailing list software
package. Currently, the software (B) can decrypt A's (the poster's)
message, and verify A's signature, but then it resends the message
encrypted for C (all subscribers) with its own (B's) signature. It
makes more sense that C (subscribers) should be able to verify the
text of A's message with A's own key, rather than taking the
software's (B's) word for it.
(Since this process is for email, detached signatures aren't really
much of an option.)
There are other scenarios where you might want to decrypt a message
and leave the signature. For example, say that A and B have a
contract, signed by A and encrypted for B. If B wants to show that
contract to a court to prove that A signed it, it doesn't seem fair
that B should have to compromise his/her private key to do so.
Even something as prosaic as forwarding an encrypted email message
would be better served if the original signature could be left on.
So, can someone clue me in on how to make this happen?

One last thing: for automatic software, daemons, or whatever, it's
really better to just have an ID with NO password than to keep a
password in a file and send it to GnuPG.
Why? Because having a password on the ID gives you a false sense of
security. Anyone with physical access to the script or whatever will
be able to get your password. Not only that, but the GnuPG keyring
only has to be readable by the account running gpg. The script may
have to be readable by multiple accounts (like a Web server account),
making having the passphrase in code or a file LESS secure than just
having a no-password ID.
By having a no-password ID in the keyring, you'll make sure that you
take adequate precautions to protect your system and the account that
can read/write the keyring. You can concentrate on that one keyring
file, rather than various nebulous scripts floating all over your file
Good luck,
