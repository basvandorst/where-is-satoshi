I'm not sure if Klaus' thinking is correct, but his patch clears up the
MPI errors I was receiving.

Is there a way to calculate the unencrypted or unsigned size of an ASCII
armored encrypted message given the size of the message and the length
of the key?

I believe you simply need to sign the keys again.  When you create
them, a self signature is added.  When you revoke them, a revoking
signature is added.  Thus to unrevoke them an additional signature is

The command is 'gpg' and you won't "go into the program" as it's a
command line tool. Use 'gpg --help' to determine which switches you
would like to use.

I'm cc'ing it.
I can only imagine that you have changed how you started up
seahorse-agent and now have a stale entry at the end of
~/.gnupg/gpg.conf.  Make sure that seahorse-agent is properly chained

Hash: SHA1
Seahorse for GNOME provides an extension for Epiphany that allows a
user to encrypt/sign/decrypt/verify any text field.  I've been using
it with the Encryption Applet that Seahorse provides and Gmail quite
handily.  The only issue is that sometimes Gmail likes to insert its
own CRs that mess with verification.

Seahorse[1] is a password and encryption key manager for the GNOME

This was sent to me individually and I can only imagine that its
intended destination was here.
---------- Forwarded message ----------
Im a gpg newbie...
And i did one bad thing: I generated my first key.... and uploaded
the public key to the keyserver.
then i decided to take a better keylength and deleted the old key on
my harddisk (and yeah i ignored the warning message.)
Of course, i didnt generate any revoke-cetifikates...
And now i generated the second key with the same password and email
but with another length and uploaded it again.
Now I have 2 public keys and only one private key....
But i tried to send an encrypted mail with my first public key....
And could decrypt it?!?! I deleted my old private key.. so why can i
decrypt it?
or i am stupid?
Can somebody help me?
sorry for my bad english!

When my university was using SpamAssassin, GPG emails were being
marked as spam because patterns were being matched by the armored text

@_subject: Multiple recipients encryption 
When you encrypt data a session key is generated to encrypt the data
and the session key is then encrypted with the recipient's public key.
 When there are multiple recipients, the session key is encrypted with
each one's public key.
