@_subject: Encrypting and signing in the same run 
Good afternoon all,
A business partner is asking us to encrypt and sign our files with PGP before uploading it on their server.
I decided to use GnuPG as it is said to be compatible.
After having generated keys and added their key to our keyring, I used, as said in the man page :
gpg -se -r 'Partner Name' file_to_encrypt.
However, it doesn't seem to meet their requirements. Here's the reply of our partner :
"The file is first encrypted and then signed.  Not encrypted and signed in the same run."
Our partner has to remove our signature before to be able to decrypt the I don't see what I'm doing wrong, even after some searches in manual and other sites.
Does anyone see what's going wrong ?
Thanks you in advance for your help,
