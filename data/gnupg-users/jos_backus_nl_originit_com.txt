Indeed. Did you configure any entropy sources using rndcontrol(8)? If not, try
and configure those IRQs which have a decent rate. Be sure _not_ to use those
associated with clk* and rtc*.
This is on a system here:
# vmstat -i
interrupt      total      rate
clk0 irq0    173824877       99
rtc0 irq8    222501722      128
pci irq10    26115597       15
pci irq11    17550519       10
pci irq5       115171        0
fdc0 irq6           1        0
Total        440107887      253
# rndcontrol
rndcontrol: interrupts in use: 10 11
#     Here, ``gpg --gen-key'' works fine.
