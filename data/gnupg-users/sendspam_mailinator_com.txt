@_subject: .asc file problem 
Hi there.
I have uploaded my public key as a .asc file onto my web server.  However,
whenever I try to view it in the browser (Firefox, but it happens with every
browser) Firefox offers the 'Open / Save' dialogue box, instead of
displaying the raw public key.
I've just moved to a new web server, and I must have done something wrong
when I uploaded it or something... do you guys know of any way I could fix
