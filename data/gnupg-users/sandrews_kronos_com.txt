When Decrypting/Checking a file I have just encrypted and signed
I Get the following error:
gpg: DBG: mapped 4k shared memory at 0x40017000, id=8153735
gpg: locking shared memory 8153735 failed: Operation not permitted
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
This is from the dialog box.
When I encrypt something, it looks as if the encryption part worked, but
after I try to check it that`s when I get that error.
The OS is RedHat 6.2.
Can you help me? :^(
