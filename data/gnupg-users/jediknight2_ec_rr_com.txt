@_subject: Specify output directory during encrypt 
Is there a way to specify where to output files during the encryption
process...for instance if I have files in C:\Testing that I want to encrypt
using --multifile and want the encrypted files in C:\Output..can gpg do that
directly or am I going to have to use a DOS move command??

@_subject: Encrypting SubFolders 
Is there a way to encrypt a folder including subfolders?
I have tried
gpg --encrypt --multifile \thisfolder\*.*
gpg --encrypt --multifile \thisfolder\*
The first one will hit all the subfolders inside thisfolder, but if those
subfolders have folders then it wont go...
so it will try thisfolder\subfolder
but it wont catch thisfolder\subfolder\subsubfolder
Any suggestions

That line works, but it starts encrypting the .gpg then the .gpg.gpg then
the .gpg.gpg.gpg :) I cant find any --exclude option that works...I actually
had to add a % sign so it reads
For /R c:\temp %%f IN (*) DO gpg --encrypt %%f
FYI, on windows the command would be:
    FOR /R c:\temp %f IN (*) DO gpg --encrypt %f
Obviously, you can replace C:\temp with a relative path, UNC, or
whatever else you'd like.
I think you need Win98 or newer to have the FOR command available in the
command shell.
