@_subject: Help adding IDEA within GnuPG 2.0.9 
Hi group,
I am trying to include support for IDEA within GnuPG 2.0.9 running under Linux. I have downloaded the idea.c module via the link on this page:  have compiled it and have added the         load-extension /idea
statement to my conf file in ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
But it does not seem to load IDEA support anyway. I have placed the idea module in the ~/.gnupg/ folder - could that be the problem ? I have verified on another server - with GnuPG 1.4.10 installed - that here the IDEA support actually gets added with this setup.
The "gpg --load-extension /idea -v --version" command within GnuPG 2.0.9 yields the following:
batch at psdkxd02:~/.gnupg> gpg --load-extension gpg (GnuPG) 2.0.9
