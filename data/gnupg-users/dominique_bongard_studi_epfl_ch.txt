This is my first post and and don't know if it's the right place for it.
I need to send e-mail automatically encrypted by my server to one
But he has no computer knowledge and he wasn't able to run pgp or gpg.
So I planned to use S/Mime with netscape, but I didn't find any S/mime
software that is not export restricted and can batch process.
And what I read says netscape doesn't support openpgp or pgpmime..
So the question is:
Is there a simple and secure way to encrypt mail from a linux server,
easy to read for a normal user.
Thanks for answering
