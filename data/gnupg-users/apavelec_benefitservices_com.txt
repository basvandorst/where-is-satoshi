My memory must be terrible because I don't recall writing anything about a
backdoor, nor can I bring to mind anything in the below-linked article
regarding a backdoor.  Besides, this is a USER's mailing list -- not a
DEVELOPER's list.  I figured that GnuPG users would be interested in such
news, since many of them were most likely first introduced to PGP through,
well, NAI/McAfee PGP itself.  Some might even still be using the perilous
product(s) and may very well be vulnerable to the threat.  To think that I
am asinine due to my comment is perhaps to insult yourself, for you seem to
be more committed to the development of GPG than assisting the users of it;
and my comment merely implicates a level thanks to the developers of GnuPG
for doing what they do the way they do it.

That's exactly right.  In fact, the main purpose for posting the link to the
news article was to bring the attention of the vulnerability to anyone who
might still be using the affected software.  I have noticed that many GPG
users on this list still use older versions of PGP for compatability and/or

file included in the archive.  However, you can create you own -- just
create a file called "options" (without the quotes, no file extension) in
the same directory that you extracted the zip package to.  By the way, it
has been recommended that you extract GPG to the following path: C:\GNUPG --
otherwise, you may need to modify your Registry.
Please remember to take a look at the manual file (gpg.man), the help file
(help.man), and the readme files (README and README.W32).  There is a wealth
of information to be found.  By the way, gpg.man has an entire section on
the options file and all of its attributes.

@_subject: Unexpected Filename Upon Decrypt 
I am looking for any help or input on probably the only issue I am having
with GnuPG.
First off, here's my environment:
Win98SE / W2KPRO / WINXPPRO
GnuPG 1.0.6
GPGshell 2.28
Network Associates PGP Corporate Desktop 7.0.3
Here's my issue:
When I decrypt a file from a usual sender, the following is displayed:
You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
2048-bit ELG-E key, ID xxxxxxxx, created yyyy-mm-dd (main key ID xxxxxxxx)
gpg: NOTE: cipher algorithm 3 not found in preferences
gpg: encrypted with ELG-E key, ID xxxxxxxx
gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit ELG-E key, ID xxxxxxxx, created yyyy-mm-dd
      "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
When the process is finished, the file "nnnnnnnnnnnnnn.zip" is extracted
(where n = a random number).  Decrypting the same file with Network
Associates PGP results in the file "PCnnnnnnnnnnnnnn.zip", which is what the
file is actually supposed to be named.
Somehow, I believe the message "gpg: NOTE: cipher algorithm 3 not found in
preferences" is related to this issue.  Any ideas?

I am by no means a HIPAA expert -- I don't think /anyone/ is, including
the United States Department of Health & Human Services itself.
However, I /have/ read through the Health Insurance Reform: Security
Standards Final Rule (
I think this quote from section (=A7 164.312(e)(1)) says it all: "In this
final rule, we adopt integrity controls and encryption, as addressable
implementation specifications."  This indicates that encryption is not a
requirement.  My organization's team of legal consultants in Washington
has confirmed this.
Another interesting quote from the /Response/ section:
-----BEGIN QUOTE-----
Particularly when considering situations faced by small and rural
providers, it became clear that there is not yet available a simple and
interoperable solution to encrypting email communications with patients.
As a result, we decided to make the use of encryption in the

Covered entities are encouraged, however, to consider use of encryption
technology for transmitting electronic protected health information,
particularly over the internet.

Our organization has a partner who claims that version 7.0.1 of
PGP is incompatible with all versions of GnuPG (as well as PGP
v8.0.2).  Basically, this person has stated that GnuPG defaults
to AES256, AES192, and AES128 symmetric algorithms as the
preferred symmetric algorithms when creating a key, and that
this is the cause of the incompatibility.

Personally, I didn't do or see anything.  My organization has a
key that was created with GPG version 1.2.3 using the default
options.  The party who is attempting to encrypt data to this
key "has determined that the version of PGP that is being used
(PGP 7.0.1) contains a bug that prevents it from generating a
ciphertext file as output when the AES256, AES192, and AES128
symmetric algorithms are defined as the preferred symmetric
Algorithms in an imported PGP key.  The exact nature of the bug
is unknown at this time."
Their report goes on to state that they "have demonstrated that
the bug affects keys generated with PGP v8.0.2 and all GnuPG
versions due to the default options...  Specifically, these
products apparently default to generating keys that specify the
AES symmetric algorithms as the first three preferred
Until they upgrade their PGP installation, they state that it is
impossible to encrypt data to our GPG-created key unless we
provide them with an "encryption key [that] must be either
created or edited to exclude AES variations from the preferred
set of symmetric algorithms specified in the key."
Again, I am uncertain to the validity of this claim, but I have
since created a new key that I have set (and updated) the
preferences to exclude any AES algorithms.  If you are
interested, I will let you know if this new key is interoperable
with their current PGP install.

About the only thing I have noticed thus far is that it seems the file
is being encrypted to Fred Flintstone's Subkey.  Could this be the casue
of the failure?  I've asked the sender to encrypt to Fred's Primary key
a few times already, but apparently s/he can't figure out how to do it.
