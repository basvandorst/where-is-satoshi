i got this adress from P100MHz, 64MB Linux (Suse 7.0)
my problem:
my pc is not able to handle with year 2000/2001, any changes in bios
etc. have no effects, the year is always 1994.
when i try to run the config-file of the gnupg-package in order to set
the pre-values (?) for the compilation (make), the programm breaks with
something like: date if file and ?? differs, not able to...
is there another way to compile gnupg?
thank you,
