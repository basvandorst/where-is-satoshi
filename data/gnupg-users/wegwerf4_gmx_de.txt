Unfortunately I forgot my passphrase but can  remember some
characters and the position of them in the phrase. I wrote a bash-script to check a list of passwords which
are all candidates. I also created a test-gpg-account to test the script before
I run it with the quite longer list. Now the output of the test-script shows me that it works
at a speed of about three tests per second and it finds the
correct phrase.  But if I run the same script in my actual
environment, in the .gnupg directory I see the passwords
running at a much higher speed.  The output per check is
the same. But this script doesn't find the passphrase.  The script reads:
Does anybody have any idea?

Just a repetition of my question, in a different way:
Does anybody out there know of any script to brute force a
list of passphrases?

Thanks to all for your hints.
I succeeded to run rephrase but it didn't find the phrase. So I had to revoke my key and generate a new one...
