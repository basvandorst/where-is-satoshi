I am using gpg 1.0.6 from an RPM made by RedHat (gnupg-1.0.6-3.rpm) along with pgp4pine 1.76 from an RPM made by CW Zuckschwerdt  (pgp4pine-1.75-1.rpm) with Pine 4.33 from an RPM also made by RedHat I have been using this configuration successfully for nearly a year. Tuesday I sent a signed mail to a friend, as I do daily, and the signature did not verify. The recipient was not able to verify it, nor was I. I have attached the original mail to this mail so that others might be able to look at it. My public key is available from gpg output is:
gpg: Signature made Tue 04 Dec 2001 08:41:49 PM MST using DSA key ID gpg: BAD signature from "Chad Davis "
which is the correct key. The two things I have noticed here are that the gpg output refers to only one of the two user ids that are on that key, whereas a successful verification outputs something like:
gpg: Good signature from "Chad Davis "
gpg:                 aka "Chad Davis "
The other thing I noticed is that my signature (from my ~/.signature, not
the gpg signature) in the file which does not verify has one character
replaced by (what appears to be) a space. This would seem to be the source
of the problem, but how does something like this happen? I believe Pine
simply pipes the message to pgp4pine and displays the output that is
returned. This would seem to indicate a problem in pgp4pine or gpg. I
would suspect pgp4pine before I would suspect gpg, but I know a few of the
people on this list are using pgp4pine. Either way it seems like a serious
issue. I can't see how this could be simply stupid user error, because, like I
said, I've been using this configuration for a year and all signatures
before and since this particular mail have verified. Naturally, one's
first encounter with the "BAD signature" message is unnerving, but this
was my own signature!
Any insight whatsoever would help me sleep better at night as well as
restore my faith in applied cryptography. I'm willing to supply any and
all information, including my private key (after revoking it) if it will
help find the source if this confusion.

I apologize, pgp4pine intercepted my attachment and processed the signature data. Here's a gzip'd version.

Last time. Here's the text:
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Checking my answer with you as I go:
1) a) Not a field, because 2 has no multiplicative inverse.
b) Is a field.
a) Sup: 1, Inf: 0
b) Sup: none, Inf: 0
c) Sup: Pi, Inf: -1
3) Assume 0 has a mult. inverse, 0^-1
Since F is a field, it has a mult. identity, 1
So, 0 * 0^-1 = 1
But, 0 * x = 0 for all x -> subproof from class notes
So, 0 = 1, which contradicts the fact that F is a field.
So, 0 has no mult. inverse.
Assume xFrom problem 2b), -x = (-1)x
So, -z = (-1)z
And x(-1)z < y(-1)z
(-1)xz < (-1)yz
So, xz < yz

Content-id: Yes, I am a stupid user. Please don't let that discourage you from looking
into this issue. Here is that attachment, again.

@_subject: gpg on public system? 
I am in the same situation at my university. I also do not entirely trust
our friendly admins. I carry my secring.gpg around on a floppy (with
backups at home). But, because floppies are so slow and unreliable, I
make a directory in /tmp and chmod it 700 before copying my secring.gpg
there. This might not be very safe, but most of the other partitions on
the system are NFS mounted from elsewhere. I also have that temp directory
being deleted in my .bash_logout.
