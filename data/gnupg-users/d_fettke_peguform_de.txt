@_subject: problems to sign emails 
my problem is, that i can't sign any emails i want to send. i'm using kmail with suse 8.2. if i klick on "send", i get an error-message called that i have given a wrong password. if i klick on "try again" the error comes again immediatelly. i can't type in any password. when i edit my gpg-key and type in no password, then the signing of emails works. only if i typeing a password in the gpg-key, then it won't working. what's the problem, or what i doing wrong?
tanks for your help

my kmal version is 1.5.1.
i trying to send emails with the builtin gpg of kmail. in the security settings at the crypto plugin i haven't anything there. the couriosity is that all works without an gpg password. as soon as i given a password it don't works. i become to desperate... :-(
