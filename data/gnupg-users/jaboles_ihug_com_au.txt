@_subject: GPGME available as DLL? 
I'm writing a program in RapidQ that uses GPG functionality to sign and verify stuff being transmitted to and received from a server. I tried using GPG itself but this was impossible, because I couldn't find a way of automatically giving it the key passphrase in the command line other than using --passphrase-fd. Using passphrase-fd 0 works fine in a console window but it won't work with ShellExecute because it doesn't take pipe/io-redirection symbols. I tried "echo secret| gpg --passphrase-fd 0", "type passphrase.txt | gpg --passphrase-fd 0" and "gpg --passphrase-fd 0 < passphrase.txt" and none of them work when executed using the API. The app I'm writing encrypts and decrypts multiple times, so popping the console and getting the user to type in the passphrase each time is unacceptable. GPGME looked like it might be the way to go, but I could only find source.
What I'd like to know, is GPGME available as a DLL? The source code is pretty useless to me since I don't know C (at all) and I wouldn't know the first thing to try and compile it into a DLL.
If not, what other options do I have?
