@_subject: OpenPGP parts and plain text in the same email 
Hi there,
isn't this what the message "This is an OpenPGP/MIME signed message (RFC 2440 and 3156)" is about? If this text is shown by an incompatible client it could be replaced by the original text.
Is there a (reliable) list of incompatible clients?
Best regards, Alex

OS X is using an LF character only
From our point of view the issue lies in the TextWrangler code since it "destructively modifies all files it opens".
Here it is: Best regards, Alex

(since the message was bounced (first, too many recipients, then too large) - I'm sending it again just to this list).
Hi there,
just updated the attached overview picture, added two more participants to this list (Jan (Crypto Stick) and David (DOMCrypt)) and also the GnuPG mailing list (might be of interest for someone there). Please have a look at the message thread below for details.
If we can agree on the name OpenPGP.JS/openpgpjs (analog to videojs, pdfjs, ...) we should move the documentation, tickets and sources from

well, JavaScript itself is just another programming language and combined with modern technologies like HTML5 Web Storage there is nowadays technically no need to implement browser plugins for different versions and platforms. See [1].
