the short form

a "randomness"
applied to it somewhere?
4) Lastly, I think PGP implements key generation
nicely in a way that
it shows you the percentage of random bytes needed
then stops you
when it reaches 100%. It's not that whatever feature
PGP has I tend
to look for in GnuPG, but I just think that this
particular feature
is quite neat :) On second thought, I'm just musing.
Scrap this idea.

Hi guys,
during encryption while the fingerprint being given by
the --fingerprint option is from the primary key.
encrypting a message to someone who is yet to be
labelled trusted in your keyring prints out a message
similar to:

> On Sat,
You can't delete your pubkey but you can render it
unusable by revoking it.
But you said you lost the secret key, so... bummer.
Quite impossible. Unless you nag all the people who
maintain the keyservers and the hundreds of sites that
mirror its contents to delete your pubkey.
You have to really prove that your YOU, though.
And that would be tough withouth a secret key.

@_subject: Recovery of PCSECURE files and bogus GnuPG algorithms 
hi guys,
the ff is a record of correspondence that took place
between my friend and Mr. Zimmermann last June 10.
My friend was asking PRZ some help about an old DOS
encryption program he got problems with. He encrypted the message to PRZ using gpg, but some of
the gnupg options were altered, like tiger loaded,
cipher-algo twofish digest-algo tiger192, etc...
PRZ was unable to decrypt the message. The ff email
messages follow this.
Sorry, Jed, I have no experience with PCSECURE.  Never
used it or even seen it.
You might have to hire a consultant to spend the time
looking into the matter.
I could spend some time on it, but that would run you
There are companies that specialize in this kind of
data recovery.  One is AccessData,
which I presume might use accessdata.com as its web
address.  I can't check if that
is the right URL now, because I'm on a plane high
above Bangkok at the moment.  I'll
upload this email when I reach Perth.
Changing the subject-- I'm curious how you generated
the earlier message to me,
the one that had a bad session key due to using the
wrong algorithm in GnuPG.
Exactly what GnuPG settings did you use to generate
that message?  You had to override
my own public key's settings to generate that message
with that algorithm.  How did
you do that?
I noticed this time you left off the GnuPG version
labels, which are purely cosmetic.
Were you worried that they would somehow offend me for
not using the real PGP?
Believe me, it was not a question of what product you
were using.  It was a question
of using a nonstandard algorithm within the product.

Just follow my advice without exp[lanation:  Eliminate
all algorithms from your preferences that are not
supported by the real PGP.
Eliminate any hashes except SHA1, no other hashes. Also eliminate Elgamal signatures (but leave el gamal
Eliminate Blowfish.  Eliminate TIGER stuff.

Would it be advisable for my friend to follow PRZ's
advice and just use the PGP algorithms? What if my
friend wants twofish more? Then people like PRZ won't
be able to read his email right?
What do you guys think? I think PRZ should get down
from his high horse and stop sour-graping about GnuPG.

sorry for being naive but i would just like to clear
some things regarding preferences and cipher-algo
settings in the options file.
setpref would set your preferred cipher algorithms for
you public key, right? so others who would send you a
message would encrypt messages for you using the
preferred algorithms.
will putting "cipher-algo newcipher" on your
.gnupg/options file encrypt ALL messages using that
algorithm, regardless of what the public key prefers
you to use?
