@_subject: gnupg and excel sending email. 
After installing gpg4win-2.1.0 the email button from excel (2003) will not send out mail.  It will put the mail in my Outlook inbox instead of sending Can't forward the email because it hammers the formatting.  Is there a fix or do I need to force my user to send the excel sheet as attachment direct from outlook.
Note:After uninstalling gpg4win the excel function works again so it's something with the gnupg
