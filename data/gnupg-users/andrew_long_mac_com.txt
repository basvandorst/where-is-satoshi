'Should' and 'Must' have specific meanings within most RFC's.... (I've been OD'ing on RFCs, recently) So, as many of us here are from a technical background, I think we might be ready to believe such a formalism may apply?

Sorry, couldn't resist channelling a bit of Niven/Pournelle ;-)

Now insist that they change them every month. And that they have a different one for every application that they use. Single Sign On is a grat idea, but unlikely to be practical in the near future.

@_subject: keyservers 
Anyone else having problems accessing pool.sks-keyservers.net? I've  tried pointing nslookup at a couple of the root DNS name servers and  get DOMAIN (not known)

@_subject: PGP/GPG confusing PGPDisk? 
This is a bit of-topic for this list but I thought I'd float it here before trying to get an answer out of Symantec.
Back in about JUne I created a (small) PGP disk using PGP Desktop for Mac. I never actually used it but it would mount itself on re-boots and was (apparently) there and available.
Since I installed the security update to Lion last week though, this disk refuses to mount and complains about having been encrypted with an incompatible cipher. I believe that it was created with AES256. OK so it's no great loss - there wasn't anything in it - I'll create a new one. Only every time I try this now I get the same error, no matter what algorithm I choose from the dropdown box (one of CAST5, AES256 and EME2-AES256).
I was wondering if it is possible/likely that, because I have both PGP & GnuPG installed on the same machine and keep copies of my public key on both the PGO keyservers & sks-keyserers that I might have introduced some confusion into the choices of algorithms available between the two different installations?
Anyone have any thoughts on how to diagnose/resolve the situation, please?
