@_subject: gnupg make fails on hpux 11.11 
I have a hpux 11.11 machine with gcc 3.2 installed in /usr/local/bin. I
export CC setting it to be equal to the location of gcc and the configure
completes successfully. However when I do the make command (either
if /usr/local/bin/gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I.. -I.. -I../include
-I../intl    -g -O2 -Wall -MT http.o -MD -MP -MF ".deps/http.Tpo" \
  -c -o http.o `test -f 'http.c' || echo './'`http.c; \
then mv -f ".deps/http.Tpo" ".deps/http.Po"; \
else rm -f ".deps/http.Tpo"; exit 1; \
In file included from http.c:34:
gmake: *** [http.o] Error 1
