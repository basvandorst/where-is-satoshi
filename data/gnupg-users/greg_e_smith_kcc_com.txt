@_subject: Scripting GPG Encryption 
I am having an issue where we have set a custom home directory for GPG and configured the registry entry for HKCU\GNU\GNUPG\HomeDir=...  The script functions fine when someone is logged into the system with the user account executing the script.  However the script fails, when no one is logged in.  Other than setting the -homedir in the script, is there another solution?
