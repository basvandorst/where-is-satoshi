Disclaimer: I have never used GnuPG on Windows.
The "HomeDir" component of the above registry key is "Name"
Guess not. If your default directory is "c:\mydir\gnupg" you should
  c:/mydir/gnupg
as the value for "HomeDir".

That would be a general term, I guess; supposedly there are other
registry keys for GnuPG which have filenames as their value.
Well maybe not *all* problems, but this one, yes.   .-)
Well, you really should use GnuPG from a prompt, since it is a command
line tool, and as such does not provide a GUI. There are, however, GUI
front ends for GnuPG out there. I am sure that other listmembers can
provide you with pointers for those and for using GnuPG with Mozilla.
I hope this helps, and best of luck with the evangelization.

I would say that a --recursive flag is "nice to have", not "need to
have", especially since there are a number of reasonable alternatives
(shell scripts, shell one-liners), that solves the problem. I guess it
is a matter of assessing the need for this particular feature versus the
need of other features.
Even Windows users can use alternative methods to use GnuPG in a
recursive fashion, using Cygwin, Perl, or nearly any other programming
language. Not being a VB programmer, it would still bet that one could
use this particular language for this purpose.

I am wondering whether it is possible to import/share the keys
(especially my private keys) from the Windows version of PGP? If
possible, which versions of PGP (for Win) and GPG (Linux) would be
Currently I have PGP v. 7.0.3 installed on my Windows box.
The Linux box is a Redhat 7.1 running Gnome on a 2.4.11 kernel.
