@_subject: GnuPG 2.0 compilation fails with "undefined reference to 
Hi list,
I'm having trouble compiling the "agent" component of GnuPG 2.0 on a
Gentoo-based machine. I could not find anything about the error message
(please see attachment) in the FAQ or by searching the Net, so I hope
that the members of this mailing list are able to help.
If you need any information about the machine on which I am trying to
build GnuPG 2.0, please let me know. As a preparation, I have built and
installed libgpg-error 1.4, libassuan 1.0.1 and libksba 1.0.0, but
perhaps there is still something missing?
Your help is appreciated.

I tried, but unfortunately version 2.0.1 won't compile either.

Well, even though it is not a perfect solution, it might be a good idea
to check the user-supplied library directories before /usr/lib.
I'll attach a small patch for the "configure" script of GnuPG 2.0.1
which works for me.

Indeed, it is a crude, temporary workaround. I'm looking forward to your
solution for upcoming builds. ;-)

@_subject: German ct magazine postulates death of pgp encryption 
The c't magazine is mostly well respected in Germany and the editors
have some valid points; the latest articles are by no means mindless
rants or PGP-bashing. The thought of letting PGP die as an e-mail
encryption mechanism for the "masses" (the non-tech-savvy average users)
and to have it replaced with something my mother could use is valid. The
c't editorial also clearly states that PGP works perfectly well and is
secure as long as keys are verified, but fake keys and people not
verifying fingerprints are a reality. Alice can't just send an e-mail to
Bob, she needs to acquire and verify Bob's public key first. Compare
this to transparent encryption like Apple's iMessage service uses and it
is not hard to answer which mechanism has better usability. I like and
use PGP like probably every subscriber on this mailing list, but the
number of people I can exchange PGP-encrypted data with is very low when
compared to the total number of my e-mail contacts.

I invite you to read my message again. I used iMessage as an example for
usability (as did c't editor J?rgen Schmidt), not for impregnable
security. There is a reason why I use PGP, but there are also reasons
why my family does not. Lately I have set up S/MIME when I helped
friends with their smartphones, but while that takes care of transporting
the public keys automatically, establishing trust is still an issue most
people spend too little thought and effort on. Lower that bar, and more
users will likely opt for end-to-end encryption.

It looks like we agree on most aspects, but to get back to the original
question of this thread: From what I have seen since the nineties (I do
remember donating money for Philip Zimmermann), PGP is great for users
with a solid foundation in cryptography, but it is too complicated for
avarage users -- no disrespect intended. For more than 20 years, PGP has
not made critical mass, and in these years computers and related
services have become ever more accessible to average users who don't
know about cryptography. In its current form, PGP can be used to improve
security in many areas and I am very grateful for the work Werner and
others put into it, but PGP does not work for mass e-mail protection, as
much as I would prefer matters to be different.

If you are not subscribed, how did you post on this mailing list?
GPG does not initiate encryption, your MUA (Thunderbird) does. Also, GPG
does not require your own key, but the recipient's key for encryption.
Unless you Bcc yourself or add a default encrypt-to-key in GPG settings,
you won't even be able to read the encrypted message.
What is "the" plugin? Enigmail? In any case, check the plugin settings,
GPG is not the root cause for your problems, the Thunderbird plugin
calling GPG is. Change the plugin settings, or disable it.
P.S.: Please keep replies on-list.

That's quite unusual. Thanks to the list admins for their work. Still,
I personally (!) don't think there is any need to accommodate non-
subscribers. The whole notion of "I want information but cannot be
bothered to subscribe" rubs me the wrong way.

Used the wrong address to post? Anyway, speaking of annoying things:
top-posting and full quotes come to mind. :-)

It is not about what is "easier for some", but I am not going to spend
more time discussing Netiquette with you. We have been doing things in
a certain way in mailing lists - since the 1980s - for good reasons.

@_subject: Why would I want S/MIME? 
The main reason I can think of is the fact that there are mail clients
that don't support PGP without significant hassle (or not at all), but
do support S/MIME, e.g. iOS devices. Not sure if you count this as a
specialized case of "easy setup and use".
