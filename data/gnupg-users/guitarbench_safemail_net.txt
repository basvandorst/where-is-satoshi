@_subject: How Do I Export Secring & Pubring Armored Files? 
I've wasted about seven hours trying to do this, with no luck.
I want exportable secring.asc and pubring.asc armored text files of my entire public and private keyrings.  None of the graphical front ends seem to do it, nor can I find a command line _anywhere_ that says how to do it.  Incredible!
I am operating in Windows XP.
Could someone please provide me with command lines to:
1:  Extract an armored text pubring.asc from pubring.pkr
2:  Extract an armored text secring.asc from secring.skr
Many thanks for a quick solution!

At this point, I'm completely flummoxed.  I have PGP and GPG keyrings scattered all over this computer, and I have no way of telling which ones are actually the GPG keyrings being used and maintained by WinPT, nor under which identifying extension.  There's a window in WinPT that nominally tells this, but it's too short to display the path & filename and doesn't expand.
By searching, the most recently modified keyrings are those I mentioned.
I'm trying to import a keyring into Quicksilver's PGPed nym function, and on top of all this, it will not import GnuPG secure keys, apparently.
I've figured out a kludgy workaround for this, namely blowing off the GPG keys and making a new set in PGP, but most of my problem seems to be from the various PGP/GPG incompatibilities.  With luck, I can import the PGP keys into GPG.
Thanks for your help.
