I'm having some problem while trying to use an hkps pool server as keyserver.

i have download the cacert file from the site and i verify that i have the good one while testing with curl.
here is the configuration of my client :
keyserver hkps://hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net
keyserver-options ca-cert-file=/pathto/.gnupg/sks-keyservers.netCA.pem
keyserver-options no-honor-keyserver-url
keyserver-options debug
keyserver-options verbose
keyserver-options verbose
auto-key-locate keyserver
keyid-format 0xlong
verify-options show-uid-validity
list-options show-uid-validity
default-preference-list SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 SHA224 AES256 AES192 AES CAST5 ZLIB BZIP2 ZIP Uncompressed
personal-digest-preferences SHA512
cert-digest-algo SHA512
and here is the error i have :
gpg2 --recv-keys 0xD9B53384
gpg: requesting key 0xD9B53384 from hkps server hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net

I already have this line in my config file. Finaly i found the solution : since im running macgogtools its seems that the gpg bin which is coming within is not working fine. I install the gnupg binaries and then use its gpg bin and all work fine.

Personnaly i've installed gpgtools in order to use it with mail mac os application.
and it is working fine unless i try to use an hkps server. with http there is no problem.
i dont know the real reason why the gpgtools version is not working since on their site they said all is ok : i think that there is a bug while trying to use the ca-cert options.
