Why does WinPT require the GnuPG executable from your site?  How is your copy of the executable different from others?

 A scroll of the prophet Krisse Selén arrived,  Saying:
The fundamental problem is that PGP 2.x uses the IDEA symetrical
encryption algorithm.  IDEA is under patent until 2007.
The GPL (Gnu Public Licence) prohibits the inclusion of patented
algorithms or software.  Hence IDEA cannot be included in GnuPG until
the patent expires in 2007.
The same situation existed for RSA keys until August 2000.  Prior to
that the RSA algorithm was patented and was not included in GnuPG.
After the patent expired the next release of GnuPG included support
for RSA keys.  I expect the same thing to happen with IDEA support
when the IDEA patent expires in 2007.

Try gpgv "%1"
Quotation marks are often necessary in Win9x to pass long file names

 a scroll of the prophet Werner Koch arrived,
 saying,
Fairly new linux user here.  I tried to compile 1.2.2rc2 on Mandrake Linux 6.0 (pgcc-2.91.66 19990314 egcs-1.1.2 release; glibc 2.1.1).  I have had no problems installing 1.2.0 or 1.2.1 from source.
Doing "./configure; make"
quits in make with: gcc -DGNUPG_LIBEXECDIR="\"/usr/local/libexec/gnupg\"" -g -O2 -Wall   -

Being fairly new to linux I'm not sure what to do next but I thought I should notify the dev team.
If you need any further information about my system to help trace this then just ask.
