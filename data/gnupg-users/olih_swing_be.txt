@_subject: gnupg 1.0.5 on solaris intel with egd 
I have to use a gnupg 1.0.5 on solaris 8 intel Box. Egd was installed to
generate entropy.
My question is simple i think:
When should the egd daemon run ?
when i generate new key ok
When i encrypt some files with symmetrics cyphers ?
When i encrypt some files with a private key ?
always when gpg will be call ?
thanks for your answer
