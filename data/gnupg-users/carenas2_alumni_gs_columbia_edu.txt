hello all.
several months ago, i imported my key to canonical's (company behind
ubuntu distribution) launchpad.  since then i cannot refresh my key: $ gpg --refresh-keys 0xe0de64c5
gpg: requesting key E0DE64C5 from http server keyserver.ubuntu.com
gpgkeys: key DE46B91FBD9FE4532CB077094D40B8A2E0DE64C5 not found on
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: Total number processed: 0
for some reason, gpgkeys is using my fingerprint as my keyid.
