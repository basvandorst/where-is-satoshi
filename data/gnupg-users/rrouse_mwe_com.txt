@_subject: excavating an existing installation 
I have taken over administration of a system that uses GnuPG to encrypt a few data feeds sent to outside vendors. The person who set it up is long gone, so I have no idea what was used for secret keys. The only public keys I am aware of are because they used via the "-recipient" option.
We are moving this to a new server, so I need to be able to set this up "as is" on a new server. I also need to create new keys.
What can I do to "reverse engineer" the current setup?
