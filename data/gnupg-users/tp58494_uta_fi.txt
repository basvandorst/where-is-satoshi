@_subject: post-installation questions 
Yesterday, I installed GnuPG 1.0.6 on my Debian GNU/Linux system (2.2r). =
think I got GnuPG installed successfully, but two details confuse me.
I ran "make check". All the tests were passed except for one. This line
was printed out, "'Expect' needed but not found - test failed." What does
this mean, and is it serious?
This may be more serious. Everytime I run gpg, it prints out this
complaint, "Warning: using insecure memory." How serious is this, and wha=
could be done about it?
Thank you for the help.
Best wishes,

@_subject: problem with Perl script piping data from gpg 
I am writing a Perl (CGI) script that would encrypt data using gpg. In an
attempt to avoid the problems with bidirectional pipes, my script
creates a temporary file (the name of which will be known). Then I would
like gpg to encrypt this file and print the "result" to stdout, where I
would save this to a scalar variable. (This may be a clumsy way of
accomplishing this task, but what would you expect from a beginning Perl
programmer? :)
Let 'tempo' be the temporary file created. 'tuope' is my user ID. So I
have these lines of code:
open(KRYPT, "gpg -ea -r tuope tempo |") or
    die "Could not run program: $!\n";
while() {
    $crypt .=3D $_;
My problem is that, instead of writing to stdout, gpg creates a file
'tempo.asc'. (I tested the code at home, but it never gave the result I
wanted. :() What could be done to "remedy" this code? :)

@_subject: GnuPG, GPG - the difference? 
What is the semantic difference between `GnuPG' and `GPG' (or gpg)? How d=
the maintainers and developers want these two words to be distinguished?

@_subject: suitable encryption etc. algorithms for beginner 
Hi, all!
In your opinion, which block ciphers, hash functions etc. would be
suitable for a fledgling cryptographer to study and tinker with?

When one is talking about keys, which way is the proper (and accurate?)
one? `GPG public key', `GnuPG public key', or `PGP public key'?
Thanks for your time.
