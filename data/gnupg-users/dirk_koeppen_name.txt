@_subject: Can I replace a main key by a sub key? 
Dear friends of GNUPG,
I do have a main key which is DSA and subkeys for RSA and ELG-E.
Now I would like to use the sign-service at  which unfortunately does not support DSA.
Is there a way to make my main DSA key a subkey and the sub RSA key my main key ?
Thanks for your help and best regards,
