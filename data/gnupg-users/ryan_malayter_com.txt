The factoring algorithm with the best running time is still the GNFS.
See GNFS has a running time of:
O(e^((64/9*log(n))^1/3 * (log(log(n)))^2/3)
When you subsitute 2^(keylength) for n in that equation, I get the
following table for RSA key strengths and the comparable symmetric key

@_subject: ECC 
I don't like being a wet blanket, but as Bruce Schneier likes to point
out, a smart attacker (the NSA certainly qualifies) will not expend
resources trying to crack your crypto at all. No matter what crypto
you use, so long as the crypto is reasonably strong and not trivial to
break. There are far weaker points in the system (specifically:
pass-phrases, endpoint hardware, operating systems, client
applications, and your personal resistance to torture or other forms
of coercion).
We all love crypto here, and it is fun to compare algorithms and
protocols and what-not. Dream up attack scenarios. And crytpo does
indeed make us safer from a lot of attacks, such as those where
adversaries only have the means to intercept or forge communications.
As such, crypto is a good countermeasure against the average Joe
bad-guy out there on the Internet.
But to think that this algorithm vs. that algorithm is going to stop a
very smart or well-funded attacker is folly. The crypto isn't the weak
point in the system. Which is why the uproar over vulnerabilities in
SHA-1 are (currently) silly, as far as I'm concerned. Yes, we should
think about replacing SHA-1 fairly soon. But no need to panic jsut
yet. It's still far easier to compromise a electronic system using
other nefarious means. Doing 2^63 hash operations to find collisions
isn't a cost-effective attack, even for the NSA. Unless the end result
is extraordinarily valuable (like, say, being able to forge orders to
another nation's military assets.)
If you're *really* paranoid, you should think about ways to not have
enemies like the NSA at all. Or at the very least, find the best ways
to fly beneath their radar completely. The same goes for just about
any other government entity in any nation. Because crypto won't
protect you from the NSA, the DGSE, or even a reasonably sized
organized crime syndicate.

Werner, I can confirm that large file (> 4GB) support does not work on
Win32 without using file redirection, at least in version 1.4.1. Did
you make a change to enable 64-bit file sizes in a later version?
I would love to help fix this issue, but as I have not worked with C
much since 1996, I can probably really only contribute lots of
testing. Are there debug builds of GPG for win32 that might be useful
in this regard? Or will using "-vv" give the kind of information
Thank you for any help/ideas,

This is surpisingly *not* a Windows issue. We have 200+ GB database
files on many of our database servers. All using NTFS.
I think the issue is that GnuPG is using a 32-bit DWORD file pointer
and the older file functions. Werner mentioned using GetFIleSize, but
the platform SDK indicates that you need to use GetFileSizeEx to
enable files greater than 2^32 bytes:
Werner, do you use GetFileSize or GetFileSizeEx? There are also
WriteFileEx and any number of other -Ex file-related functions to
handle files larger than 4 GB.

@_subject: Automated processes 
I do use GnuPG for automated decryption for one batch process. To do
so, I use a low-value, single-purpose key that has *no pass phrase*
and very strict permissions on the secring.gpg file. This file is then
placed in a folder that is encrypted at the file system level (using
Windows EFS).
I think this is about as secure as you can make automatic decryption
without trusted hardware being involved. An attacker with the ability
to run code using the same account as my script would be able to read
the secret key from the encrypted file system.
Using the --passphrase-fd option would offer roughly the same security
- that is, permissions on the script file would be your only
protection, just as the permissions on secring.gpg are my only real

@_subject: Using other compression algos with GnuPG 
The RAR compression algorithm proprietary and closed source, so it is
not likely to make it into any standards. RARlabs has refused for
years to allow anyone else to make RAR encoders (although they exist
in violation of the RARlabs license).
See A much better choice would be the LZMA algorithm from 7zip, which is
open-source and unpatented. It compresses with similar efficiency and
speed to RAR.
In any case, though, such slow-but-compact algorithms are really only
useful for archival purposes. While I have used PGP for some
archiving, this is not the most common usage of PGP, and probably not
an OpenPGP design goal.
There are much faster file encryption tools than PGP out there. We
actually use 7zip to compress and encrypt backups for offsite storage,
as its AES implementation is so much more efficient than GnuPG's.

Bzip2 does not compress better than RAR or LZMA, at least with my test corpus.
See 7-zip (using LZMA) produced the smalles files in this test, followed
by RAR. bzip produced files 30% larger than 7-zip.

@_subject: GPG Outlook Plug-In and Signatures 
Actually, when I sign an HTML email with GPGOL, and send it to my
Gmail account, I seem to get this on the receiving end:
1) A plain text version of the message, signed in-line.
2) An attachment of .HTML type, which contains the original unaltered
HTML message.
3) A second attachment, which is seems to be an ASCII detached
signature of the first attached HTML file.
Does any other OpenPGP client handle this "attachment" result? Or do
you need to save the attachments and manually verify the detached
signature? GPGOL itself doesn't seem to read this "exploded" format,
even though it creates it. GPGOL only verifies the plain text version.

But unfortunately they're here to stay. RFC 2557 is now listed as
"standards track".
I used to rail against HTML mail myself, but all my reasoning was
soundly rebuffed by the CEO, CFO, my Mom, my sister, and really just
about everybody else. They want their "pretty fonts and pictures" in
their email. Security, legibility, and compatibility be damned.
Now, well, I gave up fighting that battle. I still write mostly
plain-text email, but reply in HTML when sent it. But even I originate
an HTML email or two when a bulleted list or table is needed. It can
add value to the content of a message when used judiciously.

@_subject: RFCs, standards, 
Many RFCs *are* standards. Those that are not are identified as
"informational". Even the IETF thinks so, identifying them as the
basis for "the Internet Standards Process". See:
The only reason you can read this message is because RFC 2822 is
universally recognized as the *standard* protocol for email.
This statement makes no sense to me. Surely you are not suggesting
that HTML is incompatible with cryptography? That's like saying apples
are incompatible with cooking. Not only is it untrue, but you're not
even really comparing similar entities.
Again I must state that one has little to do with the other. MHTML's
MIME format may not play nice with PGP/MIME's encapsultation format,
but it didn't *have* to be that way. S/MIME, for example, seems to
make provisions for playing nicely with other MIME structures such as
MHTML, as well as arbitrary attachments.

I'm not sure, but it seems no MUA or plug-in I have tried handles it correctly.
This very well may be the case; it could just be an implementation
issue. PGP/MIME seems to be based on RFC1847, which states:
   ...The first body part may contain any valid MIME content
   type, labeled accordingly...
So, it would seem the "first body part" could be of type
multipart/alternative (HTML). But I am unsure; as
multipart/alternative is needed in the message header of an HTML
email. RFC 1847 requires "multipart/signed" or "multipart/encrytped"
in the message header. I think that may be what causes the troubles.
Whatever the case, I always seem to have issues with attachments and
HTML messages using PGP, but not with S/MIME. Although that may be a
result of the limited selection of MUAs and software I use at my
company. (Thuderbird, Outlook+GPGOL and Outlook plus the commercial
PGP Desktop v9).

@_subject: GPG and PGP Compatibility 
GnuPG, as well as recent versions of the commercial PGP-branded
products from PGP Corporation, implement the OpenPGP standard. They
are in almost all cases able to read each other's data, and
decrypt-verify that data.
We use both implementations at my company. I have tested sending
signed and encrypted email from a PGP desktop user to a GPG4Win user,
and vice-versa, and was able to verify at least plain-text messages,
as well as .sigs on attachments.
One small difficulty arises in that GnuPG tends to use.gpg as its main
file extension for encrypted files, whereas PGP Corp.'s products use
.pgp. But that can be overcome with configuration settings, either in
one of the programs, or by telling Windows what programs to associate
with which file extensions.

As far as I know, Certicom and others control many patents related to
ECC in the USA, Canada, and several other jurisdictions. Which is
probably why there is no effort to add these to an "open standard"
such as PGP that might then be patent-encumbered.
The OpenSSL project recetly added ECC to its portfolio of algorithms,
though, so someone must have done the investigatory work to determine
that the OpenSSL implementation was not patented.
