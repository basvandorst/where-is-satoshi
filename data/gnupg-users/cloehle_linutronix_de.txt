I want to use gpg to encrypt a potentially large file to some
(cloud-like) storage provider, the recipients are not known at the time
of uploading.
What I want to do is to send the encrypted session key of the file to a
recipient, when I 'add' them, without re-uploading or even touching the
original (encrypted) file.
This should be possible, does anyone know how to? I'm also open to other

That's what I would do if I had no other choice. The real downside is
that it doesn't follow a standard(like openpgp) and I will have to write
more code on the client side, compared to a standard openpgp solution.
It just seems like there is no reason why separating the session key and
the data wouldn't be supported, but I couldn't find anything about it.

Thanks for your reply(and all the others of course).
Personally I'm going to use non-pgp AES probably, although I'm not quite
content with that. As I said, this seems like a feature that would make
sense, I might work on it myself if I find the time.
