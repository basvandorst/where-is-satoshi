@_subject: Installing on a Virtual Host 
Hi -
We are trying to install GPG on a site that is virtual hosted
(Linux Redhat system).  We do not have access to the root and
wish install in the assigned directory - /home above the /www.
1. Can this be done?
2. If so, are there any links to sites/pages
that can explain how to install this way.
Please CC a reply to bill  - we are not subscribed

Thanks in advance and Happy Holidays to all!!
