@_subject: order of uids 
Sorry if this gets posted again.  I was posting with the wrong address
and the first attempt didn't get through.  This one should!
By default GnuPG makes the most recently added uid the default uid.
To change this, use the edit-key mode.
gpg --edit-key then, select the uid by entering the number before it:
pub  1024D/6B21489A  created: 2000-01-20 expires: never      trust:
sub  1024g/DBC7552B  created: 2000-01-20 expires: never     rev! subkey has been revoked: 2002-02-01
sub  2048g/5EB197C8  created: 2002-02-01 expires: never     (1)  Josh Huber (2)  [revoked] Josh Huber (3)  Josh Huber (4)  Josh Huber (5). Josh Huber (6)  Josh Huber Command> 4
pub  1024D/6B21489A  created: 2000-01-20 expires: never      trust:
sub  1024g/DBC7552B  created: 2000-01-20 expires: never     rev! subkey has been revoked: 2002-02-01
sub  2048g/5EB197C8  created: 2002-02-01 expires: never     (1)  Josh Huber (2)  [revoked] Josh Huber (3)  Josh Huber (4)* Josh Huber (5). Josh Huber (6)  Josh Huber Then use the "primary" command to change the primary uid.  GnuPG will
ask for your passphrase, and the preferences will be changed.
Well, you know your address is also in the From header :)
