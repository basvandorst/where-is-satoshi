@_subject: Revoking Keys 
Recently I generated some keypairs with their relevant revocation certificates, but was not able to save my new keyrings before the PC crashed :-(
I am therefore dependent on using an old keyring without these new keys plus the revocation certificates.  I am not clear exactly how to revoke the keys I've generated and now have lost.  I've looked up the man pages and the html howto but they just refer to generating a revocation certificate and use
But how do I revoke keys on the keyserver so I can generate new ones?

No, that's just the point.  I have the revocation certificates, I can get the public keys from keyservers but (obviously) not the secret keys and I didn't have a chance to save them.  Using an old saved keyring I have some old public and secret keys, but not the recently generated If I can revoke the keys then I can generate new keypairs (and save them this time!)

First of all, are you using Windows or Linux, and if Linux, which desktop (KDE, Gnome, etc)?
