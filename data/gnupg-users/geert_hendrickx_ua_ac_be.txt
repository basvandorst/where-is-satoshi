@_subject: can you deny you sent a signed e-mail? 
Hi, GPG gives us a method for signing our e-mails so the addressee can be
sure it was sent by yourself.  But what about the inverse question: can you deny that you sent an
e-mail which has been signed using you secret key?  Not that I need this :-) it's just out of curiousity.
