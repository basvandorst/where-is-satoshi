@_subject: controlling the use of subkeys 
To side-step the arguments here. Mike's just a Gentoo developer that
wants to sign stuff. He doesn't care how it works, so long as it works,
and everybody is happy with the security of it.
I'm the Gentoo developer that is busy (with far too many things)
creating a full plan of action regarding key usage and management.
The only stumbling block on the part of GnuPG itself thus far is the
need for an Assuan interface to GnuPG itself (not gpgsm) - gpgme is too
slow since it exec()s fresh copies of gpg each time you make a call, and
we we want to verify lots of ASCII-armoured files on demand (potentially
30k of them), this hurts badly.
*waves at Mike*
Mike, to answer your question directly,
Put it in your environment and your make.conf.
If that doesn't work, give me a shout directly.

@_subject: Printing Keys and using OCR. 
To chime in for a moment, I have CDR backups starting in mid-1995 (doing
backups once a month approximately). Of those earliest 10 discs, all of
them are still readable, but the media is visibly degrading in 50% of
- 2 discs (both Dysan, with a gold-looking surface) have the surface foil
  flaking off around the edges
- 3 discs (various) show imperfections in the coloured layer, blotchy.
The burner that I had would only reliably burn the first ~500Mb of the
discs, so the foil and other problems around the edges have not impacted
my data yet.
An interesting twist on this, is that some of my newer drives fail to
read the old discs properly. The older drives work fine however.

@_subject: is there any remote possibility to recover passphrase? 
Reduce the input size smartly if you know some parts of your own
paraphrase. I had to do that a while ago after a bad bit of mistyping
(don't set a passphrase on a brand new keyboard with a slightly
different layout than you are used to).

@_subject: Security Concern - Open Source Binaries 
For Gentoo, if you use the official rsync mirrors (rsync.gentoo.org)
instead of the community mirrors (rsync$N.$CC.gentoo.org), you get one
additional layer of protection, but I'd say that our overall signing
rate isn't as high as I'd like it to be. It varies between 40-80% of
packages as changes are made over time.
For many distributions, the mirrors are a severe weak point at them
The replay is of note, because it does not require defeating a
signature, but only sending old data to prospective attack targets
instead of the latest version.
The CCS2008 and ;login: February 2009 reports are the best ones to read.
The status of Gentoo signing plans are linked from there (disclaimer:
I'm the driving force behind them).

@_subject: cannot pass in input and passphrase at the same time in batch 
Not really 100% usable yet, but the correct solution to this is the
server mode accessed via --command-fd.
IIRC VERIFY and MESSAGE are the only primitives implemented to date for
that, so you'd need to do some work there.

@_subject: WoT cluster analysis tools? 
Not sure if such things exist already, but hopefully they do, and
somebody could point me to them...
To go into a little more detail, I'd like to examine the WoT as it
exists between Gentoo developers, and try to work out a reasonable way
to close it for resurrecting our long-dead keyring.
Specifically interested in isolation of local clusters within the sets of
keys. Two sets of keys, one of current developers only, and a second of
all developers, past and present.
Looking around, I find a few WoT graphing sites, but none of the tools
used by said sites.

@_subject: Efficent batch fetching with verification? 
What's a reasonably efficient way to fetch a lot of keys, by
fingerprint, from keyserver pools with HKPS?
Presently, the code is effectively this:
...cat-list-of-fingerprints... | xargs gpg --recv
This has the downside of causing many execs.
As an alternate, it was suggested that I could do manual HTTP fetches
for each of the fingerprints, then verify the keyserver returned only
the correct keys. This however, still runs into the problem of calling
gpg many times.
gpgme does an exec behind the scenes, for each call, so I'm wondering
what other solutions are out there.
Most useful would be feeding a list of fingerprints to
--recv via a file descriptor, or feeding entire commands to a long-running GPG instance (but Assuan doesn't support RECV).
The Assuan part echos a much older request of mine, that more operations
should be available via Assuan, to efficiently sign or verify many

You missed xargs itself, this mostly centers around the command-line
length limit. I can get in about ~3200 fingerprints per GPG call.
GnuPG 2.2.1, findutils/xargs 4.6.0.
Thanks for the idea of --no-auto-check-trustdb, I did miss that and it
helps for speedups.

@_subject: Efficent batch fetching with verification? 
Yes, the older versions do perform much worse, but even with gnupg2.2,
each exec of gpg is still at least 100ms, which adds up over time.
Part this may be having a huge keyring present (50k+ keys).

@_subject: New keyserver at keys.openpgp.org - what's your take? 
Yes, from the perspective of Gentoo Linux, we've recently spun up
dedicated keyservers intended for  keys only. And being able
to include our own CA for approved signatures would fit well with future
