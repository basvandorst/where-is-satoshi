@_subject: importing a secret key 
So after an unfortunate incident where a space was where it was not supposed to be in a rm -rf statement, i lost my ~ which had my secret Unfortunately i also discovered that last night was the latest full backup, and the tape decided that it does not feel like giving me my data back. from the previous incrementals that i was able to find was able to recover my  pubring.gpg and trustdb.pgp
So this leaves me with a floppy disk that i had stores my revocation cert and my secret key on. Both in ASCII armored format.
$ cat redconcepts.priv.key -----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----
Version: GnuPG v1.2.1 (GNU/Linux)
-----END PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----
$ gpg redconcepts.priv.key gpg: WARNING: using insecure memory!
gpg: please see  for more information
sec  1024D/C93A57EA 2003-09-02 Munir Nassar (Ein) ssb  1024g/578D6A75 2003-09-02 so i tried to import this key using gpg --import redconcepts.priv.key
but this did not seem to work:
$ gpg --sign
gpg: secret key parts are not available
gpg: no default secret key: general error
gpg: signing failed: general error
$ gpg --list-sec
sec# 1024D/C93A57EA 2003-09-02 Munir Nassar (Ein) ssb  1024g/578D6A75 2003-09-02
notice the # after sec?
so i added "default-key C93A57EA" to the options file but that did any ideas? or should i just send the revcert in?
