@_subject: GnuPG doesn't work with all user accounts 
I'm trying to send crypted Mails with PHP and GnuPG. I've installed GnuPG
imported PublicKeys and encrypted mails. It all works fine.
Now, I wanted to add a Public key and this doesn't work anymore. The command --list-keys gives me:
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=03)
gpg: read_keyblock: read error: invalid packet
gpg: enum_keyblocks(read) failed: invalid keyring
With user root or other users --list-keys works fine. Only as the User of my
Webserver I get these errors.
The strange thing is, that encryption with the PublicKey I already imported
(some time ago) still works fine. I'm only not able to import new keys or --list-keys.
in my php file I use the following command:
"wwwrun" -r "Peter.Bromsberg
this works.
Has anybody an idea?
many thanks
Michael Schmidt
