@_subject: Signature mismatch for secp256k1 
I'm trying to use gpg-agent to sign for cryptocurrency purposes, using
the secp256k1 curve. I've tried a few hashes, but one of them gets a
different resulting signature than other implementations. I've compared
against libsecp256k1 and nodejs elliptic library.
I won't post the code here, but I also put up a question o stackexchange
on the same topic which lists my attempt:
Any pointers would be appreciated. I'm guessing it's some silly
oversight of mine, but I can't spot it.

@_subject: Which keyserver 
I wasn't aware of WKD, thanks for the heads up.
Is it possible to define multiple sources of keys with WKD, for example
with a dns TXT record? The use-case would be if the main server is down,
alternative places to get it.
