@_subject: Safety of the key and it's length 
You seem to be referring to the size that the exported public key
occupies on disk... I'm not an expert by any stretch, but I believe
that you find the public keys of others to be larger because they
include all of the signatures that the key owners have accumulated on
them. Your brand new key would lack this extra "baggage".
Of course, if I've made any error here, I'd very much appreciate
clarification from those more experienced.
Good luck,
