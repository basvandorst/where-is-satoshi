@_subject: [Alpine-info] Native OpenPGP integration with Alpine 
There was an effort to integrate OpenPGP into re-alpine. I know it was
unfinished code, I think that most of what is needed is in place, so I
would try to figure out what happened to that effort as a first approach
into concluding that effort.
If you need my assistance while working on this project, let me know. I'll
be glad to help.
