Hash: SHA1
Hi, All
Ive recently started using Enigmail in T-Bird with GNUPG 1.4.0
Now the funny thing is, that when I use OpenPGP Key Management I see my
own Key Pub end Sec twice (2x). Also any imported other public keys are
shown in duplicate.
The same appears with gpg --list-keys etc.

Why are the keys appearing twice ??
Is this a bug in GNUPG ?
