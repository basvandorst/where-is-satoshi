Just received word back from a friend of mine who's a law professor
focusing in electronic civil liberties, and is a former Commissioner of
the FCC to boot.  He's skeptical that ITAR/EAR enforcement will affect
U.S. hackers participating in libre software development.  More than
that I can't/shouldn't say, since he was writing off-the-cuff in a
personal email rather than carefully drafting remarks for public
He rather likes writing short essays on law.  If there's interest, I'll
try and talk him into writing something layman-friendly about ITAR/EAR,
cryptography, and the First Amendment.
