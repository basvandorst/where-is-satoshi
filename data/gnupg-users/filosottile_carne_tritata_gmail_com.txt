I have this situation
pub 1024D/01A82A13 created: 2008-09-21 expires: mai utilizzo: SCA
sub* 2048g/E159FB03 created: 2008-09-21 expires: mai utilizzo: E
i have the secret key 01A82A13, but not E159FB03
what should i do? (replace subkey with other, remove it - the result is
that i can't encrypt)
what does SCA and E mean? how can i change them?
Thanks, FiloSottile
