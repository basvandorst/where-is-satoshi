RSA-S and RSA-E keys are deprecated, keys using these algorithm

The format allows it, but implementations may enforce strict

@_subject: DNS keyserver (was Re: gnupg-1.0.7: keyserver subdir?) 
I have one major concern:
The current approach is slower than HKP.
DNS is only more efficient if you stay below the 512 bytes (including
overhead) limit.  If answers get bigger, a full TCP connection is
required *in* *addtion* to the initial request/answer pair. :-/
And I pretty much doubt that servers cache RRs which are a couple of
kilobytes large, so the current approach appears to be rather
pointless.  Sorry.
It might work better if you just store minimal revocation certificates
(those used by GnuPG) in DNS.

If you really want to create your own scheme, you should use
successive encryption using one time pads (giving each officer (except
one) an OTP, and one officer gets the encrypted private key).
Your approach based on simple linear algebra might interact badly with
the actual cryptography.

It happens with 1.0.7a-cvs, too.
Key IDs can collide (especially 32 bit ones). :-/
No, the summary at the end clearly shows 'Imported: 1', and the
additional key shows up in the key ring.
If you want to experiment, you can use the 0xdeadbeef keys (but you
have to specify --allow-non-selfsigned-uid because two of them lack a
proper self-signature).
There's even a web page with further candidates for experiments:

@_subject: Automatic resyncing of keys? 
Yes, of course, but I don't think it's desirable that --refresh-keys
imports new keys.  GnuPG can do nothing about receiving these
additional keys, but the correct approach would be to discard the
unwanted ones.
It's not too hard to make colliding 64 bit IDs for V3 keys.

@_subject: Cousin to --no-literal 
Is there a reverse option which stops processing after the utmost
OpenPGP package has been removed (the signature or encryption) and
emits the contained raw OpenPGP packet?
This comes in handy for reencrypting mailing lists (which may thus
preserve signatures).
I've got a patch for an older GnuPG version and wonder if I should
update it to 1.0.7, but perhaps someone is willing to rewrite it for
the official GnuPG version from scratch?

@_subject: Will GPG use Dual Processors under Windows ? 
Try to turn off compression.
No, it doesn't.  Distributing symmetric encryption/decryption across
multiple general-purpose CPUs seems complicated to me.
However, if you aren't strictly CPU bound, a second processor could
increase throughput, but not substantially, I'm afraid.
However, there's a trivial approach to get something better: split the
file (or the stream) on the sending site and encrypt it in parallel,
using two processes.  (This assumes that you can change the data

@_subject: WARNING: message was not integrity protected 
This warning is generated if a encrypted + signed message is
decrypted.  The MDC is probably omitted because the signature is more
than sufficient, so nothing bad is going on, but the message is a bit
confusing nevertheless (and dilutes the severity of the message in
other contexts).

Are there any sample implementations (for text console and X11) that

somewhere in the =C4gypten project is probably out of question.

The patch is incomplete, see below.
In addition, gpg-agent does not do what I want: I start gpg-agent on
one terminal, and invoke gpg on some other (or even in a pipe, without
a terminal).  gpg-agemt does not query for the passphrase on the first
terminal, but tries to use the terminal on which GnuPG is invoked,
which seems to fail badly.
Or is there something I do not understand?

In my case, screen would tell me that I'd have to look at a certain
window.  I don't think such a setup is so obscure that it's unique.
My problem is that I plan to run GnuPG from within Emacs, and usually,
there's either no terminal at all, or a very dumb one (which is in no
way sufficient for pinentry-curses).  That's why the current approach
just does not work.
Again, for my needs, a gpg-agent option would be the best choice.

Mutt comes to my mind.  Gnus supports it too, but only in a very
limited way (the user interface needs *much* improvement).

Really?  I don't know about that.
My first attempt failed because the FSF was unwilling to deal with the
issue.  We might have triggered some kind of internal response, but we
haven't received *any* statement from the FSF USA after we had
convinced RMS that there is indeed a legal difficulty.
More or less, yes.  However, my main motivation is different: gpg.el is the wrong approach
from a technical point of view.  You might not have noticed, but the
first versions were able to support a traditional PGP 2.6.x command
line as well, just by reconfiguring it.  As a consequence, gpg.el
doesn't rely on --status-fd output, and it is difficult to add
additional features in a consistent way.  (The abstract command line
interface results in a lot of complexity, which is completely
unnecessary from the current perspective.)
So IMHO, gpg.el is just not worth all the trouble, especially since
most people who need it can grab it and install it (which is easy
compared to all the fuss you have to go through to get a decent Gnus

If I send someone a message, and I've got his key, Gnus doesn't
suggest to encrypt the message.
If I request encryption, Gnus doesn't let me chose the keys to use.
Sometimes, Gnus flags a signature which is valid as invalid (and IIRC
vice versa).
Gnus does not deal with trust at all.  From the Gnus perspective, all
keys are trusted.
Gnus does not include all diagnotic output it receives from GnuPG by
default.  It should, crucial information might be omitted otherwise.
Gnus cannot create symmetrically encrypted messages, I think.
Gnus does not deal properly with encrypted messages which do not use
OpenPGP/MIME (that's my impression, maybe it's a local configuration
And so on. :-/

It's still almost impossible to create a terminal window when a GnuPG
process created by 'call-process' needs a passphrase.
Doesn't work for me, I'm afraid.  GnuPG indicates that there was a
gpg-agent failure and falls back to normal mode, and gpg-agent prints
the following error message:
gpg-agent[4854]: command get_passphrase failed: assuan error
In addition, I'd like to use --keep-tty without --daemon; this should
make gpg-agent (or curses pinentry) much more robust. Otherwise
strange things may happen (two applications access the PTY at the same
time, reading).
BTW, gpg-agent is totally hosed with symmetric encryption (GnuPG
crashes because there's no key ID).  And unfortunately, symmetric
encryption is the prime GnuPG application for me these days.
