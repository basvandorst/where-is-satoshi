Well, the severity of the problem depends on whether your "forgotten"
keys are available on the public keyservers.
If not, you're quite fine: Just generate a new key and distribute this
to your friends along with a note to delete the old key.
If yes, you're quite screwed as it will stay there forever: New contacts
will not know which key to choose when they look your name up on the
keyservers. People might be smart enough to use the newer of the two
keys. If you don't rely so much on the keyservers to distribute your
key, it is also less of a problem.
This *will* sort itself out, however, after the email exchange with them
has begun: If you receive a message encrypted to your old key, you would
email them back to use the new one instead. It is just an inconvenience
to set up the "communication channel" to you. Once your communication
partner has the correct key in his local keyring, everything will be fine.
In any case, create a new key. You might change something in the UIDs
but it is not really necessary. The creation date can serve as a
discriminator between the two keys.
For your new key, immediately after generating it, create a "revocation
certificate" and store it in a safe place. You can later use it to
revoke the key without a passphrase, see the man-page and other docs for
more details. It is also extremely helpful to set an expiration date to
your key (you can alwys extend it and re-distribute the key).

The "verify" will create the secret key stub (probably there are other

You could do that, but gpg can also be used to handle piped standard

The command line would be roughly like:
gpg --armor --recipient KEYID --encrypt

Hello GnuPG users,
Is there a convenient way to access the data objects of the OpenPGP smartcard? The best thing I know is to use "gpg --card-edit" to get at the PIN-protected DOs, which is cumbersome and does not give a very machine-friendly output...
What I am thinking of is the following:
The card with its PIN counters represents a protection against brute force attempts, that is not available to other software-only crypto applications like EncFS, Truecrypt etc. Consequently, the card PIN can be shorter than the overlong passphrases needed to secure those Now, it would be really nice to store a long passphrase into one of the PIN-protected data objects and have the possibility to pipe that to one of those applications.
This way, e.g., a Truecrypt volume would be protected by a very long passphrase, while the owner has the convenience of "unlocking" that passphrase using his/her shorter smartcard PIN.
Can this be accomplished using some scripting? Or may I suggest to add "--card-do1" through "--card-do4" as new commands to GnuPG which would print the respective string to standard output after asking for the PIN when applicable?
Thanks for listening :-)

If *you* send, it is AES; if RJH sent, it would be 3DES.
It doesn't matter if your key indicates a preference for 3DES, as RJH's implementation will assume that you have the availability to handle 3DES, it will happily chose that.
Maybe, the "preference" setting on keys should be renamed to "capability". In practice, the ordering of algorithms in your key's "preference" string does not have soo much influence about what others will use when sending messages to you. The mechanism practically only guarantees that you can handle whatever is sent to you.
That user should get professional advice in implementing a security solution for his/her extraordinary needs. Plain GnuPG/OpenPGP is not necessarily the best choice for such an advanced scenario. Mind you that "PGP" means "pretty good privacy" and not "perfect global protection". For most people, however, the "pretty good" offered by OpenPGP equals to "way more than they'll ever need".
If you want to keep compatibility to OpenPGP, you should simply accept that you cannot completely control what algorithm is used for *incoming* messages. You can completely avoid sending 3DES encrypted messages, if you prefer.
If any particular user group finds that 3DES is unsafe for their needs, they can arrange for it that it is never used in communications between them. (Same goes for SHA-1 or uncompressed or ...) You might consider to use a modified gpg that warns you when it would choose 3DES for a message and give you the option of encrypting anyway or not sending the You might even want to modify GnuPG in a way that is incorporates a custom algorithm, such as Quintuple-AES or an AES-Serpent-Twofish-RC6-MARS cascade and distribute that within the user group which you target.
These changes of behaviour IMHO could even be done within the limits of the RFC. Alternatively, GnuPG could be modified in way that ignores the interoperability issues, which is probably fine if that version is only distributed within a closed group where you can control these issues for cu, Sven

You have the option of specifying "trusted introducers" (i.e. keys signed by those are automatically considered valid by you), but you don't have to.
To me it looks like the two "trust" concepts of GnuPG are somewhat intermingled in this discussion:
- First, there's the "trust" in a UID which means that you trust the assiciation betweed the key and the person identified by the UID. This is usually expressed by signing the UID in question. Another term would be "validity" of the key, IIRC.
- Second, there's the "owner trust" assigned to a key, meaning that you trust that the key's owner, before signing other UIDs has made reasonable checks to the "trust" defined above. Default for this kind of trust is AFAIK "none", and you may manually set it to "marginal" or "full". You can then configure GnuPG to consider UIDs valid (i.e. you yourself "trust" them according to the first definition) when a certain number of "marginally" and/or "fully" trusted signatures already have been made on that UID.

The OpenPGP smartcard might be an idea if you can get it to work on the computers where you want to use GnuPG. While this is better than relying on keyfiles with passphrases (which might easily be sniffed by a keylogger), it still is not 100% secure on a wholly untrustworthy system.
Another option would be to boot into a dedicated system from CD. Knoppix or the like. The risk here is a hardware keylogger. Furthermore, depending on the (W)LAN setup, you won't easily have network connectivity and, of course, it is inconvenient.
This is the general tradeoff: Security vs. convenience.

"gpg -s" does *not* encrypt. It signs your file. "gpg -e" encrypts.
While the outputs of both operations result in a "scrambled" file (that look pretty "encrypted" for a newbie), the signed one can be opened by anyone with access to your public key. An encrypted one can be opened only by using the private keys of the intended recipient(s). You may have noticed that you were not asked for your passphrase during your decryption attempts...
Try "gpg -d $file > $filename-to-save-it-under". Or "gpg -d -o $filename-to-save-it-under $file".
You don't have to use the "-d" at all, as GnuPG defaults to the right operation (decrypting an encrypted file, verifying a signature, ...). Just try "gpg file".

It can very well be the case that you are sure that a key is valid but you do not trust the owner to make this kind of assertion about other keys.
Think of a long time friend whose key you have gotten during a personal meeting but about who you know that he doesn't understand the GnuPG trust concept at all. You can obviously sign his key, but you wouldn't trust any signatures on other people's keys by him.

A rainbow table consists of two columns, "password" and "hashed

table to get the original password.
If a salt is being used, the hash is not computed as, e.g.,
SHA1(password), but rather SHA1(salt+password). The salt is a random
number that does not need to be kept secret.
This way, even if you have a rainbow table for SHA1 ready, and even if
the password is in there, you cannot find it by looking up the hashed
value of the password, as a given password can hash to many different
values, depending on the salt used.
You would have to extend your rainbow table by a third column that
contains salt values, which would tremendously increase the size of the
table. Say, if you want 1 million passwords in your rainbow table, a
table without salt would simply have 1 million entries. With a 64 bit

@_subject: Duplicity 
Hello all,
Following, in a way, the discussion about "How long should a passphrase be?", I am currently trying to come up with a sensible backup scheme using duplicity.
Duplicity creates full and incremental backups of local files, encrypts them using GnuPG and moves them to a (remote) location. By default, it uses symmetric encryption but it can be set to encrypt to a public key. When using public keys, it can also sign the backups (but, due to a current bug, verification errors are not reported...).
My question now is, should I simply use passphrase-based encryption or should I go towards public key signing and encrypting. The problem with public key is that the secret key must be backed up itself and I do not have that many secure locations available where I could store backups (secure in the sense of "unlikely to burn down at the same time my house does" - not "hard for a stranger to access"). Therefore, any backup of the secret key would have to be placed next to the files encrypted with that key and having to give my secret key (even a dedicated one) away does not create a good feeling.
So, an attacker would get a) passphrase-encrypted files some Gigabytes in size or b) sessionkey-encrypted files some Gigabytes in size and a passphrase-encrypted secret key. Which approach is more prudent security-wise? To me it looks like it is advantageous that in case b), the passphrase is only used to encrypt a relatively small bit of data, making analysis more difficult. Plus, I would get integrity-protection some time in the futute (once the bug is fixed). Apart from this, given a long enough passphrase, both approaches should be equally secure, aren't they?
As a side question, speaking about integrity-protection, how does the MDC come into play here? Wouldn't that be enough protection anyway (as it is a special use-case)?
Thanks for some "second opinions" on this,
  Sven

Matt Kinni schrieb:
The length of the public key equals the length of the private key. And there is always a public key corresponding to a private key and vice versa.
Essentially, the "strength" of the key determines how hard it is for people to calculate the private key when they only know the public key.
This means that you have a 1024 bit DSA public key, which people use to verify your signatures. You have a 1024 bit DSA private key, which you use to make those signatures.
Then, you have a 4096 bit ElGamal public key, which people use to encrypt data for you. And you have a 4096 bit ElGamal private key which you use to decrypt this data.
Then you will use that subkey (for which again there is a private key and a corresponding public key) to sign data. Commonly, you will still use the DSA key for signing UIDs on your key or to sign other people's keys.
The DSA key is commonly called "primary key", while all other keys are called "subkeys". The primary key combined with all of its assigned subkeys constitutes what one commonly calls "one's key".
Obviously, there can be "your private key" and "your public key".

You should make sure that 1) they cannot read the private key - seperate user accounts with limited priviledges is the key here and 2) your passphrase is secure enough to frustrate anybody trying to crack it.
However, be aware that those other users might also be able to exploit security holes in the system in order to install keyloggers or similar, eliminatine the protection that your passphrase offers.
Having the key on a USB drive is probably secure enough if you do not take into account malicious software on the system you want to use it on.
If you must assume that there  could be keyloggers/etc. be installed on the system (by other users or remote attackers), your best bet is probably the OpenPGP smartcard, which will keep your key safe.
NB that there are some "probably"s in my answer -- it all really depends on your threat model (i.e. how far are people willing to go to grab hold of your private key). It also depends on how you want to balance usability and security against each other.
In many cases, having the key in one's home directory unreadable by others could be good enough already. In other cases, even having a smartcard-reader with autonomous PIN-pad won't be secure.

@_subject: How secure asymmetric encryption to yourself? 
Chris Poole schrieb:
The simple answer is: It doesn't matter, both methods are equally secure
(with the security determined primarily by the strength of your passphrase).
The asymmetric approach could have its advantages, because I can imagine
some scenarios where an attacker might obtain the encrypted data and the
passphrase but would be unable to get access to the secret key file
(e.g., because it is not a file but rather in a smartcard or because the
private key is on offline media at the time of compromise of the data).
Not having the private key leaves an attacker with the requirement to
either brute-force the symmetric session key or crack the public key to
obtain the secret key. Both things are supposed to be infeasible given
GnuPG's algorithms/keylengths and the current state of cryptanalysis.
However, there is the risk that a cryptanalytical advancement would
allow easy breaking of asymmetric keys which could enable an attacker to
fully bypass your passphrase by cracking the public key (thereby getting
the private key and thereby decrypting the data). IMHO, this risk is
negligible and if it happens anyway, people would probably have nastier
things to do than cracking specifically *your* key (e.g. forging SSL
certificates of banks etc)...
On the other hand, asymmetric has one disadvantage: The private key file
is something that must be stored as safe as the encrypted data. (I mean
backups etc.) No matter whether you know the passphrase, if the private
key file is deleted, you won't get your data back!
As a sidenote: Is it possible to find out a public key just from looking
at data encrypted to that public key?(Assume the key is not on a
keyserver, of course.)
If the public key could also be hidden from an attacker (e.g. the
attacker has just the encrypted data file and the passphrase), it would
leave brute-forcing of the symmetric algorithm as the only attack
option... Plausible scenarios for this are more difficult to imagine,
cu, Sven
PS: IMHO there are more usable ways of managing one's passwords than
storing them in a GnuPG file (although much can be accomplished by
wrapping access to that file through a number of shell scripts, I assume).

because it's too OT.../
I mean tools like Keepass/KeepassX, PasswordSafe, or similar (even the
Firefox password manager can encrypt stored passwords with 3DES and a
master password). I also mean a Truecrypt volume or loopback container
for storing the password file. For Linux, encfs or ecryptfs come to
mind, too.
The reasons are as follows: With GnuPG, you have encrypted one file. To
be secure, you must now delete the original copy, which is not easy in
itself, although recent research [1] seems to show that a single
overwrite is sufficient for secure wiping. Didn't we have a discussion
about secure deletion not too long ago?
Now, to access your encrypted passwords, you need to decrypt the file,
resulting in an unencrypted version of it on your drive. When you are
done, you have to securely delete it again. If you have modified the
file, you have to remember to encrypt it between having saved the
changes and deleting it.
Of course, you can set the thing up in a way that the unencrypted file
is written to a RAM-only disk, but keep hibernation and swapfile issues
in mind.
You can also have GnuPG output the data to the console only, if you just
have to read a password (I have no idea if there are possibilities that
console output find its way into logfiles or similar, though). Depending
on the size of your password file, you have quite a number of lines
written to the console where you have to find the password that you need
for the moment. If you'd format the file like:
purpose1 -> password1
purpose2 -> password2
you could do something like "gpg passwords.gpg | grep purpose2" to find
the password you need.
As mentioned, some shellscripts could automate the process (create a
ramfs mountpoint, decrypt the password file to there, grep it to find a
desired password, or launch a text editor, re-encrypt the file after the
editor closes, unmount the ramfs).
KeepassX, e.g., supports organizing your password file into groups,
adding metadata such as URLs to the passwords, comfortable hotkeys,
integrated random password generator, password entropy estimation etc.
The main difference, though is the transparent way to access your
passwords (this is also true for Truecrypt and the other mentioned
encrypting filesystems): Enter the master-password, work with the
password file(s), lock the storage again. Done. No unencrypted copy on
disk, ever (apart from the abovementioned swapfile and hibernation).
Given these tools I also disagree with the notion that "frequently used
passwords reside in one's memory" (although I remember quite some
passwords, myself). Password-reuse is one of the greatest problems with
passwords (and, btw, becomes quite infeasible once you have to deal with
varying complexity-policies, different expiration-intervals etc) and
passwords you have to remember tend, in general, to be weaker than those
that you don't have to remember.
With Keepass, you can have a different 20-character pseudo-random
password for every stupid web forum (not to mention the more important
things). It just doesn't matter whether your password is "123" or
"las2ieu7hxalm5iuemalie" if it's just pressing "Ctrl-Shift-A" to
auto-type username and password into the login form.
I do not mean to endorse specific pieces of software here, nor do I mean
to belittle GnuPG. But I think you need the right tool for right task.
And GnuPG IMHO has its strengths not in providing protection to
frequently accessed (and modified) files.
If you need to archive a backup copy of your passwords on a remote
server, that's a wholly different issue, though. GnuPG will do an
excellent job there and digital signatures are even a bonus.

It is probably one of the best choices for the purpose, however, in
general, long-term archival and encryption don't go together nicely.
Neither does compression or similar. Many algorithms or encryption modes
are rather 'sensitive' to single bit-errors, lost bits and the like.
Imagine the session-key part of an OpenPGP message be destroyed.
Commonly, this will be far less than 1% of the actual data, but even
with 99% intact, you won't have a chance of recovering *anything* from it.
When using encrypted backups, 100% data integrity plays a much greater
role than when just storing unencrypted data.
With a directory full of .bmp files, you have a fair chance not to
notice a bit flip at all or you might notice a single out-of-color pixel.
With a directory of .jpgs, you might notice a corrupted 8x8 pixels block
or, worst case, have one unusable image.
With a single images.zip.gpg file, a bit flip may mean that the whole
archive is unreadable (which is the worst case... no idea what an
average case might look like).

Hi gnupg-users!
I noticed some "oddities" (to me) with the selection of a hash algorithm
by GnuPG. I assume that the particular use-cases have additional
limitations which are not obvious to me, so could you please clarify?
First, when sending a signed email from Evolution, SHA1 seems to be
chosen, no matter what "personal-digest-preferences" or even
"digest-algo" is set in the gpg.conf file (other parts of gpg.conf are
honored, however).
Is this a limitation of the PGP/MIME standard that Evolution uses?
Second, when using the smartcard, and "personal-digest-preferences
SHA256 RIPEMD160", the latter is chosen as digest algorithm.
Is the smartcard limited to 160 Bit hashes?
Talking about the smartcard...
Any news regarding a 2048 bit version? ;-)
Thanks for your insights,

I looked into RFC 2015 and 3156, and they appear to restrict the allowed

"pgp-md5", "pgp-sha1", "pgp-ripemd160", "pgp-md2", "pgp-tiger192", and
So it would appear that Evolution uses RFC 2015, skipping the obsolete MD5.
Is there a GnuPG setting to find out more about the exact calls that
Evolution does? As I said, other parts of gpg.conf are honored and I do
not seem to be able to set some "debug-flag" within Evolution to log its
calls to gpg (which may be based on the fact that I'm by far no expert
with Evolution).
Is there some kind of "recommended" email application when it comes to
GnuPG support? Or, put differently, which ones are known for "good"
I have used Enigmail in the past but I was under the impression that its
integration was hampered by limitations of Thunderbird's plugin API.

Yes. It's called a "hybrid cryptosystem" and is exactly what is done in

The main reason is that asymmetric operations are hugely inefficient so
that you do not want to encrypt 1GB of data with RSA.
Another reason: "K" could be separately encrypted with Alice's, Bob's
and Carol's key which allows several recipients for an encrypted message
without having to encrypt the message itself several times.

If you encrypt the same file twice, the output will be almost totally

This will be true even for two subsequent encryptions of the same file
with both being either binary of ASCII mode.
When exporting a public/private key once as binary and once as ASCII,
you are processing the very same block of data using two different data
representations. Converting should work here.

Hello GnuPG-Users!
With a new year comes a new keypair and this time I tried to use subkeys
to separate my secret primary key from the "day-to-day"
encryption/signing keys.
Using options "--no-default-keyrings --secret-keyring secring2.gpg
--public-keyring pubring2.gpg" I generated the primary key, added UIDs,
subkeys etc and then I used "--export-secret-subkeys" and "--import" to
import it into the default keyrings.
Normal signing and decryption work fine, however I cannot get an
operation to work that requires the primary key, such as re-setting an
expiry date or signing someone else's key.
I thought that I would simply 'include' the primary key by adding
"--secret-keyring secring2.gpg" whenever I need it for these kinds of
operations, but GnuPG complains about missing parts of the secret key
regardless of whether this option is present of not.
It seems I am missing something here, but I don't quite know how to proceed.
Thanks for any insights,
 Sven
