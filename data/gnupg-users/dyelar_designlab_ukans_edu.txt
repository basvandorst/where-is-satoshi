@_subject: configure on redhat linux 6.0 with version 0.98 
Under redhat linux 6.0 with version 0.98, configure can't seem to pick up
the host type.  I have tried doing a --host=linux, and it accepts the
value, but says that it doesn't recognize that host type.  Having said
that, the compile works fine, and installs correctly without the addition
of the --host=linux.  If I don't include that on the command line, it just
sits there trying to detect the host type.
