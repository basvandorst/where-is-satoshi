@_subject: Key e-mail address 
Hash: SHA1
In my case, someone who is in my gpg list chaned his email address. I have to choose his old email address when I want
to mail him by gpg. I tried follow action to add his new email address in my
gpg list. But gpg --edit-key [his id] prompt says like this.
Command> adduid his_new_id
Need the secret key to do this.
How can I add his new email address to my gpg list so that I
can send him encrypted mail easily? (not choosing his old address)
