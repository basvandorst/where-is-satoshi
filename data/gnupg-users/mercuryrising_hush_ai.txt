Can IPAD or ANDROID TABLETS create gnupgp private/public keys and use
gnupg or is that still relegated to Windows/Vista, Mac OSX and Linux
on desktop and laptop/notebook computer platforms?

Thank you both for replying to my question about IPODs and Androids.  It sounds like neither will work to be fully functional with gnupg or pgp then.  Perhaps I should get a small laptop computer.  I wonder if one of those small driveless computers and a USB storage device would work.  I need an inexpensive solution for a friend.in Europe.  Since Poland and the Ukraine are in the European Union there shouldn't be any problem using pgp for private communication among friends right? I have been using pgp since the  90's as a hobby and believe if privacy is not use it will be lost.  I used to chat with Julf at Anon penit fi back then to but not with pgp.

oPenGP Lite (couldn't find any version without the 'Lite'). This version works one way, it decrypts only, doesn't encrypt. This is a PGP Corporation (owned by Symantec now) App, hence the upper case PGP in oPenGP.
I don't know whether there is, or will be, a Mobile GnuPG what will work under iPhone or iPad iOS.
I generated on my Mac a new key pair (default RSA/RSA 2048). I didn't want to use my "regular" key.
Exported the secret key to the Mac's Desktop.
Connected the iPhone via iTunes (hardwired USB)
Imported the secret key to the iPhone via iTunes and an App called 'Files' .
In 'Files' I could see the key block, select all/copy.
Back to oPenGP, Import clipboard, ascertained that the key is now in the keyring.
Back to 'Files', set an access locked code. Checked that it works. Deleted the secret key keyblock.
Sent myself a test message encrypted with the public key of the above keypair.
Downloaded the e-mail in iPhone, select all/copy.
Back to oPenGP, Import/Decrypt Clipboard, enter the passphrase.
It works.
I don't feel at ease having my secret key in my iPhone, but i can learn to live with it, if I really want to use this iPhone feature. I'm not sure I want to.
So ios can use PGP on iphones and ipads?
 What are the security issues?  How safe is the private key and pass phrase on these devices?
y well, with key servers and

@_subject: Essay on PGP as it is used today 
From Elwin in Lloydminster, Alberta, Canada (visiting family)
July 22, 2019
Ryan & gnupg-users,
Concerning "Essay on PGP as it is used today"
When I went to the link it said it said,
    "The PGP Problem"
I searched and determined the author is unknown from from what I could
The Essay suggested a number of alternatives for private messaging.
The firstwas Signal. I downloaded it to my phone. Then the thought
came to me, "howsecure is signal? I looked for a short time and found
Signal Desktop Leaves Message Decryption Key in Plain Sight
Why would the nameless author of this essay suggest people use Signal
when anyone given access to a computer be able to just go into
unprotected directories and get the key to signal and open all past messages sent. Governments
must love this feature.
The fact that the author can not be questioned because there is no way
to contact him/her is the first big clue someone is trying to crash the faith people have
in PGP or GnuPG. This has happened before to me. I went to an EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation) meeting  and a big
and tall guy came to me and told me that he had a way of Breaking PGP and told me he had
been working on a database program that made this possible and spouted off terms I had
never heard before. I turned around for a second or few and turned back and he was gone. I
searched the room  with my eyes and couldn't find him. I went to the outside door and
looked up and down the street to no avail. I went to the Intersection and looked around -
nothing. I went back inside, and I couldn't find him. I had questions.
Doubts flooded my mind. I went and looked at the fundamentals. The PGP
I am interested in is the PGP based on RSA because it cannot be broken using a very large
Prime number set that are multiplied together and assuming these numbers are in a
supply in the quadrillions times quadrillions. I have had a hobby of codes and ciphers and have
around 200 books on what most common people would consider the ways to write things they cannot
understand or even see. I was a subway train operator and Railroad brakeman for over 41
years then retired but am not a math wiz. If you had a multi processor computer like at
Laurence Livermore National Labs that can independently parallel process millions of possibilities
a second how long would it take to break one PGP RSA encoded/enciphered message.  So if there
are certain prime numbers that do not qualify to be used, how many numbers are left? So
you have one qualifying very large prime. You  go to a list of other very large prime numbers and separately use
each number with your first chosen very large prime number to make a key and test that key
against the message with the unknown key.  If nothing on the List pans out you choose the next
very large prime number and reuse the very large prime number list.  How many numbers make up
the very large prime number list?

Again, Signal is touted as better than PGP.Why?Look at this problem
with signal. Looks really serious.

I don't think PGP does THIS !

not so sure that it does.  I think that?s the point security
researchers like Schneier have been trying to make: it is easy for all
people ? from grandparents who still think they need AOL to
chipheads who can install Arch without watching a YouTube tutorial ?
to screw up encrypted email in a way that exposes the cleartext.  Encrypted email is fundamentally unsafe as it currently exists. It?s really hard to screw up some of the new E2E encrypted
messengers.  Sure, if your method for secure communications is
dropping stego?d memes with encrypted payloads on imgur, then simple
tools like Signal and WhatsApp won?t do.  But if you?re trying to
securely communicate like a normal person who is not pretending to be
Mister Robot, then PGP for email is one of the least adopted, least
safe ways to do so and Signal/iMessage/WhatsApp are decent solutions. -Ryan McGinnis  PGP: 5C73 8727 EE58 786A 777C 4F1D B5AA 3FA3 486E D7AD

Reliably and
Depends on your threat model.  For mine, reliably and easily
encrypting email is almost absurdly simple:
1) Use PGP
2) Don't send secrets to people I don't trust to keep them.
Anyway, 99% of my PGP use is for the opposite of secrecy: I sign my
emails so that (if you care enough to install PGP) you can be highly
assured that they're from me.

@_subject: Encryption Algorithm for GnuPG? 
What is the encryption engine for the current GnuPG. I read that it isNIST AES. I know IDEA is proprietary so that can?t be used, is this correct?
If it?s NIST AES that is under the US Government? Wouldn?t that be in danger of a US back door in the algorithm?
