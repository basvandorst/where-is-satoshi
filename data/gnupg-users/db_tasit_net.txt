@_subject: Why are signatures marked as bad? 
Sorry I don't have an answer to your question, but FWIW your signature
is appears to be valid in Evolution (see below). I am also running SuSE
10.1 and use Kgpg. As much as I would like to, I can't use Kmail for a
completely unrelated reason.
This message is signed with a valid signature,but the sender of the
message cannot be verified.
