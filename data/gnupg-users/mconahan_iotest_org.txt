@_subject: Creating a RFC3156 compliant encrypted message with Gnu PG 
Does anyone know how to create a RFC 3156 compliant PGP encrypted message with Gnu PG?  I am building an app that is making use of the Gnu PG functionality, and I am having some trouble getting other PGP apps (said to be 3156 compliant) to accept it.  I have read both RFC 3156 and 2015, and I seem to be missing something, since it isn't working. Does anyone know of tutorial site, or has a script that creates a RFC 3156 compliant message?  Any help would be appreciated.

Yes, I knew that, but thanks for your response. There was another responder who recommended that I should obtain the Enigmail (or Mutt) source, and view how those apps process rfc 3156 (PGP/MIME) messages. I'm taking that approach...I'm currently upgrading my environment with the requisites (Mozilla 1.7.x/Gnu PG 1.4), before compiling and installing Enigmail.

Thanks.  I'll look into it.

@_subject: GnuPG ME: How do we use the --keyring GnuPG option via GnuPG ME? 
On second thought, is it possible to specify an unique "gpg.conf" file for each gpg session?  If this could work, this would be a workaround...I wouldn't have to modify the GPGME source.  If anybody has any ideas on how to specify a keyring/session using GPGME, please let me process, but I need to avoid process collision in my application. In short, I am using GPGME, and each process must have its own "--keyring" and "--secret-keyring".
application use GPGME where supported (and use GnuPG directly otherwise...ugh). ...I'm hoping that GPGME will support me on what I need to do.

Hmmm... For GPGME 'out of the box', is there a way to utilize the GnuPG options "--homedir", "--keyring", "--no-default-keyring", and "--secret-keyring" for a context (at a minmum I need the use of the latter three)?
If there is not a way 'out of the box', where in the GPGME source would I have to add the above GnuPG arguments, in order to have them sent to GnuPG along with the rest of the arguments already specified in the context? Would it be the function "build_argv" in rungpg.c?

@_subject: How to encrypt attachments in MIME using inline-PGP 
Hi everyone,
    If a PGP recipient is using an application that only accepts inline-PGP, how do I contruct the MIME so that I can send attachments.  I realize that Enigmail (as do some other apps) does it for you, but I was wondering if anyone knows what the general process is for handling attachments in inline-PGP?

Hi everyone,
    I was wondering if anyone had a clue on how to access the --keyring GnuPG option via GnuPG ME?

I could see that your solution would work for an app with a single process, but I need to avoid process collision in my application.  In short, I am using GPGME, and each process must have its own "--keyring" and "--secret-keyring".  I'm playing with the idea of modifying the GPGME source, or have my application use GPGME where supported (and use GnuPG directly otherwise...ugh).  ...I'm hoping that GPGME will support me on what I need to do.

@_subject: Using the --edit-key GnuPG command via GPGME 
Hi everyone,
    Does anyone have a snippet of code (besides t-edit.c) that uses the --edit-key functionality of GnuPG via GPGME?  Currently, my app is using the undocumented GPGME function "gpgme_op_edit", and when my app uses the function, sometimes the function works, and sometimes it doesn't.  ...There seems to be a race somewhere in "gpgme_op_edit"...any help with this problem would be great.  Basically, I am trying to add a userID to a PGP key via GPGME.  I think this is a pretty tough problem, though.
