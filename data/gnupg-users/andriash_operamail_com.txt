Hash: SHA1
If you are looking for just the Plugin, you will have to find someone who
has both PGP and Outlook installed, and have them send it to you. Why are
you wanting only the Plugin? You have to install PGP *after* you install
Outlook, as PGP will then detect it's presence and offer to install the
Outlook Plugin.

@_subject: Wrapping Anomaly? 
Hash: SHA1
When I decrypt encrypted mail from friends who use GnuPG, it shows up in
the text viewer with no wrapping at all. There is just one very long line,
with thick vertical lines where reasonable line breaks might have been.
In order to read the message, I must copy/paste it into a composition
window after which the wrapping is reasonable.
Does anyone know what causes this?

@_subject: New Format for PGP/GPG Secring ? 
Hash: SHA1
I've been asked the following question by the Developement Team of The Bat
Mail Client who are working on Native/Plugin support for PGP 7.x, PGP/MIME
and GnuPG:
"I didn't like much the format of PGP keyrings, but after the publications
about oddities of storing primes separately and number-of-bits in
unprotected form, it's time to change the format. I don't like to invent
something incompatible, is there something new with keyrings format
planned in GnuPGP or PGP? Or maybe there is an internet-draft-proposal
that I may be willing to support?
Maxim Masiutin
Vice President, Ritlabs S.R.L. Does anyone on the List have information on the subject that I could pass
along to the Developers?

@_subject: GPG on a Windows MUA 
I am running The Bat Mail Client on a Win 98SE box, and although I am
currently using PGP 7.0.3, I want to try GPG. From what I have read, I
can download and install the current release of GPG into C:\GnuPG, then
download a Windows front end such as GnuPGShell or WinPT that would give
me access to GPG through a PGPTray type Application, is that correct?
As for the installation of GPG, is all I need to do is put the path to
GPG in my autoexec.bat file? Are there any specific instructions as to
setting up the commandline version of GPG *before* I install a front end
for the Program?

@_subject: Use of AES-256 with GPG? 
Hash: SHA1
I'm using GnuPGShell as a front-end for GPG 1.0.4-1 on a Win 98 Box. I
have set my "GPG Preferences" in GnuPGShell to use AES-256 as my default
symmetric algorithm, but every time I try generating new Key Pairs, they
are all reported as using the AES-128 Cipher. Even if I choose
Triple-DES, the AES-128 cipher is the one reported as being used.
Now someone on my PGP-Basics List has tried to explain to me why that
is, and I include an excerpt from that explanation below:
So if I understand it correctly, does the "Options" file located in my
GPG Directory have no effect on GPG in reference to the default
Symmetric Cipher used? Is the only way to change the default to
recompile the source? If so, what is the purpose of the options file?

With the help of other List Members who wrote to me off-list, I now have
my question answered.
Thank you to everyone for your help. This summer I will be getting my
new Computer which I will install a Linux Distribution on, and then I
won't have to be limited to the GnuPGShell front end. :o)

Speaking of v1.0.5 for Windows, does anyone know the expected release
date? The only version currently available is 1.0.4-1, yet I see everyone
else is using 1.0.4d and I've been told that version has fixed a bug that
would generate PITA messages from GPG complaining about not finding a
Cipher. An example of those messages I receive is listed below:
gpg: NOTE: cipher algorithm 9 not found in preferences
gpg: Signature made 03/03/01 17:04:21  using DSA key ID C7CC38D2
gpg: Good signature from "Nicholas Andriash (Trial AES-256)
I understand the reference to "cipher algorithm 9 not found" is no longer
present in 1.0.4d

Perhaps he is wanting the verification information included in the
original document once the signature has been verified... along the lines
of how Eudora and Outlook include it:

Yes, but I do it through GnuPGTray, which is part of GnuPGShell. I simply
export from PGP 7.0.3 whichever Keys I want, and then open GPGKeys through
GnuPGTray and import them.

This may or may not be related, but I find that importing a Key *Pair*
involves a two-step process with GnuPG. You may have only imported your
Public Key and not your Private Key.     -=N.J. Andriash | Vancouver, B.C. Canada=-          [ TB! v1.51b1 | Win 98 SE 4.10 2222 A ]     [ GnuPG v1.0.4-1 (MingW32) | Key ID: 0x7BA3FDCE ]

I noticed you never did get an answer to your question on-List... did you
receive one off-List? If so, would you mind passing it on to me, as that
very question has plagued me ever since installing GPG. I've asked the
question as well, and strangely enough no one seems to know the answer...
or is ignoring us. ;o)

That is what I thought Karol. I've searched the archives, but it must be
listed under a different subject. Can you recall how far back the
discussion was, and what the subject may have been? I presume the "cvs" is
an interim release, and the problem will have been dealt with in 1.0.5, or
whatever the new release will be?
Another question I have Karol, is that if I generate a new Key pair in GPG
using Rijndael-256 as my preferred algorithm, do you know why, if I export
that Key into PGP, it reports the algorithm used as AES-128? Perhaps you
could you take a look at my Options file, and let me know if anything is
amiss or if I have some redundancy that may be causing that:
default-key 0x7BA3FDCE
encrypt-to 0x7BA3FDCE
cipher-algo RIJNDAEL256
digest-algo SHA1
compress-algo 1
load-extension idea.dll
s2k-digest-algo sha1
s2k-cipher-algo cast5
Thanks so much for your response.

Yes, I would prefer to encrypt messages and receive encrypted messages
using that Algorithm, but if that particular Algo is not found in the
Recipients Key preferences, then I would want GPG to use the first
Algorithm listed in their preference list. Is that possible?
But in my case, the Recipient is me, and the Key was generated with
Rijndael-256 as my preferred Algorithm. The note in that case is telling
me that Rijndael-256 is not available. So, if it's not available, what
Algorithm was used? When I type --version, I am shown the following:
Supported algorithms: Cipher: 3DES, CAST5, BLOWFISH, RIJNDAEL,
RIJNDAEL192, RIJNDAEL256, TWOFISH
By looking at the above list, I am presuming that Rijndael-256 *is*
available, so I am a little confused why I am getting that notation when I
send an encrypted test message to myself. BTW, is that my preference list?
So in that case, cipher-algo should be left blank, but that does not seem
to be possible when editing your GPG Options through GnuPGTray. Can I
therefore simply delete the cipher-algo line in my Options File?
Basically, through my Options File I want to say to others that I prefer
to receive messages encrypted using the Rijndael-256 Symmetric Algorithm,
but if you don't have that capability, then use Twofish, and failing that,
use 3DES, then CAST5 followed by Blowfish. Now, in my case where I am
using a precompiled binary for use in Windows, is it possible to edit my
Preference List, or do I have to accept the default? BTW, what is the
command to see the default list?
With reference to *sending* encrypted messages, my preference again would
be Rijndael-256. If however, the Recipient cannot accept that Algorithm,
does GnuPG use the first of the preferred Algorithms on the Recipients Key
Preferences... which I presume is hidden somewhere in his
self-signature... or am I *forcing* the Recipient to accept encrypted
messages using Rijndael-256?
