hi all...
after successfully compiling gnupg on my rh7.2 linux box, no errors, when
trying to run the pksd by
    /usr/local/bin/pksd /etc/pksd.conf
i keep getting this error " pksd: kd_open: Error opening num_keydb (errno =
it looks like i'm missing the num_keydb file but for the life of me don't
know how to create one, i tried...
    [root /root]# /usr/local/bin/pksclient /usr/local/var/db/create
    /usr/local/bin/pksclient /db/path create [num_files]
    /usr/local/bin/pksclient /db/path recover
    /usr/local/bin/pksclient /db/path add filename [flags]
    /usr/local/bin/pksclient /db/path get userid [flags]
    /usr/local/bin/pksclient /db/path index userid [flags]
    /usr/local/bin/pksclient /db/path since time [flags]
    /usr/local/bin/pksclient /db/path delete userid [flags]
    /usr/local/bin/pksclient /db/path disable userid [flags]
any ideas ?
