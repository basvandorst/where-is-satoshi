hey is there a special way to use gpg with xcmail it seems to be set up
for pgp and i am using gnupgp?
when i try to put in the commands for gpg instead of pgp it gives me error
right now im typing mail in a txt file and encrypting...clearsigning...ect
then copy/paste it to my xcmail proggie?
this is time consuming ...i dont wanna go back to pgp just because i cant
have gpg in it ya know what i mean?
Or can u recomend a gui mail proggie that will work with gpg?
