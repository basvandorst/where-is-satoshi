all the above questions is yes. However, it seems bizarre to me that

@_subject: PGP 5.x and GnuPG 
I looked at it briefly. It refers to PGP 2.x and I was asking about
PGP 5.x (which is why I repeatedly specified that version number). I
am not concerned with compatibility with "old" versions of PGP.
I am asking if GnuPG is able to properly exchange signed and/or
encrypted messages with PGP 5.x. Can it?
I also saw this document but it starts with this disclaimer:
Note: THIS INFORMATION ONLY APPLIES TO
PRE-1.0 VERSIONS OF GNUPG
I understood that GnuPG 1.0 and even newer versions have been
released so I assumed that the information in that document was now
irrelevant. In fact, it is based on the use of "gpg (GNUPG) 0.4.0;
Copyright (C) 1998..." That makes the document at least 1.25 years
Now I'm really starting to wonder if I am missing something obvious
since you replied to my message but ignored my main questions.

Weird. Doesn't the OpenPGP RFC start by saying that OpenPGP is a
proposed standard based on PGP 5.0? How did PGP5 manage not to comply

So you're saying that GnuPG and PGP are *not* compatible and people
using one may not be able to successfully exchange encrypted

Or is your problem rare or intermittent, with the majority of
GnuPG-encrypted messages being handled properly by PGP 6.x?

@_subject: key security 
I keep mine on my hard drive with a backup on floppy which is in a
safe deposit box, in case of catastrophic hard disk failure, fire,
etc. (as opposed to "in case of burglary"). The simple fact is, for
most of us, encryption is not necessary. However, some of us
subscribe to the idea that continual use of encryption is a Good
Idea. (Some of us also just think it's cool.) Since I fall into those
categories, I don't worry about someone trying to hack my keyrings so
I don't get ultra paranoid about them. Plus, I live alone and I'm the
only one with access to my computer on a regular basis.
Don't sweat being confused. It has frustrated me for a long time how
simple public-key encryption is at its core (i.e. the processes that
would account for 90+% of the use by 90+% of the users if the "common
person" would use it) yet how unbelievably complex most
implementations of it are (because it's generally not used by the
"common person" and because it's generally written by computer geeks
for computer geeks). Most of us don't care about 'webs of trust',
which algorithms are used, etc. We just want: 1) to get our friend's
public keys so we can encrypt messages to them; and 2) give our
friends our public keys so we can sign messages and they can verify
them (and send us encrypted messages).

This is contrary to what I believed. It was my understanding that
breaking symmetric-key crypto systems like the one in OpenPGP
implementations was monumentally difficult (i.e. requiring hundreds
of millions of dollars or more of computer hardware). It was also my
understanding that the weakest link in the system was the passphrase
protecting the encrypted private key. I believed that using brute
force one could break a passphrase relatively easily (i.e. much less
than hundreds of millions of dollars of equipment would be needed).
Which is correct? Is any passphrase, even one 100 - 200 characters
long consisting of completely random characters, even as remotely
difficult to break as it is to break a GPG coded message?

Sorry, as a non-technical user, I'm still at a loss. A scenario:
1. you have my private key but not my passphrase
2. my passphrase is:
(or something similar)
3. my key size is 1024
4. you have a message encrypted with my public key
Which is easier:
A. crack my passphrase (brute force?) to get to my private key or
B. attack the message itself, ignoring the private key?
What if my key size is 2048? 4096?

@_subject: fatal corruption with PGPKeys and GPG keyrings 
gpg: read_keyblock: read error: invalid packet
gpg: enum_keyblocks(read) failed: invalid keyring
PGP (command line and PGPKeys) both continue to read and work with
the keyrings perfectly. The only way I have found to do *anything*
with the keyrings at this point is to copy my GnuPG backups over the
PGP-"corrupted" versions.
I have not tested whether similar operations with PGP command line
would cause the corruption.
Does GnuPG not support what I'm trying to do (remove signatures)? Is
this a bug with PGPKeys or PGP for Windows? Is this a bug with GnuPG?
Has anyone ever seen this (sorry, no search function for this mail
list that I can find)? Can anyone reproduce this?

@_subject: More questions about: "gpg: WARNING: message was not integrity 
Some time ago there were questions about the warning message:
gpg: WARNING: message was not integrity protected
that gpg outputs when decrypting *some* symmetrically encrypted  texts. Werner Koch wrote in
I have some questions about this:
1. How is MDC enabled? I cannot find a setting (I'm using Mac OS X  and my man pages are mysteriously missing). There is no (commented  out) option for MDC in my gpg.conf file.
2. I have observed that by switching my cipher-algo from the default,  CAST5, to AES256 (or any variant of AES, if I recall correctly), the  warning goes away. Why?
3. Werner implies that the warning is only generated for  symmetrically encrypted emails but I have noticed that an email from  my girlfriend, signed and encrypted to my public key will display  this warning, when decrypted/verified from the command line. However,  a message that I encrypt to myself then decrypt on the command line  does *not* display it. Is this, again, because I have my default  cipher-algo set to AES256 in my gpg.conf file while my girlfriend is  using the default (CAST5)?
4. All this gives the impression that CAST5 suffers from a weakness  that AES256 does not. Is this true?

@_subject: More questions about: "gpg: WARNING: message was not integrity 
Excellent. So, the follow-up question is, should one use this option  for files symmetrically encrypted for long-term storage (like if  burned to a CD)?
Can you briefly explain this "preference system"? As in, does this  mean a given public key may/will have a preference for some algo  stored in it and when my copy of GPG attempts to encrypt to that  public key, it uses that symmetric cipher (when possible)?
Ah, great! So there are at least two benefits of using AES over CAST5  then (larger keyspace and MDC turned on).
Fair enough. I had set it because I was archiving some things for  long-term storage and discovered it was defaulting to CAST5 and  thought, why not use the largest keyspace I can?
But your point is taken, because I understand now that I was also  forcing asymmetric encryption to use AES256 as the session cipher,  which might cause problems.
Then again, if I send emails that I might not want people to decrypt  5 or 10 years from now, would I want session ciphers to be defaulting  to AES256 instead of CAST5? Why is this the default?

Ah, I see.
thanks for the tip! (Interestingly, vim "knows" all the other options  in my gpg.conf file and syntax highlights them, but personal-cipher- prefs appears to be unknown to it so at first I thought I had typed  something wrong because it didn't get highlighted.)
Thanks. That's also an excellent point. (Naturally, my public key is  not 15360-bit.)

@_subject: dealing with password in batch file 
Sorry, I'm not 100% sure what you're trying to do (I couldn't see any  actual gpg stuff in your batch file, but it's been about a hundred  years since I've seen a .bat file so I could be missing the  obvious...), but if you're trying to automate passphrase entry into a  batch file, here is what I have used in a Unix (or, rather, Linux and  Mac OS X, actually) bash shell script:
gpg --passphrase-fd 3 "$FILE" 3<$pwfile
where $FILE is the file to be decrypted and $pwfile is a variable  that is set to some arbitrary file name that contains the passphrase.
What the above does is (after you create a temporary file with the  passphrase in it) tell gpg to read the passphrase from "file  descriptor 3" and the last bit (3<$pwfile) tells Unix to redirect the  file, $pwfile, into file descriptor 3.
Obviously you need to modify this somewhat to run on DOS (or Windows,  or whatever it's called these days) but it may point you in the right
