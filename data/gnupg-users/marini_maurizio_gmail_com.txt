i use option instead of gpg.conf
my  fault was:
i had 2 default :(
grep default options
# file ~/.gnupg/options by default.
default-key 72094E5C
# Using this option you can encrypt to a default key.  key validation
# The second form uses the default key as default recipient.
 some-user-id
# compiled in (which is the default for GNU and xxxBSD systems)
# If you do not want to use the default port 11371, you can give the
default-key  2BDF0AC1
grep default option
what u get?
