@_subject: gpg batch mode hangs on windows nt 
I am seeing some odd behaviour and would like to know if anyone has also had similar problems or has any ideas for solutions.
I am developing a secure information transmission system using a combination of gpg signing and encryption, using a command line perl app and the GPG.pm perl module.  It works great on Linux/Solaris, but when I tried installing it on Windows NT, the program hangs during the encryption A quick delve into the GPG.pm code reveals that it uses batch mode to process the plaintext.  The complete command is as follows:
COMMAND :
c:/gnupg/gpg -a --homedir c:/gnupg --batch --no-comment --no-version e-fd 0 -r "some name " --default-key "another name " -se [PID 1868]
A little experimentation shows that normal encryption seems to work OK, but batch mode always hangs.  Is batch mode not supported under Windows?  Does anyone have any ideas?
