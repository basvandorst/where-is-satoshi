@_subject: Changing the email address on an existing key...how? Should I? 
Is it possible (or advisable) to change the email address on an existing pgp I'm using GnuPG 1.4.1 on Linux. The man pages do not show how to change or edit the mail address of an existing key.
I've had the key(s) a long time and friends use them. I use the same key on several platforms. It would not be too much hassle for me to just create another key with the correct mail address and distribute the public key.
What is good practice in this regard and where might I read more about it?
