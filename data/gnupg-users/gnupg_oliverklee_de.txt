@_subject: Getting rid of key stub when moving key to new smart card? 
Hi everybody,
I'm using GnuPG 2.0.28 on Kubuntu 15.10.
So far, I've been using a YubiKey Neo as a OpenPGP smart card. I've
dutifully done all the steps including creating my key off-card, backing
it up externally and then moving it to the YubiKey using keytocard.
I've decided to move to a new YubiKey. I've deleted my secret key (i.e.
more or less the stub) using --delete-secret-keys and re-imported the
Now when I try to do a keytocard to the new YubiKey, I get an error
message that the key already is on a card. If I do a --list-secret-keys,
I indeed see the reference to the card for my key.
My (hopefully) educated guess is that the stub still is there even after
I have deleted the secret key from my key chain.
My questions:
- How can I verify that the stub really is gone after deleting the
secret key?
- How can I really remove the stub?
- Or how can I transfer my secret key to a new YubiKey?

any particular reason why you are compiling yourself instead of using
the packages provided by Ubuntu? (I'm on Ubuntu 16.04 as well, and GPG
works fine for me there with a YubiKey.)
