No, you're not the only one.
Those bad sigs must be some MS Outlook feature.
C'mon, Fabian, I know you, and you're a good person. Winners don't use drugs. ;-)
Now, serious, Fabian. You should check this. I have a sugestion: If you are editing the text directly in WinPT's clipboard editor, try editing in Outlook and then using keyboard shortcuts, sign it.
Some editors, like Mozilla itself, reformat the text right after the send command.

Thank you Fabian. One of my offending messages is still a mistery to me.
It simply gone currupt. I am pretty sure the "ö" character in Ingo's

But others were sent as us-ascii. I'll double check before posting any

@_subject: Announcement: WinPT 2Go 
Hash: SHA1
Hello, All.
in order to make easier for users to carry a portable cryptosystem I
decided to build a package named WinPT 2Go.
WinPT 2Go is a small set of files with basic features. It includes WinPT
and GPG. The GPG version is a Nullify one, but compiled with no
optimizations and thus, smaller. For more information please refer to
Keith's message to PGP-Basics mailing list.
All files were compressed with UPX (ultimate Packager for eXecutable),
including PDT.dll (--force).
This package is in alpha stage, and may not work the way you think. This
pre-release is mostly to collect information from the brave testers for
major tweaks and settings.
If you dare, download it, install to a floppy, camera, usb device or
even to a hard disk. Then use it and say what you think. The final
product will be result of all comments I receive. if it interests you,
have a look.

 - GNU Privacy Guard
 - Nullify GnuPG
 - Ultimate Packager for eXecutables

Thank you gentlemen.
Do not run while holding sharp objects.

Hash: SHA1
Hello Fabian.
There are some concerns in this approach.
~   1. The size of the installer would grow up ~350kb;
~   2. The portable version is AFAIK directed to power users;
~   3. Only one installation path can be used at once, so installing 2Go
would mess with the HD installation.
You see, I still need to change the registry in order to GPG work in a
different directory than C:\GnuPG. This is very restrictive, because in
no way 2 installations can be used at the same time. The workaround for
this (very lame, I know) is a shortcut to a regfile that cleans the
WinPT 2Go settings from the registry.
Maybe when this behaviour of GPG changes I'll be able to leave the
registry in peace. For know this "hack" will have to work.

If there is a way, I don't know. =)
I added mannually the last comment mannually to make clear what I've
done (Comments are not content, thus the signature is valid).
However, I've seem many signatures with 2/3 lines, made IIRC with a
PGP CKT.
The only thing I changed was the version info, and after used it I
deleted and restored the original binary from GnuPG.org. You know, I
trust more in GnuPG.org than in myself... ;-D
But maybe I'll stick to it permanently...

Hello, John.
I use KGPG too, and I did the exact search, and my findings where a
little different. Jim Francis's key is OK, but Diann Kaivo's one is
empty (no plus sign).
A new search returned the results okay. I don't know, but if I had to
blame someone, it would be KGPG.
P.S.: KGPG 0.9.5

I didn't get it. What is the problem on using a corporate key where
your employes have to sign it and have theirs signed back by it?
That would be the exact same solution I'd adopt.

I still didn't get it.
The greatest advantage of OpenPGP over X.509 is the flexibility of the
web of trust. X.509 works based on CA's, but OpenPGP can be used with
CA's if desired.
So, if a company decides to act as a CA for their emplyes, what's
wrong with that? I could even sign the corporate key, if I could check
the documentation of the company, and the identifications of its CEO's.
I have pubkeys with pseudonyms. Is that wrong? No one will ever be
able to check my ID with documents, but I like it this way for the use
I have for that key.

All right, all right!
Yes, you are right! When I saw the key I really tought it was a public
key with employes signatures (I always use the keyservers with
op=vindex), I didn't notice they where UID's.
And yes, sharing a public AND a secret key among the employers is just
a complete nonsense. And everyboddy probably knows the same passphrase.
The idea of a corporate key is good and should be encouraged, but this
is loco.
Well, I think that yes, the employees should sign the corporate key.
If one of them hasn't signed the corporate key is a reason to make it
suspicious for the contacts of this special employee.
"I always talk to Mike at XYZ Inc., but he was not avaible yesterday,
and another person gave me this corporate key. But it don't have
Mike's signature, so I guess I'm being tampered."
Again, thanks for pointing it.

The OpenSource movement is produced by human beings, with feelings and
ideas. The result of their hard work is avaible for free to the while
world. It is their right to say what they think: if they didn't care
about privacy, GnuPG itself wouldn't be a reality.
