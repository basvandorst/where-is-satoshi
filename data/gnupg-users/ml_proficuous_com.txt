@_subject: gnupg associated Windows VPN client? 
Not sure what you mean by GnuPG based, but the two vpn products that i
use are FreeSWAN and openvpn.  To connect from a windows manchine, you'd
need to use FreeSWAN.  It has an X509 plugin that will allow WinXP and
Win2K clients to connect using the built in vpn software.  There is also
another product, PoPTOP, i think is the name, that claims to support
windows pptpd the way it is.
