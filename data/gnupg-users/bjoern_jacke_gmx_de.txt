@_subject: information overkill 
when mutt using gpg checks signatures this looks like this:
gpg: Signature made Wed Oct 25 13:19:43 2000 CEST using DSA key ID 1C98774E
gpg: Good signature from "Kurt Garloff "
gpg:                 aka "Kurt Garloff "
gpg:                 aka "Kurt Garloff "
gpg:                 aka "Kurt Garloff "
... some people have much more UIDs than this one. I haven't found out
how to tell gpg not to care about all those UIDs and leave out all these
"aka" lines.  Has anyone an idea how to do this without manually
deleting all other UIDs?
What's also a bit anoying is that gpg, when decrypting a message which
was encrypted to more than one recipent, claims not to have secret keys,
though the own secret key should be enough:
gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit RSA key, ID 07222BE1, created 2000-06-16
      "Holger Smura "
gpg: no secret key for decryption available
A possibility to make gpg be quiet at this point would be very nice. Any
idea how to do that?

Wouldn't it be a good solution to let the --quiet option just list the
primary UID when checking signatures? People (like me) wouldn't bother if
the primary UID is the one from which was actually posted from. But
getting rid of screens full of UIDs would be great.
