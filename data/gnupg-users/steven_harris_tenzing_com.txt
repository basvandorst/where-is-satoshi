Agreed. I've been looking into using procmail to strip them, as
opposed to seeing them as something valuable.

Can you share one of your subject-stripping recipes? I don't mean to
turn this into a procmail discussion. I'd just like to see how much
trouble it turns out to be.

@_subject: Confused about User IDs 
I'm having trouble understanding the use of User IDs in GnuPG. I have
an existing key that I created with reference to my personal e-mail
account. I keep the private key at home. Given that I'd also like to
use encryption when communicating with people by way of my work e-mail
address, I thought maybe I should add a User ID for the work
account. Following the instructions in the GNU Privacy Handbook, I
added this second User ID.
What purpose does having multiple IDs serve, though? Is the idea that
someone looking for my public key who knows only one of my e-mail
addresses will be able to find it?
The GNU Privacy Handbook says:
Does that mean that when I "get my key signed," I'm really getting a
particular User ID signed? That is, are these verification signatures
bound to a particular User ID and not to the master signing key? If
this trust is split, then what's the advantage of combining multiple
User IDs under a given master signing key?

The GnuPG manual mentions that the trust information is kept separate
from your public keyring, presumably to avoid spilling what you think
of others when you export your public keyring. I was surprised to
notice that the default permissions on trustdb.gpg are both group- and
world-readable. Should this file be more private? If not, what's the

On my Debian 2.2 system, ~/.gnupg looks like
I don't understand the "S." The info node on "ls" says:
What does having this bit set achieve?

@_subject: Strange warning: "this cipher algorithm is depreciated" 
If I create a new key and accept all the defaults, I get a strange
warning whenever I encrypt to the new key:
,----[ create a key - accept defaults ]
Now, if I encrypt a file, I get warned that "this cipher algorithm is
depreciated." Should that be "deprecated?" Anyway, check this out:
,----[ encrypt a file - note "depreciated" warning ]
I'm using gpg 1.0.4. Should I be worried by this warning?
