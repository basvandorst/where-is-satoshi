@_subject: "best" ed25519/curve25519 setup? 
This is a bit of a necro post but it seemed most appropriate to reply here.
I have two 4096 bit RSA keys, one is for work, and one is my personal
one. I got given a Yubikey 5
 and wanted to make use of
it. In fact I was thinking of doing something like
 as I have a
phone that has NFC.
I do want to email people on Protonmail, I believe they like ECC
 as their
default now. I still want to remain compatible for people who can only
do RSA.
I am not on Protonmail however, I use my own email server with
Thunderbird, or K-9 Mail on my phone.
What I want to know is, is this still the best way I should set things
up. I was thinking this:
# Personal
RSA offline master key
     RSA subkey for signature
     RSA subkey for decryption
     RSA subkey for authentication
     Ed25519 subkey for signature
     Curve25519 subkey for authentication
     Curve25519 subkey for decryption
# Work
RSA offline master key
     RSA subkey for signature
     RSA subkey for decryption
     RSA subkey for authentication
     Ed25519 subkey for signature
     Curve25519 subkey for authentication
     Curve25519 subkey for decryption
Then loading both keys and the subkeys on my Yubikey 5. I understand
keys cannot be removed once they are loaded on to the Yubikey for
security reasons.
For safe keeping I was going to burn my keys onto an optical disc and
put it in my safety deposit box. (Just in case I lost the Yubikey or it
My already existing keypair would become my "master key" and I would
start using the subkeys I guess.
The next post in this thread
kind of confused me:
Wouldn't using a separate Ed25519/Curve25519 key like this make it
incompatible with people who are unable to decrypt ECC?
Wouldn't having a Ed25519 master key be incompatible with anything that
cannot handle ECC? It seems a bit redundant to have two master keys.
