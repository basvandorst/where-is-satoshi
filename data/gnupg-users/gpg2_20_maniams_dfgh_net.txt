@_subject: Security Concern: Unsigned Windows Executable 
On Fri, Jun 5, 2009 at 10:19 PM, Robert J. Hansen - rjh at sixdemonbag.org
Friends : While some of this discussion may be annoying, the level of
knowledge, commitment to ones position and the frankness on this list amazes
me. thanks to all those who add to the knowledge base
*My status : *
- I do not worry about an NSA style attack. Where I live, the big bro
wouldn't take all the trouble checking and messin my _network_ to get stuff
out of me !! :-(  They use more conventional ones ..... and ....  If they
were messing with my _network_ I admit that it would be be futile to fight
against it
- As I write,  I think I _do_not_ have a neighbourhood kid problem....but
that potential exists
- I use Win XP
- I have use Cryptography - GPG (the Gpg executable on my Hard disk) for
encrypting files and some mail...mostly commercial ....stuff... still not
rocket launching (thankfully so probably !!)
- I do use secure websites for logging in and out but that is a different
game I suppose ?
*some practical questions with the above as given *
- Would It help if I had two networks to connect to ...say the home one and
the office one ?
- I have very limited restriction on downloading stuff from the gnupg web
sites (files bigger than 30 MB may be a problem...but nothing on GPG / PGP /
front ends / Mail clients seem to be > 30 MB
- what should I check ....but downloading GPG and related material from each
of these networks
- any other things to note ?
Thanks in advance
B regards

@_subject: How to verify a detached signature 
I have received a HTML file and a detached signature . I am not sure if
these are PGP compliant . The sender asks me to click here...click there on
some web site to verify the file
As I am not very eager to click here ...or click there on some un known
website, I'd like to do the following and hence request help here :
1. How do I find out if a signature file _is_ PGP / GPG compliant
2. Presently I use GPG command line version. With that how do I verify that
the original HTML file is not tampered with. A command or set of commands
would be most appreciated
*Other details : *
3. This sender has so far sent me multiple files with signatures. The data
files are named "filename_dd_mm_yy.html" and the signature is always called
signature.bin (no date of no identifiable marks). All data files are only
signed and not encrypted

@_subject: How to verify a detached signature 
Thanks for the response. I did try. But GPG cannot verify this file. I get
the following answer
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: the signature could not be verified.
Please remember that the signature file (.sig or .asc)
should be the first file given on the command line.
*Probably *one of the following two is happening
1. This signature is NOT GPG compliant
2. Probably this signature is GPG / PGP compliant but GPG is unable to
recognise this as a GPG signature
So back to my original question
1. How do I find out if a signature file _is_ PGP / GPG compliant
1.a. Will changing the extension help ?

@_subject: "Active Directory", "My documents" and Temporary Files 
Dear Members
At office I work on my Laptop PC that is connected to a network. Using
"Active directory" my company seems to have mapped the "My Documents" on my
Laptop to a network drive (directory in network drive) sitting on some
central server.
I am ok with that policy / precaution and backup policies in general, but
face the following challenges which I wished to share here
1. Any decrypted file that is in use - say an XL sheet with confidential
info being change in un encrypted state, may save a temp copy on "my
documents" and in my case save the temp un encrypted one on the central
directory !!. Though M$ should normally delete this temp file on exit, it
may not as well !!, as we know from numerous crashes and stuff !!
1.1. As I am administrator on my Laptop (permission given) how do I go about
stopping the following programs from saving anything on "My documents" or
saving them to a local directory that I choose
1.1.1. MS Excel - where does XL store temp files ? How to change that from
the default (which seems to be My docs) to some other local drive /
1.1.2. MS Word - do as above
1.1.3. MS Power point
1.1.4. Note Tab text editor - 2. I understand you may suggest that I stop the mapping of Mydocs to the
network. That may be difficult as then i'd un intentionally stop ALL data
going to the networked drive
3. I understand that I may have to look at alternatives to M$ Office
products. But I am not sure where and how often Open Office products store
the TEMP files...and all the learning curve with new shortcuts and all
4. Sorry if this is OT or if this is a long post.... I felt that this
experience sharing is essential on this list , because there may be other
users who may be blisfully un aware of this problem of temp files and my
documents not being cleaned regularly
Thanks in advance for your views and directions on this
Best regards

Thanks for the quick revert. What I wish to convey is that _even_ if I
encrypt all my files and drives, _if_ I open one of them while on a
networked environment I could potentially create a loophole i.e. the un
encrypted version may have a temp file that is saved on a network drive ...
I felt this is a major loophole to be plugged by anyone who works on a
networked machine
I did not know this. I did not think on those lines until recently. When I
thought of it I wanted to share it here

@_subject: Use GPG to create encrypted files readable by PGP 
Dear Members :
Could you (or the list ) help me with the following :
- I have an source xl file - say something dot xls
- I wish to encrypt this and the recipient is say Mr. Y
- I wish to have an encrypted result file that is recognized and readable by
Mr. Y using PGP
- A command line (that assumes the following ) would be of great help
Source file              :    something.xls
Source directory     :    c:\somewhere\
Result requested    :    something.xls.pgp -> file that can be decrypted by
Result directory      :    c:\somewhere\
recipient        :    Mr. Y. :
                        I have his pub key on my ring.
                        I trust Mr. Y (in real life I have verified his e
mail etc).
                        But Mr. Y's pub key on my key ring may or
                        _may NOT_ have trusted signatures / trust levels etc
on the key.
My System        :    win XP
My knowledge level:    I can open the command prompt and type..report back
error messages etc
thanks in advance
Best regards

Thanks a ton. That was an amazing reply.
It works for me
May I add a note for other novices : The file name should not contain
spaces. if it did try using " -> quotes to wrap the file name

I say Wow here to the simple presentation of the collision and also
forwarding this great piece here. The technical gurus of this board may have
found the above link boring....but a novice like me found it very
I'm looking for similar simple explanations like the above on what a hash
functions is and what algorithms are and what other basics should some one
know before making _their_own_ choice of algos, hash etc
any pointers would be most appreciated
