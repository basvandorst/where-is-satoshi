i have a problem verifying the truecrypt pgp-key. I searched the whole internet already for a solution and even the gnupg-lists archive...
I followed the howto on truecrypt ( up to step 6. However, the last one won't work. I'll try to verify with:
gpg --verify truecrypt-7.1a-linux-x64.tar.gz.sig truecrypt-7.1a-linux-x64.tar.gz
(I tried it already with every other combination I could imagine:
gpg --verify truecrypt-7.1a-linux-x64.tar.gz.sig TrueCrypt-Foundation-Public-Key.asc
What I did so far is:
1) Create a key with:
    gpg --gen-key
2) Download the public key of TrueCrypt from  change into the Downloads-directory and import the key with:
   gpg --import TrueCrypt-Foundation-Public-Key.asc
3) Signing the key with my under 1) generated key:
  gpg --edit-key F0D6B1E0
  I set
  >trust
  to marginal (using choice number 3)
  and then   >sign
  I sign it with the above generated key and my password. I think I did something wrong at this step!?
Because when I'm trying to verify it
gpg --verify truecrypt-7.1a-linux-x64.tar.gz.sig truecrypt-7.1a-linux-x64.tar.gz
it just says:
gpg: verify signatures failed: eof
I hope that is enough information for solving my prob. Of course, I downloaded the tar.gz.sig file to the same directory...
Thanks in advance!

Thanks guys! finally, it worked!
That was the problem. After downloading it again, everything just worked fine. And I skipped the part of my description which I wrote down in my first mail!
