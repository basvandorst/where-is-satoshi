seperator translation on the receiving system
depending if it is *nix, Windows, or... like we use,
an OS/390 mainframe (EBCDIC).

That will help you with your date issues, but for
Windows scripting, you may want to search
I could help you by writing the script, but think you
might appeciate it more if you did it yourself and
researched it on usenet.
Best of luck.

You need to set the trust model to what works for your
needs in the gpg.conf file and sign and trust the
recipients key.

@_subject: Make GnuPG create files with .pgp extension 
Perhaps the best approach to this is a simple script.
gpg --encrypt --recipient %2 --output %1.pgp %1
You could expand on it.  Shouldn't be a problem for
any environment.

Instead of --decrypt, use

@_subject: Migrating from PGP TO GPG 
My firm uses both GnuPG and McAfee e-Business Server
(the original PGP, IMO).  Project will take a little
research, but all should be fine for you.  And if you
have existing keys with PGP, there is no reason you
can't continue to use them so you don't impact your
trading partners by changing keys.
Good luck, and you shoulg get lots of help from this
forum even as an observer.

This is probably a dumb, basic question but is it possible to list than one key name for the -recipient option when encrypting a Gnupg-users mailing Gnupg-users at gnupg.org

On Mon, 2008-02-25 at 09:59 +0100, Dirk Traulsen If you are the third recipient, you have to give 6 times a wrong password until you can finally input the correct one. This gets real fun when there are ten It would be nice, if 1. gpg would take the password and test it automatically with all recipients 1a. If there would be a hit, 1b. If there was no hit, print a list of all recipient keys and two more chances for a correct 2. there would be a command --recipient-keys which would just list all recipient keys of an encrypted file, so I could see in advance whether my key is one of I thought it wasn't any command for security reason, but I agree seems a basic functionality is Maybe a command giving complete information on a file would be too. I mean a signed file and an encrypted file have both .gpg and are hard to distinguish, aren't they Or the --verify command could be more verbose and list keys $ gpg --verify gpg: verify signatures failed: unexpected $ gpg --verify gpg: Signature made gpg: Good signature from Gnupg-users mailing Gnupg-users at gnupg.org

gpg --list-packets --list-only  but clearly you identified yourself as a recipient because you were prompted for a passphrase.

Am 25 Feb 2008 um 8:01 hat Tracy D. Bossong gpg --list-packets should give you a No, it does does the same as  The only difference is that gpg gives additional packet information before asking the passphrases three times for each recipient. So the described problem for an encrypted file with several recipients stays the C:\>gpg --list-packets :pubkey enc packet: version 3, algo 16, keyid data: [4095 data: [4095 You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key user: "Dirk Traulsen (dtl-2) 4096-bit ELG-E key, ID E192093D, created 2005-10-21 (main key ID Please enter the Dirk Gnupg-users mailing Gnupg-users at gnupg.org
