You can just import the keypair as you thought it might work. Then
GnuPG tells you that the secret key wasn't imported and that you should
use --allow-secret-key-import on the command line for that operation
(it's in g10/import.c line 610 if you want to have a look).
So, I don't see any problem here. New users just _try_ things. So
they'll try to import as usual and then come across this message. Not
even a need to consult a man page, methinks.

Could be, yes.
Well, it can't happen without the user noticing it anymore. Till now
you could import a bunch of public keys and this didn't prevent
importing of a secret key hidden amongst them. Now you see that there's
somebody trying to feed you with a secret key. You can of course import
it (in a second go with the --allow-secret-key-import switch), but it
doesn't work without you noticing it.

--passphrase-fd expects a file descriptor, not a file. If you want to
go via this keyfile, then you'd need this syntax (I haven't tested it
on a Windows systems though):

So, with PGP you need at least one secret key in order to build a web
of trust? You can't just import public keys because you only intend to
verify signatures from that machine and then set trust values

Every line of this PGP public key block has a trailing space at the
end. Remove those spaces and the key will import without any problems.
Perhaps GnuPG should report this? pgpdump reports "illegal radix64
character" which gave me the clue.

Janusz A. Urbanowicz quoted (in a private email to me, which I have been
given permission by him to mention here) the following section from RFC
2440, page 46, paragraph 6.4:
 Any characters outside of the base64 alphabet are ignored in Radix-64
 data. Decoding software must ignore all line breaks or other
 characters not found in the table above.
So, it indeed looks like GnuPG should cope with it and issue a warning
as is suggested in the paragraph following the above one.

Is it possible to sign an old PGP 2.x key with a current GnuPG key and

If I try the following:
    gpg --output public.asc --export mykey
    pgp -ka public.asc

    Unsupported packet format - you need a newer version of PGP for

Is there any way it can be done, or is it just not possible to sign an

@_subject: Suggestion 
I think it would be a nice addition if GnuPG asked for your passphrase
when exporting the secret key with --export-secret-key. I know that it
is not necessary, but it would make it safer against misuse as the key
couldn't be extracted unattended, ... IYSWIM.

In article <200102171158.MAA01836
Yes, ok, then let's make my suggestion different. Then I think a
confirmation question like:
   "Are you sure you want to export your secret key? (y/N)"
Should appear. I *know* that it doesn't introduce any security. But
it's generally a bad thing when you notice "Oooops, was this my SECRET
KEY BLOCK I attached to that email? Sh*t! Why didn't GnuPG warn me
about this." Not that this happened to me, but I know a few people that
are afraid of this happening.
I didn't mean to say that the key is safer. It's just that you don't
export it in a foolish manner without noticing what you are doing. Of
course even the exported SECRET KEY BLOCK is password protected. But
would you like to send your secret key to me? No. Why should an
inexperienced user not be warned if he tries to do something he doesn't
want to, but doesn't notice?

I've a short question concerning signing and lsigning. If you lsign a
key and afterwards (some time later) decide you want to export it and
therefore sign it, does the lsignature gets marked exportable or is a
new signature created? What is the recommended process if you change
your mind and want to make a local signature exportable?

What exactly is the problem with this key in compatibility respects to

In a security software, I want to know about all security concerns that
may occur! If I decide to ignore them, then I may do so, but at first I
want that the program doesn't hide any potential problems away from me.
This may differ for programs that are not security related.

That's different. GnuPG can't know about everything on my system
(especially not about security holes and information of the system
GnuPG has no access to). But if GnuPG *knows* that it's currently doing
something which could cause problems, then I want it to tell me.
No, I'm not. See above. Something like "deliberately" vs. "on

I'm against --writable-keyring as this seems to imply that the others
are not writable. Which may not be the case (from the file system's
point of view).
I'm against --import-keyring as this may be confused with an --import
option to import whole keyrings.
I'm in favour of --use-keyring, but I could as well imagine
--active-keyring to be suitable.

I once created a method of disabling Nimda on an infected computer (and
display a warning message for the user when the computer is booted next
time) while this computer tried to infect my HTTP server. However law
(at least in Germany) sees this as an aggression against the owner of

proof-of-concept and didn't use it in practise.
Interesting question, indeed.
