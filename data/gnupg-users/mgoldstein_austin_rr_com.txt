Questions from a hopeful convert:
1.  How do the random number generators compare?
2.  Are the prime numbers used in key generation calculated or is there a
prepared list (i.e. the quick key gen option in NAI's pgp)?
3.  It's my understanding there are no temp/swap etc. file generation to leave
an unaccounted plaintext.  Is this true, and how?
4.  Is there a wipe option? If not, how does one assuredly eliminate a
plaintext file.  If a wipe is present, how many overwrites are performed?
