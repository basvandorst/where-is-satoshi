@_subject: OT How can I reactivate my subscription 
Hash: SHA1
I used to subscribe at this list using the address pt . I am
subscribed but cannot receive any mail since my mailbox was full in
august. Now my mail is working OK but gpg-users-list doesn't mail me
any more.
I cannot subscribe again as I am already subscribed. How can I contact
any human responsible for the gpg-users list to fix the problem?

finally I reached a human being at the human address above. The
solution was at the above link, but not very obvious:
I had to log in and find an option far down the page:
"delivery options" . It was set to "Disabled"! After changing to
"Enabled" I hope it will work.
An option not to receive any mailings to the list your are subscribed
to! That's a reale strange option I couldn't imagine. It was
automatically activated because my mail bounced.
I have suggested a hint on the login page:
eg. "Your mail is automatically blocked if messages bounces. To
reactivate delivery please log in and change the settings for your
