@_subject: Options to revoke a key 
I must admit it that I was dumb enough to create an nice key (for playing with a USB Token "eToken") and forget the passphrase...
Apparently I also didn't create a revoke certificate (not sure if I understand the whole revoking thing here because I'am prompted for the passphrase upon revoking the key). I still remember fragments of my passphrase. That's why I'am asking for advice how to brute force recover it. Any real life experience with those things? The OS is Linux.
Thanks for your help

I thaugt of using a dictonary file (filled with the fragments that I still remember
and other common words).
The only missing part is that I don't know how to really accomplish the "cracking" task.
Running gpg --edit-key  and revoking the key where I am prompted for the passphrase is not that practicable to put in a loop and try every combination
based of my custom dictonary....
Hm - tried it. Gpg tells me that I didn't found any revocation keys for the given ID.
Thanks for your advice - that's what I've done with the new key.
