@_subject: unable to encrypt emails in evolution using gpg 
When I encrypt email and click Send I get this error and sending mail
Because "gpg: CEF41E5C: skipped: unusable public key
gpg: [stdin]: encryption failed: unusable public key
", you may need to select different mail options.
Where CEF41E5C is my key.
Please note: I have imported both private and public keys of mine. Also
the paraphrase I enter is correct
Please help, thanks.

I found the solution myself, luckily.
You have two keys, one is pub and other is sub right? (you can find
them in `gpg --edit-key CEF41E5C`)  so in my case pub key was fine but
sub key was expired. Its a long story why. So edited the sub to expire
`never` and my problem was solved.
Thanks for your interest.
