Will there be a binary available for GnuPG 1.2.0 for Intel Windows NT
platforms with the key revokation patch (and other patches) applied?
If not, can someone recommend an easy way to compile the sources under

I've read what caused this error under 1.0.6 when exporting a key from
1.0.7.  But why is it happening under 1.2.0?
Am I doing something bizarre?  What is with the IDEA message?  I don't use
C:\ --default-key 403fb2a7 --clearsign

gpg: the IDEA cipher plugin is not present
gpg: please see  for more information

Is there another variety of the hardware someone could recommend that

E.g. Memory smart card, cf card, other usb card?

I'll need to revoke it...

It's all crypto to me... :-)
I'm not exactly sure now which version I used.  I had 1.0.6, 1.2.0 and
Nullify's 1.0.7 R2 binary installed at the same time.  (Bad idea.)
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

You can ignore the IDEA message.  As for the 254 problem, can you do:
gpg --export-secret-key 403fb2a7 | gpg --list-packets
After the line that begins "skey[3]: ..." there is a line that says
something like "iter+salt S2K, algo: 1...".  Can you tell me what the
line reads?  You can snip off the "salt" if you prefer.
Also, what version of GnuPG did you generate the key with?

Definately 1.2.0.  I uninstalled the others. I also tried this with 1.2.0
under Linux. Note: This email may contain confidential info and is intended only for the

Hmm.  What version of gpg were you running for =

you sure it is not 1.0.6 ?

No.  This listing is from 1.2.0!  I uninstalled the others. I also tried
this with 1.2.0 under Linux.
I attempted to use the key under PGP 6.5.8 (ugh!) and I didn't get an error,
but it pretended like I had the wrong passphrase.
I also attempted to use the key under Nullify gnupg 1.1.91-nr1, to no avail,
with the same errors and same --list-packets output.
I can't seem to find a single version of the software that can read this
key!  And I was dumb enough to send the public part out to the keyservers

You have listed this using gpg < 1.0.7, =
254 indicates the new SHA1 protection but old =
versions of GnuPG didn't
know about this and assumed this is the protection =
algorithm.  OpenPGP
recently changed the meaning of the protection algo =
254 which could be
done because algorithm numbers > 127 were not =
If you want to export this key so that 1.0.6 can use =
it, do a   gpg --export-secret-key --simple-sk-checksum =
0x12345678 >mykey.sec
with gnupg >=3D 1.0.7
Does it work now?

If there is a problem with locking on FAT12 filesystems (and other similar
filesystems) under Linux, how is locking handled in OSes where FAT is the
native fs?

solution for it.
flash-disks come with a vfat
anything about
etc.). The only solution is
an option ;) Changing
not working with my
MacOS-9 box... And now think
securly on the disk...
There is a solution.  The problem is in locking, =
so if you use
--lock-never then GnuPG will not try and lock the =
keyrings.  However,
you will need to make very sure you never run two =
copies of GnuPG at
the same time :)
One good way to do it is to keep the pubring online =
as it is the one
people generally need to write to when importing new =
keys, and only
keeping the secring on the flash disk.  No =
locking issues in that
system unless you want to add a new secret =
