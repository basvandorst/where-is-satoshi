@_subject: Tor Support for SKSkeyservers in 2.1 
Hash: SHA512
I am having trouble setting up TOR support for sks-keyservers in 2.1.
I recently migrated my system from an ubuntu install where I had this
in my gpg.conf file.
keyserver hkps://hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net
keyserver-options ca-cert-file=~/.gnupg/sks-keyservers.netCA.pem
keyserver-options http-proxy=socks5-hostname://127.0.0.1:9050
Now that I am on Arch, and using the 2.1 GPG I need to change some
options to make this work.
I have the following in my dirmngr.conf
hkp-cacert ~/.gnupg/sks-keyservers.netCA.pem
And it works with out the
keyserver-options http-proxy=socks5-hostname://127.0.0.1:9050
line in my gpg.conf
But then I don't have TOR support.
otherwise if I include it I get the following error message.
gpg: error searching keyserver: Configuration error
gpg: keyserver search failed: Configuration error
