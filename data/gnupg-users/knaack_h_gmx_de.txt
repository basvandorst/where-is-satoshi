on my machine running Linux and a recent KDE/Plasma, pinentry-qt
occasionally starts right after logging in and asks for my passphrase.
Is there any way to track down, which process asks gpg-agent for my private
key? Preferably, I would like pinentry to inform, which process actually is
the source of the key request.

Thanks for the hint. Unfortunately, it happens just very occasionally,
and I haven't figured out yet, what the reason may be. I have been logging
on at least ten times, and even fully rebooted five times today, without
getting such a request.
I have now installed the git version of pinentry and will just wait for
this issue to happen next.

This is much better. Somehow of a problem is just, that the pinentry window
is not resizable, so the window title gets cut off. I would say, all this
information should better be put inside the window itself.
It would also be nice, if you could release a new version, so distributors
can pick up and build it.

I hope not to get too far off topic, but I encountered that suspicious
request of pinentry right after loggin into KDE, again. So, with the PID it
provided, I checked with ps aux:
me        2486  0.0  0.0  34028  3940 ?        SL   21:46   0:00 gpg2 --enable-special-filenames --batch --no-sk-comments --status-fd 11 --no-tty --charset utf8 --enable-progress-filter --exit-on-status-write-error --display :0 --ttyname kein Terminal --ttytype xterm --decrypt --output - -- -&14
And pstree outputs:
When hitting cancel on that pinentry window, I get another window, stating
that kwallet wants to get access to my private key.
Any idea why this is happening or how I should proceed analysing? The only
legit process I would see should be my e-mail client.

I just wanted to report back on my issue. So, I actually ran the KWallet
configuration program (kwalletmanager5) and found the main switch in the
properties-menu to disable KWallet in my user account. It has been some
months now, and I have never been annoyed by randomly popping up pinentry
ever since.
Thanks for the help to guide me into the right direction.
