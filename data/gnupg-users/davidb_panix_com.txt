thanks for the replies Thorsten and Steven, but i need to set this up
on my isp's server which uses sendmail and procmail.
the first thing i need to accomplish is:
 1. check messages for gpg signatures
 2. add a new header line to the message
    that will indicate whether or not it's
    signed
      and if it's signed
        whether or not it's signed by
        someone who's public key already
        exists on my ring
can anyone help me out with this?
