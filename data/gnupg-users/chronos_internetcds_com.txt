@_subject: email signature file 
Hi all,
Just started using the gnupg keys and had a basic question: How do I setup my
gnupg keys as the signature file ? I see everyone has, so then how is it done ?
I`m using kmail on mandrake 7.1. The error I get is- this is a directory and
not a file.             Thank you, Chronos.

Hi all,
Well I got the signature file thing figured out as you can see below.
Next question is how then do I type a messge with the keys ? I can enter into
the directory and it says- go ahead and type your message. So then I type my
message etc. What do I do to encrypt it and finish ?
Thank you, Chronos.

@_subject: exporting keys to email 
Hi all,
Had a question about exporting my keys to my email. I found this on a redhat
site. gpg --armor --export >mykey.asc Now then I`m using Kmail
and running mandrake 7.1. Basic question first- under file settings pgp it asks
for your pgp user identity. What exactly am I supposed to put in there ? The
number or my you or something else ? Then when exporting my key to
my email it says file not found for the > What am I supposed
to put there ? Or do I need to create a file to export the key into first under
the gpg directory ?
                         Thank you, Chronos

@_subject: key malfunction 
Hi all,
Had one of my keys crap out on me this morning and aside from removing
all the files manually what else can I do to make sure there are no
remnant traces of the key left in my system.                                                             Thank you,
