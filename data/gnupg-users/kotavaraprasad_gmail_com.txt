Hi ALL!
I have downloaded "gnupg-2.0.15.tar.bz2" and done the below steps to install
them on SunOS.
Step1: unzipped it
Step2: Moved into the parent directory(gnupg/gnupg-2.0.15.tar.bz2) and types
Step3: I have also tried checking whether gpg is already installed or not.
For all the above commands I get "KSH: NOT FOUND" reply.
It will be a great help if any one can send me the installation guide.
Thanks in advance,
Varaprasad Kota.

Hi Paul!
First, Thank you very much for your response.
After trying with different options, I was able to compile it with the
command "./configure AR=gar". I have also GCC compiler installed readily. I
tried compiling it and it gave me a error message saying that I need to
install library file "*libgpg-error, libgcrypt, libassuan, libksba,
Pth.........Required libraries not found. Please consult the above messages
*** and install them before running configure again.*".
I have downloaded them, unzipped and placed in the home directory of GNUPG.
I have tried recompiling again with the command "./configure AR-gar". I
still get the same message.
Pls advised me what needs to be done on this.  After unzipping the above lib
files what needs to be done. Pls send me step by step instructions.
I have attached the error message.
Thanks in advance,
Vara Prasad Kota
