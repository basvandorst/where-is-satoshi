@_subject: decrypting a file with passphrase in the command as an option 
I tried to change the passphrase to blank but it keep giving me errors
both in Key Manager and GPA (btw, I am using GPG for Windows).  I then
tried to create a new key with blank passphrase and it wont let me.  How
do I remove a passphrase insteading of changing it?

Yes, the option is descriped in the man page.  But before you do that
you should think about it.  It is in almost all cases better to remove
the passphrase from the key.
We have this question here every few weeks.
