I have created a master key along with a subkey for authenticating and a subkey for signing.
I copied the subkeys to my smartcard (Nitrokey Pro 2) using gpg2 --edit-key 93DA8C1D and did not enter save thereafter, but deleted them manually using gpg2 --card-edit.
I deleted the master private key.
gpg2 -k 93DA8C1D

gpg2 -K no private keys are visible.
What have I missed? I read online the stubs are generated automatically with the above command.
Thank you.

I deleted ~/.gnupg and imported the public key as you asked.
All is working, thank you Dirk.
I apologise for not checking this sooner and I'm not sure what broke as I tried a clean import previously.
PS I also picked up a few good tips just by watching this list (thank you Werner for "echo foo | gpg --clearsign -v --debug ipc").
