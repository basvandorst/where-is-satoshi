@_subject: GPG help... 
I need a bit of assistance with GPG. Basically I want to be able to call the
exe from an ASP page having built the command line in code, however I can't
find a way to pipe the password into the command. Is it possible? I am using
the pre-compiled WinNT executable.
Please cc me since I am not on the mailing list...
