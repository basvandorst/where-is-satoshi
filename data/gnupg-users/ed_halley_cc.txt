@_subject: gpg --encode / gpg --decode round-trip breaks my files 
I'm having trouble with encryption of binary files on Linux.
If I understand correctly, the round-trip through --encrypt and
--decrypt should be identical.  I would do this sort of encryption with
PGP on Windows many times, but cannot with GPG and the same key, or even
a newly generated key.  GPG gives no error messages, but breaks the
Upon hexdump inspection of wells.gif.out vs wells.gif, the bytes are
similar, but get out of sync after a few dozen bytes.  This happened
near some 0x09 0x0A bytes, by chance, in this test.  Is this some
strange ASCII newline assumption artifact?  Binary files don't need to
be encoded first, do they?
Other data:  this is Red Hat Linux 7.3 (Valhalla) with all updates,
giving a GPG version 1.0.6.
