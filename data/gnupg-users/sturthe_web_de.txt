just tried to enable iconv.dll and idea.dll in the optionsfile (gpg.conf).
Note: Both files are in a folder called lib!
load-extension lib\iconv.dll
load-extension lib\idea.dll
Using the --version command I recognize that idea.dll was found, but there's
the nasty "iconv.dll missing error". So I used a file monitoring program
(FileMon from SysInternals) and found, that (after execution) gpg.exe looks
first for iconv.dll, and then for gpg.conf. I can't believe that this was
intended, because in an earlier version (1.4.3) there was no such a
Maybe somebody can confirm this?
PS: Using GnuPG 1.4.5 on Windows XP

first of all thanks for your answers. I gave up my lib-directory for the
dll's and copied them to the root of gpg.exe. But honestly I'm still
confused, because it worked using version 1.4.3. That's why I thought it
could be a bug in the new version.
