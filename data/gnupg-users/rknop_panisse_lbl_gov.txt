@_subject: Piping stdout to more or less? 
When I run either
  gpg --decrypt file.gpg | more
  gpg --output=- file.gpg | more
things don't work as they ought to.  I don't see the prompt for the
password; this is unsurprising, since it's probably lost somewhere in the
pipe.  I type my passphrase, and then the cleartext is priunted to the
screen, along with the More prompt.  However, none of the more keypresses
do what I expect; space does not move to the next page, and so forth.
I've also tried less, with the same problem.  Instead, all of the keys I
press are echoed back to the screen after the More prompt at the bottom of
the screen.
Is there a way to get stdout output of gpg piped into a pager, without
having to first save the cleartext to disk?
Thank you,

I've tried
  gpg --output=- file.gpg | more
under both tcsh and bash.  Both have the same problem: the keys I hit
aren't going to more as commands, but appear on the tty.

I'm using RedHat 7.1.  The shells are straight from what came with that:
tcsh 6.10 and bash 2.04.  I am running XFree86 4.1 (which is part of the
reason for the -ac kernel; most of the rest of the reason is just that I'm
a freak who likes to compile kernels).  However, I expect that has no
bearing whatsoever on the behavior of command-line gpg and pipes and so
tcsh doesn't always pipe stderr and stdout together; you have to use "|&"
to get them to pipe together.  I use that fairly frequently, to see the
stdout of something but to send the stderr elsewhere (e.g. /dev/null, or
just to the console to be wiped out the first time I use a less "redraw").

@_subject: finding keyservers 
The GPG documentation suggests that one could get a list of keyservers by
  host -l pgp.net | grep wwwkeys
This doesn't seem to work for me:
  pasand:~% host -l pgp.net
  Host pgp.net. not found: 9(NOTAUTH)
  ; Transfer failed.
Is there another way to get that list?  Is there something stupid I've
done that might prevent the authorization of getting that list with

I switched my shell to bash, and now piping the output of gpg to more or
less seems to work.
My shell used to be tcsh.  I had tried running bash, and then from that
shell piping to less, but there it didn't work.  But when my shell is bash
in the first place, it does seem to work.
I don't pretend to understand any of this.  However, I guess the time has
come for me to learn and adapt to using bash....

(Sorry about the date of the last message; I've fixed the time on that
machine, and warned the people who are now the real sysadmins that the
battery is dead and they have to think about it whenever it powers down.)
I spoke too soon.
It worked the first time.  It hasn't worked since.  Indeed, trying to do
it seems to screw up my bash session worse than it ever screwed up tcsh.
So my problem with piping the output of gpg to a pager still stands.
