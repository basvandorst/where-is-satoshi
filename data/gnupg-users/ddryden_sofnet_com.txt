I'm new to this list, and glad to be in good company.
My question is can gpg encrypt .jpegs .gifs etc... ??
Here's what I did: "gpg -ea foo.jpg ".
It encrypted with the --armour switch to ascii very nicely.
And it named it foo.jpg.gpg.asc
But when I ran: gpg -d foo, well,
here's the output:
[ddryden gpg -d foo gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: decrypt_message failed: eof
So my question is, does gpg do image format encryption?
Many thanks in advance
Daniel Dryden
P.S. I hope I presented this clearly enough :)

GPG doesn't care for the format behind the file extension. It
can encrypt all kind of data formats, including those of pictures.
When you use "gpg -d foo.jpg.gpg.asc" it asks you for the
passphrase and then it should work. You've to use the full name of the
file (that contains the ciphertext), not the name of the plaintext.
Timo, I tried "gpg -d foo.jpg.gpg.asc" , then typed in the pass phrase
and all that happened was  my terminal turned into a Matrix screensaver !
Garble. BTW it is a Gif file.  I can't find any documentation regarding encrypted
images. Thanks for your help regardless.
