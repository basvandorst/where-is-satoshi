@_subject: Signing already-encrypted files (all to self)? 
Can't speak for Chris of course, but maybe you don't want the private
key "open" too much. You can encrypt without the private key. Same
doesn't go for TrueCrypt.
(When it comes to signing that's another matter, but you could always
make a separate key for signing.)
Now the thing that I _do_ wonder about, Chris, is why you want to hash
the plaintext files? Why not hash them encrypted? (No need to
decrypt-then-hash-then-encrypt a bunch of files.)

"When his wife was hospitalized, G?del literally starved himself to
death, unwilling to eat anything not prepared by her."
What I don't get is, why didn't he just make his own food?

Why fix what's not broken?
(i.e. who cares if it doesn't use with-colons? It works, right? If it
ever breaks, we can change it. But it works for the time being.)

@_subject: Why revoke a key? 
Calculate how many combinations there are, assume some number of tries
per second (you can experimentally find this out), and there you go.
But remember Murphy's(?) law! -- (I mean the one about doubling computer
power every 18 months -- are there two Murphy's laws? Confused now...)
You can measure the strength of your password in bits of entropy, which
is basically the log base 2 of the number of combinations. So if there
are 64 possible combinations (a single alphanum case-sensitive
password-ish) then you have 6 bits of entropy. In the diceware FAQ at
 you can find info about how long a password with a
given number of bits is supposed to be secure. Also some tips on how to
pick a memorizable secure passphrase.
Yes but remember the attacker might get at an old version of your key
that still used the old passphrase.

This is why I hated physics: Everything is named after someone. It's
also why I picked computer science. Oh...

@_subject: Problem when decrypting PGP messages 
I'm using the exact same configuration (though with a Google Apps
account, not sure if there's a difference from Google Mail).
Google is working fine for me. However I have conversation view switched
off and various other "special" options set so you might want to go
through your settings and see if you can tweak them a bit. Conversation
view is a real mess.
