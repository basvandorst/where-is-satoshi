@_subject: Trouble with enigmail and Thunderbird 1.5 
Hash: SHA1
I have recently switched ISP, but I also upgraded Thunderbird at the same time.
Now when I get a gpg signed e-mail, I supposedly can check the pen? and it
will offer to download the key, giving me a choice of keyservers. I
generally pick random.sks.keyserver.penguin.de
But now, when I do that, it just buzzes around and never downloads the key.
I looked at my firewall, and it is not blocking it. I tried it manually with
 gpg --keyserver keyserver.kjsl.com --recv-key 0xF621EDAD
for example, and it worked fine.
Is this a known problem? Or should I find a Thunderbird newsgroup to ask?
And if so, which one?

I get the same message when I try to import your key. So if it is not you,
it is both Thunderbird 1.5 and the keyserver. I would not expect both to be

I can see you are making a point,
One with which I agree.
People will conform with whatever measuring system is in place.
If you get paid in lines of code, they will generate a lot of
lines of code, even if a better program can be written with fewer.
If they get paid inversely by memory requirements, they will write
small programs.
If they get paid by fast programs, they will probably write fast ones.
It would be more difficult to pay people by reliability of programs,
clearness and simplicity of documentation, etc., but those might be
worthwhile criteria.
All of which reminds me I forgot to send my contribution to FSF last year.

While it would not prevent google from looking at the envelope (sender's

from analyzing the content by encrypting it with gnupg (e.g., with
enigmail). This would require your destinations to have pgp or gnupg and use it.

Hash: SHA1
Are just the PCs at work shared, or are the secret keys at work shared too?
It depends, partly, on the security features of the OS you are running. Can
the other users see your key ring? If you run Linux or Unix, for example,
and have the permissions of directory containing your key ring set to
drwx------ , and the permissions of your secret key ring set to -rw-------
you should be pretty safe except from the super-user. If you do not trust
the super user, you are in big trouble in any case. It is my understanding
that the security features of at least some versions of Windows are much
less and that anyone can get at those files.
In theory, yes, especially if it is too simple. If you pick a complicated
one such as NICqW$Yu1Fg.ZSLawenaP5ZCiDy (now that that one has been
displayed on the Internet, it is no longer considered a good one), they are
much less likely to guess it even with a dictionary attack. The main trouble
with a passphrase like that is that it may take a month or so before you can
remember it, and writing it down is not considered a good idea.
That is safe as long as the other users of your machine are not running
programs on it while you are using it.

I suspect that Linux and OSX may be more resistant to compromise than
Windows systems, but I would not wish to be dogmatic about it ("Do not step

~  a firewall. The only servers I run do not serve the Internet (ntpd and
sendmail and named). So I am pretty safe. But if I desired to prove that my
machine were uncompromised, how would I go about it?
I imagine it is not so easy. Once I tried to write test programs that
pinpointed hardware errors. I wanted them mathematically correct. I could
not because I always needed to assume some of the machine was working
correctly. Thus, a memory test program assumes, at least, that the
processor(s) are working correctly. A processor test assumes the memory is
working correctly, and so on.
It seems to be a chicken and egg problem both for software and hardware.

This seems to be a common problem. There may be organizations that use PGP
or GPG to sign and even encrypt their e-mail. But the average computer user
does not seem willing to do anything to increase the security of their
electronic communications. They talk about big brother intruding on their
communications, they worry about eavesdropping, and so on, but are
absolutely unwilling to use GPG, or even Enigmail, to accomplish it. WHen
all is said and done, more is said than done.
That is a problem. I tend to sign my e-mails except on mailing lists where
they are not welcome (but I forget and sign them sometimes when I forget). I
used to be resigned to be relegated to the computernerd class, but I get
complaints at times from people whose mail client cannot seem to tolerate
My view is that the signature is already subtle enough for this. At least
you do not encrypt your messages to people who cannot decrypt them. Of
course, you cannot, since you need their public key to encrypt.
I have no idea. I suppose people would not know what your logo meant anyway.

down some, so I looked into the radiator where there was no noticeable
water. We got some from the restaurant. I forgot what the trouble was
(defective radiator hose, loose clamp, etc.), but at least she did not
need to get a new engine.

I thought the keys were used to encrypt the block containing the session
key (that is, IIRC, 512 bits). And it is the session key that is used to
encrypt and decrypt the actual message. Since the session key is small,
encrypting or decrypting it should not take a lot of time compared with
doing an entire message (depends on its length, of course).
So unless the time to encrypt or decrypt the session key is large
compared with the time to encrypt or decrypt the actual message, is this
discussion not about the wrong thing? What is the message size of the
messages being used to come up with the numbers on this thread? Are they
realistically large (whatever that might be)?

Way back when (1970s, I guess) we had a computer where I worked that was
networked to another one many miles away that acted as a server. We used
punched cards in those days. Passwords were up to 6 6-bit characters. To
run a job, you put a job card ahead of the stuff you wanted to run. We
had a whole box of those gang-punched and you took one and used it for
your job. The password was PASSWD. Some security. 8-(
Later I had to use multiple machines, and some I could log into with a
Teletype or similar communication device. Each had a different rule for
acceptable passwords. So there was no way I could use the same password
on all the machines. Now I now know that it is not a good idea to do
that in any case, but we were not supposed to write down our passwords.
And some required changing the password every month, so there was no way
to remember them all in any case. Even if I could remember them, I could
not even remember what login to use on each machine, and which password
went with which login so I did write them down and to hell with the
management rules.
I do not think it is entirely not wanting to be educated. But if the
education takes several hours a week to keep up with and to administer
my own responsibilities in the process( generating new passwords, and
different ones on a frequent basis, finding some way to remember them
other than writing them on a post-it note on a monitor, keeping up with
password rules (Must have letters in both cases, special characters,
digits, at least some length, not to exceed some other length, not a
simple permutation of the last few used on this system, etc. But some
require some or all of these. Some allow only letters and digits, and so
on. Who can keep up?), then management would have to budget the time so
I could do it, and they will not. There has to be a better way, and I do
not know what it is.

called a LAN in the building where the server might be first, then dial
the number of the server on that LAN, then log into that server.
Oh! Yes. Once I got stuck implementing security on a bunch of UNIX
servers on a battery of PDP-11/70s and Vaxes. I made it necessary for
each user to assign himself a password. I gave them 30 days and cut off
those who had not done it. I almost got lynched. I also put slowdowns in
the login program. If you got the password wrong, it waited a second
before you could try again. If you failed a second time, I doubled it,
etc. When it got up to a minute, I had it hang up on them.
People then got to leaving their terminals logged in, so I put a timer
in there and if they did no input for an hour, I logged them out. They
hated that too. That was not enough. Some  would wander around
and change passwords of people who deserted their terminals. I got so
many people mad at me that I was relieved of my responsibility for that,
thank goodness.

First of all, I would have to install everything from the distribution

know that the downloaded updates are correct? These days, the updates
come with checksums and sometimes have digital signatures, so they may

When I was on a grand jury, the prosecutor said that while the words of

that they did not prosecute for this unless there was intent to commit a

A friend who worked at a bank said they never looked at the dates, but
cashed them when presented unless there were insufficient funds to honor
them. So there is no use in writing a post dated check unless the person
to whom it is presented holds on to it until the date.
As treasurer of a tax deductible organization, I use the date on the
check as the date of the donation except sometimes I do not. I do not
when it is dated something late in December, but postmarked mid January
or later. In that case, I use the postmark date.

Let us assume you are the bad guy and have computing power that can do
an arbitrarily large number of key attempts per second. Unless you have
my encrypted keys, you have to access my computer (unless you have
already stolen it, in which case there are much easier ways to invade
the machine), you will have to try logging in through the Internet (in
the case of my machine), and the first thing you will hit is the login
program. This can probably handle only a few attempts per second, and if
I were serious about security, I would have it double the time to reply
each time it got a failed login on that connection. In the days of
dialup, I would have the machine hang up on the connection with too many
failed login attempts.
Of course, if you could get into my machine and login as the only user
with access to my encrypted password file, you could copy that file to
your high speed facility and crack it at your leisure. But if you could
do that, you could already do anything you wanted with my machine --
install trojan horse keyloggers, defeat the security in the login
program, etc.

Quite possibly. And unwarranted assumptions are especially pernicious
because those are typically those I am unaware of making.
I am not a security expert anymore. I really was never a security
expert, though I was once put in charge of security for 10 VAX machines
running UNIX, but this was around 30 years ago almost before the
Internet. Some of us were using uucp on dialup, but that was about it.
In those days it was almost impossible to get the users to use passwords
on their accounts.
I realize if you stole my computer that I would notice it.
If you broke into my house skillfully enough that I did not notice it,
you could install a key logger, or copy my hard drives, steal my backup
tapes, ... . But you could also remove all protections by getting in as
the root user (on UNIX-Linux). And I might not notice that.
The trick is to do that from the Internet. I have some safeguards to
protect me, and they may protect me from amateurs, but an expert might
be able to defeat me.
It seems to me that to do much damage to my machine, you need to get a
shell with root access. And to do that, do you not pretty much need the
root password? Or hijack a program that is currently running with the
root privileges?
I never run a web browser as root. But there are demons that run and
some have root privileges. Such as the download mechanism to download
updates from Red Hat. My nameserver does not run as root. I do not run
telnet. ssh will talk only to specified IP addresses on my LAN. My
firewall will not accept messages from outside unless in reply to
something I sent out, so I believe it would take a man-in-the-middle
attack to get past that unless the firewall is defective. I actually
have two firewalls; a primitive one in the router that comes with
Verizon's FiOS service, and another one using iptables. These, too,
could have bugs, especially if I made a mistake in programming the
iptables firewall.
At one extreme, the only way to be pretty safe is to have a machine that
is not connected to the Internet, and have U.S.Marines to guard the
hardware and access to it. I do not choose to defend myself against
threats that would reasonably require that. I want my security to be
weak enough that the black hats would not resort to torture to get the
information they want.
The friends of mine that even know what computer security might mean do
not even encrypt their e-mails, though they worry about it's being
intercepted. Friends complain if I digitally sign my e-mails. I assume
if they could accept encrypted e-mails, that they would save them in
clear form on their machines anyway. So maybe I am kidding myself.
I do not think my machine has been taken over. For one thing, I can
pretty much see the Internet traffic from it, and when I am not doing
anything, not much goes down the Internet. A friend whose machine was
hacked (Windows ME) had lots of Internet traffic and the machine got
impossibly slow. The hard drives never stopped clicking. I do not have
that, though the hard drives on this machine do not click, but the
Xosview program shows that when nothing is going on, nothing except
BOINC programs run. The demons do, but they do not use any processor time.
If I ran this machine as a server, my problems would surely be worse.

I almost never sign anything unless I suspect the destination can at

diminishing population because most have moved to texting on cell
phones, or twitter or Facebook) have no interest in security, though
they sometimes act in a paranoid fashion about eavesdropping. But they
refuse to do anything about it. They cannot deal with MIME signatures
(at least those still using AOL), and cannot ignore them either.
They hate the inline signatures too. When I do sign, it is just to draw
attention to the fact I have a public key and can accept signed and
encrypted e-mail. And so far, other than complaints about extraneous
text in my emails, that is about it. I really get no use from it.
So signing to this list, and an occasional test that my stuff is still
working is the only use I get from gnupg and enigmail. The stuff I would
really prefer to send encrypted I cannot send that way because those to
whom I would send it could not read it (they have no software and no
public keys). And if they could, they would probably save it in clear
text somewhere, forward it, or whatnot.
I think PGP and gnupg are really great ideas, whose time has not yet
come. And by the time people realize its usefulness, the snooping
community will have made it impossible to use it anymore. People sending

Mr. Red and Ms. Hat can be trusted, I do not care if they are the two

* I am not protected from any black hats subversively working for Red Hat.
* I am not protected if their site is highjacked by black hats until

* I am not protected if the DNS is damaged somewhere and when my update

Probably the software Red Hat supplies is kept on a machine that is not

I do not know how they do it either. I assumed that each major release,
that for Red Hat occurs only about every 18 months, they do sign each
and every file in the repository. They probably have an automatic way to
do that. And then someone sneakernets it over to the Internet-connected
machines that do the downloads to the customers.
For updates, I assume they do that to each file that has been touched
and carry them over to the Internet-connected servers in a batch, say
once a day. But maybe they resign and carry over everything in the
repository to save the trouble of figuring out which have been touched
and which have not. The whole release fits on one DVD. Recall that for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux, with extremely few exceptions, they do not do
enhancements: those are delayed until the next major release up to 18
months later. They only do bug and security fixes (and that time-zone
file change). So once a day (or whenever the regression testing is
completed successfully) some clerk can do the carry over at some time,
presumably late at night.

Well, the bug and security fixes can come out several times a day
(though that is not usual), and new RHEL kernels seem to be coming out
every month or so these days. But those are bug fixes and security
fixes. When I read their release notes on those things, they do not
describe enhancements on the kernel.
Similarly for things like postgresql, they may backport bug fixes but
they do not put in enhancements as far as I can tell.
Perhaps they enhanced Firefox, but that is not the usual thing. I notice
no enhancements for GnuCash that is quite a ways behind what other
distributions are using. They try to keep up with Java, but that is to
hope to keep up with the security failures in that.
I know major releases do not happen exactly every 18 month. IIRC, they

If somehow you trust the Linux kernel you are using, that is already a
big assumption.
That would assure you that the Kernel source was used to compile the
kernel. And if all was properly signed, and you have somehow obtained
the fingerprint of the signing key in some reliable way, that would
give high assurance.
But how about the compiler that was used. It could have been sabotaged
too, to insert a back door into any code it compiled, or only code for
files with names that exist in the compiler and a kernel, perhaps.
So not only need you trust the people who examined the source code for
the kernel, you need to trust the people who support the kernel to
have done the same thing for the compiler they use. And the compiler
they used for compiling that compiler.
To really trust (or not trust), you have to take all that C-code for
the first compiler and compile it by hand to binary (not assembly
level). Then use that to make the assembler that has been similarly
verified, then the C compiler you really want to use, and so on.
I am not sufficiently paranoid to do this, and I would not live long
enough to do it even were I motivated to do it. Maybe Ken Thompson or

So they run around like chickens with their heads cut off, but refuse to

My correspondents hate it when I even sign something because they think
the signature is some kind of error message that they do not understand,
and they ignore stuff they do not understand (like messages to update

When I want privacy, I wring my hands in despair because only one person

Very few use Linux. And as far as I know, he uses it only because it is

the only one he knows who has the capability of using it, he will
probably stop using it too.
So when I want privacy, I cannot use it anyway because none of my

is useless except in very small communities of committed users, and I am

clutches, no power steering, no power brakes, no radios, etc.
He said the added complexity would have two benefits:
1.) Some really stupid people would not be able to drive them because
they would be stalled out most of the time.
2.) Those who could get them to move would have to pay a higher level
of attention to what they were doing than the average driver.

I had been driving Alfa Romeo Giulietta Spiders for a while, and one
Giulia (same car, 1600 cc engine).
Then I bought a Lotus 26. I had driven my current Alfa to NYC (the
nearest Lotus dealer to Buffalo NY where I was living). I had already
bought and paid for the car, but it needed preparation so I could not
take delivery until the next day.
Nevertheless, the owner of the dealership took me to dinner at a fancy
French Restaurant on his bill. He started by buying me a Martini. I
drank it, but did not like it much. He then bought me another. I nursed
it along, but finished it. He then ordered me a third. I told him I did
not want it, that two were enough. He insisted. I took one sip to be
polite, but I was not going to drink any more.
He surprised me, though. He took the drink from my hand and smashed it
to the floor. He then pointed out the old saw about martinis were like
breasts on a woman: one is not enough, but three are too many.
His point, as he explained, was that the Lotus 26 was not like the Alfa
Romeos that I was accustomed to, and if I drove the Lotus the same way,
I would kill myself. He then explained some of the fine points of a car
that normally understeered but under the right circumstances, could
oversteer, and that I better go to a large vacant parking lot and learn
to handle that. Which I did. Luckily, in Buffalo at the time, there were
blue laws that prohibited shopping malls from being open on Sundays so
even if I spun out the car, other than a little excitement, I could not
really hurt anything. The Lotus 26 was not like the 300 SL or the W-186
in switching from under to oversteer, but it could do it. It saved my
life once or twice when driving on snow with glare ice (that I did not
know was there) underneath it.
But it takes nerve, when the front end is losing it to shift down a gear
and floor it, when instinct and reflexes make you want to hit the brakes.
But none of that will work on my Prius.

Come to think of it, I had a friend who drove a Griffith (or some name
like that) which was basically a TVR designed with an 1800 cc British
engine in it. To make it into a Griffith, you swap out that little
engine and put in a Ford 275 (or so) cubic inch one. I think the clutch
and transmission get replaced too, but I do not remember (or care). this
must have been in the early 1960s.
Well, when he took the thing to the inspection station, you sometimes
get an inspector who fancies himself a race car driver. But do not
actually have the knowledge or skill for it.
Well this one takes it to the brake testing machine, which here is a
long instrumented track. The drill is to take the car up to some modest
speed, and hit the brakes. The machine measures the braking forces of
all four wheels, etc.
Well this clown revs up the engine and pops the clutch. If I remember
correctly, that car would do 0 to 60 in something like 4 seconds. It
would not handle worth a damn, but it sure would accelerate. By the time
he got his foot off the gas and onto the brake, he had run past the end
of the machine and almost hit the car ahead (it did have good brakes).
Since he missed the car ahead, he gave my friend a pass on that test.

Return addresses like

In my little list, I did not pick these people and see how to link to
them; they were people I new directly (the one-hop ones),
Or I knew someone who knew them (my piano teacher: Gorgbachev, my

Getting to Richard Nixon was a bit harder. A friend of mine knew his mother.
I am actually surprised and impressed by my list. Not that anyone else
should care.
And on this list, David Wagner was easy since I worked with his mother
at Bell Labs and met him not long after he was born. He surely has no
recollection of me.
Speaking of Bell Labs, kind of a name-dropping switchboard. My
grandfather worked there, so I am a two handshakes away from Clinton
Davisson. And I worked there and knew Doug McIlroy, and knew Ken
Thompson and Dennis Ritchie very slightly. Also Bela Julesz. And Vic
Vyssotsky was the most compulsive cigarette smokers I ever met, but a
uniquely brilliant computer scientist. Jean Felker, who lead the TRADIC
project (possibly the first transistorized electronic computer)
interviewed me when I first tried, as a high school student, to get a
summer job there. We talked about round-off problems when using
fixed-length and fixed-point arithmetic.

@_subject: Recommended key size for life long key 
I would think the NSA would have two teams, that might work together at
times. One is interested in breaking the encryption of those they deem
to be enemies. The other is making encryption mechanisms that are as
difficult to break as they know how, for the use of our own secret
services, state department, and so on.
So perhaps the snooping division is pushing elliptic curve technology
because they have a technique for breaking those that they have not
published and that has not yet been leaked.
But the other division is developing some superior technique, such as
hyperbolic curves (I made that name up; it has nothing to do with
reality) that is at least an order of magnitude more difficult to break.
For use by any government agency that has secrets to keep but must
communicate from place to place, or from time to time. Some might need
public key encryption methods, some might manage with symmetric key methods.

@_subject: General brute force attack question 
Hash: SHA1
I do not know what people do now, but in the old days, the black hat
team obtained a copy of the password file, /etc/passwd in UNIX and
Linux systems. This file was owned by the super-user but had to be
readable by anyone else.
The password file did not and does not contain the passwords at all.
It contains a string that is obtained by using the password to encrypt
a constant string (typically a bunch of blanks) and the encrypted
result is stored in that file. This scheme was quite effective when
the bad guys were trying to dial up and login from outside. First of
all, it was slow to log in so you could not try that many passwords
per hour.
Furthermore, I had a system where the delay for a new prompt increased
with every failure, and even then after a while, the system hung up on
the attacker.
When it became possible to just export that file, he could do so, and
then work much faster on a faster dedicate machine. To get around
that, there was a shadow file (/etc/shadow) that could only be read or
written by the super user and no one else. It was sometimes hidden
somewhere else, but I doubt that helped security much. But that file
could not be taken except if actually present in the machine room.
My information on what is done these days ends about 1990, so they may
be more sophisticated now. For one thing, for Linux systems, one can
run SELinux, where even the super-user could have a difficult time
getting at that shadow file.

@_subject: gpg in a =?ISO-8859-1?Q?cybercaf=E9?= 
I built a virtual machine once.
I had a computer with no memory management hardware. And I had a FORTRAN
compiler for it that worked pretty well, but if I wrote too many
EQUIVALENCE statements, the computer crashed. A FORTRAN compiler is
pretty big and inspecting all its code was out of the question.
I wrote a program for a virtual machine that had all the same
instructions as the real hardware did, so that was trivial: took less
than a day to write it. But it had a little extra feature: memory
management. The virtual machine ran as its input, the binary
instructions of the programs that would normally run on the real
machine. Like the OS, the compilers, etc. The easiest way to tell if the
real machine was running or the virtual machine was that the virtual
machine ran about 20x slower.
I loaded the virtual machine and started it up. Then I invoked the
FORTRAN compiler and presented it with a program with a lot of
EQUIVALENCE statements, and saw that it was over-writing the interrupt
vectors at the bottom of RAM, and further, what the offending
instruction was. The original compiler had a bug were an index register
needed to be specified, and it was omitted. Pretty simple.
Now a black hat could easily put any old virtual machine on that
machine, so doing nasty things would have been pretty easy. I suppose it
is a little more difficult at a cyber cafe or public library. But not if
I owned the cafe or worked in the library.

I remember in the past when I needed a random number generator, I made
plots on a crt where one random number was used as the x-coordinate and
the next one was used as the y-coordinate of a plotted point. I expected
to see a mess of noise, but there were, instead, stripes. Turns out
there was a bug in the RNG I was using.
