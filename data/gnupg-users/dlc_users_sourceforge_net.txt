I'm not sure that I understand what you mean by "outside the terminal

variable set and exported, then all the children will inherit it.
Similarly, if .xinitrc (or .xsession) has the variable set and exported,

xterms and window manager (and _their_ children) will inherit the

Would that be host-id of the sender's machine, or the mailhost, or one
of the servers along the way?  The only one that makes sense (to me) is
the hostid of the originating machine.  But, oops, wait, there's
firewalls in the way, so you can't check hostids.  Oh yeah, and I'm
sending this message from a kiosk in an internet cafe, and er, I almost
forgot, we have a farm of machines as a mailhost.
Not that I disagree with you, though -- I think a hostid should be part
of each Recieved header, which should be verified on a host-by-host
basis (i.e., each successive host in the path verifies the key of the
host that contacted it), perhaps with an ever growing checksum of those
hostids that each machine along the way verifies and then appends to
(such that a machine could verify the checksum for each set of recieved
headers).  But that's just my take on it. ;)

Good point.  I was thinking more along the lines of SSH-style host
keys, rather than PGP-style.
This seems to imply that the host's keys would exist in the WoT -- but
how (why?) would you sign a host's key, as opposed to a persons key?
It's trivial for a sysadmin to replace one host's key with another.

I'd like to chime in my support for this position.  In practice, there
is a difference between mail-delivery headers and content-related
headers.  The Subject header, for example, is for the user, not the MTA.
The Recieved headers, while being potentially interesting to the user,
are not part of the message the same way the that Subject is.

Send the shell cmomand you are using, along with info on the shell.
In general, with a sh-derived shell (sh, ksh, bash), redirecting output
is done with >, as you indicate:
  command [options] > outputfile
This will clobber outputfile for each run.  Appending to the output file
uses >> :
  command [options] >> outputfile
This won't capture errors, though; to do that, use:
  command [options] 2> errorfile
You can also use 2>> to append to the error file.
These can be combined as well:
  command [options] >> outputfile 2>> errorfile
Finally, to get both the output and errors in the same file:
  command [options] 2>&1 >> outputfile
If you need more help, send the literal command you are trying to use.
If you are using a broken^Wdifferent shell (csh, tsch), the syntax is
slightly different; hopefully someone else can help you with that.
