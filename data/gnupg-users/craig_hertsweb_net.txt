@_subject: Can you print GPG Emails? 
Hi All - a newbie question, so be gentle.
Probably a simple answer I'm sure but I can't seem to find a solution.
How on Earth do you print an email that has been encrypted using gpg?
I'm encrypting orders from an online store which are emailed to Outlook.
I decrypt using the Outlook plugin - and I can read it just fine.
Trouble is - when I try to print the order for my records - it prints the
encrypted version.
Thanks in advance if anyone can suggest a solution.
