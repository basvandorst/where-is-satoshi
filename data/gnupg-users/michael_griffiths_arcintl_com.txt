So who is on with the plausible deniability project for gpg?  I have to admit the thought of not being able to prove my innocence
doesn't sound like a good prospect. Innocent until proven guilty just
isnt an option anymore

So the people who come on gnupg-users asking for help because they've
forgotten their passphrase or accidentally deleted their ~/.gnupg
directory don't exist?
I guess that's a new way of replying to them: "You don't exist".
Not forgetting the possibility of malicious intentions - trying to frame
someone by putting encrypted data onto someone's computer and tipping
off the authorities.

Yes, and I'm sure that the government's (in any country) will word these
cases in there own favour and make anyone who uses this technology look
like the bad guys

You are, of course, assuming that the reporting is correct in its
implication that the defendants either admitted to having access to the
keys, or that it has been proven that they do have the keys.
I remember a lot of discussion at the time that the RIP bill was being
pushed through about the difficulty of proving that you don't have
access to a particular piece of information.
The RIPA is a particularly nasty piece of legislation in this respect.

This is what the uk law has to say on the matter (see below) so I
interpret it as this. You may not be guilty but if you don't give them
the info they require in the format they require you are then guilty of
that law.
3.1 Part III provides a statutory framework that enables public
authorities to require protected electronic information which they
have obtained lawfully or are likely to obtain lawfully be put into an
intelligible form; to acquire the means to gain access to protected
information and to acquire the means to put protected information
into an intelligible form.
3.2 The specific provisions are:
power to require disclosure of protected information in an
intelligible form (section 49);
power to require disclosure of the means to access protected
information (section 50(3)(c);
power to require disclosure of the means of putting protected
information into an intelligible form (section 50(3)(c)), and
power to attach a secrecy provision to any disclosure requirement
(section 54).
3.3 Failure to comply with a disclosure requirement or a secrecy
requirement is a criminal offence.

refusing to divulge data, or even regular people trying to protect their
privacy - they are child molestors and wanna-be terrorists.
Bollocks, To be charged is not necessarily to be guilty, The concept of
fair trial & presumend innocent until found guilty in a court of Law,
must preceed assuming pronoun "convicted" applies to each charged.
Better stick to technology.

@_subject: IT Department having the secure key. 
i wish to setup GNUpg for my work (i am the IT Administrator) but i have a
few questions.
First: if the user creates a key and then leaves the company. assuming
he/she didnt tell anyone the pass phrase and was the only key used, are
those files locked for ever?
if this is so my idea was the IT department (i.e. me) create the keys for
all my users and use a complete random password for all, then backup those
keys. then issue them to the user and allow them to change the pass phrase
to something they prefer. then if the user leaves we can use the originally
backed up key with the original password to decrypt the files they
will this work? i know it may sound like a security risk and ruin the whole
point of encrypting in the first place but this is the only way i can think
of safe gaurding the companies data (not users data).
Also have another question.
if a users key is compromised i.e. someone knows their pass phrase. should
the user just change the pass phrase or should a new key be generated? and
if a new key is needed will all the files that were encrypted with the old
key be in danger of be decrypted or be totally useless without the old key?
Sorry if this has been answered before or a dumb question. i am new to this

Hi Annette,
First GPG wouldn't have been loaded on its own via email, this would
require user installation. Which outlook version is he running? Also I am running outlook 2003 with
GPG installed and my search function works OK. How are they trying to do
a search?
