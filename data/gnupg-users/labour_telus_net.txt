@_subject: Why are my signatures being labelled as bad? 
I'm trying to figure out why I can send encrypted messages to myself at home from my work computer, and they come through just fine, but signed messages to myself from my work computer come labeelled as having a bad signature.
Work computer - Suse Linux 9.3 running Kmail and KGpg. Have identity set to sign and encrypt with same GPG keys. Exported public address to home Home computer Compaq laptop running Suse 10.0, also with Kmail and KGpg. Imported public key from work, set it as trusted. Signed files from work arrive at home with "bad" signatures. Encrypted files from work arrive and decrypt just fine. Signed files and encrypted files from home arrive at work just fine. Can anyone point me in the correct direction?
