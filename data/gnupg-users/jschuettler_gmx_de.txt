I'm all for breaking backwards compatibility.
What's the worst the haters can do? Turn their back on GnuPG? Shout out
really loud once more? I think they should get a life!

And that is my opinion, too.
Some people have the necessity to decrypt old data, so there should be a
separate tool for them to do exactly that. It's the only way to start
off fresh.
But I believe many people shouting out against the developers really
have no such reason. They are described very well with the word "hater"
and can be disregarded.
