@_subject: New hashes - what to do to enable them 
Hash: SHA1
I've been playing around with the both the 1.1.90-release of Nullify
and different 1.07-releases, but I can't get other sign hashes then
SHA-1 and RIPEMD160 to work with the standard DSA/ElGamal-key. I've
tried to change preferences of the key but if I sign with SHA512 the
top ----- line is OK, but there is no ending with signature.
I'm using:
GPGshell 2.41
Nullify 1.1.90 nr1-release

@_subject: Transalate? 
Lately I've been polishing up my norwegian transalation og GnuPG 1.06. Now
that 1.07 is released, is there an easy way to add or alter changed phrases?
It seems pointless to manually roll through aobut 70 pages using cut and
paste between the 1.06 and 1.07 documents.
Is the phrases stored in a database somewhere? If so were could I get hold
of them/it.

Hash: SHA1
Have been waiting for an updated a while, well done!
The only gripes I have with it is that users have to manually install it. With a dll needing to be registered and hard coded registry entries, it's not an easy task for a novice user. Will g10 Code GmbH release a version with an installer?

@_subject: Reload keys 
Hash: SHA1
I use both PGP 8.1 and GnuPG 1.2.5 for Windows with GPGshell. Both programs have 414 keys. What I've noticed is that GnuPG is slow reloading the keys to GPGshell. It takes 8-9 seconds. With PGP the (re)loading of keys is done in a couple of seconds.
Is it possible to make GnuPG reload keys much faster?

Hash: SHA1
Solved the problem by using:
gpg -rebuild-keydb-cache from GPGShell
GnuPGs reloading of keys seems now a tad quicker than PGP.
