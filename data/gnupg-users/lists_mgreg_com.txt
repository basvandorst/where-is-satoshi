@_subject: How do I list all recipient of a message (including myself)? 
Hi All,
I am writing application in which I need to know if a GnuPG encrypted message was sent to me.  It seems that whenever you list the recipients of a message it will list every recipient but you -- even if you're one of them.  Surely there's a way to reveal whether or not you're one of those recipients...?
