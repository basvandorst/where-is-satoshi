(Yes, intended only for testing...)
First PGP version supporting WinXp has been PGP-8.x AFAIK.
So I will test (yes, only testing...) new key compatibility with this still
common spreaded version. But where to get old freeware version PGP-8.03/PGP-8.1 (release in
Sym at ntec's freeware page seems to be redirected to shop:
 PGP-version history up to v10:

Ok, i'll give it a try ;) Some of the cleaned header entries are non-standard additions [1], for example issued by M$, useless for non-M$ clients... For example Priority is set by X-PRIORITY (RFC2076) and Importance (RFC1327/1911).

@_subject: Order/changing of subkeys derogates compatibility!? 
After further investigation:
Actual version of 'Symantec Encryption Desktop 10.2.3' (former known as
PGP...) is supporting subkeys for signing or encryption in both directions,
accurate interaction with GPG-2.0.26/GPG-1.4.18. NOT working with subkeys for signing or encryption are:
PGP-6.5.1 / 6.5.1ckt
PGP-8.1 (thanks to Symantec support...)
I did try to get old version of PGP-9.0x, -9.5x, -10.0x, but it seems to be
impossible to get it even from Symantec enterprise support. Didn't find it
in download archives.
Maybe someone can help from private trial archive (email...)?
So finally there is still this open question:
How is the collaboration between actual branches of GPG-2.0/GPG-1.4 and PGP
Before generating new series of long term keysets, what do you think about
this keystructure:
pub  4096R/97CA9679  erzeugt: 2014-11-22  verf?llt: niemals     Aufruf: C
               Vertrauen: uneingeschr?nkt     G?ltigkeit: uneingeschr?nkt

did try it too:
Thomas' attempt gave me with Gpg-1.4.18:

John's hint with ECHO -e PASSWD\nMyOldPassword\nMyNewPassword\nSAVE|GPG --command-fd 0 --no-tty --passphrase-repeat 0 --status-fd 2 --verbose --edit-key E62651B3
gave me just:

It seems that old password isn't accepted by batch cmd. Why?
MyOldPassword is definitely correct and works if editing same test key for example with addkey !?

@_subject: gpg.conf: settings for security and compatibility 
Hello to all,
my newbie post...
I am struggling with gpg.conf for GnuPG-Pack-14.11.x (gpg 1.4.18).
Dealing with encryption should be secure, cross-mailer interoperability and
compatibility should be maximized between PGP/GnuPG/GPG/OpenPG and different
os (Win/Mac/Linux).
There are some known hash size problems with Debian (no SHA 512), so SHA256
will be used.
Newer SmartCards accept keysize <= 3072 bit. Key is divided in:
masterkey C (RSA4096)
subkey A (RSA3072)
subkey E (RSA3072)
subkey S (DSA3072, smaller sig!) Suggestion for gpg.conf (pls optimize, I am a newbie...):
# keyserver hkp://eu.pool.sks-keyservers.net
# default-keyserver-url hkp://eu.pool.sks-keyservers.net
s2k-count 1000000
s2k-digest-algo SHA256
s2k-cipher-algo AES256
cert-digest-algo SHA256
digest-algo SHA256
personal-cipher-preferences AES256 TWOFISH AES192 AES CAST5 3DES
personal-digest-preferences SHA256 SHA384 SHA512 SHA224
personal-compress-preferences ZLIB BZIP2 ZIP Uncompressed
default-preference-list SHA256 SHA384 SHA512 SHA224 AES256 TWOFISH AES192
AES CAST5 3DES ZLIB BZIP2 ZIP Uncompressed
Is there a proofed gpg.conf out there?
Thanks, best regards,

@_subject: Setpref is not working or is it a bug or something? 
beware of compatibility issues...
Older versions of Debian (< sarge) don't support SHA512, AFAIK.
Many Smartcards are limited to key size <= 3072 bit, AFAIK.
RSA signatures are larger than DSA signatures, even if same bit size.
So, what are the most useful cross-over compatibility settings for new,
secure keys?

I am working with GnuPG-Pack, which includes extended gpg-1.4.18.
This versions supports smartcard keys with 4096bit?
What's about the standard SHA1 hash with signatures?
In gpg.conf really no need for:
s2k-count 1000000
s2k-digest-algo SHA256
s2k-cipher-algo AES256
cert-digest-algo SHA256
digest-algo SHA256
personal-cipher-preferences AES256 TWOFISH AES192 AES CAST5
personal-digest-preferences SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 SHA224
personal-compress-preferences ZLIB BZIP2 ZIP
default-preference-list SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 SHA224 AES256 TWOFISH AES192
AES CAST5 ZLIB BZIP2 ZIP
Thanks a lot, regards *still learning...*

Thanks to all contributors for this useful discussion and hints!
I am sorry, all my replies are sent to gnupg-users at gnupg.org only,
without touching the subject.
I am new to mailing lists, so is this the right procedure?
Thanks once more,

Yes, that's true, SMTP-Filter is running for outgoing mails:
 It deletes for security/privacy reasons:
X-Relayed-By: GPGrelay
Hidden header 'In-Reply-To: <1CD78A.547AEDEA.0002 at machine>':
IN-REPLY-TO and REFERENCES for example include ... at machine, which is always
the same... This is not wanted because of the possibility of tracking cross
over the web ("who posts which content...")
So, how to deal with this behavior?
Keeping subject untouched seems to be enough for identifying and associating
to thread, isn't it?

@_subject: Order/changing of subkeys derogates compatibility!? 
Hello to all,
while creating some new v4-RSA keypairs a compatibility issue occurs with
old PGP-6.5.x:
C,E should be RSA, S should be DSA (2048 with SHA256 for smaller
Sec/pub keyset is used with GPG-1.4.18 (Win7-64), pub key is exported to
PGP-6.5.x only for testing purpose on another machine.
First attempt, everything is working in PGP-6.5.x too:
pub  3072R/D956D57E  erzeugt: 2014-11-30  verf?llt: niemals     Aufruf: C
                   Vertrauen: uneingeschr?nkt G?ltigkeit: uneingeschr?nkt
sub  2048D/A916DB9A  erzeugt: 2014-11-30  verf?llt: niemals     Aufruf: S
sub  3072R/599E4462  erzeugt: 2014-11-30  verf?llt: niemals     Aufruf: E
[ uneing.] (1). rsa3072 name (kom) Second attempt, editing:
After test-editing the subkeys with changing DSA-subkey it gets last
position and is not working in PGP-6.5.x
pub  3072R/D956D57E  erzeugt: 2014-11-30  verf?llt: niemals     Aufruf: C
                   Vertrauen: uneingeschr?nkt G?ltigkeit: uneingeschr?nkt
sub  3072R/599E4462  erzeugt: 2014-11-30  verf?llt: niemals     Aufruf: E
sub  2048D/01D27D06  erzeugt: 2014-11-30  verf?llt: niemals     Aufruf: S [ uneing.] (1). rsa3072 name (kom) Third attempt, everything is working in PGP-6.5.x too, RSA only:
pub  3072R/D956D57E  erzeugt: 2014-11-30  verf?llt: niemals    Aufruf: C
                  Vertrauen: uneingeschr?nkt G?ltigkeit: uneingeschr?nkt
sub  3072R/599E4462  erzeugt: 2014-11-30  verf?llt: niemals    Aufruf: E
sub  3072R/B65BF3EE  erzeugt: 2014-11-30  verf?llt: niemals    Aufruf: S
[ uneing.] (1). rsa3072 name (kom) No difference, if using RSA-2048 bit. No Difference, if using DSA-1024 bit.
If new keypair is created 'by hand' in this order:
RSA C 3072
DSA S 2048
RSA E 3072
everything works till editing any of subkey. But this option is needed
because of future changings in subkey set while keeping main key ID...
So, is there a known issue regarding the order of DSA-subkeys for signing?
How to change order of subkeys for testing purpose?
Thanks and best regards,
