Has anyone used the new gnupg-1.2.1-lc2 yet?
I'm wondering if anyone noticed this version
from ALT Team and what do you think about it?
The LANS key generated in that GPG version
actually fails to be imported in any other
known version of GPG or PGP, making this
pitiful incompatibility rather inconvenient
for users. So, I'm interested in getting some
opinions about this version.
