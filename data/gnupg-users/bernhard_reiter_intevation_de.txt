@_subject: Python bindings for GnuPG 
For those of you seeking to use GnuPG from Python, there is an overview at
  I've just overhauled it.
My recommendation currently is to use James Henstridge's PyGPGME.
As it is actively maintained and even supports Python 3 and 2 since March.
An interesting approach is W. Trevor King's pgp-mime which uses pyassuan to speak to gpgme-tool. Haven't tried it. Happy Hacking,
