I use gnupg with a software I write and it needs a gpg key with expiration date. As I do not myself manage this software, I would like to provide a shell script on Linux (e.g. launched every day with cron) which would check for the expiration date and send a warning if key expires within a given time (15 days for example). Does there exist an option which would give the expiration date of a key, if such date exists ? I saw nothing on man gpg. It is possible to retrieve the expiration date on Linux with a command line, as shown below, but the command is ugly, not totally safe (because of the grep) and may not work on all versions of gpg. Having these keys : # LANG=C gpg --list-keys  Ne gardez plus qu'une seule adresse mail ! Copiez vos mails vers Yahoo! Mail

Thanks, it is a command I can rely on ! And it gives an epoch time which can be easily processed. For those interested, I just added a -- grep -E "^pub:" -- to get only one date. Eric LANDES
