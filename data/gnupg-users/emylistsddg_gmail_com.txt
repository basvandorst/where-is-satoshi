@_subject: libkleo.dll can't load within TheBat! or be registered 
i use TheBat! for my email client. and Gpg4win ver 2.0.3.
gpg4win seems to work fine except when trying to load up kleopatra.exe from within TheBat! kleopatra.exe - Unable to Locate Component
this application has failed to start because libkleo.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem
and ...
RegSvr32 libkleo.dll
returns, libkleo.dll was loaded, but the DllRegisterServer entry point was not found
This file can not be registered
what, the libkleo.dll is not a .dll or .ocx file  ??

should we uninstall 1.4.7 prior to upgrading to 2.0.xx or does the win-installer take care of that.

@_subject: getting gnupg keys from old computer to new 
i used the wingnupg to install gnupg on a notebook i'm retiring. i mainly used the app and keys for my email client, "thebat".

@_subject: not recognizing my passphrase after moving from XP to Win7 
now i'm finding out after moving from XP to Win7 that i can't edit my keys or decrypt email test messages. the passphrases to decrypt i have aren't working from command line or my email app.
during migration i copied all the files from \\gnupg dir on XP to my new machine.
is there command line opt for gpg2 to run to sync my key ring or am out of luck after moving to new machine and have to create new key pairs?

Hello Johan,
i checked that. chars are typing correctly. i keep all passwords in a password database. i copied/pasted & typed what i thought should be the correct passphrase. gpg2 returns "invalid". keyboard is a new microsoft sidewinder x4 but chars/keys are mapping fine with it.
appreciate your help and insight

@_subject: not recognizing my passphrase after moving from XP to Win7 
Hello Henry,
i copied the 32-bit XP gnupg dir contents to this dir on Win 7-64bit
from:    C:\Documents and Settings\\Application Data\gnupg
there is a sub-dir C:\Documents and Settings\\Application Data\gnupg\private-keys-v1.d  that is empty. did i miss getting my priv keys copied over? nope, do not use Outlook. i use "TheBat! v5.1.6.2" on my windows machine, have for years. i thought too, as you did, maybe the mailer program was the issue. but i went to commandline, encrypted a small test text file with my email key. that succeeded. but couldn't decrypt it. returns invalid key. no matter i typed in key or pasted from my main password database app. either i changed the password and forgot to update my password database or, as you mentioned, copying from 32-bit XP to 64-bit win is likely the issues.
i'm scanning my backup synology host to see if i have the saved old xp dir's and (maybe?) i can do an import of them.  otherwise i'll just consider this a bust and recreate new key/pairs.
now that you mentioned it, as i have a few linux vm's running i could start using for email. a few of those vm's have gpg & mail client support already.
**edit update:
after copying and importing keys to one of my linux vm's and trying numerous times to decrypt a simple text file. i found my error. it was user error as one char that i thought was a certain char wasn't. an alpha char looked like a char i was typing and it was a numerical char. gee, toss these older eyes of mine away!! if you hadn't helped with your suggestions i doubt i would have found this error. the other reply was about my keyboard. turns out, user error typo. text really small in my password database .. i'll change that!
appreciate your help!
that may help and appreciate the offer. let me see if i can find the old backed up dir and see if gnupg will import that

Hello Henry & Johan,
appreciate your advice. and a lot of information you took the time to write. i think i mentioned i found the error, more or less my own eyes and the size of the text in my pw database. one char off resembling another. i doubt i would have found that error if not for your help.
i exported everything and imported my keys to one of my linuxmint vm's, and will begin soon to using thunderbird for all email. thanks again for all the help!

@_subject: howto revoke a key that has no secret key 
somehow i managed to send a key id to a key server that has no secret-key. so i would like to remove it.
gpg --output keyrevoke.asc  --gen-revoke 0x doesn't work since there is no secret key.
at a loss as to how to remove/revoke this key

@_subject: howto revoke a key that has no secret key 
well i managed to create a pub key without a priv key. that is, it only has a pub part. thats what gpa key manager is telling me.
so i thought i would remove it and recreate a new key pair for that email addr.
if you or someone can tell me how i can create a priv key for that email address that i created with only a pub key? i don't know how i did that with the gpa key manager.
hope that clarifies it a bit

@_subject: howto revoke a key that has no secret key 
i found my error and the priv key. i had created this pair on a linux vm some time ago and had forgotten that. back then when i exported it and imported into a win machine something didn't quite take. i'm in the process of updating the db, and getting things in sync.
appreciate your reply and help

@_subject: one key/pair for multiple email accounts 
in practice, do users of gnupg find that having multiple email account id's added to one key/pair using that key/pair to sign and/or encrypt emails & files more efficient to manage?
i have mulitple email accounts and in the past had generated a key/pair for each, each with its own unique passphrase. i'm rethinking that approach.
curious how other uses in this situation manage their gnupg?

@_subject: "this key has only a public part" 
Hello Gnupg-users,
i used gpg4win 2.0.20 gpa 0.9.4 to create a key pair for one of my email accnts.
only it says under tech details, "this key has only a public part". i tested an email, it was encrypted but i can't decrypt it.  i thought it would auto create the key pairs pub/priv ?
can i fix this?
