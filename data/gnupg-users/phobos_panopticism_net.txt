@_subject: Holiday giving (crowd-funding campaign?) 
I've Cc:'d Sam Tuke (listed as the Press Contact and Campaign Manager).
Wow, that's very generous of you, Robert. Thank you very much.
Related: A month or so ago, a post on the GnuPG blog mentioned a
crowd-funding campaign that was to be launched "in early December".
Details were scarce, however. This sounds like perfect timing; perhaps
either Sam or Werner can provide us with an update on the campaign?
