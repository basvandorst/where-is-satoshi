Any plans for a GPG for Palm OS?
PGP has discontinued their PGP Mobile for Palm OS. The latest version
is 2.0.2; it is not available commercially and it does not work well
with Palm OS 5 and above. I have tried the previous versions of PGP
for palm and they crashed my Palm. Only version 2.0.2 worked
marginally without crashing my Tungsten T.
A Palm OS version of GPG would enable better and easier key exchange
and key signing during conferences; furthermore, it enables encryption
of emails using mobile devices.

I appreciate the time you guys dedicate for the development and
maintenance of GnuPG.
Many people use a PDA in their work and/or daily routines. Do you use
a PDA? How many of the Physicians you know use a PDA. PGP was one of
the few reliable HIPAA compliant applications for Palm. Now the
available applications vary in reliability and show a near complete
lack of standardization. The PGP people refuse to make PGP for Palm
available even commercially.
How about a "SuperWaba" ( port? This would
make it useful on more than one platform (Palm OS, Symbian 7.0s (Nokia
6600, 6670) etc...), No? Would this introduce more security headaches?
The Palm/PDA port is probably not a priority for most developers, but
people are becoming more mobile.
As I said, I appreciate your work. GnuPG is a great product even
without a Palm port.
