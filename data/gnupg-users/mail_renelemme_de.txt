@_subject: OT: how to unsubscribe? 
Hello Group,
I know this is not related to GnuPG but I would like to ask how to unsubscribe for a while from this mailing list.
I could find subscribe on gnupg.org but not unsubscribe.
Again sorry for the off topic,

Hello group,
what would happen if I would change the passphrase of my sec-key but keep a copy of the sec-key with the old passphrase? Could both sec-key files on different pc's be used?
