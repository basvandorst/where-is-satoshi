@_subject: install problem 
Sorry to disturb you
I am Zhaolh of Panasonic in china, now I have a problem about installing of
When I finished installing this software according to the README, and run
gpgconf -list-dirs
the log as below is appeared
"gpgconf: error while loading shared libraries: libgcrypt.so.20: cannot open
shared object file: No such file or directory."
How can I do to solve this problem?
Thank you very much!
