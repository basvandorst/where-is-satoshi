I've like to let you know that I have set up, as a part of GnuPG News
Japan operation, the chat group on the service called Lingr.
It is more or less on the topic, but might be nice and casual place
for people to get quick answers to questions they may have.
I've also setup English room as well,
It works pretty well for webchat.
Give it a try!

It seems like somehow, it is not handling interactive sessions.

Type in "exit" can pass that entry to the shell can cause shell to end
instead of exiting out of key edit mode.
If I do gpg --version, this is what I get.
Notice some how it is returning to shell once the command is issued. C:\

press enter.

This is fresh reinstallation of the operating system so I doubt if there

Anyone has idea what might be causing this, and is there any workaround

I found the problem.
The path as installed by gpg4win specifies c:\program
files\gnu\gnupg\pub, and that binary somehow shows that behavior.
Changing the path to c:\program files\gnu\gnupg\ solved that problem.
(Copying the message to the gpg4win list, as well...)

@_subject: Naming of GnuPG 
How will version number convention will continue, as there are 1.4.x and
2.0.x lines concurrently running?
1.4.x line will be evolving on its own separately from 2.0.x line, right?
Just curious, because now it is at 1.4.9 and 2.0.9...
GnuPG Standalone, instead of having two different version numbers...
Well, I guess some programs go like 1.4.10, 2.0.10, etc., so this may
not be relevant at all!

@_subject: Naming of GnuPG 
Hello David,
As for 1.4.x / 2.0.x naming thing, what I meant is that I don't think it necessary confusing. (although, I know a case that one got confused whether he should download 1.4.8 or 2.0.8; but this person was on Windows, so it wasn't too much of problem, as there weren't any choices.)
A lot of general public might think, however, higher the version, more features (which in GnuPG case, it is true), and perhaps less buggy, etc. And also there are many programs out there, which has version number inferior put into "maintenance mode" with only vulnerability fixes being conducted, which certainly not the case with GnuPG, as new features and enhancements are being introduced to it.
It was just my opinion, that if having 1.4.x and 2.0.x is about making choices available for standalone OpenPGP, and integrated solution with S/MIME, I just felt it makes sense more to have similar versioning scheme as I assume, that capability of OpenPGP part would be identical or similar to their 2.0.x counterpart.

I think this is well appropriate in backend situation, however, GnuPG intended for general users. I often advocate use of GnuPG, and OpenPGP to people, and, from that experience, I think making this clear makes it much easier for people to adopt it. (it won't be necessary showstopper for them, but then I think it wouldn't hurt...)

Hello Ramon,
GnuPG really won't help you there, unless person other-side has way to verify your signature.
As GnuPG is just a standard command line program, technologically speaking, as long as the mail server allows, it should be able to sign the E-mail automatically.
So it is probably technically possible, however, if it is useful or not would be another question...

@_subject: Paperkey 1.0 released 
Paperkey is great, and I've put up some Japanese introduction of the tool.
One thing I saw on Windows version is that piping doesn't work. It
seems like it corrupt the output when redirection is used, so this
could be something to do with the operating system, but just reporting
the issue. (Earlier GnuPG on Windows also had same problem, for
example, gpg --export > foobar would cause corrupted data on foobar,
not sure it's related.)
So on Windows,
instead of doing,
gpg --export-secret-key 51A00A8E | paperkey --output output.txt
I have to do
gpg --output output.sec --export-secret-key 51A00A8E
paperkey --secret-key output.sec --output output.txt
Thank you.

It's otherway around, wave should support OpenPGP, but then I'm not sure
if it'll be much useful.
Say, if you (let's call A) start conversation with someone, B. In this
case, it wouldn't be too much of problem communicating using OpenPGP.
Then what happens if person C is added in the middle of conversation?
C wouldn't be able to decipher anything prior to his/her joining as
messages are not encrypted for C.

As far as I know, FIPS requirements are quite specific. Library may have
been implemented and complaints to FIPS requirement -- but all components
would need to be complaints to FIPS to be able to call it FIPS complaint.
(and I don't have answer for that...)
If your question is if GnuPG is FIPS *certified* then answer is probably no,
unless someone has submitted some particular version of GnuPG for
certification and passed it.
