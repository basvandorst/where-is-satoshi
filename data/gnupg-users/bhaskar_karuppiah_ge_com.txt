When I try to decrypt the file I am getting the error message "gpg: mpi too
large (25161 bits)". Any help on this would be much appreciated.

Hi Folks,
Your help much appreciated !
Thanks Wren for your repsonse /....here is the details explanation of my
error ...
Server A and Server B used to send and recieve the files from each
other.Server A runs on Sun Soloris and Server B runs on  SunOS 5.9. Because
of business decision we had to move Sun soloaris to Windows NT platform in
server A.So we replaced Server A with new server which runs on Windows
NT.All the keys have been exported to new server.When Server B tries to
decrypt the file which was encrypted by new server , Server B is getting the
following error message.The error message is "gpg:
mpi too large (25161 bits)". We did not face problem until Server A is not
replaced with Windows NT.It worked fine with old server.
Please advice what could be the reason , any solution for that?
Hash: SHA1
mpi too
