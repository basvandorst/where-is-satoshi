 I generally do this ( cp .gnupg on floppy to have it at home and at work=

 I never had problems with this.
 I suppose It's a good mean to backup an important thing.
 The biggest problem is it's a little bit unsecured to have your=20
.gnupg on floppy.

@_subject: Sorry my email adress disappeared 
My Email adress  had 'disappeared' for 4 days last  I got to say I'm sorry If mailing List have been 'flooded' by
'unknown email adress' messages.
 This is due a Registrar/Web hosting/DNS change, which should have
lasted only 24 to 48 hours. . .
 All my apologies.

Hash: SHA1
 I recently tried Kmail in KDE3.
 It now has a really good support of gnupg=20
( 1click to sign, 1 click to encrypt ).
 I just wanted to tell it to you, since I was really happy to see it.
