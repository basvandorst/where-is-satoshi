Doesn't make sense signing the files with your public key since the only
person able to verify them would be you.. you sign with your private
gpg --sign  will sign the file with your private key
gpg --clearsign  will sign the file and leave it in an ascii
format (you didn't say wether the files are binary or ascii) so use
whichever you need.
to encrypt and sign its gpg --encrypt --sign --recipient 'blah'

Is there any particular reason why one must be done before the other?
I.E. Sign & Encrypt over Encrypt & Sign.
Does signing encrypted data help people determin the key for example
(just guessing)

Also... if you are just looking for a way to use FTP in a secure manner
then perhaps what you are doing is overkill and you can look at sFTP ,
FTP over SSL, or using ssh to create a tunnel to secure the two FTP
Just an idea.

Why is it you cant use clearsign and encrypt at the same time if the
file is text and you want it signed THEN encrypted?
