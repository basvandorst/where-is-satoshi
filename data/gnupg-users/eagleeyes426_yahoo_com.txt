@_subject: deleting secret key not implemented 
Hi there,
I saw this response from Werner regarding this in 2.1 beta, but I don't
In 2.1 the secret keys are manage by gpg-agent and in theory gpg should
not care about them.  However, we also have import and export commands
which tell the agent what to do with the secret keys (i.e. import or
export).  A delete command is a bit more difficult regarding the UI
because it is possible that gpgme uses the same secret key for an X.509
certificate - it would then also be silently deleted.

I know it's not implemented because when trying to delete a test key I
./g10/gpg2 --delete-secret-keys testing

Delete this key from the keyring? (y/N) y
This is a secret key! - really delete? (y/N) y
gpg: deleting secret key not implemented
gpg: testing: delete key failed: Not implemented
But how do I go about deleting it if I can't do it through gpg2? Can I
do it manually somehow?

@_subject: GPG2 encryption options 
Hi there,
I'm wondering if gpg2 can be used to encrypt a file using a keyfile. The
term keyfile is used to refer to a static file where the contents are read
into gpg2 to be used as the passphrase for the encryption process.
for example:
ccrypt -e --keyfile ~/.somefile ~/the_file_to_be_encrypted.doc
So the above ccrypt command encrypts the file_to_be_encrypted.doc with the
first line take from .somefile
ccrypt -d --keyfile ~/.somefile ~/the_file_to_be_encrypted.doc.ctd
and the above command decrypts it....
Is this possible with gpg2? I like this because I can use random files taken
from the 100,000's+ static non-changing files on my system as passwords for
encrypting and decrypting files etc. I'd just prefer to be using gpg2 as I
can then specify algo's hash's etc instead of being stuck with AES.
There are some files I don't like having to enter a passphrase for each time
due to them be accessed very frequently, but I don't want the contents of
them being stored plaintext either.

Hi Guys,
Thanks for the response. I had been doing a lot more reading since posting this query and came across gpg-agent. I think that's a nice option. I've been having fun since then building the latest libgcrypt and gnupg 2.0.21 stable build, because while Ubuntu includes the 2.0.21 package, it's broken against the new version of libgcrypt (Ubuntu's libgcrypt is from 2011).
So I now have gpg-agent running and I'll try that out as it can cache my passphrase which will help considerably.
I also like the other option Mr Pentchev provided, and will try that out if I can successfully finish the script I'm writing to randomise it enough for my satisfaction :P
With shuf I can get random bits from those 100,000+ files, taken from random directories and random files each time, the issue is of course for decryption I would have to store that passphrase the script creates somewhere to enable it to be pulled for decryption before re-encrypting it with another random passphrase.
But I could definitely store that in a gpg file that's signed and encrypted against my key, that I decrypt once per session or however long gpg-agent caches my passphrase for.
Is that something that I can configure on the command line for gpg-agent or the options file?

Small detail: this feature is not working in the current stable versions. GnuPG
2.1 will support this.
I use the following script to make the card forget its PIN:
gpg-connect-agent 'SCD RESET' /bye
I created this based on a message of Werner Koch to this list. Earlier, I killed
the scdaemon.

Hi guys,
Firstly I'm not 100% sure your getting my replies if I reply directly from my mail client (new to mailing lists).
But here goes anyways.
My attempt at creating random passphrases is finished. I now have a script which generates these randomly and passing these through thanks to your previous advice is working nicely to encrypt and decrypt files.
What I would now like to know is how to securely store and access the passphrase file for decrypting files.
My idea is to sign and encrypt the passphrase.txt file (all good), but is there a way that I can access the file without having to decrypt it fully back to it's .txt state and search it to get the passphrases out of it for example?
or I just have to encrypt\decrypt each time i want to pipe passphrases out of it? Also how do I go about setting up the gpg-agent to cache my main passphrase for X number of minutes for example?
Kind Regards,
Peter Humphreys

@_subject: Can't decrypt message encrypted with ECC 
I have created a test ECC 25519 subkey.
If I encrypt a file & sign a file to myself with gpg2 -esa
some_text.file it encrypts fine. But when trying gpg2 -v
some_text.file.asc I get the following error:

When listing my secret keys I get a # symbol next to the above key in
question is that normal?
