@_subject: In wich commands can a certain option be used? 
Hello everyone,
GnuPG version: 2.029
I'm new to GnuPG and so I have some questions that I cannot answer by reading the documentation.
GnuPG supports a lot of options and many commands. Is there anywhere in one of the the documentations a list of commands, for wchich a certain option can be used?
Maybe I have read the documentation too less carefully. In the description of the options tghere are mentioned some commands sometimes. But this seems to be an exeption.
Best regards
