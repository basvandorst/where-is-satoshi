@_subject: upgrade problem 
I'm trying to upgrade my GnuPGP to 1.0.6 from 1.0.4; the install goes well, the usual configure, make, make install ... everythink ok. I then went to check that the version was ok: % gpg --version, but it still shows that I'm using 1.0.4. I've checked /usr/local/bin and the modified date *is* the day i installed it ... what's up?
If anyone has any suggestions please cc me as i'm not subscribed to the
