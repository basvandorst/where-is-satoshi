I'd favour a pragmatic approach, drawing the line depending on the state of technology: we all know that encryption does not provide absolute security; it provides relative security for a limited time. Relative because it depends on the means the adversary has, and limited time because of technological progress.
Old files encrypted with a method that is trivially crackable today are actually not encrypted, they're just encoded in a fancy way. Users with such files should reevaluate their encryption strategy, and not depend on gnupg to be a permanent decoding tool. But on the other hand, email encryption can never clean up as radically as TLS1.3, because it has to provide protection for data-at-rest, too, which TLS doesn't have to address. So unless an algorithm is completely broken, it should stay supported, at least for decryption.
