@_subject: GPG vs. PGP 
Hi there,
I have a few questions about gpg which I've been wondering about for a while
now.  I have a backup copy of my keyrings generated while I was still a
windoze user.  These belong to PGP v5.5.3i, and contain various keys
generated with that version, in DH/DSS and RSA, as well as another generated
with CK-T (a pgp non-official hack).
Currently I have installed PGP v2.6.3i in Debian/Linux, and was trying to
configure v5.0i as well.  My questions are:
- Will I be able to make use of the keys (RSA and DH/DSS) which I have in
the secring.skr and pubring.pkr with GPG?
(Just to make this question a bit more clearer, I just want to be able to
have them in my GPG keyrings, not being able to generate new RSAs or
DH/DSSs, just encrypting, decrypting, signing, verifying,... under GPG).
- If yes, would that be as straight forward as to copying those keyrings to
GPG's conf, or will I need to still have a copy of PGP v2.6.3i and/or v5.0i,
and separate keyrings?
- Last, could anyone explain the algorithms (DA/ElGamal?) GPG uses for
de/encryption and signing and how will they affect to cross messages between
GPG and PGP users?
Thank you in advanced, and my apologies if this was much to ask for a first
question to the list.

I'm having some trouble with some pub keys;  I'm using gnupg 0.9.3 as
default, together with pgp 2.6.3i and pgp 5.0i.
¿Could anyone help me with this?
This is the output I *always* obtain for almost any operation with GnuPG:
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
gpg: key DDDC215A: secret key without public key - skipped
it complains about the public key not being there - which it is - sometimes
complains about the lack of a self signature for that key.  It is though
recognized by PGP5.0, and the self-signature seems to be there too:
$ pgpk -ll 0xDDDC215A
sec  2048 0xDDDC215A 1998-07-20 ---------- DSS             Sign & Encrypt
f20    Fingerprint20 = 5F11 2DFF E972 CE5D B041  F729 F432 4FE4 DDDC 215A
sub  8192 0x06E9D714 1998-07-20 ---------- Diffie-Hellman
f20    Fingerprint20 = 4AA8 A165 EB10 702A 59D6  A23A 1B20 9898 06E9 D714
uid  Horacio Menezo SIG       0xDDDC215A 1998-07-20 Horacio Menezo $ gpg --list-secret-keys
sec  2048D/DDDC215A 1998-07-20 Horacio Menezo ssb  8192g/06E9D714 1998-07-20
$ gpg --list-keys
but it doesn't find the public key for 0xDDDC215A, so I extract an ascii
copy of it with:
$ pgpk -xa 0xDDDC215A -o file.asc
and try to import it with gnupg:
$ gpg --import file.asc
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
gpg: key DDDC215A: secret key without public key - skipped
gpg:horus: key DDDC215A: invalid self-signature
gpg:horus: key DDDC215A: invalid subkey binding
gpg:horus: key DDDC215A: no valid user ids
gpg: this may be caused by a missing self-signature
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:           w/o user IDs: 1
The same occurs if I try to handled this from within mutt (^K keybinding),
though I obtain a little more info:
gpgm: can't handle public key algorithm 192
gpgm: key DDDC215A: secret key without public key - skipped

gpgm: this may be caused by a missing self-signature

And the same goes on for someone else's public key I'm trying to add to
pubring.gpg (or pubring.pkr, or pubring.pgp, since gnupg seems to handle all
at once).
