@_subject: compiling trouble 
I tried many ways to compile gnupg 1.0, and had
resolved problem of gettext. However, I still
got error message:
g10/gpg: can't resolve symbol '__register_frame_info'
Could you kindly give me some tips.

I look int gpg, found __register_frame_info is a member of
library of libgdbm, then I update my gdbm to 1.8(2.0) and
check all symbol linkage in system, after reboot, compiling
is ok.
