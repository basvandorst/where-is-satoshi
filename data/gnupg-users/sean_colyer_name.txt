@_subject: [gpgtools-devel] Joint OpenPGP (JS) implementation 
I just came upon gpg4browser as well. Looking at the code it looks like
this is the most complete implementation out there currently. I imagine
that they have been working on this for some time and it's quite
impressive. Ironic that there was minimal development on this for so long
and now so much coincidental parallel development..
I've been working on key generation which is one area that I think
gpg4browser hasn't, and I'm sure there are a few others as they have noted
on their site.
As for key management -- I like the concept of offering a range of
solutions, I think it's important we create a common interface for the
different methods that we can use to connect to a range of options.
