Because that worm can't sniff your password?  Or create an inbound
message that requires you to enter you password to decrypt it?  Or
send your private key off via guntella to other instances of itself?
Crypto will make central AV harder.  However, central AV is already
hard, and the benefits of crypto may be large.  (It may be that
STARTTLS is more usable..)

I'm trying to decrypt an idea encrypted message someone sent me.  I
get an out of memroy error on a fairly fresh install of Mandrake

anything up...

I don't mean to disparage GPG here; it has improved greatly.
However, there remain enourmous usability issues with PGP; much of what was
written in "Why Johnny Can't Encrypt" remains true.
Getting agreement between the different mail formats (mutt's use of
Mime encoding and 'traditional' encoding) remains a problem.
IDEA and CAST remain as problems.
Does your mother use PGP?  Mine sure doesn't, despite being willing to
try, it remains too hard.
Now, are these GPG's fault?  In most cases, no, they're not.  But
they're problems that we need to address to get say, 10% of the email
on the net to be encrypted.  And if thats a goal, then we need to
examine the things that are preventing us from hitting it.
