@_subject: GnuPG Made Easy - docs? 
Hello everyone around,
I've tried to find a api documentation for the GnuPG Made Easy implementation.
I couldn't lookup the zip files, since the ftp servers seem down, at least i can't reach them.
Is there any api doc out there? I'd prefer readable format, a whole html / pdf or something, otherwhise i'd need to copy / paste again to get it printed. I dislike window switching, and my 2nd screen is broken.
