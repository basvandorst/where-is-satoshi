@_subject: Integrating GPG 
Hiya. Could I bother the group with a simple question?
I'm trying to integrate GPG into a program, and it would be nice to call GPG using shell commands rather than have to statically-link any libraries.  Enigmail is an example of this: you have to specify the GPG executable in the options, and it uses this to encrypt a temporary file.
The nearest I can find in documentation is --passphrase-fd [filenum], but the documentation doesn't help much with how to use it.  ------- trying -------
filenum = open(decoy_file, for_writing)
shell "gpg --passphrase-fd [filenum] ..."
print filenum, passphrase
filenum = open(file_containing_passphrase, for_reading)
shell "gpg --passphrase-fd [filenum] ..."
------- /trying -------
I don't really want to put any passphrases into a file, but I'd like to find some way of using GPG with a supplied passphrase, rather than having the user type it each time (which may not even be possible in a GUI)
Is there some feature I missed, or is there a good reason why I shouldn't even be trying?

@_subject: FAQ addition 
Hiya. Does the FAQ maintainer read this list? If so, I just wondered if it might be useful to add a bit about trusting imported keys:
Q: I've imported my Windows' PGP keys, but Kmail refuses to use any of the keys, because they don't seem to be trusted.
A: gpg --list-secret-keys   (to get the number of your private key)
gpg --edit-key [keynumber]
  > help
  > trust     (5 is "ultimately trusted" for your own secret key)
  > quit
