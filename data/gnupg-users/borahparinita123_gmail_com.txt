@_subject: Hi ,request help  on a problem with gnupg that gpg decryption does 
Hello ,
Requesting inputs from anyone , if you have faced any issues on GPG decryption which is done uninteractively
The version used is : gpg (GnuPG)  Version: 2.2.4 / libgcrypt 1.8.2  windows And automated job is scheduled from controlM to run  on a Windows Edition - Windows Server 2016 Datacenter.
The return code is empty for decryption, even if it is handled at shell level  ,  it looks GPG agent hangs and the job does not exit
The automated job uses commands like below along with other housekeeping functionality gpg --debug-all -vvv --batch --pinentry-mode loopback --passphrase-file -o ?ouputfile? --yes ?decrypt ?file to decrypt?
if it is made to kill the gpg ajent uninteractively after  the outputs are generated then only the job exits with ok status Thanks ,
