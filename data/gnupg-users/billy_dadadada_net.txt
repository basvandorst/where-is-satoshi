Pine would have to let you get at the MIME parts of incoming messages.
Which it unfortunately doesn't.  How can you get around this Pine
I know pgpenvelope's procmail filter wouldn't be limited this way,
but you can't decrypt with procmail.

I know this is a joke, but what?
I don't see anything particularly i18n-friendly about
PGP/MIME vs. the regular-old PGP BEGIN/END format.
Generally, it has always seemed like less of a hassle
to deal with inline data than with MIME parts.

Hash: SHA1
What's up with that?
Thawte has a system of travelling notaries
and an institutionalized Web-Of-Trust system going.
It seems rather innocuous, actually...
They are issuing free personal X.509 certs
and PGP keys. (bad idea, btw).. But they'll
also sign your PGP key for you if you can
show some ID to their web form and to a
few of their (usually free) notaries... (good idea)
Unfortunately, their form can't handle
my GnuPG key...  They also have a problem with newer
PGP keys, they say.. I guess they need to do some work...
Anybody have any experience or opinions with this system?
More info at: I noticed L.Sassaman has a
"Thawte Freemail Member" id on his key...
Mr. Sassaman, any hints?

First of all, "chmod +s /usr/local/bin/gnupg"..
Then it will use secure memory.
Can't find or create ~/.gnupg because what's '~' ($HOME)?
What user is this CGI running as?  Give that user a home with a ~/.gnupg
directory or something... Where were you planning on storing the keys
if not there? What about a passphrase?
Well, you were running as yourself on the command line... and you HAVE
a ~/.gnupg directory.
Geez.. that's about as bad a hole as they come...
Look at the permissions on the /tmp directory...
At least make a dedicated, restricted directory for this TEST file.
Better yet, don't write it to disk at all... GnuPG is perfectly
happy taking a pipe from stdin.  Keep the file contents in RAM
and print it to GnuPG's standard input.

You accumulate signatures on your UID+key, not the key itself.
A signature asserts a relation of a UID to the key.
See, this prevents someone from removing the uid,
reinserting their own, and having the key maintain the same trust level
with your friends..  If a UID changes, then the signatures attaching
that UID to the key have to be discarded.

True.  You don't have control of the Lokmail server.  That's a current
limitation of it.  There's nothing we can do about that basic fact.
We can't replace GPG or PGP on the user's computer, but we CAN provide
some basic PKI for casual users email, giving ordinary or mobile folks a
chance to sign their mail and keep their enemies out of their business.
There are other players in the field, but none of them seem to be
interested in interoperability with the huge PGP userbase, so screw 'em.
It will never be PGP, but it fills a niche, and it's a good alternative
for many people, and I'm excited about making it available.
How many people are you forced to communicate insecurely with because
they're unable/unwilling to use PGP for whatever reason?  The answer
in my case is 'a lot'. A lot of my friends and even business associates
(*gasp*) are 'hotmail' types, and I can't change that.  What I can do
is offer them and everyone else a service that introduces them to the
wonderful world of private communication, probably for the first time
in their lives.  `Anything you write can be printed out and put on your
bosses desk tomorrow morning, so watch yourself', I have to remind them.
I'd rather not have to do that, so this is a solution for them.
Sorry if this is offtopic, but thousands of Lokmail users are also
going to be GnuPG users (indirectly) very soon.  :)
