What about simply using Mozilla for reading news -- as you're already
using it for mail? :-) Signature verification with enigmail works for
news reading exactly as for mail (i.e. supporting both, inline PGP and

@_subject: Mime Type for Encrypted Attachments 
What would be the correct content type for encrypted attachments if the
mail is sent as inline PGP (i.e. multipart/mixed)?
I have found a number of content types that seem to be in use, so I'm
not sure what would be the "best". I know that e.g. Outlook uses
"application/octet-stream", but I think this is a rather bad default.
What about "application/pgp" or "application/pgp-encrypted", any idea?

Thanks for all the answers! In fact I'm quite aware of PGP/MIME and what
is correct there. I think I will use application/octet-stream as
suggested, and which many other mail clients use anyway if you attach
pre-encrypted files. The point is that I would like mail clients to be
able to detect the PGP encrypted attachments (and possibly act
accordingly), but this will usually fail if I'd use text/plain.

I have released Enigmail v0.89.6 for Thunderbird 1.0 and Mozilla 1.7.x.
I fixed creation of PGP/MIME messages and other compatibility issues
with GnuPG 1.4.0. Thanks to John and David for analyzing the problem so
At the same time I'm taking the opportunity to announce the availability
of the new OpenPGP key management in Enigmail. Most of the important
functionality is currently available; more will follow soon.

@_subject: Issues with adding UID's 
Hash: SHA1
I have found two issues related to adding UID's:
1. If I have a key with no UID explicitly set as primary UID, then
adding a UID will set the new one as 1st UID. I would have expected the
original 1st UID to stay at position 1.
2. Following scenario: I have 2 computers, both using the same secret
key. Now, I add a UID on the 1st computer. I export the new key (both
secret and public key) and import both at the second computer. The new
UID appears correctly on the 2nd PC, but when I use "gpg --edit-key ...
toggle", the new UID is not visible. Furthermore, I cannot use
"gpg -u ". I have done some testing, and found that the new UID
is only "fully" available if I first delete the secret and public key
from my keyring and then import the updated key.
I think both issues are bugs, or do I miss something?
