@_subject: Web of trust 
Usualy people communicate in the small comunity f.g. for bussines or what, and they must meet personaly first to know who is who. Then they can go back away. If somebody new come to company on one side f.g. somebody already known for other side can sign his key and people on the other side can trust him because somebody already known signed his key. Uffff...
I think that "model" of web of trust depends on situation where it is used. It will not grow to "universe scale" where everybody knows everybody.
I think that "human" must consider if "sign or not sign" this model is not Does not look off-topic.
