This wont work for me using PGP 6.5.1int. I am able to import PGP private
keys into GPG though.
Which version of PGP are you using?

I was successfully able to do the following last night: First create keys in
gpg leave the password option empty. Then export the secret key using the
 gpg --export-secret-keys --no-comment -a foo >foo.asc
Then open foo.asc in Windows PGP6.5.1 and change the password - this works.
change the password in GPG or import the PGP key pair back into GPG.
I was wondering if anyone knows if the RSA module in GPG will make any
difference to the exporting of secret keys?
Thanks, Oliver

Ok, I follow steps 1-4 and everything looks like its working.
However, in PGP my signature is corrupt - so I delete it and sign it again
Then I go to encrypt a file using PGP and I find that there are no
recipients in my list. Signing works Ok
What may be going on here?
Thanks, Oliver.

Hey, I'm sorry,
what you said works correctly. I just had to change it to asci output ie:
gpg --export-secret-key --no-comment -a KEY-ID > key.asc
gpg --export --no-comment -a  KEY-ID >> key.asc
This is excellent and yes I agree it should be in FAQ or somewhere.
Well done.
