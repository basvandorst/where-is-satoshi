@_subject: GPG automated decryption failing 
I am using the below command for automated decryption of PGP files (GNUPG4WIN / Kleoptatra).
echo mypassphrase|gpg --logger-file "D:\FileShare\PGPScripts\SFTP\gpglog.log"  --pinentry-mode loopback --batch --yes --passphrase-fd 0  --decrypt-files "D:\FileShare\Concur\WIP\*.pgp"
However after a certain time period 4 hours or so, it throws the below error. How can I resolve this? Is there a setting to set the passphrase to never expire
public key decryption failed: Bad passphrase
decryption failed: No secret key
Kind regards,
