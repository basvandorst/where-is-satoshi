@_subject: Help for testing GPG installation 
I have switched over to GPG from PGP recently. I need a volunteer who can try
out a few exercises reg. encryption, decryption, siging etc. This will take
only a few exchanges by email for about a week. Can someone help me please ?
My GPG Public key is accessible from ::
  Please send me an encrypted message
(using my GPG public key), to start with.
Thank you,

@_subject: Seahorse 
I am a regular user of KDE and KGPG. I tried to ride "seahorse", but I find
the interface very confusing. I found out how to encrypt/decrypt, after some
struggle and experimentation. I am still not able to sign/verify a file. How
do I do that ? Why cant interface designers make things a little less
enigmatic  :{ ?
