@_subject: export secring 
i use PGP Freeware Version 6.5.3.
after i download gnupg version 1.0.4. i want to import the keys which i
create with gpp.
i´m able to import public-keys, which i create with gungp version 1.0.4
But, i´m not able to import private-keys, which i create with gnupg.
To make an export i use the command gpg --export-secret-keys.
is there a way to import private-keys in PGP Freeware Version?
my OS is WIN 98
thank you in advance, theo krueck
