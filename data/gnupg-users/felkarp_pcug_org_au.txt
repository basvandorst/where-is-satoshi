@_subject: My public key -> http://www.keyserver.net 
Following the directions in the GPG Manual slavishly, I have
successfully exported my public key (in ACII format) to a file.
The next step is to get it onto a Keyserver from which it can readily
be copied by anyone interested.   appears to be
admirably simple.  It displays an empty field and the instructions:
Select the key and chose `Copy'
Paste into the field
Press the `submit' button
Or words to that effect.
Could hardly be simpler.
However, when checking what has been created created by the `gpg
--export' command, the file, apart from the block of ASCII characters,
also contains the following lines:
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: GnuPG v1.0.2 (GNU/Linux)
Comment: For info see < block of ASCII characters>
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
My question is: Does everything get copied to  or only the
ASCII characters block?
I strongly suspect that the former alternative is correct and  `adding a
key to the key-ring'  involves using what is needed from the
submitted data and discarding the rest.  However, given the importance
of getting it right first time round, I thought it worth a query.

Even simpler - if the command activates my sendmail daemon (which is
not loaded by default at login).
Many thanks for the help.
`gpg --send-keys'  does not make it to the first chapter of the GPG
Manual, and I am going at it a step at a time.  The Manual provided
much of the needed info - once I knew where to look.
I subsequently discovered that I had even more detailed info in my
downloaded  `Keyserver FAQ'  that I had not checked when I posted my
request for help.  And I still do not understand it, now that I have
checked it.  The info is listed below.  I am posting this to gnupg-users
as well, since there may be other GnuPG Newbies that would also benefit
from a fuller explanation and the supplied FAQ answer has much wider
applications than just placing one's own key on a keyserver.

At the present moment (on my box), the `--clearsign' command works

My thanks to both Anthony Davies and Sam Roberts for their replies.
The obtained downloaded key is correct.  I had tried the routine on a
Public key that was of interest but not my own.
It looks as though there are significant gaps in my current
understanding that I would welcome  to have explained to me.
My attempt to download the key - which failed - read:
$gpg --recv-keys 0xD3498839
I also attempted to copy the key from the web-page to a file and then
import the file.  It also failed.
It probably all relates to the fact that the key is an RSA key -
something I still need to learn about.

I believe that I have finally unscrambled my problems and have GPG
fully operational.
I would have got there sooner and not tried the patience of several
contributors to this mailing list, if Chapter 1 of the Manual had been
more explicit about the significance of the file identifiers .gpg, .asc
and .sig.
By a combination of helpful replies to my queries and trial and error I
believe I have managed to sort it all out.  The supplied examples in
Chapter 1 all use the required syntax;  however, it is not immediately
obvious that this also appears to be the  syntax.  I refer specifically to the identifiers for signed files, for the
`revoke' file and for importing keys.  This comment might be premature
and these routines may all work equally well with other file
identifiers (specified by the --output option?).  However, if my
Newbie experiences are typical, I can see merit in an additional
paragraph in Chapter 1, that explicitly suggests the file identifiers
that have been found to be the most appropriate.
