So... 'Robert', who do you work for? NSA? Financial crime?
I mean, with the net moving to encrypt everything
we'd expect to see many new and unknown yet seemingly
polished tools being dropped on unsuspecting first time
users just to collect their key material.
Surely someone will have fun with your windows binaries.

This is rather sad. I think FreeBSD has
a project somewhere trying to move that way.
Hopefully all of the unix-likes are at least aware of
the concept, if not having an actual project for it.
Also, none of the BSD's have any built-in integrity
in their repositories, they just insist their infrastructure
and committers are infallible among other escuses.
(Excepting DragonFly which uses git, don't know if they
sign it though. Monotone seems better at that sort of
embedded pki thing.).
