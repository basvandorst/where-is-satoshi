@_subject: SSH CA and OpenPGP card 
FYI: I managed to solve my issue by using pure opensc-pkcs11. OpenPGP cards
seem to be supported by opensc. At least, I managed to sign an SSH public
key of a server with the key on the card.

@_subject: SSH CA and OpenPGP card 
I am trying to use the OpenPGP card as a SSH CA (see ssh-keygen and i.e.
ssh-keygen by default uses an ssh (private) key to sign a public key of a
server or of an individual.
I managed to successfully use the OpenPGP card for SSH authentication, and
so it can perfectly be used as an SSH key encryption engine.
ssh-keygen *can* sign a public key with a smartcard. Using a PKCS token.
However, I see that the OpenPGP card does not natively talk PKCS but
there's some wrapper library. Am I really forced to use that? Would it work
correctly or would it break the keys currently on the card?
Is the PKCS library for OpenPGP card usable?
Best regards,

Thanks for taking the time to examine that. I guess that I'd need to dig
deeper. Or ask the OpenSSH guys.
