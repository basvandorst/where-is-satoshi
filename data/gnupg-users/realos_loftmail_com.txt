@_subject: Subkey revocation means losing signatures? 
I think I got the point. Deleting a UID results in loss of signatures while revkong a UID doesn't if it signs the new UID prior to being deleted.
What about creating an empty uid, i.e. without any email address and
requesting people to sign that uid in addition to respective UIDs with
email address?

I also thought of using the free-form UID for collecting signatures and
the using it to sign my new UID. What do you mean by: If i use that UID to sign my other IDs doesn't it make sense??

Did not get your point. My idea was: Having a signed free-form uid puts more trust in
my key that revoked uid.
Ok, this was a mistake. A key signs other keys/UIDs; a UID does not sign
other UIDs.

@_subject: allowed commands on keys that keyservers handle correctly 
I did not spot any comprehensive documentation on the web about what
kind of key-update different keyservers allow. If I like to remove my signature from a certain key and/or uid, what is
the best approach to that? Does it make sense to revoke the signature or
just delete it? I find both of these commands in "gpg" software but am
unclear what to use.
Generally, I expect keyservers to handle revocation of any key
components better than just deletion for obvious reasons.
Is there a *goog* documentation about what keyserver can handle and what not?

@_subject: documentation about gpg.conf file? 
I was wondering if there is a good documentation about how to edit
gpg.conf file. Over the last weeks I have gained quite an acceptable
understanding of gpg but still need to go a log way before feeling
realy comfortable with advanced options.
I would like to define my own policy for WoT and thus need to override
default settings for marginals-needed, completes-needed, max-cert-depth,
default-cert-level etc.
Could not find any good documentation. Closest I came across was  (German). Manpage only
describes how to enter these option on command line but no special not
about configuration file is give. Any help/hint is much appreciated.

Yes this may be the best of both types of servers. It seems to be a very
small change in protocol. Verification of identity by challenge/response
and allowing more than one keys attached to same email address.
Why have this found it's way into server protocol implementations?
Are there any hidden problems at first sight?

Ismael Valladolid Torres wanted us to know:
To avoid ambiguity, ofcourse. you would not mix up that John Doe with
the one from New Zeeland.

Well, it still may make sense using a free-form UID. Imagine a David
Shaw from London has created a free-form UID which is signed by Jack
upon checking his personal ID card. Now this Davin Shaw adds a new
UID with email address to it, Jackcould now also challenge/response
the listed email address. After such a successful check he can
successfully associate that email address with David Shaw from London
as only he possesses the private key and could have decrypted the
I think it does not matter whether there are 10 or only 1 David Shaws
listen of server if you know which key you have verfied.
But as far as I know this concept is not taken into consideration in
current gpg implementations.

I did try
 marginals-needed 2
 completes-needed 1
 before posting to this list and gpg invocation did not complain but
 adding a few more options was not working so I thought they might have
 to be preceeded by some "set " or something like that.
 Now after your email, I checked again and there was a typing mistake :)
 Thanks and Salam/Shalom ;)

Replacing an old key with updated one seems to be possible with
biglumber and such other servers. Such servers have the disadvatage of
not syncing with other public servers and only allowing one public key
per email address. Are there any other drawbacks of Biglumber?

So, you have some difference on uids for these 2 keys? Like different
entry in name or description?

I am a bit cautious about key uploading on servers, at least until I
feel more comfortable and competent with gpg commands and concepts. I
once created a key with some PGP program which automatically was
uploaded to some keyserver. I lost the private key part and this key is
doomed on keyserver for eternity. For such reasons, I like to experiment
with BL which does not sync with other public servers.
Yeah, it does not support hkp protocol but that is not an issue for me
at the moment. I just see some advatages of BL like key signing announcements
and key replacements as a big plus for me in the beginning.
Some time in future I will move on to public servers. But now it seems
biglumber is my choice.

I think free-form UIDs carry no importance in the current implementations of
gpg/pgp. Signatures on them do not contribute to WoT so this would not
be a big loss, I suppose.
The big advantage would more clean keys and advantage of removing keys
once challenge/response fails.

@_subject: lost private key password 
I have found an old pair of private and public keys but unfortunaltely
do no remember the corresponding password. Public key is places on key
servers, thus I would like to have access to it's password again.
What would you suggest in this case? A brute force attack with some
software if I know part of the password? What tool is suitable for that?
Thanks in anticipation.
