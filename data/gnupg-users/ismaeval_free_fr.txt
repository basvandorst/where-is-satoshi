Check headers of each delivered mailing list post, it's clear enough

@_subject: Make GnuPG create files with .pgp extension 
Most often, recipients of my encrypted files are users of legacy PGP
versions. So I use to rename my .gpg files to .pgp so they can access
them directly with their PGP shell extensions.
Is there any way to make GnuPG to create files directly with the .pgp
extension without specifying the complete expected file name using the
-o option?
Cordially, Ismael

[ultimate] (1). Ismael Valladolid I'd like to edit my uid, adding my second surname and setting the
company I work for as a comment. However I don't know how to modify an
existing uid. Can it be done? If so, how? If not posible, why not?
Of course I can add new uids using the adduid command:
[ultimate] (1)  Ismael Valladolid [ unknown] (2)  Ismael Valladolid Torres (Oberthur Card Systems)
[ unknown] (3). Ismael Valladolid Torres Looks like it would be enough deleting uid 1 and setting uid 2 and
primary, then it would "look like" I had edited the first uid. However
in that case I lose the "ultimate" tag to the left of the primary key.
What does this tag mean here? Which way to have this tag for the new
uids created?
Cordially, Ismael

Is this to be reported to GnuPG developers or to Cygwin developers?

@_subject: Questions about the use with GnuPG and SmartCards 
Any pointer to a complete spec on what data's expected to be on the card
and on a external medium? I have access to personalise a smartcard with
any dedicated or elementary file needed and I'd like to give it a try.
