@_subject: Gpg (GnuPG) 2.2.9 versus gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.23 
Dear gpg users:
I am migrating to gpg 2.2
All my gpg 1.4 keys were migrated to 2.2 during the upgrade.
When I try to decrypt a document I am getting the following:
gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit RSA key, ID 2BDB2DD8782B904E, created 2017-03-15
      "mykey "
gpg: public key decryption failed: No pinentry
gpg: decryption failed: No secret key
I am thinking maybe there is a minimum version of pinentry required?
I am running on two platforms:  Linux, RHEL 7.3 (Maipo) and Unix, Solaris 11. The Solaris machine has pinentry 0.7.6 already provided and the Linux box has 0.8.1. Is that the reason I am having this issue?
I have tried to upgrade pinentry going through the ./configure, gmake, gmake check, gmake install2 steps but I keep getting errors. So if I must upgrade pinentry, then if anyone has some pointers on this for either of both of these platforms, I'd be most appreciative.
Also, pinentry was not a factor before. Can I just get pinentry out of the equation altogether somehow or is that a bad idea.
Sorry for so many questions. Would appreciate any insight you can provide.

@_subject: Solaris 11 install libgcrypt make install hangs 
I ran ./configure, make, make check and entered make install over an hour ago
the make check was clean
If I hit ctrl-C, how do I proceed?
I am installing all the latest.
Trying to get GnuPG installed and these are pre-reqs
I am not a developer so not sure the impact of cancelling a make install. do I need to do an uninstall?
Sorry but kind of at a loss on what to do.
