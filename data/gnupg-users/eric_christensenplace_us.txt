Ahh, yes you are correct.  I was responding without waking up fully...

RSA is not an encryption algorithm.  RSA is a means of exchanging keys.

Oops, yes you are correct.  I was actually thinking of how TLS and SSL
works with their key exchange.

Just to play devil's advocate there could be a single email address being used for a group of people.  You'd know the message was for you because you have the correct key to open the message while everyone else would be left with a random mess of characters.  Not sure why one would setup such a system, since email addresses are cheap now days, but none the less you could setup something similar.  Although this does make one wonder about hijacking someone's account which means that you'd always want to make sure that you change the authentication to your email accounts regularly lest someone do this to you.  It would, more than likely, be a very targetted attack.
So CAFF[0] does make key signing a bit more secure although it does not solve the problem completely.  When signing keys with CAFF, the program will create the signatures per UID and then email the specific UID signature to the address on that UID.  The message is encrypted which requires that the receiving party not only have access to the email address but also the key so they can import the signature.  Once they have imported the signature they can upload the updated key to a key server.  That means that if they are only attacking the email from a sending point of view then they wouldn't have access to the key signature.
