@_subject: file encryption and integrity check 
i am very new with gnupg and cryptography in general.
i'd like to know if gnupg is a good choice for encrypting files with a password and if it is possible to check if an encrypted file is corrupted or not (integrity check). my goal is to burn some files on cds and protect them both from other people and from physical corruption of the media.

so no need to hash files (md5/crc32) before encryption?
anyway, after reading some man page and experimenting, i ended up with the following settings:
encrypt: gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo aes256 --compress-algo none decrypt: gpg --decrypt i avoided 3des,cast5,blowfish becouse they have 64bits blocksize.
i preferred aes over twofish, both 128bits blocksize, becouse the first one seems more "standarized" then the second one.
last, i preferred aes256 over aes128/aes192 becouse it is more secure and encryption times are quite the same.
i have disabled compression becouse files i have to encrypt are already compressed, and compression takes much more time then encryption.
do you think it is a good choice?
