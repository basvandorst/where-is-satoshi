[arthur gpa-0.3.1]$ uname -a SunOS manor 5.7 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-5_10 [arthur gpa-0.3.1]$ cc -v Reading specs from /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.7/2.95.2/specs
gcc version 2.95.2 19991024 (release)
gnupg fails to complile cleanly.
Two fixes:
In argparse.h the defn of ulong isn't picked up
typedef unsigned long ulong;
is a bodge round.
In jnlib/stringhelp.c the varargs stuff fails. It
needs a  at the top.
Config files attached.
