@_subject: Batch generate keys without revocation cert? 
Thank you Angel,
I am already making extensive use of  batching, but (as you can see on the
linked page), there is no option to remove revocation certificates from
being generated.
Was there something specific there that I overlooked?
As you mentioned, I am deleting the revocation cert, but this is suboptimal.
A bit of background...
I was trying to use this for generating "vanity" keys (while using all of
the gpg mechanics, entropy, etc) -- so I need it as fast as possible.
I have come to see that this is far too slow to get an interesting key ID
of my choosing, so I will continue looking into other options like this:
 (with modifications for
Curve25519 added)
If there was an option to provide my own fixed entropy, that would also be
helpful as I'd like to create that using Diceware.
If you have any suggestions, please let me know.
Thanks!  Jonathan

I would like to batch generate keys, but *not* have a revocation cert
I do not see an option for this, how can it be done?
Thanks,  Jonathan

I see this option being added here:
However it doesn't seem to have been released as of 2.2.19.
Is there a reason this still hasn't been released?
Thanks,  Jonathan

@_subject: ed448 support in gpg? 
I am looking into making a new key that is as "future-proof" as possible.
Offline master key that is ed448 would be ideal if possible with Curve25519 subkeys for daily use on a smartcard.
Is ed448 available / in development?
Or a similar 256bit "safe-curves" option?
Thank you,  Jonathan

@_subject: ed448 support in gpg? 
Great news!
How will older clients deal with a certification signature from this unrecognized algorithm?
Yes, I intend to do this with the subkeys (Curve25519)
Only the primary (certification key) would use ed448 which would rarely be used and only offline.
Agreed  :-)
In this situation, I just want to avoid creating a new key-pair as long as possible and ed448 is likely to survive just a bit longer from what I understand.
Performance is irrelevant.

Ah, I was not aware of that.
Seems I should stick with RSA-4096 primary key for now.
I can add an Cv25519 subkey (and even an ed448 subkey later)

Hi Cyrus,
1. This is the SHA256 checksum I get for GnuPG-2.2.20.dmg:
2. The signature (GnuPG-2.2.20.dmg.sig) checked out for me:
gpg: Signature made Sat Mar 21 12:42:46 2020 CET
gpg:                using RSA key 4F9F89F5505AC1D1A260631CDB1187B9DD5F693B
gpg: Good signature from "Patrick Brunschwig " [full]
gpg:               aka "Patrick Brunschwig " [full]
gpg:               aka "[jpeg image of size 13251]" [full]
Primary key fingerprint: 4F9F 89F5 505A C1D1 A260  631C DB11 87B9 DD5F 693B
1. I have met Patrick Brunschwig in person, checked his government ID.
   He also checked mine.
2. We both cross-signed each other's keys.
3. You can verify this by getting our pubkeys from pgpkeys.urown.net
4. You can check the OpenPGP signature on this email to verify my key is:
   9386 A2FB 2DA9 D0D3 1FAF  0818 C0C0 7613 2FFA 7695
Now, of course you don't know me, but you now have a bit more info to go on.
Maybe there's someone in this list below that you know / trust to check ID
and / or verify key fingerprints?  My key:
Meeting people in person and verifying key fingerprints is of course best,
but not always a realistic option for every piece of software :-)
Good luck!
