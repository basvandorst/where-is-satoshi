@_subject: openpgp card woes: 'secret key not available' 
Hi all,
in my ongoing quest to make use of my OpenPGP card I've finally managed
to add several card subkeys to my key following
However, I seem to have done something wrong (again):
 > gpg -ev msg
 gpg: using subkey B0DACEAB instead of primary key 0DC0B7D6
 gpg: reading from `msg'
 File `msg.gpg' exists. Overwrite? (y/N) y
 gpg: writing to `msg.gpg'
 gpg: RSA/AES encrypted for: "B0DACEAB Wouter van Heyst "
So far, so good.
 > gpg -vd msg.gpg
 gpg: public key is B0DACEAB
 gpg: using subkey B0DACEAB instead of primary key 0DC0B7D6
 gpg: detected reader `SCM SCR 335 (21120617208489) 00 00'
 gpg: reader slot 0: active protocol: T1
 gpg: slot 0: ATR=3B FA 13 00 FF 81 31 80 45 00 31 C1 73 C0 01 00 00 90
 00 B1
 gpg: AID: D2 76 00 01 24 01 01 01 00 01 00 00 03 54 00 00
 PIN
 gpg: verify CHV1 failed: invalid passphrase
 gpg: using subkey B0DACEAB instead of primary key 0DC0B7D6
 gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit RSA key, ID B0DACEAB, created 2006-08-15
       "Wouter van Heyst "
 gpg: public key decryption failed: invalid passphrase
 gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
gpg complains about an invalid passphrase, but it didn't even prompt for
one. I'm also not sure what the 'secret key not available' is about,
according to `gpg --card-status`:
 Encryption key....: 6D70 3242 0A9E A10F 2A57  9E88 D886 E99A B0DA CEAB
       created ....: 2006-08-15 13:37:02
I've ensured gpg-agent and/or scdaemon are not running, they have caused
weird problems in the past. Not sure what is wrong now.

It certainly was enough to make my brain register it as unreadable, I
only went back to it when Warner mentioned the deadline again.
Looking at it now I agree it is rather minimal as far as html goes, but
it's still not something I'd willingly read as email (had to spawn a
browser to look at it).
I had a look at the code, but unfortunately I'm not much of a perl
coder. I'm sure there others on this list who can do a better job than
I can.
The system was fairly easy to use, the hardest part was deciding how the
various entries ranked :)

I got a patch plus sig just fine, sure it isn't somewhere between the
list server and you that the scrubbing happens?
