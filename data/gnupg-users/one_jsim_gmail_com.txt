@_subject: Fwd: PGP encrypt/GnuPG decrypt problem 
============================== START ==============================
---------- Forwarded message ----------
As a measure of caution I always encrypt my backups with gnupg using
my public key. I have been doing that for ages. New public key every 5
years or so ?(standard options, but a lot of bits in the keys)
Once in a while I decrypt a backup archive with the most recent "free
version" of PGP. Perhaps 1% of my backups are tested.
Never had a problem, I have to give it my private key, off-course, but
the programs figure out all the other needed information by itself .
Since my archives have CRC into them, and I use it to check the
integrity of my files, I am confident that I can recover my backups
with PGP only.
Just my 0.02 euro

I have been creating key-pars for me and helping other people. Since I
am not a cryptographer I use always GPG defaults options and
suggestions (line command)
Alfter all this new stuff  (creating sha-1 collisions, md-5 ? or so)
should I change the procedures I used to use?
Should I revoke (and help others to revoke) their keys - some keys
have yet 5 years or so "to live"?
For a new key, continue to use default options?

@_subject: usin g GnuPG to encrypt before FTP 
Sending a file encrypted over vanilla FTP does not protect the FTP
password (if any). Worse if the FTP password is the account password.

PGP/GPG does not work easily with web-mail.
Most email, today, is read and write using the browser
POP ou IMAP mail is a rarity
That is the problem
Some text/link in this problem?

I retrieve
"Yes, it is possible to create a public key with the same fingerprint as an
existing one, thanks to a design misfeature in PGP 2.x when signing RSA
keys. The fake key will not be of the same length, so it should be easy to
detect. Usually such keys have odd key lengths"
How percentage of PGP (or GPG?)  users, do you think, know that checking
fingerprint only is not an assurance against fake signatures? Did you know?

Any (easy) way to find out the version of a given key?

This is not clear to me.
Certainly a key manager (example GPA) can have certificates that can be
version 2. Other keys may or may not be version two but have been signed by
the older version.
As far as I understand the all thing can not be trusted  (worse if you can
not figure out the version of a given key).
