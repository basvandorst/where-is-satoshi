Hi all,
I don't have any issues running gnupg - at least not on suse 11 with gpa
and kde.
I do have some issues. Normally, when I deliver boats I have two laptops
- - one for navigation systems Professional 2000 and this linux dell
latitude - but my other laptop (ibm a21e) died sea water spray not too
good on repeated atlantic crossings. Lasted 10 years!
Anyway I can take hard disk out of the dell - leave linux at home
(cyprus) I've installed thunderbird on pro 2000 but not gnupg yet.
Are there any issues I should be aware of prior to or installing gnupg?
I want to add enigmail to thunderbird.
Is it all plain sailing under Microsoft O/S? recommended frontends would
be helpful.

Hi All,
installing gnupg enigma on pro 2000 I have to import files from this
linux laptop - are file conventions the same?
(a) put linux hard drive on usb and scan for keys public and private via
enigmail or gui for gnupg
b) copy just the folder of gnupg to usb and scan that
(c) can I just copy directory to win 2000 hard drive?
Any advice copying/importing between microsoft o/s and linux would be
helpful :)

Hi All,
that a back up export utility would be a good idea - one that selected
all the files required. Changing file formats perhaps complicates the
issue of export/import between operating systems - microsoft bringing
out "new" versions (if that made a difference?) of it's operating system/s.
A platform independent set of data files means no matter what o/s you
choose one can switch between and share data. Core data formats could
change for improved security - whatever as long as o/s independent.
I'm not a developer :) just another end user!

Hi, I don't wish to be over-simplistic, but I had thought that the web
of trust was a people thing rather than a mathematical model.
I can appreciate it's difficult to form a web of trust between people
that you never meet - like me posting here - the idea I thought was to
develop such networks through people that one knows - or gets to know
via  shared contacts - shared experiences - common interests and concerns.
What is trust anyway? Common shared values? How does one measure that
with the depth of signed keys?
Ok so I'm being a bit philosophical
Best Wishes :)

I appreciate secure systems - being rigid are apt to get broken or
people break out of them :) just as equally friendships based on common
interests and concerns dissolve - may be there's no trust in keys at
all. it's a value judgement - that over time, changing conditions may
not reflect the "trust" one had in regard to the person. I'm not likely
to put trust into systems.
I appreciate the security of transmitted data and a requirement it's not
going to leak out the edges or that some one's going to compromise
oneself or others - or (it just struck me) that I may want to compromise
some one (shudder) but then we are still making value judgements about
people and who we trust and why we trust them.
It was philosophical - radical politics - enabling people to protect
their privacy - as a driving principle - where are we now then? a small
group of people that's fairly secure - but the principle is for public
world wide use of pgp to safeguard their privacy - with a fair few
intent on breaking it. It's still a people thing - conflicts of
interest, politics, philosophy the ethics or mores that govern how
people interact. What they share - are we to become closed and only open
if a key is trusted by so many? That in itself is a weakness.

Hello Robert,
I think the battles for our freedoms is without end. People for societies - they
gather together against real and perceived threats. Those societies of men - in
working men's club's or of some gentleman's club.
Today we live in a very different world - global capitalism - the internet -
communication is global socities are global where people gather round shared ideas.
Ideas - common values become global - the increased Americanism - the increased
control of all forms of media - to share in and be part of the common global
experience - to have the "right" views of our world.
We are a society - but without Articles of Association - other than a common
"right" to send and receive encrypted mail - people find it a useful tool in their
daily lives.
I suspect a politician to say "we will take this right away from you for the
common good because "terrorists" will use it to communicate." There is no such
thing as the "common good" there is only vested interests to control what people
think what they believe in.
It is good to be associated with this list - where the only common factor that
binds us to it is that we can and do send encrypted e-mails. I would like to see
every Journalist and every NGO and Charity using GNUPG - perhaps we should try and
get it onto a free CD available with a popular computing magazine.
I have a whole load of links on my web site - though fraturing my skull - I've yet
to develop the enthusiasm to do more.
We have perceived risks - not real risks of losing our "right" to send and receive
encrypted mail - perhaps with the common global spread we will face real threats
from those which perceive we need to be told want to think and what to believe.
Keep up the good work!!

I much prefer to send and receive in plain txt. When I started out some 25 years ago it was
the norm and the convention to do so. I ran a BBS (Bullet Board System) and later became an
ISP (Internet Service Provider). Most people that use Microsoft O/S format emails as HTML -
using fancy fonts and so on. A simple "Hello world" is 50Kb in Microsoft-speak yet a mere
5bytes in linux-speak. We - with long memories remember the criminal actions of Microsoft -
which still act the same way as in the past. There's a lot of "politics" as to why people
write plain txt - who use Linux and not the criminally-based Microsoft. A lot of people do
not care if they send out junk emails - their friends can read it and so must the rest of
the world.
I think lists should say "Please send plain txt only."

Hi Jerry,
I don't hate any one for using Microsoft - I even beta-tested Windows 3.11 and Windows 95/98
till I realised that though we filed bug reports Microsoft in Ireland took no notice.
And as an ex-Chairman and ex-Vice President of a US Company we had an ethical trading policy
to which the Microsoft Corporation failed to comply with. They still seem to be facing
problems in the EU.
If I were to suggest that you should support your local bank robber or mugger and give them
every assistance and that all criminals be released - you would suggest that I was mad.
Microsoft does engage in illegal business practices - and are supported by millions every
day with their lock in licences and anti-competitive practices.
I just have a better grasp of business ethics and better grasp in recognising software
freedom - but I don't hate people for their ignorance of Microsoft's bad and illegal
business practices.
Most people have Microsoft on their desktop or laptop without any choice. They do not have
the freedom of choice. Most people like my girlfriend just switch on their laptop or desktop
and use it without any knowledge that there are alternatives.
As some one said "Microsoft gives you Windows - Linux gives you the whole house" that whole
house is for free. Microsoft lock you in - they lock companies in too. They engage in
illegal business practices.
I often find it odd that people when they get to know about Microsoft's illegal business
practices that they continue to have a Microsoft Operating System on the desktop or laptop.
Companies that sell desktops and laptops operate with very small margins - but the licence
that goes to Microsoft is constant about 12 years ago it was a fact that IBM paid Microsoft
a licence fee for every machine it sold - $400 USD. So when desktops or laptops are sold in
a sale there is no reduction of licence fee which remains a constant.
A computer buyer can not go into say PC World and say "I like that HP or Acer, but I will
buy it with or without an operating system or with a Linux distro installed." They have no
choice. Microsoft's business policy is "No choice but Microsoft for the general consumer and
for the business user."
I support freedom of choice - I support ethical business practices. Microsoft Corporation
does not support any ethical principles. It is not a question of "I hate Microsoft." I don't
support unethical or illegal business practices.
I also think that the majority of computer users are in ignorance. But you can Google and
see for yourself the basis of business practice by Microsoft Corporation. Oh and once IBM
had a licence for Windows - IBMers are not told to talk about that.
But once you do know - then you have a choice - continue to support anti-competitive
unethical and illegal business practices of the Microsoft Corporation or if you support
ethical good practice and no criminal activity. Your choice as everyone else's.
As an oldy (63) I prefer plain txt. I don't admonish people for sending me HTML with all
manner of fancy fonts - I just accept it.

Hello Michael,
Firstly, ALL keys are untrustworthy - even if signed by some one else - it's not till you
have met the person - verified it's them - and checked a copy of their public key - which
they show you as a print out. If you then decide to have a level of confidence (trust) in
that person being who they say they are - and the key belongs to them then you can set some
level of trust.
The web  of trust is not something you can pick up. Rather the web of trust is a group of
people that have seen each other's public keys and thus signed them. So your mates and your
sister all use pgp - they each agree to sign each's key - then you have a web of trust.

You are a little confused - you ask ask "can some one verify the gnupg fingerprint for
pubkey" and you use Verners key to verify gnupg. Then you worry about impersonation - now
clearly Verner and gnupg have different keys. Or don't you know that?
Clearly you failed to follow my link and clearly you failed to check the public key for
gnupg. Now being a little confused try and get a clear question in your mind - is it
Verner's key that you have such a passion to verify or gnupg?
Verner's had about three keys two of which have expired - to the best of  my knowledge he's
a real person - he even maintains this list. You could always try encrypting  an e-mail to
his public key asking him if he's a real person. I'd suggest you not do the same for the
public key of gnupg.
People generate a private and a public key imaginary people don't do this - granted some one
can set up a false ID and create a set of keys - but though they have created a false ID to
do so they are nevertheless real people.
If you are so concerned about Verner's key why not take a trip to Germany and arrange to
meet him? You can't meet the gnupg (as its a bit of software) but you can verify it's
running on your computer.
All your keys are "untrusted." Everyone of them - apart from your own public key. They all
remain so until you actually meet that person and verify that they are who they say they
are. You carefully check their passport their driving licence.
But gnupg has not got a passport or a driving license. The only way you can check if gnupg
is real is to check if it's running on your computer gpg --version - this will tell you if
you have the software installed. If it's installed and working correctly it must be real.
What if that fails? Well you do the same thing gpg2 --version and hope that Verner does not
pop up and say "Hello."

To put matters simply, (1) Verner's key is not the same as gnupg's key (2) You can confirm
the validity of Verner's key by meeting him (3) you can confirm that gnupg is running on
your computer gpg/2 --version..
The subject of your e-mail is: can someone verify the gnupg Fingerprint for pubkey?
I gave  you a direct link to import gnupg's public key - but pointed out to you that the
"normal" procedure for verification would not work i.e all your public keys are by default
untrustworthy and that the only way to verify a public key is owned by a person is to  meet
that person.
You have no way to verify that the public key belonging to gnupg is valid - but it does
exist on your computer. It's entirely up to you whether you trust it or not. It's a question
of reality.
Verner's key and gnupg's key are two separate keys - you can not confuse the two. Verner's
already explained this to you in some detail.
To conclude - the only key you can trust ultimately is your own. When  you have met some one
and confirmed their ID as indicated you can set a level of trust to "fully." It does not
matter how many people have signed a public key belonging to someone - they are all
untrustedworthy - until that is you meet that person in reality.
As to the question: can someone verify the gnupg Fingerprint for pubkey? The answer is no.
Why? It is not a person but a bit of software.
I am usually quite good natured :)

You have to apply some logic - and some common sense. I have about 180 public keys - all
apart from about 5 or 6 are untrusted. Now a lot of people have my public key say 175 and
all those people have my public key marked as untrusted.
The whole idea behind the web of trust is that you have met "real" people. On the whole most
people are who they say they are - but with all systems you get people using fake IDs.
Now Werner Koch has a reality - he writes GPG4Win GNUpg and maintains this list - but
because I've not met him (though I have exchanged e-mails with him) I have not signed his key.
The whole principle underlining the web of trust is that you  have met that person in the
real world and to the best of your knowledge - they are who they say they are and their
public key belongs to them.
It is a principle of the whole system that you only sign people's keys. The person comes
first - not the key.
It's not the validity of keys but the validity of people. So in your every day life you
accept that the train  driver the bus driver the person behind the bar - your wife and kids
are all living real and normal lives. Now, your wife and kids aare somewhat different. You
married your wife and thus can trust she presented to you a real ID. You had sexual
intercourse with this real person (your wife) and she as a result of that intercourse
produced your kids.
Your relationship to your wife and kids is special - you trust that they are really real and
you believe it to be true. And why not? You wake up in the morning beside her - you watch
your kids grow up. Now 20 years into your marriage you discover that your wife's a secret
agent - Jane Brown - not the Mary Smith you thought you married - and that were you thought
believed your kids sprung from your seed they were in fact from the milkman. The reality -
the belief is she's still your wife and they are your kids - they have behaved as such.
Most people are bound up with beliefs and behaviours. They interact with others on a daily
basis sharing common values beliefs and behaviours. Under normal conditions we don't ask
every one we meet for their passport driving license or DNA sequence. We accept it as the
norm that people are real and valid - its the IDs they use which may or maybe questionable.
A spy may have say 6 IDs - the IDs are fictitious but the person is real. You have lots of
family and friends - who they are - what they are changes overtime and  changes because of
the  conditions under which you meet them - they could  be a Father a Professor - an Olympic
Javelin thrower - then Retired - then dead. All these are IDs - which govern your
behavioural interaction with that person. What do you trust? That you hear them speak? You
have shaken them by the hand? Gone down the pub with them?
In truth we can not say that all these IDs are "real" neither can we say they are "false."
But we interact with them and so build a reality of behaviours - sharing common interests
and values and beliefs. Just like all these people on this mailing list. People are real.
Though they may have many identities.
It is common practice to accept people at "face value" - even if you only "know" them from
being on a mailing list. It is by common interaction "communication" that one reinforces
one's own belief systems and we accept the commonly held belief that we are interacting with
a real person - we through our own perception then make judgements about that person - we
like them or we don't - we admire and respect them or we don't we trust what they have to
say or we don't.
We make value judgements about real people - no matter what ID they present to us. It's the
"face value" which is the key. Have we met the person? We affirm the reality of people via
our social networking. Mary knows Bob - Bob knows Harry and Harry knows Mary. You can ask
Bob and Harry to confirm that it is really is Mary that you are talking too. We all can
confirm to some degree the reality of Werner Koch - by what he does. But I have not met him
in any social network other than this and other mailing lists.
So people on this mailing list "know" that Werner Koch is "real." You can send him an
encrypted e-mail and if he has your public key reply to you. The "reality" is we make people
"personal" to ourselves by interacting with them. If we don't interact we don't build any
models in our minds. If say 5 people said  that they had actually met Werner in the flesh -
at face value - you would accept that Werner Koch was who he said he was.
We assign material documents to give validity to real people. People come first not the
documentation. A public key is such a document. A person may generate many public keys - the
person is the real validity. You do not affirm a level of trust in the public key. You
affirm a level of trust in the person. So all your public keys are untrustworthy except for
those people that you have met. So even though I and many others have exchanged e-mails with
Werner Koch his public key remains untrusted.
Likewise you can not meet face to face with a bit of software though you may affirm its on
your computer and you may affirm by interacting with it - the fact remains the public key
remains untrustworthy.
I have lots of keys - 98 per cent are "untrustworthy." It's normal. It is not the same as
having the perception of an untrustworthy person - which is based on our perception oof the
value system we place on their behaviours. A public key is a static document - whereas
people - those that are alive have values belief systems and behaviours that interact with
other human beings out of common interests and goals. Some people have a mind set that says
"that person is real therefore their documents are real." Then they form value judgements on
that documentation - to trust or not to trust - as though they were interacting with real

What is our "reality" about public key encryption? The validation of public keys? The
validation of real people? We almost forget why we want public key encryption - so that only
the recipient can read our e-mails. The "recipient" is a person - their public key is merely
a tool to which software on your computer can encrypt to their public key. That's the only
reality a public key has. It is not a seal of authenticity - not a rubber stamp. It has no
power vested in it as to give "authority." It is merely a means for secure communications
over an insecure network.
The web of trust - signing people's keys is based on people meeting face to face and
interacting in a social network - it is not about the level of trust one has in the public
key. A keys "validity" is it works. The validity is the recipient of an encrypted message
can decrypt it. All keys are valid in this respect. They are in a sense all trustworthy. All
keys do what they say they can do. Without any failure. So you need not set any level of
trust on keys because they work perfectly.
The "trust" is in the person - not the public key. So some would argue that signing Werner's
key is crazy - has no logic and a miss-placed value system. I'd have to agree.

Hello Sam,
First off - it's normal to have most of your keys as "untrusted." It does not matter how
many other people have signed that public key - you have not met that person have not
verified them vis some photo id and not met them in a social context. Most people are normal
users of pgp - I suspect there are few secret government agents - not that they are likely
to say so :) though some believe them to be everywhere. Gnupg works perfectly signing and
setting a level of trust is to do with building the web of trust - and that is all about
people. It is about holding key-signing parties - developing your social network of pgp
users - through family friends work colleagues club members - and the wider world.

You can install the programme GPA and it will under preferences edit it for you. If I recall

Some say that all the power of the universe - and all the time its been in existence will
not crack a 2048 bit key with a secure passphrase. So by the time the universe is well and
truly over and some poor sod of a government agent is alive and well he will not have
cracked yer e-mails or indeed any encrypted data. Can you imagine that power from a
computer? No. The mind boggles at the energy it would consume - a million million million ad
infinitum suns.
But they "key" to all this is them holding your private key - it would be quicker and a lot
simpler to crush your balls with a pair of pliers - you will give up your most treasured
possession - your passphrase. This is the meaning of brute force attacks on your key.
The strength of your passphrase is critical alpha numerics take the whole universe to crack
where as a phrase like:
is a good key it will last you forever - if you can stand having your balls crushed. So the
best form of security would be to invest in a sturdy steel codpiece and a long passphrase.

First off,
It was the enigmail mail list which I un-subscribed too. I am currently using Mint Linux 32
bit LXDE. I don't trust and have no faith in Openpgp's ability to encrypt to predefined
per-recipient rules. I have set my system to do it manually.
Now I have 3 Linux Laptops. I started testing Linux distros with gpg2 - enigmail with
Thunderbird - all 100 per cent Openpgp failed to initialise with pgp2 and in fact Openpgp
always signed to my private key not my public key when  using percipient rules. Here is a
list of main Linux distros which all fail to initialise pgp2:
Opensuse 12.1 12..2 11.1/4 either 32/64 bit with KDE/Gnome/LXDE
Ubuntu (any flavour) KDE/Gnome/LXDE 32/64 bit
Linux Mint KDE/Gnome?LXDE 32/64 bit
Fedora-16 KDE/Gnome/LXDE 32/64 bit
(With all official updates).
With Thunderbird Enigmail/Openpgp with gpg2 your system may freeze you may not digitally
sign or encrypt to someone's public key via e-mail. You may not digitally sign an e-mail
whilst at the same time encrypting. Be warned - any encryption done will be to your private
key and not to your public key. Enigmail may fail to initialise (gpg2).
There is no compatibility in above Linux distros  with Enimail/Openpgp and gpg2 - you are
best advised to stick with gpg (GnuPG) 1..4.11.
I have posted this info on my main page to my web site - I have tested. And tested sending
people e-mails - No one to my comments seriously - even when I told Verner - he said let
kgpg handle commands - why? gpg2 specific commands do not work with gpg2.
Now testing with a fellow Linux user revealed that if you have both gpg 1.4.11 and gpg2
installed you don't get any problems. So I can only conclude that gpg2 is an add-on widget
to gpg 1.4.11 - gpg2 only recognises gpg 1.4.11 commands.
Openpgp/enigmail does not support gpg2 unless one has installed gpg 1.4.11 - but I no longer
trust Openpgp/enigmail to do anything.

I ran the debugging programme with Openpgp debugging options to console and I got the
message that with gpg2 installed one was not able to digitally sign an e-mail whilst
encrypting  to their public key which in all the named distros it encrypted to my private
key - fact.
Another user who was using Fedora-16 64 bit with gnome stated that Openpgp would not
initialise pgp2 - and me? I ran Fedora-16 32 bit - I had to reboot before openpgp would work
(so badly as was useless) with gpg2. Fact I even when and installed Fedora-16 64 bit fact
and encountered the same issues, Fact.
It is a fact that Openpgp will only work if BOTH gpg 1.4.11 and the widget gpg2 is then
added. Fact. Most Linux users have BOTH by default. Fact. That's why no one's reporting aany
problems. Fact. If you remove from your system gpg 1.4.11 then  you have real problems with
open Openpgp - even Kleopatra. Fact
Now if you don't like these facts then  that's not a problem. I have decided to tell every
one not to use gpg2 without having installed  gpg 1.4.11. Now as I haave spent the last 10
days playing with all these Linux distros and sending all these test e-mails which have
provided factual evidence as stated I  can only conclude that Openpgp will only work with
1.4.11 installed. Now I have not mentioned anything about Windows XP and the latest version
of PGP4Win which some times encrypts to my girlfriends private and not to my public key I've
not figured out that one yet - unless I install gpg 1.4.11!!
I will say this I am running Linux Mint LXDE 32 bit - on a 64 bit Acer Laptop with all
updates. My gpg-agent's running because I added it to my .xsession file. Now I  have
un-ticked the box - use agent. Now Openpgp is pretty variable in how long my passphrase
lasts - it could last all day yet it could last to the next e-mail.
But I don't trust Openpgp to honour per-recipient rules. It does not work ie it will not
encrypt to the e-mail address as set out in its own rule. Fact.
Now if you can't even trust the software to do what it says on the tin - then  you have to
go back to basics as I have done. Fact.
Now I have pointed out some serious short comings that are spread over Linux Distros and
Windows XP with Thunderbird and enigmail/Openpgp installed. Fact.
I am not angry - far from it - I got a lot of brain ache burning DVDs installing various
Linux Distros and playing with them. I would have tested more - but hey - I pointed out the
facts of my discovery. Now all my 3 Linux laptops are Mint Linux LXDE 32 bit installed with
TB gpg 1.4.11 enigmail/Openpgp - No probs. Fact. But I still do not trust enigmail/openpgp
to do anything on the tin. Fact.
Now on the whole as no one's interested in these facts - I don't much care. I worry about
sending an encrypted mail to some one's public key in case it does not work. It digitally
signs e-mails - but I have no confidence no assurance of encrypting to a public key. My
girlfriend who only sends me encrypted mail sometimes sends me encrypted mail that I cannot
read. Why? The answer is very very  simple - sometimes Openpgp/enigmail signs to your
private key and not the person your e-mailing's public key. Fact. I'm not angry about that -
why? Because the error does not happen all the time. Fact.
All I do is repeat the facts. Get 50 variants of popular Linux distros KDE/Gnome?LXDE do not
install gpg 1.4.11 just gpg2 TB Enigmail/Openpgp and have fun.

- From tests carried out - Mandrava Linux was ok. I suspect that other Linux distros have no
real problems - just because your works - does not mean that every other Linux distro works.
I stated I only ran tests on a few Linux Distros - I too have 5 e-mail accounts and could do
multiple testing - with surprising results. We all think that at the core all Linux distros
are the same - they are not. Heavily branded distros where the core of every programme is
re-written is bad news for the user.
I case in point. Seahorse. You are supposed to set how long a passphrase will exist for. In
Ubuntu and opensuse this feature has been removed. Such programmes as "apt" are not
installed - and do not appear on opensuse's list of "approved" apps.
But it's not all about re-writing all the code for hard-wired branding. A women wrote to the
enigmail list and said that her Fedora-16 64 bit had failed to initialise gpg2 - she ven
whent as far as going to Mozilla and downloading and installing Thunderbird. She even went
to the enigmail's home page and downloaded and installed the correct version of enigmail for
Thunderbird. The result? Openpgp caused her system to freeze.
I was the only person who answered her - I was the only person to conduct tests on Fedora-16
KDE/Gnome/LXDE 32/64 bit. I stated the results of my tests. Further in opensuse gpg2 is
installed by default - a user-agent is installed by default - but in all versions of
opensuse tested no user-agent was ever running. As stated the Seahorse was the default
daemon - but had the ability to set how long a passphase would last had been programmed out.
With branded versions (not all) of popular Linux distros the term "open source" means
"closed source." But we are still faced with the problems of GPG4WIN and the problem of
directly installing from source. We are still faced with the fact that Openpgp does not
support gpg2.
Now I'm  running Mint Linux LXDE 32 bit - the Seahorse as provided has no way of controlling
the length in minutes your passphrase stays around. Linux Mint uses Ubuntu software sources
and that function has been written out.
I am trying to install Seahorse directly - I have to google for all its dependences - which
are not installed - though I've got a "Seahorse!" You either get the original open source
software or a pre-packaged look-a-like. I suspect that when you install a branded Linux -
you install Thunderbird and Enigmail all these open source packages are re-written to be a
closed shop.
But it still does not answer why direct installs have the same problem. Or why Windows XP
with Thunderbird and Enigmail have problems.

Therefore, are we saying that with some Linux distros that happen to have installed gp2
automatically that those Linux distros have a problem with gpg2?
For example opensuse - all versions tested:
(1) When you open the address book in TB select an address right mouse click you get an
option to create a per-recipient rule for that person. (Openpgp/inigmail is installed for
you to do this). With gpg2 installed this option flickers jumps and fades out.
(2) With gpg1 - it is clear - no jumping -no fading no fuzziness - you get other options -
such a delete - which are not available when just pgp2 is installed. This same flickering
and fuzzing occurs with Fedora-16 all GUIs 32/64 bit and you only have one menu option which
is to create a rule - though it flickers on and off one does not know one's created a rule
till you go an check it within the options of openpgp.
(3) Having created such a rule you decide to digitally sign and send an encrypted e-mail to
that person using their public key.
(4) But - and this is the big big big but - you  can not digitally sign whilst encrypting -
and worse when the person gets that e-mail they say "Why did you send me an e-mail that I
can not open." These are real person to person facts with gpg2 installed on all the Linux
distros I tested.
(5) Now I say that gpg2 does not work with the Linux distros I tested. Not all Linux distros
are the same they convert open source to proprietary branded Linux.
(6) And what's worse when end users download Thunderbird from Mozilla when they download
enigmail from their respective web sites and correctly install correctly configure they
still have the same problems with gpg2.
This is why I said and listed those Linux distros that gpg2 does not work with. Now I
suggested that perhaps enigmail/openpgp was at fault - and got told to bugger off cos it was
a gpg2 problem.
Now as a scientist who believes in the scientific method I have tested and have drawn my
tests into the public domain. Now some people's reaction was not helpful - reading in that I
was angry without reading the contents of my e-mail - these are fuck-wits. Lowlife
cyber-hoodies. But I am patient even with fuck-wits. I may add that I do not consider you a
fuck wwit or indeed a cyber-hoodie.
But we are still faced with the issues raised thy don't go away:
(1) Because "Oh it works on my system so it must work on other people's."
(2) "Bugger off we are not interested in how many Linux distros you tested it's not got
anything to do with us."
(3) "Its not gpg2 it's something else."  The "something else" is always a mystery.
To conclude:
(1) Some heavily branded Linux distros do re-write all the open source code to lock users in
and deprive them of some functionality - Seahorse is a case in point
(2) Even when installing the open source for TB and Enigmail gpg2 does not work on Linux
distros (I tested)
(3) Some Linux distros (the one's I tested) do not support gpg2
These are the tested facts of the matter - these are real person to person experiences.
There is one commonality which stands out and that is gpg2.
We may also say:
(1) Do not Install any version of opensuse any version of Ubuntu any version of Fedora-16
and any version of Linux Mint. Why? The gpg2 that get's installed does not work.
(2) All heavily branded Linux distros are no respecter's of open source.
(3) Further more if you decide to download all the open source from their respective web
sites they will not work on these Linux distros.
(4) It took me 10 days sometimes 18 hours per day to test something like 50 Linux Distros
against (a) A person running Windows XP with GPG4Win installed (they had their fair share of
problems too) (b) a person running Mandriva with gpg2 install with "no probs."
I trust that matters are clear

Let me reiterate "I am not angry." Which means in common English let me explain again to you
I am not angry.
I gave you an example which was Seahorse - clearly you failed to read.
I have set out quite clearly the issues found on Linux distros - you are unable to provide a
solution to any. I am neither angry or disappointed. I state observations quite clearly -
the recorded facts - and you are at a loss.
As previously stated I now run Linux Mint/Ubuntu LXDE 32 bit with gnupg 1.4.11 I am quite
happy with this set up. It works. I am considering installing Mandriva 64 bit with LXDE
which from tests shows it to be stable with gpg2. My tardiness (slowness) in making such a
move is I am a little tired of installing Linux distros.

Hauke,
I have tried all this - but I still get the same errors even after restarting my laptop.
KGpg fails to start Kleopatra keeps warming me of errors and enigmail refuses to send mail
unless I force no signing force no encryption. If I try to use gpg2 in enigmail it shuts
down completely refusing to do anything.
The more I do the more it seems that I do not fix this problem. All I get is the same error
message from enigmail:
Error - key extraction command failed

Yesterday whilst figuring out what to do, I found that I was logged out - my Linux box
refused to accept my password.
Anyway having copied the contents of my home directory - I reinstalled LXDE. Then slowly
configured. I installed gpg2 - created the directory and associated files and then copied
over my files.
All works perfectly now - thanks to being locked out!!

@_subject: It's time for PGP to die. 
I've been using gnupg for many many years. I have 199 users in my key ring and 99.99 per
cent are "untrusted." A fact that I for one do not mind. You don't trust my key is from me -
right? Trust is relative - you have all been here for many many years - but I will not sign
keys from you as "trusted."
Leaving aside the issue of how popular encryption of mail is - we are faced with the fact
that 98 per cent of computer users are completely ignorant about software and hardware. They
just go into PC World and buy what they like. There is No Microsoft pre-loaded security
features built-in and so end users have no idea about encrypting their emails - and no easy
way to instantly share keys between users. There is no automatic key generation at the point
of switching the computer on for the very first time and then sharing your key with millions
of other people.
Same with so-called smart phones and tablets - there is no automatic "simple" key creation
and automatic posting to a secure key server.
We make an effort - but I have very very few friends that I have had to install gnupg on
their computers - every one I know knows nothing about computers. While we are concerned
with our "rights" to private communication - concerned with NSA GCHQ 99.99 per cent of the
world's population while having a general or non-existent idea of "security" have no idea of
what they should do. We fiddle while Rome burns.
After 20 odd years while there has been advances in cryptography and GUIs there has been an
almost zero growth in take up. No wonder Yahoo and Google (who can not be trusted) are
providing solutions to end users who are completely ignorant. Can you imagine the horror of
Microsoft entering the "market?" That thought scares me to death.
But we have to face the fact that Microsoft has a hold on hard drive manufacturers - in that
they are all sold with a version of "Windows" on them. What is required is that at first
boot up of a computer an Iphone or an Itablet whatever a programme needs to run that will
install and create a set of keys automatically. Your public key will automatically be sent
to key servers. If there are any "bugs" security holes - then updates should be automatic.
Time to die? Well after 20 years I think it is all very academic - professors sit in class
rooms the world over - not much common sense comes out of their mouths. The real issues are:
(a) do we want to implement our own security on our own devices as a "geek" or
(b) have some automated pre-installed software that will create all that's necessary at
first boot or
(c) rely on some large corporation to handle the encryption and decryption for us
Will global encryption and de-cryption of all emails and there attachments be fully automatic?
The implications for security and intelligence services are a real head ache but who cares!!
Some countries do not allow encryption by law and those that do will change their laws to
have access to All private keys or face long term jail sentences. All governments are
against the people.
GNUpg would have a great future if the developers had greater vision. We are in a very very
tiny minority of people. So small we are insignificant. The use of gpg will die out because
we are ALL getting a bit long in the tooth.
Service providers will make their own solutions available simply as an added "end-user
benefit" but without any legal binding on their own security. We know that the NSA and GCHQ
would be horrified by the thought of every one in the entire world encrypting their emails.
They have a vested interest of keeping it under their control.
The fact is 99.99 per cent of the world's population does not know gnupg exists. Or GPG4WIN.
Perhaps when we are all in our 90's we will say "Oh gpg was a good idea, pity it did not
catch on."

@_subject: Keysigning 
Hello Robin,
The first thing you need to do is upload your public key to a key server. Perhaps you can
find people where you live - a local Windows group or Linux group they would be happy to
sign your key.
Video conferencing? You need to produce some documentation of who you are - some here may
feel that video conferencing is not a good idea. But first get your public key to a key server.

@_subject: Keysigning 
Hello Robin,
I tried to download your public key from several servers - without any luck.  As your using
Thunderbird you can always attach your public key.
As for key signing - then face to face communications are better. I've asked myself "what is
the importance of people signing my keys?" There is no valid reason as far as I can see -
though people like to build the web of trust - and for the most part - people on here are
who they say they are - and over the years you get to build up trust. Though having said
that I'm not about to rush out and sign every one's keys.
Why not start your own group? There are lots of Linux groups around the world - unless your
stuck in the middle of nowhere! Perhaps you can provide a link to where you uploaded your
public key?

But I get the following error when signing my mail: "Key 0xAAd8C47D not found or not valid.

I hope that is within the bounds of your understanding.

@_subject: Help needed 
Hi Daniel,
Firstly I can neither encrypt or sign. I have two laptops (1) 32 bit LXD (2) 64 bit LXD my
64 bit machine crashed and went off for repairs. It came back I reinstalled the operating
system and all programmes - now a mirror image of my 32 bit LXD. Then I did the following:
(1) david at laptop-1:~$ gpg
gpg: directory `/home/david/.gnupg' created
gpg: new configuration file `/home/david/.gnupg/gpg.conf' created
gpg: WARNING: options in `/home/david/.gnupg/gpg.conf' are not yet active during this run
gpg: keyring `/home/david/.gnupg/secring.gpg' created
gpg: keyring `/home/david/.gnupg/pubring.gpg' created
gpg: Go ahead and type your message ...
(2) Run ALL your GUIs eg Kgpg Kleopatra GPA - but do not create a new set of keys! Kgpg will
complain and not run.
(3) Reboot your system - very important!
(4) Type david at laptop-1:~$ gpg-agent
gpg-agent: gpg-agent running and available
david at laptop-1:~$
Then I copied ALL .gnupg files from the 32 bit laptop to the 64 bit laptop - on the 32 bit
laptop I exported my keys saving them to a file - I did this twice. Then I imported my keys
into the 64 bit laptop. All programmes see my key - even gpg but I always get the same error
message: "Key 0xAAd8C47D not found or not valid. The (sub-)key might have expired" when I
try to sign or encrypt a message.
Now insted of copying ALL the files from one .gnupg to another am just going to copy
secring.gpg and trustdb.gpg - then import my keys - if this works then you will know how to
do it in the future - if it does not work - hmmmmmmm...............

@_subject: My Conclusions 
Hi All,
After spending 62 hours on what I thought would be a simple task namely to get a fully
functioning gnupg mirror on my 64 bit Linux system - I realise this is an impossible task to
do. In the past I've ended up creating a new set of certificates - but this time round I
thought that I would apply some effort.
My conclusion is It IS Impossible To Transfer Your Keys From The Same O/S To Another Machine.
There is no one in the entire universe that has ever attempted it. And if they have THEY
HAVE FAILED. Not one person on this list knows how to do it successfully. No one. NOT ONE OF
YOU can transfer a mirror image of your .gnupg folder and expect it to work.
This tells me what I have long suspected - yes it's good at encryption and signing but the
programme is fundamentally flawed as to make it utter crap. My keys are PERFECT but the
software is CRAP. Werner Koch knows it's crap. Every one knows it's crap.
So, If I want to go on signing and encrypting my emails I HAVE TO CREATE ANOTHER SET A
BLOODY KEYS!!!!!!!!
I am not a happy bunny!!!

@_subject: Why the software is crap 
Hello All,
I even tried exporting my private and public key from the command line and then tried
importing. The same error message as before. I have checked on the internet - most of the
suggestions are crap - the authors have never ever tried to do what they suggest others to
do. If they had done so then they would have known just how crappy their supposed expertise was.
I have even looked through   and found this to be a
useless pile of crap also.
I am faced with two options:
(1) Create yet another set of keys
(2) Give up using gnupg after some 20 years
I think I will unsubscribe from this list and give up on gnupg as a pile of crap.

@_date: 2014-11-14 11:45:48
@_author: david@gbenet.com 
@_subject: My Conclusions 
I have done everything correctly - and my conclusions are still the same NO ONE HAS EVER
SUCCESSFULLY MADE A MIRROR COPY OF THEIR .GNUPG AND HAD A FULLY 100 PER CENT WORKING SIGNING
AND ENCRYPTION PROGRAMME THAT WORKS.
THERE IS NO CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS FROM ANYONE - SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU HAVE NEVER EVER DONE IT.

@_date: 2014-11-14 12:24:26
@_author: david@gbenet.com 
@_subject: Why the software is crap 
I have cooled. You can export your private key - you can export your public key. You can
import your private key you can import your public key. In 20 years I have always had the
same problem - the same error message and have each time created a new set of keys. I have
done this 4 times.
I notice that no one on this list - for all the talk of "oh I've done it" can offer no
practical information has to HOW. No one. No one. No one knows how to do this simple task.
In all my 20 years I have never found out how. Perhaps things are different under a Windows
O/S but on Linux there is NO SOLUTION.
Perhaps the only "solution" is to import ones private and public keys and lose all your
contacts - ie a brand new installation. But I repeat BUT no one has ever created a mirror
image of a .gnupg and had a fully 100 per cent working signing and encryption functionality.
No one. There are no real practical solutions written anywhere on the internet.
There is nothing of any value in   - there never was
in all the 20 years of reading it.
Sure you can moan criticise me for my getting frustrated - and you can all moan and cringe
and all withdraw your support - BUT NO ONE HAS EVER OFFERED ANY PRACTICAL USEFUL ADVICE THAT
WILL ENABLE ME TO TRANSFER MY KEYS AND HAVE THEM WORKING CORRECTLY. NO ONE. NOT EVEN YOU.
You are offended? Why? It is an easy thing to do is it not to moan about what and how people
express themselves - yet you completely ignore the real issue. You ignore is because you can
offer no real meaningful solution. As I have said no one has ever successfully transferred
their public and private keys between machines and got them to successfully work. That's a
real fact. And no one on this list as any practical solutions that work in the real world.
That's a fact. The fact is no one on this list has ever done it with 100 per cent success.
That's a fact. There is no practical advice on the internet. That's a fact.

I have GPA Kleopatra Seahorse and Kgpg on laptop-1 and laptop-2. They all make "calls" to
gnupg. I at first made a copy of my  public key I decided to use Kgpg to save my public key
postmaster.asc which I saved to david at laptop-1:/media/store$.
It is to be noted that both laptops are "laptop-1" So now All tasks are performed on the 64
bit LXD laptop:
(1) david at laptop-1:~$ gpg
gpg: directory `/home/david/.gnupg' created
gpg: new configuration file `/home/david/.gnupg/gpg.conf' created
gpg: WARNING: options in `/home/david/.gnupg/gpg.conf' are not yet active during this run
gpg: keyring `/home/david/.gnupg/secring.gpg' created

gpg: Go ahead and type your message ...
(2) Run ALL your GUIs eg Kgpg Kleopatra GPA - but do not create a new set of keys! Kgpg will
complain and not run.
(3) Reboot your system - very important!
(4) Type david at laptop-1:~$ gpg-agent
gpg-agent: gpg-agent running and available

(5) Then I discovered failings within Thunderbird/Enigmail - I did various test e-mails
skipper at gbenet.com to postmaster at gbenet.com admin at bikermates.org to david at gbenet.com - all
failed to support signing all failed to support encryption.
(6) I tried doing backups - I tried deleting pubring - in fact I tried doing everything that
was possible to do.
Then I switched back to the 32 bit laptop today (15th 11th 2014 and decided to investigate
the "problem."

The nature of Linux is that your "home directory" is automatically created so one can hardly
forget to create it. As stated laptop-1 has a 32 bit O/S and laptop-2 as a 64 bit O/S this
means installing an 64 bit Linux Operating System and copying ALL programmes that are on the
32 bit Linux Operating System. They have the same programmes. This means that are a "mirror"
of each - except that one is 32 bit and one 64 bit. No migration of an Linux operating
system took place - it would be meaningless to put a 32 bit O/S on a laptop with more than 4
MB RAM as it would not recognise the additional memory.

Hi All,
The problem is with gpg2 on a 64 bit O/S I removed gpg2 and also lost GPA and Kleopatra and
Kgpg no longer runs on my 64 bit Linux.
Now my only error is "bad passphrase." Which I can not change from the terminal.
Also as I recall the problem is with Enigmail - I have to install a version of Thunderbird
at least 3 years older than my current version with an enigmail current to that version.
This will get rid of all errors. Hopefully :)
A rule maybe - "don't run gpg2 on a 64 bit Linux system - and install a much older version
of Thunderbird and enigmail - and never upgrade Thunderbird to a newer version."

@_subject: The Facts: 
I have partly resolved the problem - which seems to be related to gnupg2 Thunderbird and
Enigmail running on a 64 bit Linux. The only error message am now getting is "bad
passphrase" when I've not even entered a passphrase but am about to too.
As I recall the only options I have are installing  a version of Thunderbird at least 4
years older than the current version. I'm using Thunderbird 24.6.0 at the moment with the
same error message - "bad passphrase" with no ability at the terminal or in Enigmail to
correct or change it. Even gnupg 1.4 does not accept -passwd.
As I recall I had the same problem with Fedora and Suse 14 64 bit. I'm on Linux
3.11.0-26-generic (x86_64) Ubuntu 13.10. And as I recall others had similar problems with
Fedora on a 64 bit O/S.
I've enclosed a copy of my private key - but as I've got rid of gnupg2 the error message
"Key 0xAAD8C47D not found or not valid. The (sub-)key might of expired" has vanished. The
only error message am stuck with is "bad passphrase" and no ability to sign or encrypt
emails or files or anything else.
So am going to install a copy of Thunderbird at least 4 years older than the current version
with an appropriate Enigmail. As stated and as aa fact of daily life there are problems
running a Linux distro in x86_64 there are problems with gnupg2 there are problems with
Thunderbird and there are problems with Enigmail.

# An options file can contain any long options which are available in
# GnuPG. If the first non white space character of a line is a '

# In the example, this option allows you to read your local copy of

 some-key-id
# By default GnuPG creates version 4 signatures for data files as
# specified by OpenPGP.  Some earlier (PGP 6, PGP 7) versions of PGP
# require the older version 3 signatures.  Setting this option forces
# GnuPG to create version 3 signatures.
# Because some mailers change lines starting with "From " to ">From "
# it is good to handle such lines in a special way when creating
# cleartext signatures; all other PGP versions do it this way too.
# If you do not use the Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) charset, you should tell
# GnuPG which is the native character set.  Please check the man page
# for supported character sets.  This character set is only used for
# metadata and not for the actual message which does not undergo any

# Group names may be defined like this:
#   group mynames = paige 0x12345678 joe patti
# Any time "mynames" is a recipient (-r or --recipient), it will be
# expanded to the names "paige", "joe", and "patti", and the key ID
# "0x12345678".  Note there is only one level of expansion - you
# cannot make an group that points to another group.  Note also that
# if there are spaces in the recipient name, this will appear as two
# recipients.  In these cases it is better to use the key ID.
 mynames = paige 0x12345678 joe patti
# Lock the file only once for the lifetime of a process.  If you do
# not define this, the lock will be obtained and released every time
# it is needed, which is usually preferable.
# GnuPG can send and receive keys to and from a keyserver.  These
# servers can be HKP, email, or LDAP (if GnuPG is built with LDAP
# support).
# Example HKP keyserver:
#      hkp://keys.gnupg.net
#      hkp://subkeys.pgp.net
# Example email keyserver:
#      mailto:pgp-public-keys at keys.pgp.net
# Example LDAP keyservers:
#      ldap://keyserver.pgp.com
# Regular URL syntax applies, and you can set an alternate port
# through the usual method:
#      hkp://keyserver.example.net:22742
# Most users just set the name and type of their preferred keyserver.
# Note that most servers (with the notable exception of
# ldap://keyserver.pgp.com) synchronize changes with each other.  Note
# also that a single server name may actually point to multiple
# servers via DNS round-robin.  hkp://keys.gnupg.net is an example of
# such a "server", which spreads the load over a number of physical
# servers.  To see the IP address of the server actually used, you may use
# the "--keyserver-options debug".
keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net

# Common options for keyserver functions:
# include-disabled : when searching, include keys marked as "disabled"
#                    on the keyserver (not all keyservers support this).
# no-include-revoked : when searching, do not include keys marked as

# verbose : show more information as the keys are fetched.

#           of information shown.
# use-temp-files : use temporary files instead of a pipe to talk to the
#                  keyserver.  Some platforms (Win32 for one) always
#                  have this on.
# keep-temp-files : do not delete temporary files after using them
#                   (really only useful for debugging)
# http-proxy="proxy" : set the proxy to use for HTTP and HKP keyservers.
#                      This overrides the "http_proxy" environment variable,
#                      if any.
# auto-key-retrieve : automatically fetch keys as needed from the keyserver
#                     when verifying signatures or when importing keys that
#                     have been revoked by a revocation key that is not
#                     present on the keyring.

#                         when sending keys to the keyserver.

# Display photo user IDs in key listings
# list-options show-photos
# Display photo user IDs when a signature from a key with a photo is
# verified
# verify-options show-photos
# Use this program to display photo user IDs
# %i is expanded to a temporary file that contains the photo.
# %I is the same as %i, but the file isn't deleted afterwards by GnuPG.
# %k is expanded to the key ID of the key.
# %K is expanded to the long OpenPGP key ID of the key.
# %t is expanded to the extension of the image (e.g. "jpg").
# %T is expanded to the MIME type of the image (e.g. "image/jpeg").
# %f is expanded to the fingerprint of the key.
# %% is %, of course.
# If %i or %I are not present, then the photo is supplied to the
# viewer on standard input.  If your platform supports it, standard
# input is the best way to do this as it avoids the time and effort in
# generating and then cleaning up a secure temp file.
# If no photo-viewer is provided, GnuPG will look for xloadimage, eog,
# or display (ImageMagick).  On Mac OS X and Windows, the default is
# to use your regular JPEG image viewer.
# Some other viewers:
# photo-viewer "qiv %i"
# photo-viewer "ee %i"
# This one saves a copy of the photo ID in your home directory:
# photo-viewer "cat > ~/photoid-for-key-%k.%t"
# Use your MIME handler to view photos:
# photo-viewer "metamail -q -d -b -c %T -s 'KeyID 0x%k' -f GnuPG"
# Passphrase agent
# We support the old experimental passphrase agent protocol as well as
# the new Assuan based one (currently available in the "newpg" package
# at ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/alpha/aegypten/).  To make use of the agent,
# you have to run an agent as daemon and use the option
# For Ubuntu we now use-agent by default to support more automatic
# use of GPG and S/MIME encryption by GUI programs.  Depending on the
# program, users may still have to manually decide to install gnupg-agent.
# which tries to use the agent but will fallback to the regular mode
# if there is a problem connecting to the agent.  The normal way to
# locate the agent is by looking at the environment variable
# GPG_AGENT_INFO which should have been set during gpg-agent startup.
# In certain situations the use of this variable is not possible, thus
# the option
# --gpg-agent-info=::1
# may be used to override it.
# Automatic key location
# GnuPG can automatically locate and retrieve keys as needed using the
# auto-key-locate option.  This happens when encrypting to an email
# address (in the "user at example.com" form), and there are no
# user at example.com keys on the local keyring.  This option takes the
# following arguments, in the order they are to be tried:
# cert = locate a key using DNS CERT, as specified in RFC-4398.
#        GnuPG can handle both the PGP (key) and IPGP (URL + fingerprint)
#        CERT methods.
# pka = locate a key using DNS PKA.
# ldap = locate a key using the PGP Universal method of checking
#        "ldap://keys.(thedomain)".  For example, encrypting to
#        user at example.com will check ldap://keys.example.com.
# keyserver = locate a key using whatever keyserver is defined using
#             the keyserver option.
# You may also list arbitrary keyservers here by URL.
# Try CERT, then PKA, then LDAP, then hkp://subkeys.net:
 cert pka ldap hkp://subkeys.pgp.net

I had the same problem with Fedora-16 64 bit. All these people who keep saying they have had
no problems do not make any contributions at all. I don't care if your system works - mine
does not. The question is why on a Ubuntu LXDE 32 bit laptop my keys work - and on a Ubuntu
LXDE 64 bit laptop I can not sign I can not encrypt? My private key was created and signed
on a 32 bit Linux system - which fails to do anything on a 64 bit system. And when I don't
install gpg2 I only now get one problem "bad passphrase." These are real "facts of life"

fails too.
My only option is to install a 32 bit Linux O/S and a 64 bit laptop. Or wipe the partition
and give it all to Windoz.
Thank you for putting up with my ravings and my frustrations and I thank the very very small
band of people that offered practical help. All I do know is:
(1) When I remove gnupg2 from Enigmail all but one problem goes away.
(2) Then up stuck with "bad passphrase" without even entering the passphrase.
(3) 32 bit Linux works fine for me
(4) 64 bit Linux does not work for me.

    Free Software Foundation statement on the GNU Bash "shellshock" vulnerability
A major security vulnerability has been discovered in the free software shell GNU Bash. The
most serious issues have already been fixed, and a complete fix is well underway. GNU/Linux
distributions are working quickly to release updated packages for their users. All Bash
users should upgrade immediately, and audit the list of remote network services running on
their systems.
Bash is the GNU Project's  shell; it is part of the suite of software
that makes up the GNU operating system. The GNU programs plus the kernel Linux form a
commonly used complete free software  operating
system, called GNU/Linux. The bug, which is being referred to as "shellshock," can allow, in
some circumstances, attackers to remotely access and control systems using Bash (and
programs that call Bash) as an attack vector, regardless of what kernel they are running.
The bug probably affects many GNU/Linux users, along with those using Bash on proprietary
operating systems like Apple's OS X and Microsoft Windows. Additional technical details
about the issue can be found at CVE-2014-6271
 and CVE-2014-7169
GNU Bash  has been widely adopted because it is a free
(as in freedom), reliable, and featureful shell. This popularity means the serious bug that
was published yesterday is just as widespread. Fortunately, GNU Bash's license, the GNU
General Public License version 3 , has facilitated a rapid
response. It allowed Red Hat
to develop and share patches in conjunction with Bash upstream developers efforts to fix the
bug, which anyone can download and apply themselves. Everyone using Bash has the freedom to
download, inspect, and modify the code -- unlike with Microsoft, Apple, or other proprietary
Software freedom is a precondition for secure computing; it guarantees everyone the ability
to examine the code to detect vulnerabilities, and to create new and safe versions if a
vulnerability is discovered. Your software freedom does not guarantee bug-free code, and
neither does proprietary software: bugs happen no matter how the software is licensed. But
when a bug is discovered in free software, everyone has the permission, rights, and source
code to expose and fix the problem. That fix can then be immediately freely distributed to
everyone who needs it. Thus, these freedoms  are
crucial for ethical, secure computing.
Proprietary, (aka nonfree) software relies on an unjust development model that denies users
the basic freedom to control their computers. When software's code is kept hidden, it is
vulnerable not only to bugs that go undetected, but to the easier deliberate addition and
maintenance of malicious features . Companies can
use the obscurity of their code to hide serious problems, and it has been documented that
Microsoft provides intelligence agencies with information about security vulnerabilities
before fixing them
Free software cannot guarantee your security, and in certain situations may appear less
secure on specific vectors than some proprietary programs. As was widely agreed in the
aftermath of the OpenSSL "Heartbleed" bug, the solution is not to trade one security bug for
the very deep insecurity inherently created by proprietary software -- the solution is to
put energy and resources into auditing and improving free programs.
Development of Bash, and GNU in general, is almost exclusively a volunteer effort, and you
can contribute . We are reviewing Bash development, to
see if increased funding can help prevent future problems. If you or your organization use
Bash and are potentially interested in supporting its development, please contact us
The patches to fix this issue can be obtained directly at       Media Contacts

Hi Dark Penguin,
The first thing to say is - when installing any Linux distro you need to ensure that the
distro has installed every software update every security fix first. This is important when
installing GPA Kleopatra and KGPG.
Every Linux distro has gnupg installed - so at a terminal just type gpg - this will create
ALL the folders and files needed (.gnupg) it's pointless installing GPA without running gpg
first - I think it's pretty silly.
Then you may wish to install gpgv2 via the package manager. Only then install GPA Kleopatra
or KGPG. And only after installing all the updates and security fixes.
Once you have done this you can use any of the packages to create a set of keys - GPA
Kleopatra or Kgpg.
There are no bugs in GPA - all these programmes expect to find a valid existing .gnupg

(2) I ran qrencode -o david.png david.asc
(3) Got david.png 291 bytes
(4) I ran your command zbarimg david.png > david.asc && sed "s/QR-Code:-/-/g" david.asc
(5) created david.asc 18 bytes
(6) All david.asc contained was "QR-Code:david.asc"
(7) Which was not the original text.
(8) zbarimg can display a png like any other but seems not capable of converting it back to
its original form. Am working on a solution

Hello Stefan,
Firstly the "<" did the trick - I used QtQr - to decode back and then to decrypt Kleopatra -
and it worked fine QtQR creates pngs but did not use this feature.
I've tried unsuccessfully to get people on FB to encrypt and have always promoted gnupg or
gpg4win but no one seems to take thier privacy very seriously :)

My experience has been from te early 80s I thought encrypted communications would grow to a
world wide phenomena - but I was a bit optimistic. Top security professional in my opinion
don't tell people to encrypt which is there best form of security.
It seems to me there are two or three types that use encryption
(1) those that actually need it
(2) computer nerds who think it's some holy grail
(3) ordinary people trying to get more ordinary people to see sense
I posted your little bit of advice to a Linux group on FB - the reaction was not as I
expected - condescending replies in the main - none of whom and the intelligence to see the
implications - I felt I was defending what was a good idea.
Today with increased surveillance from security forces reading everything we do you would
have thought that those involved in politics would at least use encryption - they have no
idea what one is talking about. Thirty odd years have past - and still 90 per cent of the
population who use computers and smart phones have no idea. Well 99.9 per cent :)
I seem to hanging on to a vital bit of technology - and every one I know is still throwing
flint spears at Hairy Mammoths :)
Rant over - I shall go back to silent observation :)

Keyservers should have strict rules on public keys - all to have a valid
email a validation email sent back - then confirmed and that public key
is then available. No identity available - simple - reject the key.
Users of gpg that want to create weird and wonderful keys need to keep
them on their own laptop or desktop - keyservers should be able to purge
off these keys then keyservers would be back to what was intended.

I have used gnupg for years and converted just a handful to encrypt
their emails - and it's beyond my comprehension why it is that normal
people do not encrypt their emails by default.
Over the years GUIs have come along and gpg4win - perhaps people are not
that concerned about GCHQ and the NSA reading all their emails - they
read everything else from all thier devices.
We know FaceBook Google etc.. hand over all data to the NSA and GCHQ and
their are rumours that SSL has been cracked - am sure it has as my
website and database were hacked and my host provider had 3 mail servers
hacked in a matter of 3 days - much to their shock.
I think for Windows users gpg4win attempts to provide a GUI that makes
installation easy - but only geeks use it :)
I try to promote user encryption on my website (it's down at this time)
but very very few people take their daily lives seriously.

My public key has only one confirmed signing - it had two - but really I

Every key server is at risk. It has been done once - and can be done
again - there is some very sophisticated malware out there. This is a
great shock and a wake up call to tighten security - on all key servers
- and to have a standardised platform - that takes money and developers.

I have had one key pair for over 20 years - for postmaster at gbenet.com
I decided to create another key pair last week for my website -
site-admin at gbenet.com
I set the settings to choose a key by email account select the key
manually. I then sent a encrypted and signed test message from
postmaster at gbenet.com to site-admin at gbenet.com
The email arrived and I could read it - I had no need to decrypt it
because it was signed and encrypted to postmaster at gbenet.com
I then decided to reply - it selected postmasters key but refused to
sign the email - I entered the passphrase three times  all by hand the
same result.
Puzzled by this - I decided to take the checkbox out of picking the
right key for the email accounts of postmaster at gbenet.com and
site-admin at gbenet.com
I decided to send just an encrypted email to postmaster at gbenet.com from
site-admin at gbenet.com "I can't find the key" even though I had selected
the  key - hmmmm.............. I tried then to just send a signed reeply
to postmater at gbenet.com not encrypted - the dialogue box popped up to
enter the passphrase for site-admin at gbenet.com - again it refused to
accept the passphrase for site-admin at gbenet.com
Oh and I created a new key pair for david at gbenet.com which are
completely useless. I  tried with all three keys - the only key to work
is my postmaster at gbenet.com which I've used in Thunderbird and Enigmail
for over 20 years.
And after each of these config changes in Enigmail and Thunderbird I
shut down Thunderbird deleted all the caches and rebooted my laptop.
The results were all consistent:
Enigmail will only work with ONE Key.
It does not recognise any other key than the first key that was created.
I'd like to use my david at gbenet.com key here - some ages ago complained
I was using postmaster at gbenet.com's key to sign emails. I thought it
woulld be a good idea to have a key for this email account. BUT I can
not use it - I can not sign emails.
You moan - but offer no solutions. I can think of only one possible
solution that will work delete site-admin's key pair - delete david's
key pair and go back to what Thunderbird and Enigmail are happy with one
key pair from postmaster at gbenet.com
To be frank your comments are just like a bad fart - then they go away.
You don't think perhaps can not think - your not too smart as to offer
any solution.

Hello Erich,

I then shut down Thunderbird re-started and carried out the following test:
Test One:
I sent an encrypted and signed email to site-admin from postmaster. I
received the email - it took 6 attempts to decrypt it.
I then decided to reply - so I sent an encrypted and signed email to
postmaster - I was unable to  sign as site-admin - after 9 attempts of
entering the passphrase - each time rejected by Enigmail. I was unable
to send a signed and encrypted email to postmaster.
Test Two:
I sent an encrypted and signed email to david - when selecting the right
public key there was always a tick in postmaster which I removed and
selected the right key to encrypt too. BUT Enigmail REFUSED to accept my
passphrase after 9 attempts.
Test Three:
I decided to send a signed and encrypted email to postmaster from David.
With the following results: For some strange reason Enigmail encrypted

Consider the fact that for 30 times Enigmail refused to accept the

I decided to send an encrypted email to Erich. When selecting his

Erich's public key
On sending I thought I was going to be asked for david's passphrase yet
again - but no - the email passed very quickly.
This begs the following questions:
(1) Why is postmaster always selcected as the default public key?
(2) Why is it on failing 30 times to accept david's passphrase why does
enigmail mysteriously remember it when it rejected 30 times?
