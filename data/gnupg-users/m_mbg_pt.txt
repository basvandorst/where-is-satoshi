@_subject: OpenPGP smartcard reader 
I recently contributed to the FSFE and received an OpenPGP smartcard.
I ordered an Omnikey 3121 USB card reader. I am facing some problems
when using this reader and card combination on a Ubuntu 14.04 machine.
Using GnuPG 1.4.15 as root it works fine. GnuPG 2 does not work at all.
As a regular user, I have the gpg-agent running to authenticate to SSH
hosts and the card can't be read. As soon as I kill gpg-agent, gpg
works fine.
Any clues?
Or, what is the most compatible card reader available to read OpenPGP
smartcards using GnuPG 1 and 2?
Thanks in advance!

@_subject: Smartcard reader disconnects 
I am using a USB Shell Token v2 that I bought from KernelConcepts with
a OpenPGP 2.1 smartcard.
Sometimes, after doing an operation, the smartcard reader apparently
disconnects and I can only get it to work if I disconnect and
reconnect it.
When it gets disconnected, if I try to access it, I get the following
$ gpg --card-status
gpg: selecting openpgp failed: ec=6.108
gpg: OpenPGP card not available: general error
By the way, I am using Ubuntu 14.04 and everything works except for this.
Does anyone have any idea?
