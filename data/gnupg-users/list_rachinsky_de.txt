@_subject: unusable public key 
I want  to automatically encrypt and sign a backupfile before it is
transferred to another less trusted machine.
I need an passwordless key for this.
The key is there:
root /tmp# gpg --list-secret-keys
pub  1024D/4D347F13 2001-09-13 pc4_backup_sign
Signing works:
root /tmp# gpg -v -s tes
gpg: writing to `tes.gpg'
gpg: DSA signature from: 4D347F13 pc4_backup_sign
But I can't encrypt:
root /tmp# gpg -v -r 4D347F13 -e tes
gpg: 4D347F13: skipped: unusable public key
gpg: tes: encryption failed: unusable public key
I'm using:
root /tmp# gpg --version
gpg (GnuPG) 1.0.6

@_subject: stripping header-information 
White noise is a statistical profile, I think most unencrypted (and
uncompressed) data is not looking like white noise.
I don't think, this will buy you anything if used over TCP/IP without
additional measures, like sending white noise all the time (you don't
pay for traffic, do you?). Otherwise an eavesdropper could recognise
an encrypted transmission.

@_subject: Strange trust problem 
* On Fri, Feb 01, 2002 at 07:43:14PM -0800,
I had a similar problem. I discovered an option to gnupg which showed
me an error in my trustdb. Try "gpg --check-trustdb", perhaps your
trustdb is broken. I solved the problem with deleting my trustdb and
making a new one. This was ok to me, because I have only about three
keys I trust (at the moment). Perhaps exporting, deleting and
re-importing the trustdb could help, but I don't know. There seems to
be another (in the manpage) undocumented option "--fix-trustdb" but I
don't know its purpose.
Hope this helps

You need some compiler to compile the compiler. You have to look
for some binary (pre-compiled version of gcc or another C-compiler),
perhaps you can install one supplied from your OS vendor.

@_subject: Exporting non-exportable signatures 
does anybody know, how to export nonexportable signatures? I have an
old keyring and want to move some keys to the one I acutally use. Some
keys are signed nonexportable, but I don't want to have to sign them
again, after exporting and importing into the new keyring.
I haven't found a solution for this with google or in the manpage.
Please CC me, I'm currently not subscribed.

I think I expressed myself badly before. I have multiple keyrings for
different keys, and some keys should move from one to another (from
private to job, for example). Because sometimes I use only the job keyring.
Actually I don't really know, why I talked about an old keyring
before, it's not old, it's just not used at the momemt.

when I revoke a signature on an uid, gpg asks for the reason and a
Please select the reason for the revocation:
  0 = No reason specified
  4 = User ID is no longer valid
  Q = Cancel
(Probably you want to select 4 here)
Your decision? 4

can somebody tell me, what the difference between validity 'undef'
and validity 'unknown' is?
Like here:

uid       [ unknown] Werner Koch uid       [  undef ] Werner Koch

You have to add an keyid.
gpg --keyserver  --recv 12345678
Works fine here.

The option you would need for this would be named cert-keyserver-url.
But according to the manpage it does not exist.

What about different Levels (sig1..sig3) of signatures? If the first
one is sig3 and the second one sig1 and min-cert-level>1 there would
be a difference.
