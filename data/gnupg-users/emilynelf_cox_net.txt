@_subject: Total n00b asking for help 
I am trying to install GnuPG to use with Thunderbird 0.9.   I read the instructions at  but honestly, I am lost.  I am no coder, but am  intermediate "user". Basically, I know enough to know what I don't know.
Any help would be greatly appreciated, though I ask you don't assume I have too much of a clue.
I am most confused about what exactly I need to download as several files are mentioned at enigmail.mozdev.org.
I thank you in advance for your assistance.
