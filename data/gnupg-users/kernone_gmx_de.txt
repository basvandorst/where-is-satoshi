@_subject: Specifing Folders for Secret and Public Key 
I am running GnuPG on Windows XP using Thunderbird and Enigmail.
I want to tell GnuPG where it should search my secret-keyring and where
to search my public keyring.
I am thinking about having my secret-keyring on an usb-stick mounted on
let's say y:\, and my public keyring should be stored on my hard disk.
I think you can imagine what i wanna do. I just want to know a clean way
to do this. Just changing GnuPG's homedir isn't all i want - as far as i
understood it.
Thanks for any hints concerning this problem!

Thanx a lot, i think think thats just what i was searching for!
Where do i have to put that gpg.conf file (does it get created by gpg
when using the command line options and if so where?)
And what about the two other files random_seed and trusted.db - where
should i store them and how can i specify their path?
Thanx in advance,

Thanks alot for your help!
I am quite sure i get it done now - will test it now.
And i'll lookup the commands in the man page again.
Best regards,

Thanks again Mark!
I just tested it, and it's all working as i wanted!!
I did set up a Windows system-variable GNUPGHOME pointing to my
homedir, there i have my gpg.conf with the following lines :

What is the real advantage of a smartcard? I have stored my
secret-keyring on an usb-stick at the moment. How could i improve
security further more? I am just reading about encrypting the filesystem
  on the stick using 'truecrypt' - is that a good idea / nice solution?

What does these options really have to do with Enigmail's work? Does
this auto-key-retrieve have any effect on Enigmail?

I am using TrueCrypt now, i made a filebased encrypted filesystem on my
usb-stick, that gets mounted as partition and i am using that to store
my gpg secret-keyring.
It's all working very well, i am only a little concerned about the
protection against bruteforce attacks - as TC uses symmetrically
encryption. Is it possible to specify a min password length (maybe
entropie) from that on the password can be considered 'safe' against
I think i gotta read/think a little more about the whole security issue
around it.
