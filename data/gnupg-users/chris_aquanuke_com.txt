@_subject: Using GNUPG with php scripts and webserver 
Hi I cant get php scripts from Apache to execute GNUPG comands.
I figure its a USER problem.
If I run cmds or execute php scripts from the cmd line that works fine.
Im running Cpanel with PHP Version 5.2.0
Apache is running as nobody, and in /etc/passwd I have
I tried changing that to
so that I could su to nobody and do gpg --import KEY and set the trust but
even after that I still couldnt run any PHP scripts from the browser.
Anyone give me a step by step how to set up GNUPG with PHP in a browser.
