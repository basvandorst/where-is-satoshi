@_subject: can't connect to `C:/Program Files/GNU/GnuPG//S.gpg-agent' 
Because it doesn't export anything. A program cannot modify the
environment of its parent, so gpg-agent has to be executed like this:
? eval $(gpg-aget --daemon)
? echo $GPG_AGENT_INFO
The 'eval $(foo)' part is tells your shell (bash, zsh) to interpret
gpg-agent's output as commands; without it, all gpg-agent can do is
print them to stdout.

@_subject: gpg --verify detached signature from two file descriptors? 
BSDs have it with 'fdescfs'.
There is also the 'temp file' way - mkstemp() or /usr/bin/mktemp.
