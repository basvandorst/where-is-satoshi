@_subject: Lost passphrase 
a while ago I was experimenting with gpg and mutt, made some keys and
uploaded them. Then there was little time to play with it so I forgot
about it for a while and kept using my old mailer without the keys.
Now I just found the time again to set it all up like it should, and
realized that I wasn't cautious enough not to loose the passphrase.
Well, I know already, that it was stupid, so please don't make me feel
worse than I feel already, but I would appreciate if you could give me
some hints whats the best I could do now.
- i can't revoke it --> no passphrase :-(
- i still need the email adresses with the useless keys
- i definitely can't find the passphrase
My ideas were to make new keys using my name without the middlename, but
for the same email adresses, but I quess it will confuse people.
Thanks for feedback,

@_subject: Thanks to Sven and Peter (was: Re: Lost passphrase) 
i just created a new key, the revocation and tatood the passphrase on my left
toe :-=
Thanks for help, i figured that the situation looks bad, but hoped thare could
be done something. If it were, however, it would go at cost of security, so
it's all good.
Take care and watch out for your passphrases folks :-)

@_subject: gpg.conf missing 
i just created my .gnupg file --> gpg --gen-key
All is good, but the gpg.conf is missing. It's already the 2run, the first
created the file but it was empty.
Why, and how do I get this file to modify it?
