@_subject: Windows GnuPG implementation for the enterprise 
Hello all,
I was told this is where to announce a new way to implement GnuPG in a
Windows environment.
As the transmission of PII has been scrutinized, we along with many other
groups have had to require the encryption of all data in and out. As more
users and novice users join the encryption front, my staff and I had been
presented with the almost daunting task of user training and key
management, not to mention the potential proprietary solution costs. After
an extensive fruitless search, I decided to write a user friendly Windows
frontend designed around a specific GnuPG install, integrated with Windows
domain groups . I've dubbed it eGPG and released it to the world for free
at Thank you for your time and my thanks to the GnuPG team.
