@_subject: signing key selection - GNUPG Keychain Access 
I am using GNUPG Keychain Access on Mountain Lion
and am trying to sign keys.
The popup offers my available private keys in the dropdown only by the
email address/comment text,
but since I have several keys with the same email address, it is
impossible to tell which is which.
Should that not also show the keyID to make it possible to properly
identify which key is to be used?
Is there a preference setting for that?
