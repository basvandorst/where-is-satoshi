Hello fellow gnupg users,
I get this message when I run gnupg from cron as any user.
gnupg is run from a script to decrypt a file. The commandline used is:
echo "my secret passphrase" | gpg --passphrase-fd -d file-to-decrypt.gpg
This is on a redhat 5.1 system.
gnupg version is 0.9.4
When I run the script from the command line it works fine.
Has anyone experienced the same problem?
