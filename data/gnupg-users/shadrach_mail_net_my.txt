@_subject: export of gnupg by end-users 
Is there current information on requirements for downloading / possession / personal-use export of gnupg binaries/exe's?
Basicly, current crypto export law applicable to people in the US and in the EU who are either citizens or resident foreign nationals.
US EAR sections 740.13(e) and 740.17(g) make reference to commercial export of 'open source cryptographic software" but it is not clear what rules apply to possession/export of compiled programs by individual end users.
