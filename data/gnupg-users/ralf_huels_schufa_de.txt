Sorry, in my last post I confused ID0 with ID2. ID2 is signed with ID1, which is signed with ID4, so IMO ID2 should be considered valid (-/f). I really don´t see what´s wrong in your case. If I import a
friend´s key that is signed with my home key which is set to
f/f here at work, the trust of the friend´s key gets set to -/f automagically.

@_subject: Does GNUPG have the PGP ADK weakness? 
It seems to me that two aspects of the problem have been happily mixed
up by several authors. One is whether a given software uses the ADK feauture and encrypts to an The other is whether a key can be modified to contain an illicit ADK.
Ralf´s statement that GnuPG is vulnerable seems to be based on the fact that keys generated by GnuPG can be modified by an attacker to contain
an unwanted ADK. No user of GnuPG will have a problem with that as GnuPG
does not use the ADK feature at all (i.e. not even with authentic ADKs). However, if that key is subsequently used as an encryption key by someone using an unfixed PGP version, it will encrypt to the illicit ADK. In that sense, GnuPG-generated keys are vulnerable to the ADK bug even if GnuPG itself is not.

Which is exactly why Ralf disparages the use of v4 signatures all As far as I understand the debate, Ralf is talking about keys. Unfortunately, many others seem to talk about software.
The problem for users of any software that uses v4 signatures and
encrypts to ADKs was construed as a problem for users of any software
that uses v4 sigs. I can see why people say that not encrypting to illicit ADKs is the sender´s responsibility and thus GnuPG users are fine. However, the fact remains that "broken" PGP (or other s/w) versions are going to remain out there. I think it´s ok to point out that PGP (< 6.5.8) users are not safe from the bug when encrypting to GnuPG users. Of course there is really nothing we (i.e. the GnuPG users and developers)
can do about that except set the good example and spread the word.

Umm. Not exactly:
Ralf says that people who want to make sure should avoid v4 sigs. The
safest way to do that is to use software that only uses v3 sigs. In fact he recommends GnuPG as an analysis tool.
I do think, however, that Ralf´s criticism of the CERT advisory (as quoted in  suffers
from some of the same misunderstandings that have troubled the entire The way I understand the advisory, they perceive only the actual _use_ of illicit ADKs as the problem, while Ralf takes the mere fact that keys can be modified as the problem. For instance CERT calls keys that don´t
have ADKs when added to the key ring "not vulnerable" (presumbly because
they obviously don´t have an illicit ADK), while Ralf disagrees (because ADKs might be added later). I guess it all depends on whether you emphasize on the key itself or on the software that uses it. I think in that respect Ralf´s criticism is too harsh. If all software
products used only hashed parts of the key, there wouldn´t be a problem.

Best possible encryption for e-mails.
An alternative to classic PGP: why crypto-s/w GnuPG is better than
the competition
by Marcus Höfer.
 > Das populäre Verschlüsselungsprogramm Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) hat
PGP has new competition in gpg. Security experts around the world call
it one of the best encryption programs. There is also official support e.g. the grant from the german Ministry of Commerce.
This explains the insecurity of e-mail and the need for encryption.
It mentions PGP as the most popular tool and states that weaknesses
found in PGP have deterred many of its users.
This explains that PGP is used to encrypt and sign e-mail. The system used
provides a tremendous amount of possible keys. A number not breakable by
current standards. This states that while PGP is provided as source code, there are some secrets that the distributor wants to keep. The ADK system is mentioned. The text also mentions the rumours about the NSA being able to use a back door. "Thus, security experts have been warning us against indiscriminately
trusting PGP for quite some time."
GnuPG is deifferent. Free of cost and constantly improved by hobbyist
programmers. Due to the entire source code being available, there can be no back doors.
GnuPG was introduced by WK in 1999 for Unix and has since become
available for several platforms. Thanks, Gregor.  I thought the article was rather vague on some of the issues.
Not surprisingly, the general principles of public key encryption were
glossed over. You would expect that in that short a text.
But the ADK issue is adressed rather passingly, as compared to the
back door rumors.
The text was less than I would expect from a newspaper of "Die Welt"´s
standing. Still, good advertisement, I guess.
Again sorry for the previous post.

That is a point that has been bugging me for quite some time about
the public key infrastructure in general. If I´m not mistaken adding
a UID is usually not an issue, because you need the private key but there is nothing that prevents e.g. a spammer from getting a load
from the keyservers and signing every key with a key that has UIDs
that endorse some product or other.
Maybe this is a minor threat because PGP/GnuPG keys have little mass
market impact, but that is SbO, isn´t it? ;-)
On a more practical note I created an RSA key for compatibility
reasons only to have my first signator sign it with a DSA key.
Maybe it would hamper the entire concept of public key exchange too
much, but sometimes I think some protocol to ascertain the key owners consent before tampering with the key is possible would be desirable.

By creating a Key ;-) Seriously, the algorithm preferences are stored in the self-signature of a user ID (You can review them by running
gpg --list-packets on a public key file or using the pref command in
the --edit-key function). I don´t know, whether algrithm preferences
are possible at all with RSA keys/v3 sigs.
Currently the preferences 10/4/3 (Twofish, Blowfish, Cast5) are hard-wired into the GnuPG key creation process. You´d have to go source-diving to change them (g10/keygen.c, IIRC).
Apparently, editing functionality is on the wish list for version 1.1.

gpg --list-packets on a public key file or using the pref command in
the --edit-key function). I don´t know, whether algrithm preferences
are possible at all with RSA keys/v3 sigs.
Currently the preferences 10/4/3 (Twofish, Blowfish, Cast5) are hard-wired into the GnuPG key creation process. You´d have to go source-diving to change them (g10/keygen.c, IIRC).

 - signed: as above but with ASCII armor, not human-readable    but no encryption either.  - signed & encrypted: signed, encrypted with someone's public

I attended a key signing and checked a person's ID. The guy

that didn't have the fingerprint.
I of course had only checked the name fields in the UIDs against his ID and the question of a fingerprint didn't concern me during the meeting.
I chose not to sign this key even though it carries a signature of one of my trusted introducers, the holder of
the secret key could describe the location of the event in encrypted communication and soon after the event my own
key was signed with that key.
So, I met this person, am sufficiently convinced of his identity, he has claimed ownership of a well-signed key
and I still didn't sign it because he didn't list the
fingerprint in his claim of ownership.

AFAIK, no.
No. The passphrase isn't even used in the encryption of actual data.
Your plaintext is encrypted with a random key (which is only used once) using a symmetric algorithm such as AES. That random session key is encrypted with the asymmetric algorithm using the recipient's
public key and then decrypted with the corresponding secret key. The passphrase is only used to encrypt the secret key while not in use.
So a successful plain text attack on the message would only reveal
the session key. Theoretically, I suppose, that session key would
then constitute a known plaintext for the asymmetric cypher, but I don't think such an attack is feasible.

Weeell. I picked the wrong field, anyway. The command I sent you lists
all keys that have full trust. That was not what I meant.
The field that I should have picked was $2, which lists the validity
of the key. This is still not what you want, but yields something
similar in some cases ;-)
What I meant was this:
gpg --list-keys --with-colons|awk -F\: '{print $1 " " $5 " t" $2}' \
This lists all valid keys, which is what you want, if you're interested
in keys that are signed by your ultimatly trusted keys and you have no
trusted introducers.
For a precise answer to your question I'd recommend a perl script.
Hm. I don't know, really. GnuPG is about cryptography, no about key ring

Make a detached Signature and ship it together with the image.
`gpg --detach yourimage.jpg` (optionally with -a) will produce a signature
file yourimage.jpg.gpg or yourimage.jpg.asc, that you can later use to
verify the image.
The signature won't be an integral part of the image, you will have to ship
two files and this won't work without the recipient noticing.
I don't know if there is a possibility of putting a signature in an image
file. I guess there would be some recursion trouble (putting the
code inside the data that is to be verified) unless you have an image format
that allows for comment fields.
I usually sign a list with message digests of several images and send the signature through  in case I might
have to prove authorship. I don't know, if such a proof would hold water
in a german (or any other) court, but it's better than nothing.

Also, if you use Cygwin, you can install the man page to be displayed
properly with a "man gpg" command...

@_subject: AW: 1024 bit encryption compromised? 
Hm. Up to now I had only read opinions that stated that Bernstein's result was still rather theoretical.
Neither am I.
I guess it all depends on who you want to hide your stuff from. If you need
to keep stuff from Governments or billion Dollar corporations, you better be
paranoid. If you just want to keep stuff from your small provider's admin
I'd guess that 1024 bit RSA still goes a long way.
Personally I use GnuPG for "political" reasons rather than for a true need
for cryptography. I assume that by using and promoting GnuPG, building a
web of trust and so forth (besides the fact that it's fun ;-), I might weaken the position of crypto opponents, who might argue that only
criminals use crypto anyway.
If I were to create a new key now, I would make it 2048 bits. Since I
have two fairly well signed 1024 bit keys (Ranking 1722 and 2003 in the
dtype.org statistic ;-), I'll stick with those as long as there are no
further advances in cryptanalysis.

@_subject: AW: Cygwin and 1.0.7 
Weird linewrapping in the makefile, as far as I could tell. Everything
worked fine when I called make again in the individual subdirs.
Same behaviour here. That works fine here. Maybe it depends on the data in the keyring...
Also, doing "make check", the seat test failed. AFAICT due to CR/LF

I work for a credit bureau. You better believe there's lot's of stuff that
we can't send by e-mail. You'd be surprised how many customers expect us to send consumer data via mail without giving thought to
encryption. We don't, of course. After all we're talking about credit profiles and stuff like that here.  I shudder at the thought of how little even some people who professionally handle sensitive data are aware of e-mail security issues.

Weeeelll... ;-)=20
The cryptogram is encrypted with Edward Grahams public key.
You need his secret key to decrypt. Unless he's a person you
made up for testing purposes, you probably have only his=20
public key.=20
If you want to decrypt stuff you encrypted for other people=20
you have to specify _both_ your own and the other guy's key ID
in the encryption phase.

@_subject: AW: Importing SMIME and PGP7 into GPG 
S/MIME is not currently supported. For some information on the differences, see for example
You can usually verify a PGP signature with GnuPG, however
the key itself is usually *not* included in the message.
You'll have to process the signature, get the key ID from
the output and retrieve the key from a public key server.
You can configure GnuPG so that it automagically retrieves
unknown keys, though I don't know the relevant options right
If the key is not present on your favorite key server, you'll have to ask your correspondent to send his public key to you in a separate message (or get it from his home page, maybe).

I don't know about confirmations, but at this moment, you are
listed: You'll get used to it ;-)
I don't see what being in Germany should have to do with this.
I've never met a serious OpenPGP user who was unwilling to sign my
key. Too lazy to, maybe, but never actively opposed to it.
AFAICS, you have not even tried to contact all the Biglumber listings
for your home town ;-)

@_subject: AW: Import of GnuPG KeyPair to PGP 
The problem used to be that PGP encrypts the secret key with a different algorithm. I assume that this is still the case with
PGP 8.0. if so,  FAQ 5.9 is of interest:

@_subject: User Ids without email address 
I have a UID on my keys that contains only my name, date and
place of birth:
uid  Ralf Huels (born 1967-06-21 in Muelheim/Ruhr, Germany)
As you probably know, this (together with the name at birth=20
where appropriate) is considered to uniquely identify a person=20
according to german census and is easily verified with most=20
pieces of official german ID.
I don't see any. When signing a UID like that you should check
carefully for a self-signature, I guess. There's no other way=20
to check whether the person described by the UID has control
over the secret key as you can't send a challenge.
