Does it mean that you think it's not a very good idea to use iButtons to store
the secret keys?  What's the point of storing *a part* of the passphrase?

No, I do not take into account crypto iButtons... :)
(I have quoted all of your message)
If you do not mind, I'd like to clarify [to myself] few things.
If you just have a pair of keys, then according to the known practices it is
recommended to generate a revokation certificate as soon as you generate a key
pair, correct?  So if you loose your iButton, you just issue (send our,
whatever :) you revokation certificate, and everything is fine, right?  So
I do not see too big problem with loosing the iButton itself.
But if I choose to use my iButton for passphrase only, that means that I have
to use many keys should I work (in general sense) in many places, which does
not seem to be very good for me.  What do you think?
Besides, I believe the current implementation of gnupg does not allow to
use something like
    gpg --secret-keyring=extension:/some/path/or/similar ...
Are you planning to add support for things like this?

What made you think so? :)  No, what I am talking about is just storing the
secret key in iButton's memory using standard procedure (should user choose
to put no password, this will be unencrypted).
