I'm having a problem with inter-operating PGP 6.5.3 and GNUPG on Windows. I got to export my public and private keys from GNUPG to PGP without problems - and I can use it to encrypt/decrypt with PGP, but everytime I try decrypt with PGP a message encrypted with GNUPG I get a "bad packet" error. Did anyone got this problem and found a solution ?

Well my goal was not so much to use PGP but to provide a GUI to decode GnuPG messages under Windows. So far GPA is Unix only, and GnuPG for Windows is command-line only. I did a little app with Delphi to help my users, but they still have to type their password under a command line every time they need to decode something, which is not good when you do that 100 times a day :(
I know GnuPG has a way to automate decoding with the option passphrase-fd but that seems to be only for Unix. So far I quite don't see how to automate under Windows (but if someone knows, I'd be cool because making a win32 GUI for GnuPG would be really easy and quick with Delphi !)

Well in fact I had already started designing a neat Windows frontend for gnupg, with all the bells'n whitles (Win98 style toolbars, etc...). Then I found out that the current version of GnuPG for Windows has absolutely NO way of getting the secret key password from another program. This means that, no matter what, when decrypting something, the front-end had to let GnuPG open a shell window and have the user type in his password there... since I don't know much C, I can't do anything else than wait that this is fixed. The gnome front-end is possible because the password passing feature exists and works on the Unix version of GnuPG. I quite don't understand why there's no "secret-password-is" option for GnuPG that lets someone pass the password directly, it is not less secure than having someone type it Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at

I've been following GPA from time to time, but it's not ready yet for prime time and I'm not very good at C (and there's no binary snapshot either), so I decided to code my own GUI in Delphi instead (which is a matter of minutes once the GnuPG interfacing code is done).
Well I tried to do just that but didn't manage to get it right. I'm pretty sure my password pipe is fine (I can read back what I put in it), yet GnuPG doesn't seem to care. I get the message "Reading passphrase from file descriptor xx" but then get the error :
gpg: public key decryption failed: bad passphrase
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
I'm sure my passphrase is right of course :) . So either I forgot some "magic something" somewhere, or there's something broken in gnupg-1.0.2 for win32. I looked at the GPA code and doesn't seem to do anything more than I Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at

Well I send a pure \n at the end, that still doesn't do anything. It seems that gnupg doesn't even reads the pipe content since after calling it I can still read back the password in the pipe in my program...
