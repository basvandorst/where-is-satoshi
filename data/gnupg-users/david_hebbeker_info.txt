@_subject: are angle brackets around email address allowed for auto-key-locate? 
The manual [1] says that GnuPG can automatically retrieve keys for
emails in the "user at example.com" form. Does this exclude emails wrapped
by angle brackets like ""?
I need to ask as I have an interoperability issue with?Gnome Evolution.
Evolution specifies the email with angle brackets when encrypting.

Hi Werner and everyone,
thank you for your response, I was hoping that this would be possible. On the other hand, I have experienced a behavior I could only explain
with auto-key-locate being restricted to the pure form. Maybe you can
enlighten me on this case.
I demonstrate this behavior on a system which uses the attached
configuration file gpg.conf. I tested this with GnuPG 2.1.18 and
2.2.12. rm msg.*
echo "hello world" > msg.txt
gpg --batch --yes --delete-keys edward-en at fsf.org
Bad Case (does not work)
gpg --always-trust -e -r "" msg.txt
Good Case (works)
gpg --always-trust -e -r "edward-en at fsf.org" msg.txt
missing keys
Note: The only difference is the missing angle brackets.
Can you please explain the difference? That would be of great help!

I still have the problem described in my previous e-mail. Can it be
that this is faulty behavior of the GnuPG?
I would create a bug report at [1] so it does not get lost. Does
something speak against it?
