As Lionel mentioned, always encrypting to yourself is one way to do this.
That's certainly a good idea.
You said you were using mutt as your MUA.  Then you can also use a feature
of mutt to save your sent messages in the clear.  This assumes that you feel
your local machine is reasonably secure (or that you use some other method
of data protection -- like storing your mail folder on an encrypted disk
partition).  Anyway, to have mutt save your sent messages in clear text, add
this to your .muttrc file:

@_subject: Signing with more than one secret key available 
Hash: SHA1
IMHO, this is something that should be handled by your mail program.
When I used Eudora with the NAI PGP plugin, there was a drop down where you
could select the private key you wanted to use to sign the message.
I now use Mutt where you can use the 'pgp_sign_as' setting to specify which
key to use for signing.  This can be changed using a 'send-hook' for
different recipients.
I haven't used Enigmail/Mozilla for anything other than simple testing so I
don't know if there is any way to do something similar with it (I assume
there isn't or you probably wouldn't be asking :).  If not, perhaps it's a
feature request you might make to the enigmail developers.
That's your call.  It's definitely more work to keep things straight, so I'd
only do this if I had some very good reason to do so.  It's probably best to
only use different keypairs for different _groups_ of recipients, instead of
for each _individual_ recipient.  You might have a work key and a personal
key, for instance.

@_subject: Key e-mail address 
Hash: SHA1
You can use a pgp-hook to do this in mutt.  From the Mutt manual:
  Usage: pgp-hook pattern keyid
  When encrypting messages with PGP, you may want to associate a certain
  PGP key with a given e-mail address automatically, either because the
  recipient's public key can't be deduced from the destination address,
  or because, for some reasons, you need to override the key Mutt would
  normally use. The pgp-hook command provides a method by which you can
  specify the ID of the public key to be used when encrypting messages
  to a certain recipient.
If you end up using this, you might also be interested in a patch from Dale
Woolridge that helps make the use of pgp-hooks easier.  See

How did you install these versions?  If you're using a stock Mandrake

If you installed 1.2.1 from source, it defaults to /usr/local/bin/gpg for
the binary, and /usr/local/bin is probably in your path after /usr/bin.
This would cause a call to gpg to find the old version first.
Try uninstalling the gnupg rpm, if the above matches what you've done to

The Fine Manual says this about the export command:
    --export [names]
              Either export all keys from all keyrings (default keyrings and
              those registered  via option --keyring), or if at least one
              name is given, those of the given name. The new keyring is
              written to stdout or to the file given with option "output".
              Use together with --armor to mail those keys.
So if you're trying to export all the keys on your public keyring, just
leave off the pubring.gpg part of the command.  Otherwise, gpg is trying to
find a key that matches pubring.gpg.  See the section "How to specify a user
ID" in the gpg man page for details on how to specify [names] as in the
export command.

@_subject: querying multiple keyservers 
Hash: SHA1
Hi all,
Is there any way to use multiple keyservers with gnupg?  What I'm after is
having gpg search one keyserver first and if there are no matches (or
perhaps even if there are) then search another keyserver.  I know that most
of the public keyservers sync, but I'm looking at using a small,
semi-private keyserver for a local linux user group as the first keyserver
and then fall back on one of the public servers.
The reason we're looking at setting up a small keyserver is that many of the
new users will hopefully find it easier to rely on a keyserver that other
members control.  That way we can purge keys if someone loses a key or
forgets a passphrase.  But for those of us in the group who use gpg more
regularly, we'd prefer not to have to switch our config settings to go back
and forth between the public and private keyservers.
I tried setting keyserver twice but it seems like only one of them gets used
(and at this god-awful hour of the morning I can't recall if it was the
first or the last).
I know that we could also just maintain a group keyring, but I was looking
to have some fun learning about running pks.

@_subject: key expiry 
Hash: SHA1
I think this may be keyserver related.  I imported a copy of my key from a
keyserver into another account's keyring and verified a message.  I got the
expired key warning.  Then I deleted the key and imported it from the file I
have on my website and it verified without any warning.
Any ideas on ways to make this work within the existing keyserver
infrastructure would be welcomed, but this is another reason I dislike using
the keyservers.  They are simply broken in too many ways to be all that
useful. :(
The canonical source for my key is at the URL in my .sig and in the
X-Request-PGP header.  If you use the key from that location and still get
errors in GnuPG or PGP, I'd like to know about it.  I think GnuPG will
handle it fine.  I'm not as sure that PGP will, because of the expired
self-sig on the photo id, but I don't have a copy of PGP handy to test with
and I'm too lazy to download it and fire up a windows VM to test it.  If it
doesn't work with PGP and there's a good way to fix this from my end, I'm
all ears.
One other thing I just noticed is an old user id on the key that's on the
servers but was one I removed from my key, long before there was a revuid
command in gpg and before I knew about revoking the self sig.  That uid
still has the expiration date set and may well be causing problems.  I
suppose I can import that and then revuid it and upload that to the
keyservers to see if that helps.
And I thought I'd squared all of this away a while ago... :)

@_subject: key expiry (was: Re: PGP8) 
Hash: SHA1
Yeah, I *thought* I had. :)
It looks like there's an expired sig still on the photoid.  Before I go
deleting or revoking that expired sig, perhaps someone in the know can
explain why this would make the key show as expired and what the best way
top remove this is?  I had originally created the key with a 5 year
expiration but then I changed my mind and set it to not expire.  I used gpg
to make these modifications to the key, just FYI.
I'm using gpg 1.2.3rc2 and had been using 1.2.2 and 1.2.1 previous to that
and both allowed me to use the key fine and verify my own sigs.  Perhaps
this is because I also have the secret key though.  I do recall testing it
on another machine without the secret key and gpg 1.2.{1,2} and I got no
warning about the key being expired.
Here's the output of list-sigs (trimmed a bit):
pub  1024D/D654075A 1997-12-07 Todd sig 3       D654075A 2003-01-27   Todd uid                            [jpeg image of size 3296]
sig 3       D654075A 2003-01-27   Todd sig         D654075A 2002-06-05   Todd It's that last sig on the photoid packet that's expired.  I can see this
using list-packets.  BTW, is there a command that will show this without
having to work on an exported key file?

Right, I didn't think it would, but I wasn't sure where else the expiration
was coming from.
I caught on to that after Eugene posted and made me take another look at
what's out there on the keyservers.  I had just deleted those uid's from my
key a while back before the revuid command was available and before I knew
that it was better to revsig them at least.  Hell, I might have done this
before I was even using gpg, I don't know.

That's the "certificate check level" as the man page calls it.  See the
description of --default-cert-check-level for what the numbers are suggested
to represent.
Really?  In gpg or pgp?  And had you previously imported the key from a
keyserver?  As I figured out (slowly) and David just pointed out as well,
the expiration was from an old uid that was present on the keyserver but not
in the .asc file I've been distributing.  If you see any uid's that have the
address free??! then you have some cruft from the keyservers
that's causing the key to show as expired.
I've now revoked those uid's and uploaded the key to these keyservers:
    ldap://keyserver.pgp.com
    x-hkp://wwwkeys.pgp.net
    ldap://pgp.surfnet.nl:11370
Hopefully, that will propagate reasonably.  If not, I'll send it to other
keyservers if and when I feel like spending more time futzing with the
keyservers. :)

What registration were you subjected to?  I downloaded a copy of the PGP
code for windows today and the only thing I had to do was check a box
agreeing to the license, which, while it isn't GPL or even OSI compatible,
wasn't totally ridiculous.
That would certainly be true, but I don't think it is.  One nasty clause in
the license does make it sound like building your own binary of PGP for
daily use would be outside the scope of the license (Section 2e).  It says
that any use other than to verify that there are no holes or bugs is not
acceptable, but how broadly one defines that is probably a matter of
No disagreement that free software is to be preferred.  But since PGP has
been saddled with so much rumor and misinformation from its inception, I
think it's worth making sure that the complaints against it be legitimate.
I would rather have readily available encryption that isn't free software
than no encryption at all.  Fortunately, I don't have to make that choice,
thanks to David, Stefan, Timo, Werner, and everyone else contributing to the

I had this same error when I built 1.2.1 on a redhat box, using the same

keyservers/Makefile added gnupg onto the end of the whatever was passed in
as libexecdir.  So when the rpm specfile passed in /usr/lib/gnupg as
libexecdir, the keyserver makefile was making that /usr/lib/gnupg/gnupg.  I
found this out by running strings on the gpg binary.
Try this as a test, cd to /usr/lib/gnupg and symlink gnugp to . and see if
that helps.  If so, you've got the same problem.
I tried asking about this on the redhat phoebe list (since the phoebe rpm

ldap lookups) but I didn't get any replies.  I've been meaning to ask here

I noticed in looking at the makefiles that there is a GNUPG_LIBEXECDIR as

One thing that puzzles me is that if I use the RPM macros %configure and

in /usr/libexec/gnupg.  Again, this might just be bad behavior by the rpm
macros, but gnupg seems to behave differently from many other apps in this
The configure macro is essentially:
    ./configure --prefix=/usr ... --libexecdir=/usr/libexec
This causes no problems as far as I can see, the Makefiles look good.  It's
the %makeinstall macro that makes life weird.
The makeinstall macro essentially does this:
    make prefix=$RPM_BUILD_ROOT/usr ... libexecdir=$RPM_BUILD_ROOT/usr/libexec
I believe Red Hat uses this because so many packages seem to ignore DESTDIR
(unlike the well behaved gnupg package :).  But shouldn't using this syntax
for make still work?  It ends up putting the keyserver helpers into
$RPM_BUILD_ROOT/usr/libexec and the rpm build fails unless you move them to
the gnupg dir in the specfile (or use the more appropriate DESTDIR in make
install).  Most other packages I've created or built with rpm don't do this
sort of thing so it's unexpected behavior in that respect.
I don't know my way around Makefiles very well so I may be completely
misunderstanding things.  I ask mostly to satisfy my own curiosity at this
point, I've already built my own gnupg-1.2.1 packages.

Hash: SHA1
Here's an old tutorial that covers the basics:
    I think the important thing to keep in mind is that the web server normally
runs as a different user (and has different privileges) than you do when
logged in via ssh.  There are various ways to deal with this.  Some web
hosts set things up so that your scripts run under your userid.  For those
that don't do this, the --homedir option is one to look at.  You can see
what user the server is running as in the phpinfo() output.
If your web server is running as a user other than your ssh login, then you
need to make sure that this user can access the keyrings where you imported
your keys.  Not doing this is what burns most people trying to setup a gpg
encrypted web form.  The result is that it "works fine from the command line
but fails when run from the web page."
You might also want to search the archives for this list.  The question
comes up fairly often.  There's no search feature integrated with the list
archives directly, but there is a searchable archive at:
    [To the list mods: perhaps a link could be added to the listinfo page to

that new users would try searching for answers before posting.]

Hash: SHA1
I don't use IM much, but I did spend some time recently trying to find a
suitable IM program with OpenPGP support.  I'd consider using IM if there
were good end-to-end crypto support.
There's a plugin for gaim (which does jabber and other protocols):
    There's also gabber, which I'm told is a nice jabber client.  Unfortunately
the gpg support only works for 1.0.6 or older. :(
            I haven't used either much at all.  I started working with gabber until I
ran into the problem of it not running with 1.0.7 and up.  I'm not much for
downgrading just for IM support that I don't use much at all.  I should've
tried gaim-e first, maybe it works better.  I don't know, I ran out of time
and patience following the 'crypto IM' tangent that day. :)
I was also a little concerned with this quote from gabber's lead developer,
Julian Missig:
    "I do not keep up with GnuPG at all, and I don't know too much about
    it to begin with."
That doesn't inspire confidence that the gpg support will be done with the
sort of attention to detail you'd want in a crypto app. :)
Perhaps someone with a better eye toward secure programming could lend a
hand to the gabber folks to help them get up and running with gpgme?

It is. :)
You might want to search the web for pgp/mime and inline pgp to find more
info.  I think there are some handy links in the GnuPG FAQ.
This isn't really an issue of pgp vs gnupg.  It's one of MUA vs MUA, or more
specifically, PGP/MIME vs Inline PGP.  Evolution uses PGP/MIME, which uses a
mime type of multipart/signed for pgp signed messages.  Inline PGP simply
uses the OpenPGP ascii armored format for messages.  That's what you're
Inline is more widely supported than PGP/MIME.  PGP/MIME has several
advantages over inline pgp (you can signed messages with attachments, use
character sets with high bits, etc).  Of course, if the people you
communicate with can't open the message, these advantages are useless.
I don't use Evolution (or Red Hat 8.0) but I did do some testing with Evo
for a LUG presentation I gave a few months ago.  I found that Evo would
decrypt and verify inline pgp messages.  It won't create them, but it should
read them.  It's going the other way that's problematic, sending a message
from Evo to say an Outlook user with PGP 8.
I use mutt.  It can handle both PGP/MIME and inline pgp for sending and
receiving.  Plus, it sucks less.
If you want a GUI MUA, you might want to take a look at KMail.  The most
recent version (with KDE 3.1) is also supposed to handle both PGP/MIME and
inline pgp.  I haven't downloaded it yet, but I know from past versions that
it's a capable MUA.
I think there are some developers on the list from both Evo and KMail, so
perhaps they can provide more details if you need them.

Hi all,
I was preusing the GnuPG FAQ today and I noticed something that seems like
it should be updated.  The FAQ says to send updates to the maintainer, but I
couldn't find the current maintainers address in the FAQ.  I'm guessing that
they're on this list.
Question 7.3) How does the whole trust thing work?
states in part:
You can get a list of the assigned trust values (how much you trust the
owner to correctly sign another person's key) with:
$ gpg --list-ownertrust
The first field is the fingerprint of the primary key, the second field is
the assigned value:
   - = No ownertrust value yet assigned or calculated.
   n = Never trust this keyholder to correctly verify others signatures.
   m = Have marginal trust in the keyholders capability to sign other
       keys.
   f = Assume that the key holder really knows how to sign keys.
   u = No need to trust ourself because we have the secret key.
However, this is not how ownertrust it output any more.  The NEWS file says
that --list-ownertrust was renamed to --export-ownertrust way back in
gnupg-0.3.3 and that it only exports defined ownertrust values.  Also, the
output does not use the key above, it uses numbers.  Perhaps this section
could be updated to reflect this change?
For a moment, I was excited thinking I'd learned of a new gpg command that I
didn't know previously. ;-)  So I was dissapointed when I tried it and found
it doesn't work.  What I've done to check out the ownertrust for a
particular key is:
    $ gpg --edit-key  quit
Now that I'm thinking about it, is there another way to go about this?

You should look into using ssh to connect to your web host.  If they don't

I'm taking a guess that you'll only need to have the public key installed on
the webhost so that mail sent from the shopping cart can be encrypted to
you.  If so, you should generate your key pair on your local machine and
then upload the public key to the web host.  Storing your secret key on the
web host is not a good idea (and it's even worse if you transmit it via a
completely insecure protocol like telnet).

By default, the --export option will send your key to stdout (usually, the

you could use a command like this:
    gpg --armor --export your_user_id > chad.asc
replacing 'your_user_id' with, well, your user id.  See the gpg man page
section titled 'How to specify a user ID' for info on the many ways you can
specify a user id.
When you import a key, it's added to your public keyring.  By default, this
is stored in ~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg.
Well, it tells me you have good taste. :)
Seriously, mutt has very good gpg integration.  For example, if you want to
email your key to  a friend, you can type k and mutt will prompt you
for a key id.  It will then extract the key in an ASCII armored format and
attach it to a message.
To import a key you receive via email, you can type ^K (that's CTRL-K) to
extract it and add it to y our keyring.  Mutt does indeed suck less. :)

gpg --send-keys That also assumes you have set a keyserver in your gpg.conf file.  If not,

You can grab particular keys from the keyserver using
gpg --recv-keys Or you could use the auto-key retrieval option to have gpg try and get any
keys you don't already have when it is verifying a signature.  The pros and
cons of this were discussed here in the past day or so.
That may well be an issue of the pgp signature format.  Mutt uses PGP/MIME
by default and that's all well and good.  However, most MUA's simply can't
(or won't) send and receive mail in this format.  They just put an OpenPGP
block in the message body.  You can make mutt check these signatures in
several ways.  The recommended way in 1.4 and above is to use the
check-traditional-pgp function, which is bound to ESC P by default.  The
other way is to use procmail to munge the message headers.  See the
PGP-Notes.txt file that comes with mutt for details on how to do that.
I prefer to leave the messages intact and I take advantage of a nice mutt
patch that forces mutt to check for traditional (inline) pgp signatures[1].
That way I don't have to hit ESC P all the time.  I also use traditional
(inline) signatures for most of my list mail since that is the more widely

Hash: SHA1
Them asses or the masses?  (I know, often there isn't a difference. :)
One thing that opportunistic encryption helps stop is the passive (and
massive) eavesdropping that is a favorite of police states (e.g. carnivore).
Sure, it doesn't stop MITM attacks, but it does severely limit who can see
your email contents and what it will cost them to try.  Plus, in general,
the increase in encrypted traffic is a benefit to all.  It takes effort for
the eavesdroppers to figure out which messages and users are using weak (or
non-existent) trust models/policies and which users are not.  This slows
them down.  If major governments want to spy on everyone, why not make it as
hard for them as possible?

Hash: SHA1
Some MUA's suck.  That they can't see it doesn't necessarily mean that
there's anything wrong with the way you're signing.
That said, you appear to be using mutt 1.4 (and FYI, there's a minor
update, 1.4.1 which fixes an IMAP security problem).  When you
clearsign messages with that version of mutt, it sets the content-type
as application/pgp.  Many many MUA's don't know what to do with this
content-type.  There are some patches you can get for mutt 1.4 that
will change this to text/plain, which works much better for most MUA's
if you need to send onld style, inline PGP messages.  You can also
upgrade to mutt 1.5.4, which uses text/plain by default for inline
The patch I used for a long time with 1.4 was from Dale Woolridge.
It's available at Dale's site:
    Evolution, at least newer versions, doesn't support inline pgp
messages at all anymore (as far as I recall).  I believe that both
pine and squirrelmail users will be OK if you coerce mutt into using
text/plain for inline messages.
The real long-term solution is to get wider adoption of PGP/MIME into
these other MUA's.  Then there's an RFC to point people to when they
complain that their MUA doesn't display the message properly.  But
that seems to be taking forever.
You might also try getting the mailing list admins to allow PGP/MIME
signature parts through.  If they're blocking them, I'd say their
filters are overbroad, but if it's their list, they can do what they

@_subject: broken ascii armor (was Re: auto decrypt in unix) 
Hash: SHA1
Your message tripped up a small issue in mutt.  The first paragraph of your
message disappeared after the signature was checked (which still fails even
after I downloaded your key).  I tracked this down and found that the ascii
armoring on your message has had a few errant spaces added, one of which
causes mutt to think the first paragraph is part of the armor header.  In
your message, the line after Hash: SHA1 contains a single space.  According
to the OpenPGP RFC:
   7. Cleartext signature framework
      [...]
      The cleartext signed message consists of:
        - The cleartext header '-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----' on a
          single line,
        - One or more "Hash" Armor Headers,
        - Exactly one empty line not included into the message digest,
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        - The dash-escaped cleartext that is included into the message
          digest,
        - The ASCII armored signature(s) including the '-----BEGIN PGP
          SIGNATURE-----' Armor Header and Armor Tail Lines.
I'm guessing that some MTA along the way added the space.  Since it took me
a while to figure out why mutt was losing the first paragraph of your
message (making the line about the korn shell seem out of place :), I
figured I'd post this here, in case any other mutt users found the same
thing.

This is a damn cool feature.  Thanks for adding it!
I have a few questions about it after poking around with it briefly.
Doing this, I was surprised to find that the revoked user ids on my
key were now not shown as revoked.  I'm guessing that's due to the new
signature added when the preferred keyserver was added?  I ended up
selecting the non-revoked user ids and then using the keyserver
command.  Is this the intended way to go about things?  It seemed
rather unintuitive at first glance.
I tried using a pobox.com URL.  When I tested it I received this
message from gpg:
    Key available at:     requesting key D654075A from http server     no valid OpenPGP data found.
    requesting key D654075A from hkp server subkeys.pgp.net
Again I'm just guessing, but I figure it's because pobox.com redirects
to where my current ISP gives me some webspace.  I'd like to be able
to put a preferred keyserver url in my key and signatures that won't
change often, hence the pobox.com url would be nice to use.  Is it a
conscious decision not to follow redirects or just a limitation of the
gpg http code (or a complete misunderstanding on my part, hehe)?

I've built 1.4.0 on Fedora Core 2 and haven't been able to get

    checking whether readline support is requested... yes

I'm not much for understanding the autoconf tools, but looking a
little at it, I think it's because of the failure to find add_history
in -lreadline.  That looks like it leaves HAVE_LIBREADLINE undefined
in config.h and so readline doesn't get used.

@_subject: MUA questions 
Hash: SHA1
This might not be as in depth as you want and you might have already
seen it, but there's a section in the GnuPG FAQ titled, "Which
email-client can I use with GnuPG?"  It has links to 2 other resources
that provide similar lists of which MUA's handle what types of PGP
            That depends on who your recipient(s) is/are.  Sending inline sigs to
a friend who uses Ximian Evolution would be bad, since Evo doesn't do
inline PGP at all anymore (older versions tried but IIRC, it didn't
work very reliably).  Conversely, sending PGP/MIME to Outhouse Express
users won't get you very far either.
Personally, I sign all mail to mailing lists inline, except to the
mutt-users list, where I send PGP/MIME on the assumption that most
folks there are using mutt and can handle that format.  I also
configure my MUA (mutt, if you haven't guessed or looked at the
User-Agent header) to send inline to some recipients and PGP/MIME to
others.  I also have it configured to recognize some other MUA's and
to automatically send replies in the format they can handle.
I don't even think it's a question, inline is more widely supported.
That's unfortunate, as PGP/MIME has the advantage of being defined in
an RFC and can properly deal with all types of mail messages and
formats, whereas inline breaks pretty quickly when you feed it much
more than plain old ASCII.  Inline also doesn't do anything for your
attachments, making your job harder if you want to sign and encrypt a
message to a friend and include an attachment.
If you mean an inline encrypted message body, then yes, Evolution
doesn't handle that.  Perhaps it's not really best described as having
a problem with it, it will display the encrypted message for you just
fine, it just won't help you decrypt it.  I'm guessing you're more
curious to know if any MUA's break or otherwise act badly when they
encounter such messages.  I'm sure there are some, but I've not used
any such MUA's.
Actually, my choice of MUA's has always been guided by the PGP support
they had.  I started off with Netscape 3.0 back when I had PGP with a
plugin from either Viacrypt or Phil's first commercial incarnation of
PGP Inc.  Then I moved to Eudora for a while.  Around that time, I got
sick of Windows and moved to Linux and used Kmail for a while, though
it's lack of support for PGP/MIME led me to try mutt.  I stopped
looking at that point.  Mutt is perfect for my needs.
I would think it would be.  What MUA are you using that does this and
what type of messages do this, inline or PGP/MIME?  Just curious, as
it might help me to avoid sending the wrong kind of message to someone
in the future.  It might also just be a problem with the sender's

Haha, that's got to be MS Lookout Express!  Odd too, it will run just
about any virus you feed it, but it balks at an RFC compliant MIME
message.  And people pay good money to Billy...  Sheesh.
Most of them can.  Once again, that silly old virus propagation
platform, Outhouse Express, has problems even with inline messages if
the content-type for the message is application/pgp, which was a sort
of informal standard among inline enabled MUA's.  Mutt 1.4.1 generates
this type of message when you set pgp_create_traditional=yes.  There
are patches available[1] to change this to use text/plain and in fact,
the more recent development versions of mutt do this by default.  The
mutt developers got sick of getting complaints from users of other
MUA's that they couldn't read the inline messages mutt was sending.
If you decide to update your mutt from 1.2.5 to the more recent stable
version 1.4.1, I highly recommend Dale's patches.  They work
wonderfully and will give you all that you have now without the need
for any macro.  Even if you go all the way to the bleeding edge 1.5
series (which is quite stable in my experience), Dale's pgp-menu-trad
patch is quite useful.  It makes it easy to see whether you're about
to send a message using PGP/MIME or inline format.
One thing that might convince you to upgrade is that 1.2.5 contains a
remotely exploitable security hole.  This was fixed in 1.2.5.1. See
the Mutt News[2] page for info.
Anyway, that's enough ranting and raving about mutt I guess.  It's not
like they're paying me to try and market for them.  :)

    pgp-traditional will force text/plain instead of application/pgp

Says who? :)
Does that exclude MIME of any type?  And what do you mean by the
message body?  Those lines are quite blurry with a capable MIME MUA.
That sounds like a lot of extra work.  And it does nothing for you if
you want to encrypt those attachments as well as ensure that they
arrive intact.
The PGP/MIME specification handles that much more gracefully, IMHO.
You sign and/or encrypt the entire message one time.  This is not only
easier since you only have to enter your passphrase once, it also
eliminates the potential to forget to sign or encrypt a sensitive
attachment.  There are plenty of other benefits as well.
The only drawback I see with PGP/MIME is the lack of implementations
that support it.  That's changing though.  Many Linux MUA's support it
now.  The excellent combo of Mozilla and enigmail makes it available
to Windows users as well.  I'm not up on what other Windows MUA's
support PGP/MIME, but I know there are others.  The links in my
previous message list a bunch of them for several platforms.
Oh, ok then.  I think the links in my previous message should help you
there.  While the pages linked don't really tell you exactly how a
particular MUA makes things happen, they do tell you if they support
it or not.  Short of trying each one, you'd have to ask someone whose
opinion you trust whether a specific MUA makes it easy or hard.  I
think mutt makes it a breeze.  Many would disagree with me on that
though.  YMMV.
I've never used pine.  I looked at it when I started with linux, but
it's lack of tight PGP integration put it out of the running for my
Many old pine users really like mutt if they give it a try.  If you
use PGP/GPG on a regular basis, I don't think mutt can be beat by any
other MUA, certainly not any other text-mode MUA's I've seen.  But
again, that's just my opinion.
That's always a handy thing.  In mutt, you have the power of hooks
that allow you to specify per folder, per sender, per reply, etc, what
actions to take.  By default, I sign all messages.  I have a list of
people I always encrypt and sign messages to.  I also have a list of
people I never sign messages to.  Then I use inline most of the time
but for a few folks and mailing lists I use PGP/MIME.  Lastly, when I
reply to non-list mail, I have mutt look for some X-Mailer and
User-Agent headers of MUA's that are known to support PGP/MIME and I
send in that format when I reply to those users.  That sort of fine
grained control is what I love most about mutt.
Well, we'd be veering far off topic if we went much further down that
road, but I will add that while I despise outlook (mostly the express
version) for the hassles it causes regarding PGP/GPG usage, I'm not
one to bash MS just for the hell of it.  I choose not to use their
software, but I don't begrudge them making money, which is how I tend
to see the M$ abbreviation.  Making money through free markets is a
great thing.  The world needs more of it.  I just choose to give my
money to other companies, that's all.

quite well.  This is another place where Dale Woolridge's
pgp-menu-traditional patch[1] is very helpful.  It adds (PGP/MIME) or
(Inline) to the PGP: menu in mutt's compose screen.  That way it's
really obvious if my rules have guessed wrong and I get a chance to
catch and correct it before hitting send.
Somewhere, either here or on mutt-users (I think the latter), there
was some talk and examples of how to loop over your gpg-keyring and
set pgp_autosign and pgp_autoencrypt for all the keys you have.  I'd
want to clean up my bloated keyring before I did that, but that's
another thing I intend to get around to doing some evening.
Basically, if I have a key for someone, I have it so I can encrypt
communication with them, so making that happen by default would save
me some time.

Those message do contain text/plain message bodies.  Your MUA is
simply not displaying them as such because it does not support the
PGP/MIME RFCs, 2015 and 3156, the latter of which supersedes the
former.  AFAIK, there is a PGP plugin available that will allow you to
read and verify these messages, though I have not used Eudora (or
windows for that matter) since the 3.0 or maybe 4.0 days, so my memory
could be shoddy here.
And to others they alleviate many common problems with inline
signatures.  It's a matter of preferences.  It's been discussed to
death.  Take a look through the archives and search the net for
PGP/MIME and you'll have hours of fun reading.
It sounds like a bug in Eudora to me.  You might want to check if
there's a newer version available.  I know that there are 6.0 versions
of Eudora that have been out for some time.  If upgrading to that
isn't an option, maybe there's a more recent 5.x series that fixes
the bug.
Required isn't the right word.  PGP/MIME is preferred by some users.
Some MUA's simply don't support sending the old inline style of
signatures, Evolution is the only one I can think of at the moment,
but there may be others.  I think a decent MUA will be liberal in what
it accepts, meaning that neither inline signatures nor PGP/MIME will
cause the user problems.

It's also not required that anyone use a mailer that shows RFC
compliant MIME messages as attachments when they are clearly marked to
be shown inline with a content type of text/plain.
Can you show me any charter at all for the list?  I saw nothing
specific that would cover this sort of thing when I signed up, nor is
any such charter posted here regularly.  What other unwritten rules
should we all be aware of?
I'd say the fact that the mailman software used to run the list knows
how to handle PGP/MIME formated messages and to add it's footer
without breaking them means that the authors of the list software
don't share your view that mailing list and news group postings
shouldn't contain MIME (they are not really attachments any more than
a text/plain body part is an attachment).
I think that if PGP/MIME bothers some folks so much, they should
either ignore messages from those who send in that format, kindly
persuade the sender of such messages that inline is better, or upgrade
to a MIME compliant MUA.
Using inline pgp signatures is something I only do as a convenience so
that my signatures can be checked by as many people as possible with
as little difficulty as possible, and because the default archiver
that ships with mailman isn't yet smart enough to handle MIME
I would much prefer that people got with the program and started
complaining upstream to the authors of crippled MUA's.  I often think
I should send everything PGP/MIME, just to help speed that process
along.  Obviously, if no one pushes for a standard to be adopted,
we'll be stuck with people trying to foist inline signatures on the
rest of us for another 10 years.

Your message would show up as an .ems attachment to many Eudora users.
It would be an attachment of some sort to other MUA's.  Those MUA's
are basically broken as far as I am concerned.  A PGP/MIME signature,
like you just used, is a simple MIME message and the fist part of it
is marked as text/plain.  Often, these messages also have a
content-disposition of inline, though your message doesn't have that.
AFAIK, an MUA should display the text/plain part, even if it is
incapable of verifying the attached PGP signature.  Many MUA's don't
do this, and it's a constant argument over who's right and who's
Indeed.  The Evo developers punted and decided that they couldn't work
with inline signatures at all.  I think that's rather unfortunate,
since so many other MUA's clearly deal well with inline signatures.
But at least they chose to implement PGP/MIME, which has the benefit
of an RFC to define it.

Hash: SHA1
Did this someone provide any evidence of this alleged backdoor in
some NAI release of PGP or did they just pass on rumor and innuendo,
AKA FUD?
It could.  Who do you know and trust that's competent to carefully
look over the all the GnuPG code and spot backdoors?  If that number
is zero or close to it, then you are going on some amount of trust
that David, Stefan, Timo and Werner haven't slipped something in and
that if they have, someone else will notice (and publicize) it.
Also, it's been a while since I've tracked PGP closely, but IIRC, it
was only the last NAI release (version 7) that did not include any
corresponding source code release.  While commercial PGP was never
under any open source license, it has always been released -- with the
exception of PGP 7 -- with source code for peer review.

Evolution is seriously lacking in this regard.   The developers punted
and just gave up on reading any inline pgp sigs, despite the fact that
many many MUA's create and verify them quite well.  If you want to do
a lot of work with signed email, this limitation of Evo makes it
unsuitable for the task, IMHO.
If you want a nice GUI MUA on linux that can do both inline and
PGP/MIME, definitely give KMail a look.  AFAIK, you still have to go
to a little trouble to install the software needed to support
PGP/MIME, but they have a HOWTO on their home page.  Once you get that
done, KMail is pretty sweet.

Nor do I.
I think you're right on here Mark.  I was just getting ready to send
something similar.
I run Spamassassin locally, with Bayesian filtering and non of these
messages have been marked as spam.  That's thanks to the extra check
of the Bayesian filter AFAICT.  Here's my SA output:
X-Spam-Status: No, hits=-4.7 required=5.0 tests=BAYES_00,RCVD_IN_NJABL,
        RCVD_IN_SORBS autolearn=no version=2.61
The main difference is the BAYES_00 test, which should lower the score
a good bit.
The mail is most definitely not spam.  Jean-David, you ought to take
whatever action your ISP provides to have that message marked as ham
(non-spam) so they can learn from it and not mark similar messages as
spam in the future.
I've found, using SA locally with Bayesian filtering and a decent
sample of spam and ham to train it with, SA has a near zero level of
false positives.  I've had one in about 6 months and it was one that
mocked the Nigerian money scams.  Spamassassin is an incredible tool,
