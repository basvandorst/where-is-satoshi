Do not use loopback unless you know what you are doing.  Adding --verbose should give you some insight what goes wrong.
On an old Solaris box you may want to run something like
  find /usr -type f | xargs cat >/dev/null which is more effective than typing on the keyboard.

If you want the volunteers here to help you, it is important that you write a proper bug report.  This includes telling us the version of GnuPG and of the OS, describing _exactly_ what you did, and providing logs.  You should be aware thata curses based panel disturbs the stderr diagnostics printed to the tty; thus you should redirect it to a log file.
BTW, there are commercial support service providers available [1] who will be able to talk you to a solution.

[1]  for a list.  gnupg.com is my own service which also develops and maintains GnuPG and friends.

Attempting to generate a key on Solaris 10 server using the below command
gpg --full-generate-key --pinentry-mode=loopback
Everything seem to be working but the key generation never completes.
Its been setting at this point for 10 hours.  I tried to produce more entropy by running suggested command on other console and the agent is running
  root  8249 28754   0 21:48:19 pts/12      0:02 gpg --full-generate-key --pinentry-mode=loopback
    root 17222     1   0 19:55:32 ?           0:08 gpg-agent --homedir /root/.gnupg --use-standard-socket --daemon
GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.
Real name: root1
Email address: root at localhost
You selected this USER-ID:
    "root1 "
Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O
We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.
