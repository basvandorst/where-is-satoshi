@_subject: I am trying to setup a PHP encrypt/decrypt system and... 
I am trying to implement a php mechanism that will use GNUPG to encode a password which will then be stored in a MySQL database. I don't quite understand the keys (public vs private), so I am wondering what is the most simple way to decode the password? Do I need a key for that?
NOTE: We have root access on our server and only the admin (me) needs decyption ability (end-users don't need decyption ability...)]
Any help is much appreciated.
