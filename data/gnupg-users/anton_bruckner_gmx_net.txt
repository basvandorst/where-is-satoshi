@_subject: newbie : passphrase as an env. variable or command-line option ? 
Is there a possibility of giving the passphrase in the command line or as an
environnement variable so as to have no further interaction with gpg, or
should one use the library instead ?
I didnt find it in the documentation.
Many Thanks,
Anton Bruckner
