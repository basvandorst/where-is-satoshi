@_subject: Expanding web-of-trust with subkey 
Hi, I am new to using PGP in general, but fairly confident in the
cryptographic primitives and the overall concepts. I have issued a master
key on cold storage, and subkeys on my primary machine (one with encryption
and one with signing privileges).
I wanted to send an email to a new contact (a bug report to a software
project) so I added the public key and assigned it "Fully trusted" (4).
Then I ran `gpg2 -esa -r ` and gpg tells me:
*It is NOT certain that the key belongs to the person named in the user
ID.  If you *really* know what you are doing, you may answer the next
question with yes.*
Does this have to do with me not having signed the key? If I assigned it
"Ultimate trust" (5) the warning disappeared.
I tried signing the key:
*Really sign? (y/N) y*
*gpg: signing failed: No secret key*
*gpg: signing failed: No secret key*
It took me quite a while to figure out that I can't sign someones key with
a master key. (Maybe the error message can be improved?)
So.. Do I need access to my master key in order to expand my web of trust?
This seems like quite a restriction.
How do you handle key management? Let's say you just want to send a signed
and encrypted email once to someone who announced their pubkey over https?
What type of trust would you assign?
Best, Didrik
