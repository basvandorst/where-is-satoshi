Does anyone have gnupg 1.0.6 compiling on a sparc64 Solaris 2.8
    system?  Does anyone know how to fake out the build routines to     use acceptible machine and os types?  My trouble seems to be:
gcc  -O -Wall  -o mpicalc  mpicalc.o ../cipher/libcipher.a  	      ../mpi/libmpi.a ../util/libutil.a ../intl/libintl.a  -lz -ldl -lnsl  -lsocket
../mpi/libmpi.a(mpih-div.o): In function `mpihelp_mod_1':
mpih-div.o(.text+0xb0): undefined reference to `__udiv_qrnnd'
mpih-div.o(.text+0x424): undefined reference to `__udiv_qrnnd'

    Any help is appreciated.  Thanks much....

    OK.

    Works fine.  But, I do get this message, and chose to use
    --enable-static-rnd=none as suggested.
    *** You may want to run ./configure with --enable-static-rnd=none to be
    *** able to load the EGD client code dynamically; this way you can choose
    *** between RNDUNIX and RNDEGD without recompilation.
lh> What is the output of ./scripts/config.guess?
    sparc-sun-solaris2.8
lh> What is the output of gcc -v?
    Reading specs from
    /tools/gcc-2.8.1/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.5/2.9-redhat-980810/specs
    gcc version 2.9-redhat-980810
    It's looking to me, with a little more hindsight that I was
    probably just fighting the "--disable-asm" trouble.
    Thanks....
