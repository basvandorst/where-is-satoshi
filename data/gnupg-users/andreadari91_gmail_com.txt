In my public keyring I have a public key signed in date 19 February 2016 by
a user (pbkey) that I trust fully, but the same pbkey of the user that I
trust is revoked in date 18 February 2016.
So the question is, how can be possible that a pbkey signed after a key
revocation, which could be easily done by a malicious user, is treated by
gnupg as validate fully?
This, in my opinion, should breaks the chain of trust for keys signed after
a key revocation.
A possible solution could be to change the trust of the key revoked from
full to untrusted, but in that case all the keys signed before the
revocation will be treated as validate unknown which is not what a user
could want.
Thanks to those who want to respond.

1) This is the general situation:
User one is the user that i fully trust and has a revocation dated on 18
February 2016
2) Here you can see User one pbkey details:
3) Here you can see that user three is treated with validity = full even if
it is signed after the revocation of User one key.
Fortunately, this is not a real situation, but I tested it to understand
what happened in this cases; because i wasn't able to find any
documentation about it.

I use the default Debian gnupg packet config, I have only Andrea Dari's
private key.
I tested it also with gnupg v2.x but it still have the same problem.

Nop I didn't, now it works!
This time gpg didn't run that command by itself.
Thanks Ingo
