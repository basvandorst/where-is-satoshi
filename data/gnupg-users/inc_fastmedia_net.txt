hi .. i tried to install gnupg 1.1.1 but came to these errors:
[cpaul gnupg-1.1.1]$ gpg --gen-key

sorry to be such a newbie, but i don't see why it can't create the
files.  or am i nuts to attempt to use the latest devel version?
and.. how can i use secure memory?

@_subject: ELG-E key? 
hi there
a pgp user sent me an ascii file.  i have their public key on my public ring.
if i try to decrypt the file, $ gpg -d Untitled.msg.pgp i see the below:
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit ELG-E key, ID 44F373A5, created 2001-07-25
      ""
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
is there hope?
