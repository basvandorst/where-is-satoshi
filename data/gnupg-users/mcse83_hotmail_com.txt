@_subject: Cant get Fellowship card to work 
Hello Everyone,
I bought myself an SCM' SCR3340 ExpressCard smart card reader for my
laptop. I also signed up for a Fellowship smart card at:
I run Vista with SP2 and I have GnuPG 1.4.9 installed. When I go to a
command line and run the following command:
gpg --card-status
gpg --card-edit
I get the following error:
gpg: detected reader `AKS ifdh 0'
gpg: detected reader `AKS ifdh 1'
gpg: detected reader `AKS VR 0'
gpg: detected reader `Aladdin Token JC 0'
gpg: detected reader `SCM Microsystems Inc. SCR3340 ExpressCard Reader 0'
gpg: pcsc_connect failed: removed card (0x80100069)
gpg: card reader not available
gpg: OpenPGP card not available: general error
I *know* my smart card reader has been installed correctly as I can see
it in device manager. I have even updated to the latest drivers today
and firmware. For some reason I just cant read my Fellowship card.
Can anyone help please? Is it a hardware issue? An incompatible smart
card reader?
I have also just ordered 3 of the new OpenPGP cards (that supprt 3072
but keys) and I am REALLY hoping I dont have the same problem like I am
with the Fellowship card ;-(
Thank you.

Why is it when I sign an email and someone replies to it I sometimes get
the following error:
Part of the message signed; click on 'Details' button for more information
in the details it says:
OpenPGP Security Info
Error - signature verification failed
gpg command line and output:
C:\Program Files\GNU\GnuPG\gpg.exe
gpg: Signature made 10/11/09 14:13:48 using RSA key ID xxxxxx
gpg: BAD signature from "Sean Wilson "
Why does this happen?
If I send an email between two different email accounts and I sign it,
then reply I NEVER get a broken signature so why does this happen when
other people reply to my emails?
Thank you!

The SCM Microsystems Inc. SCR3340 ExpressCard Reader seems to work as it
can read the OpenPGP 2.0 card (I do have problems writing changes to it
though, see below).
I have just upgraded to GPG 1.4.10 but when I try to create a key pair
on the OpenPGP 2.0 card it says:
An undefined error occurred (this is when I do it using OpenPGP in
Thunderbird by selecting Manage Smartcard from the OpenPGP menu)
Is running GPG 1.4.10 up to date enough to be able to generate key pairs
on the newer OpenPGP 2.0 cards?
If not what do I need to do to be able to use the OpenPGP 2.0 card?
Not sure why but I can't access Thanks for any help!

I am running Windows Vista.
I think I am running the built in driver for the card reader.
What additional software do I need to install to get the OpenPGO 2.0
card to work??

I think I should provide a bit more information about my setup, I am
REALLY confused now (lol):
Vista Home Premium with SP2
Thunderbird 2.0.0.23
Enigmail 0.96.0
SCR3340 ExpressCard Reader
OpenPGP 2.0 smart card
GPG 1.4.10
Currently I subscribe to Hushmail for my email. I use
Thunderbird/Enigmail/GPG to be able to send/receive encrypted/signed PGP
email using their service. I have been doing this for about 2 years now
and I keep the private key on my laptops (encrypted) drive.
After much reading about the OpenPGP 2.0 card I knew I had to have one
;-)) So I bought one the week it was released.
I have been playing around with the card today as I have the day off
work but it seems to have me lost as to how it works.
I generated a test key pair on the OpenPGP card. My understanding of the
reason for doing this was that it was the most secure way as the private
key never touches your hard drive and its ONLY present on the OpenPGP
card (which you can only access with the correct PIN).
Heres were I am confused. When I go into "Key Management" in Thunderbird
(under the OpenPGP menu) I can see my new key pair listed there even if
I remove the OpenPGP card from the reader?! Also, if the cards removed
from the reader, I can right click the new key pair in "Key Management"
and select "Export keys to file" and it even saves the secret key to the
file on my hard drive!!! I thought the whole point of having the key
generated ON the OpenPGP card was so that it was secure (by never being
on the hard drive)? Whats the point if I can save a copy of it from "Key
Management" WHILE the OpenPGP card is not in the reader?
The other things is, how do I know when I look at my private keys in
"Key Management" which ones are on the OpenPGP card and which ones are
stored locally on my hard drive? When I sign/encrypt a test email I
don't know for sure if its using the private key off the hard drive or
OpenPGP 2.0 card.
If anyone can shed some light on this I would greatly appreciate it! I
really want to store my Hushmail 2048bit private key on the OpenPGP 2.0
card and access it via the PIN only rather than use the current way I
have it configured (ie: private key stored locally on hard drive with no
smart card). I thought it would be as easy as copying the Hushmail
private key onto the OpenPGP 2.0 card and telling Thunderbird to use the
private key from the smart card rather than the hard drive key...
On another note, is it possible to completely erase all key on the
OpenPGP 2.0 card once I have finished testing them?
Thank you.

Another update ;-)
I copied my Hushmail keys onto the OpenPGP 2.0 card by using the
keytocard command.
When I run gpg --card-status I can see that my keys are there.
But when I try to decrypt a Hushmail email in Thunderbird I get this error:
OpenPGP Security Info
Error - secret key needed to decrypt message
gpg command line and output:
C:\Program Files\GNU\GnuPG\gpg.exe

      ""xxxxxx at hushmail.com" "
gpg: public key decryption failed: wrong secret key used
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
Can someone explain to me why this is happening?
I am really battling to get my keys to work with this OpenPGP card ;-(
PS: If I try to decrypt the email by NOT using the OpenPGP 2.0 card then
it decrypts the email first time!

@_subject: OpenPGP 2.0 and Hushmail keys 
Does anyone know if the new OpenPGP 2.0 card supports Hushmail keys?
The key I have from my Hushmail account is 2048bit in length but once I
copy the key onto the OpenPGP 2.0 card I can't decrypt Hushmail email
anymore, any idea why?
Also, if I generate a brand new key pair ON the OpenPGP 2.0 card, will
anyone be able to export or copy the private key (if the OpenPGP card is
NOT inserted in the reader)? Does GPG write a copy of the keys anywhere
else besides on the card?
I know it asks you when you generate the key pair if you want to store
an off card copy for backup purposes but I selected no for this.
What I don't understand is that when I generated a brand new test key
pair on the OpenPGP card and then removed it from the reader I was still
able to export the keys to a file from key management in Thunderbird,
can someone explain this? I thought the private/secret key was ONLY on
the card when generated this ways so that no one could get to it to
brute force it etc?
Thanks everyone! ;-)

Thanks for the reply!
How do I troubleshoot the issue I am experiencing with my Hushmail keys
on the OpenPGP 2.0 card not being able to decrypt my mail?
Are you sure about what you said below regarding the stub and the
secret/private key? I just generated a test key pair on the OpenPGP 2.0
card and then removed the card from the reader. When I go into key
management in Thunderbird and select the newly created key and select
"export keys to file" it says:
Do you want to include the secret key in the saved OpenPGP key file?
So I click " Export secret keys" and it saves it to a .asc file. If I
open this in notepad it looks as follows (this is a test key so I don't
mind posting it here as it will be deleted and is for testing purposes
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: GnuPG v1.4.10 (MingW32)
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----
Version: GnuPG v1.4.10 (MingW32)
-----END PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----
If I open my Hushmail keys in notepad it looks familiar to the test key
I have exported from key management (with the card not inserted in the
I am battling to understand this as I thought generating a key pair on
the openPGP card itself was as secure as can be as your private key ONLY
exists on the card itself and is not available anywhere else (ie: on
your hard drive for export).

I was trying this, is it correct:
gpg --edit-key xxxxxxxx
select 1
key 1
select 2

@_subject: One Private Key on Two or more OpenPGP 2.0 cards? 
If I generate a brand new key pair and then add the key to an OpenPGP
2.0 card all works perfectly. But if I want to add the same key onto
another OpenPGP card (as a backup) I get the following error in Thunderbird:
Error - decryption failed
gpg command line and output:
C:\Program Files\GNU\GnuPG\gpg.exe
The SmartCard D2760001240102000005000000430000 found in your reader
cannot be used to process the message.
Please insert your SmartCard D27600012401020000050000003F0000 and repeat
the operation.
Obviously if I insert the first card it decrypts the email no problem.
What is the correct method to use to have the SAME private key on
multiple cards? The reason I want to do this is so that I can have a
"production" card, a backup card and an offsite card. How do I
accomplish this?
Thank you.

@_subject: One Private Key on Two or more OpenPGP 2.0 cards? 
Many thanks for this David! Now that you have explained it to me it all
makes sense. I tested it and it works perfectly.
The only thing I am battling with now is, how do I create an
authentication key that I can use with SSH across all 3 of my OpenPGP
cards? I'm a bit lost how to do this! I can easily create a single
authentication key on ONE card but whats the correct procedure to follow
to create an authentication key and put it on 3 OpenPGP cards?
Many thanks for all your help!

@_subject: Generating Key on OpenPGP - backups? 
If I generate a key on an OpenPGP 2.0 card and select yes when it asks
me to create a backup of the key, how do I restore the private key
should the card become damaged/lost/etc ? I tried putting a new OpenPGP
card in my reader and restoring the key from the file it created in my
profile but it wouldn't let me decrypt the test emails I had encrypted.
Once you have created a private key ON the OpenPGP card, what is the
correct method to use to be able to put the private key onto another
OpenPGP card as a backup?
I know how to do this if I create the key pair on my hard drive but am
unsure how to proceed if I create the key pair on the OpenPGP card itself.
Thank you!

@_subject: Bit length incorrect on OpenPGP 2.0 card 
When I create a brand new key pair on an OpenPGP 2.0 card and I tell it
to create a signing,encryption and authentication key of 2048bits in
length it created two of the three keys as 2048bit but the other one is
1024bit! I have tried this many times on two cards and they both seem to
behave the same way, how do I force gpg to create 2048bit keys for all
the keys I generate? If I try to create a key pair of 1024 or 3072bits
in length the same thing happens.
What am I doing wrong?
