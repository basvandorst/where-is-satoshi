@_subject: correct usage of gpg param 'throw-keyid(s)' ? 
What is this param's correct usage:
I see conflicting docs online:
Generally, which gpg docs are authoritative?
I.e., if/when they conflict, which is considered correct?

The obvious difference in usage ...
One says the usage is
  throw-keyids
the other says usage is
  throw-keyid
neither one mentions the others' usage
