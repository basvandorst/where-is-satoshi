Did someone write that there is some school of thought that RSA is no
longer very strong? Or, is the meaning that it's likely to take 900
years instead of 100 years to crack?
Just curious. I have RSA 4096's ... could change them easily enough if
someone convinced me to do it.

@_subject: Gen Key command done correctly 
I tried to generate a key using commands in "Terminal" on my OS/X.  This
is actually a learning experience for me done on purpose.
When I used gen-key, I got one, but at the end was told that I'd need to
generate a  sub-key that I could use to actually encrypt.
So,, what I am asking in where I went wrong?
I used the gpg --gen-key to generate a non-expiring 4096 RSA key; gave a
name and email address.
What would be the complete process done via the CLI ??

Ladislav Hagara said the following:
Next question ...
Sub-key generated.
Do I still encrypt to the original public key? And thus, is the sub-key
used automatically? .. I ask because it's not intuitively obvious to me
how I tell gpg to select that sub-key since Thunderbird already uses the
key generated originally to the email address.

@_subject: removing a misplaced comment in UID 
I am sure I goofed. I am unsure how to correct it now that I sent my
keys to the servers.
When I made the revised keys, I put in /name/ and /comment/ and /email addy/
the *comment* part, I should have ignored. However I was thinking of the
line seen often under "Version" a /note/ or /comment/ but I put the line
in that UID comment field. Now I have this huge UID with /my name/ &&
"keys at so-and-so" && emailATemail
can I remove the comment?
thanks for the help (again)

I had my friend set up her XP machine with Thunderbird and gnupg, based,
I believe, on directions obtained here ... so I feel she got the correct

in dos"  then a *HUGE* amount of (likely) code .... then
gpg4win-1.1.3.exe and several lines of likely text prompts
the compose window is therefore huge and email takes a while to get
sliced up for emailing.
How best to eliminate this? A total re-install?

However, this started a different problem on her XP machine. Namely,
from a command prompt, typing in gpg yields an error stating that gpg
isn't registered or available or located or whatever.
I took it to mean that gpg hadn't added the sys var stating its true
folder location ... but his didn't exist earlier.
how to fix that one?

I'm on a MacBook and using Thunderbird version 2.0.0.6 (20070728)
I see no Header of "Reply To:" ... I was looking for it because when I
hit "Reply" to one of the List emails, the compose window popped up with
a message addressed to Robert H. as opposed to the List.
Is this normal? If not, is there a setting in the List Account for me
where I can set the headers appearing in emails to me?
Reply-All seems not so much a good idea since two emails would be sent
... so I figure I am doing something wrong.

Hash: SHA512
I noticed today that my Per Recipient Rules list is in sad disarray.
Furthermore, the list is huge, by my standards and patience level.
I would like to push all those entries that have a "Key" associated, up
into the top of the list, but rapidly, not "Move-Up ,, Move-Up"
I would like to delete all the rest, if that makes sense to do ...I am
using Thunderbird and am not sure if and how the remainder of the list
is used .... those entries where there is no key and the rule states to
move on to next recipient .... because I am getting a wee bit impatient
with Thunderbird locking herself up for long periods and was working on
trimming things down ... compacting, expunging rules, and so forth ...
and came across the Rules List.
Thanks for any help.

Hash: SHA512
I am totally unable to figure this out after several days of many hours a day
and some great off-list emailing and help. Works on every one else but mine.
MacBook-Pro 2.16 core-duo
OS/X 10.4.11
Compiled and Re-compiled 2.0.8 using ./configure | make |sudo make install
no errors
~ if you manually start
gpg-agent and it places S.gpg-agent into a respective .gnupg, then still
{1} Thunderbird sees not the secret-key and fails;
{2} you are unable to kill agent and remove S.gpg-agent by log-out
{3} you are unable to start gpg-agent by log-in
I can use 1.4.8 fine and obviously without gpg-agent.
I can manually start gpg-agent then start Thunderbird. But Thunderbird will
either go into seemingly endless loop, pinwheel then :timeout: ... or it will
give error that secret key not available ...
is there anyone using Mac OSX 10.4.11 and successfully using gpg-agent with
any 2.x version of gpg?
And if so, would you mind going into just "how" you did it, probably off-list
cuz it's going to get boring for everyone else

did that, restarted computer .. tried decrypting one of charly's emails and got the oddest request for passphrase but inside a terminal window. it didn't accept it, put * in a few places and plain-text in others and then TB just Tried it again but this time TB just did the time-out after  minute or two and error box with gpg stuff and "timeout" trying to get at passphrase.
Went back to telling it to use "gpg", which is 1.4.8 and it works again.
anyone ?

@_subject: Gnupg and my Mac 
This current line of thought about running gpg2 on the Mac is germane.  While I am currently running  compiled 2.0.9, thanks to a *lot* of help from Charly, I also want to run it in Apple's Mail.app
OK ... here's the rub ...for example, I open Mail and it tells me a series of missives about not finding a recent version of gpg because the current gpg version is 2.0.9 and is not 1.4.x ...OK, DUH I run the gnupg.prefpane 1.2.2 and she tells me to locate gpg svp.
I then switch over to Root, logged in ... I am presented with a "Finder" window.
Well, gee, the Finder window only shows non-hidden folders ... in the real Finder window, I *can* see /usr/local/bin/gpg2 for I have set a pref to show hidden ...... but the gnupg version of a finder, while I am logged in as *the* system admin, will not show that ...
Thus, I am unable to point gnupg at the actual locale of gpg2, or anything for that matter which currently resides in /usr/ ...
So, while some people might be running Apple's Mail with a 2.x version, I am unsure how they did it despite already being told.
