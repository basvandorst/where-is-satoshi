@_subject: command line interface glitch Gpg4Win 2.1.0 
When I encrypt a .csv file using Kleopatra the recipient says everything goes smoothly. But, when I encrypt the same file using a .NET console application to start the gpg.exe process, upon decrypting the file the recipient gets an error message with a Close button. The error message is: The file"blah_blah.csv.gpg" contained no valid encrypted data.  If he doesn't click the Close button he can open the file, save it with a new name, and it has all the data. Has anyone had this problem or can anyone suggest anything to try? Thanks for your help.
