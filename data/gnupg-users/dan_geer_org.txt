@_subject: up a creek 
Dear gnupg-users,
I was using gpg 1.4.1 on Mac OSX 10.3.9.  There
appears to be a UI bug: if you want to use the
"--edit-key" function and you have more than one key
with the same name, that the UI will only list and
only operate on the one of the list of multiple keys
with the same name.
Why would you have a key with the same name?  If you
choose (and I chose) to have expiring keys.  The only
key the UI will talk about is not the one I want to
talk about, and thus begins my problem.
I did discover that "--list-keys" allowed me to find the KEYID that I actually wanted, and, further, that
I could use the KEYID instead of the name as a value
for the "--edit-key" function.  What I then did was to
extend the life of the relevant key ("expire") by one
year.  Unfortunately, this seemed to get me into a
sort of half-state:
% gpg --edit-key FDE5027B

[ultimate] (1). Dan Geer Note the different expire dates between keys in the
above.  I'm guessing that expiring keys is an infrequently
used part of the code base.
Now this led me to ask at macgpg.sourceforge.net if
I was correct.  There I got the advice to not use
1.4.1 but to download and build 1.4.7.  That was not
hard and not scary, though the front page instructions
do say that for binary downloads 1.4.7 is only for
Mac OSX 10.4.x, and the 1.4.1 was the latest binary
for 10.3.9.  Nevertheless, after confirming that a
build of 1.4.7 was appropriate for 10.3.9, I did as
suggested, and downloaded and built according to
directions, including getting passing grades on all
27 tests that are done with "make check -i".
Therefore, and consistent with the instructions, I
did "sudo make install". I then ran this as my very first instruction:
% gpg --list-key
gpg: fatal: can't create directory `/Users/geer/.gnupg': File exists
secmem usage: 0/0 bytes in 0/0 blocks of pool 0/32768
and, somewhat disastrously, I appear now to have no
keyfiles.  Consulting with the macgpg folks again,
they found the above hard to imagine; in particular
the error message indicated that a file exists in
my homedir named .gnupg; not a directory but a file.
While they found this odd and inexplicable, that
much at least was understandable: ~/.gnupg is and
was a symlink to a directory in an encrypted volume.
% ls -l ~/.gnupg lrwx------  1 geer ... /Users/geer/.gnupg@ -> /Volumes/private2/dg/.gnupg/
% ls -l /Volumes/private2/dg/.gnupg
ls: /Volumes/private2/dg/.gnupg: No such file or directory
In other words, it appears that the install process
or the first-run command to --list-keys destroyed
the contents in the encrypted volume, not the symlink
itself.  The macgpg folks found that situation to be
so unexpected that they said I should join this list
and ask about my situation here.
Yes, there is a backup on a token device that is hidden
in another location, so the keys are not really and
truly lost, but while they may not be lost I am surely
lost and ask to be found.

  Right.
 And therein is the issue.  A year ago, I wrote an
editorial where I made a semi-numeric mostly educated
guess that 15-30% of all home/private systems were
already compromised.  I got some hate mail but in the intervening months, Vint Cert said 40%, Microsoft
said 2/3rds, and IDC said 3/4ths.  Whatever the true
number is, real risk management must now assume that
the counterparty to a conversation stands a good chance
of being 0wned.
That said, the discount brokerages are hurting on this
as 0wned machines mean that stock pump&dump schemes
can be pumped by booking real trades from real people
with real money, i.e., steal the password via a key
logger and then time the trade to help with the pump
phase.  I've another editorial on that, but suffice it
to say that in at least one instance, the November 06
10-Q filing by e-Trade, the losses in question reached
the level that required SEC disclosure.
Which brings us to a point: Those brokerages want,
and are willing to pay real money for, something like
an Active-X component that at the outset of the trading
session is downloaded fresh, steals the keyboard away
from the operating system, and pipes keystrokes through
an entirely distinct network stack direct to the trading
environment, i.e., makes the home user's PC into a dumb
terminal for a moment.  On the one hand, that this could
work is horrifying and the idea of teaching the user
community to say yes to "steal my keyboard" is likewise
horrifying.  But on the other hand there is a coherent
argument that people fall in two camps: Those who always
click "YES" and those who never do.
If someone always clicks "YES," then the odds are that
they are alreacy 0wned and, thus, you need to 0wn them
for a moment if you are going to do anything important.
If someone never clicks "YES," then the odds are that
they are canny and self-protecting, so you don't need
to 0wn them up just to have a transaction.
The times, they are a changin'

@_subject: Miscellaneous questions 
> Although commonly used, a name is not a good measure for identity.
My reply is probably very nearly pedantic, but the question
raised is a venerable one:  Do you want your system to be
name-centric or key-centric.  A name-centric system is one
where the name is the identity, per se, and the key is an
attribute of that name.  A key-centric system is one where
the key is the identity, per se, and the name is an attribute
of that key.  By analogy, just as there are advantages and
disadvantages when comparing bearer bonds versus registered
securities, there are advantages and disadvantages when
comparing name-centric versus key-centric systems.  A reference
to an early discussion of binding would be Carl Ellison's 1996
USENIX paper, found at Within an enterprise, name-centric might be the better
choice as moves and adds are the principal things that
happen to individuals and their roles.  As an individual,
I prefer key-centric as I've a fairly strong bias toward
preserving the benefits of pseudonymity in the face of
spreading surveillance.

@_subject: Someone has harvested my address  
I kept this email address specifically for use for my postings on, and
 to help me sort postings from, this list.
  It seems that somebody has harvested this address, as I received an
 off-list spam to it.
  Is anyone responsible for the administration of this list interested in
 details, or shall I just change this address?
 I do not run this list, but I do run others, some
of which are quite small.  The quite small ones
often have no list-directed spam at all as the list
names would not be guessable.  When a previously
spam-free list starts getting list-directed spam
it has been correlated with adding someone to the
list or having a list member cc a list-directed
message to other parties.
If you (any "you") wanted to track down the vector,
I'd start with list additions immediately preceding
the appearance of the spam.
In like manner, whenever I buy anything on the web
or do anything where, for better or worse, an e-mail
address is essential to completing the transaction,
I use the firm's name at a domain I own for no other
purpose, e.g., paintstore at trashdomain.com.  That may
be approximately what you are doing as well.  Honestly,
no commercial firm has lost my effectively use-once
addresses and the domain I use for this purpose has
only a whitelist filter for things like "paintstore"
that I've actually used.  As such, I'm tempted to
conclude that e-mail address harvesting tends to be
dominated by certified pre-0wned home users.

Personally, I do think privacy and security are a zero sum
game in the main, i.e., I agree with Ed Giorgio's commentary
in the New Yorker ("The Spymaster," January 21, 2008) to that
effect.  I don't like it, but what I like is irrelevant.  If
zero-summed-ness is an actual fact of nature, then I'll choose
more privacy and less security as the Internet-of-Things approaches.

Perhaps you are correct.
My own definition of privacy evolves, but as of now is this:
   Privacy is the effective capacity to misrepresent oneself.
and, semi-orthogonally,
   Security is the absence of unmitigatable surprise.

  It will be when any kind of authority (thus hierarchy) or intolerance
 (thus ignorance/inconsciousness) would have *perfectly disappeared*.
 Whenever it's possible or not, we can still see that today it isn't so,
 therefore privacy still has importance.
Given that
    Philosophical and legal analysis has often identified privacy
    as a precondition for the development of a coherent self.
       -- Phil Agre, "The Architecture of Identity," 1998
one must conclude that it is a mortal peril to give up privacy,
at least before, as you said, evil has disappeared from the face
of the Earth.
My point was and is simply that nearly everything is now observable
IN PUBLIC.  Technology makes this possible but it social media and
sensor networks through which that technology brings observability
of the heretofore unobservable to the attention of whomever wants
it.  That trend cannot be undone, ergo, I said in the speech,
    [W]e are becoming a society of informants.  In short, I have
    nowhere to hide from you.

  No. Taking part in social networks and other media is a choice. One can
 a) choose not to take part at all, or b) choose how one takes part and
 what information one shares.
  In short, privacy of information is still real, still relevant, and
 still (largely) within the control of the individual. Tools such as
 encryption help retain the reality of privacy of information.
  The question of privacy of information is of critical importance to
 liberty. By choosing to believe that privacy (or specifically privacy of
 information) is a concept that has "fade"ed you are playing into the
 hands of those who would wish to forcefully strip us all of privacy,
 whether we like or or not. That would be a mistake, I think.
I fully agree with you, which means that I see few ways to preserve
the liberty that privacy represents than to withdraw from much of
civil society while it shares ever more -- sharing ever more on the
"I've got nothing to hide" premise.  Technology makes what is
observable by others daily grow wider; lip reading robots, electric
grids that know the noise signature of every device you own, smart
cameras on every street corner, MIT's "visual microphone," electronic
health records that are and must be shared amongst providers plus
the providers' paymasters, and on and on.  That these are possible
is worrisome; that they are widely built into services which promise
"convenience" is the Pied Piper institutionalized.  As I wrote
elsewhere(*), we are becoming a society of informants -- I have
nowhere to hide from you.
