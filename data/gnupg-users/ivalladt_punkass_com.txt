@_subject: Sign locally a batch of keys 
I need to import into my keyring several .asc files with some keys
each. I want to trust marginally those keys, so I simply am not asked
for fingerprint verification. I've thought of using lsign.
Is there any way to lsign them all while importing as a batch
procedure? Is lsign what I need in order to trust keys personally and
Any other ideas useful.
Cordially, Ismael

I do, I use a private keyring and a public keyring containing only the
public part of my private key in a pendrive. Then I use them from here
or copy them to the hard disk only if I control the computer.
My passphrase is so hard to spell that they'd kill me before I was
able to tell them it. :)

AFAIK it can also happen if keyrings are placed in a FAT32 partition.
You can also set lock-never in gpg.conf but sure there are issues with
