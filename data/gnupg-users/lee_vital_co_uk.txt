@_subject: Selecting primary UID 
I have two UID's on my keypair, I wondered if it is possible to
specify which is the primary UID - the actual problem is that
when I sign someone elses key, it is signing it with my second
UID, rather than the one I want it to use.
Any help much appreciated.

@_subject: Selecting primary UID 
Okay, I realize that, but I wondered if it was possible to
specify which UID gnupg uses primarily. The problem is that I
have one keypair, with a personal UID and a work-related UID.
When I sign a key,  it is currently specifying that it is signed
by  and and printing my work-related UID along with it.
The problem with this is that it suggests that the company in
some way validates the authenticity of the key, rather than
myself personally. Further, I probably won't work here forever,
and if/when I leave it would be better if keys I have signed do
not have my therefore ex-work UID details on.
Much appreciated

Well, if I do gpg --check-sig blah, the line pertaining to my
signature is as follows:
   "sig!      77856D96 2001-06-21 Lee Evans (Lee Evans Vital
Online) "
This would suggest that I have signed it in my role as an agent
of Vital Online. I am no legal expert, but it would be arguable
that this could imply that I , having signed it as an agent of
said company have signed it with the authority of Vital Online,
and thus that they have retrospectively verified they key
themselves. Since I can find no legal precedent for such things,
I am basing these assumptions on email related case law, as that
is, IMHO, probably the closest material, and something that would
probably be cited should such a case ever arise. As you can see
at the bottom of my mail, it is now common practice for employees
to put disclaimers at the bottom of mails, explicitly stating
that views contained in said mail do not necessarily reflect the
views of the company. Since no similar disclaimer is present in
my UID, it could, as I say, be argued that my company themselves
are verifying the validity of the key through my signature.
I thought about that - the thing is, you can't infact revoke a
user ID, just the associated self-signature. The UID will still
remain with the key, and I assume the previously signed keys will
retain the details they picked when I signed them.

You could use the perl PGP module, or if you're only going to be signing
mails, the PGP::Sign standalone module will do just fine - using that,
siginging a mail is as easy as
    "my ($pgpsignature, $pgpversion) = PGP::Sign::pgp_sign ($keyid,
$password, $emaildata);"
Then just print the email / pipe it through sendmail; whatever you would
normally do, adding $pgpsignature and $pgpversion.

I personally use Knode from the KDE suite - I think pan also supports GPG
signing of mail, and so can pine, although I wouldn't recommend that as a

Looks to me like either 1) your PATH env var is messed up 2) you are missing
development packages.
First thing to do, see if you actually have the things - you can check for
the rpm's with 'rpm -qa|grep gcc' to see if you have gcc (GNU cc). If you do
(which I doubt), then your PATH is messed. If you don't, you need to install
some of the development tools. I think this is the most likely problem, as
it's highly likely the default workstation install doesn't include any
development tools. You could also try something like 'locate make' to see if
you have any of the make tools - again, you probably don't, but if you do
that command will tell you where the binaries (executables) are.
If you do have the packages, then there is something wrong with your PATH.
This is basically a list of directories, stored as an environment variable.
Whenever you try to run something, it will check in these directories for
the binary. To check your PATH, do 'echo $PATH'. To add directorires to it,
you can either run 'export PATH=$PATH:/new/directory' (which will only be
temporary), or find the file in which your PATH is specified. This is read
in when you log in, so the changes will affect all your future sessions.
It's probably something like /etc/profile, ~/.bashrc or something like
that - if you can't find it, you can probably get away with tacking the
previous command onto the end of your ~/.bashrc.

@_subject: UID revocation 
I revoked a UID from my key, succesfully. If I now send my key to a
keyserver, and then retrieve it back again, the copy from the server
overwrites mine and reinstates the UID. Is this the correct behavious?
Shouldn't the keyserver distribute my modified key (minus the UID) ?

"The OpenPGP specification does not support user ID revocation, but a
user ID can effectively be revoked by revoking the self-signature on the
user ID. For the security reasons described previously, correspondents
will not trust a user ID with no valid self-signature."
Thanks for your help.

No, but you probably had version 1.0.7 on your old machine, and RedHat
only installed 1.0.6. You should upgrade.

alternatively (and preferably),  just remove the gpg rpm (rpm -e gnupg)
installed by redhat. that will remove the older 1.0.6 /usr/bin/ gpg
