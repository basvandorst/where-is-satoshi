@_subject: General newbe questions using GnuPG 
As a newbe, I have scanned the GnuPG FAQ looking for help on the question
of configuring GnuPG for encrypting and exchanging files between GnuPG 1.4.1
and a client site running GPG on AiX.
I am running GnuPG 1.4.1  on my end.
My client running PGP 6.52 on AIX.
I generated my key pair taking the defaults when prompted and used gpg --armor --export KeyID > testkey.pub In the FAQ, the section 5.1 (shown below) has no corresponding section on
"How can I encrypt a message with PGP so that GnuPG is able to decrypt it? As a newbe, I have not got a clue on what choices to make running gpg --gen-key to make the necessary PGP compatible public key.
On my system, I get:
Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) DSA and Elgamal (default)
   (2) DSA (sign only)
   (5) RSA (sign only)
Your selection? 1
DSA keypair will have 1024 bits.
ELG-E keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (2048) When I provide the key to my client and he uses it to encrypt
a test message using PGP 6.5 on AIX, I get the following when I try to decrypt it with GnuPG:
[smf] unix!/u/smf/test $ gpg --decrypt testfile.txt.pgp | head
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=6f)
Additionally: The key pair I generated was a test pair using a non existing user name, a random comment, and bogus
e-mail. (This test key is to be replaced with a production
key with appropriate name, comment, and e-mail ID after testing
is complete).  I then imported the test public key on my
office system and signed the public test key with my private key for my e-mail ID.  I exported the signed key
with: gpg --armor --export keyid > testkey2.pub and sent it via
email to my client. I can only trust that he did the appropriate steps on his AIX box to import the key and generate a test encrypted
message. The result of trying to decrypt the test message on the production system is shown above. When I use the signed public key on my office system to
encrypt a test file and transfer it to the production
system, I can decrypt the message without problem.                                       Steve Fabac

@_subject: Need help exchanging keys with PGP 6.5.2 on AIX 
I have not been successful in exchanging encrypted messages between
PGP 6.5.2 on AIX and GnuPG 1.4.1. I am still learning with GnuPG and the curve is steep. The FAQ has suggestions for Encrypting messages with
GnuPG for decryption with PGP, but no section on how to
generate compatible public/private keys for exchange with
PGP 6.5.2 on the AIX system. My first attempt to run gpg --gen-key and exchanging the
public key with the AIX administrator resulted in
when I tried to decrypt the test message. Then I tried and specified (1) DSA and Elgamal (default) and
DSA key pair will have 1024 bits.
ELG-E keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (2048) 1024
After sending the resulting public key to the AIX administrator,
decrypting the test message resulted in:
[smf] unix!/u/smf $ gpg --pgp6 --decrypt testfile.txt.pgp > bob
gpg: mpi too large (57092 bits)  and [smf] unix!/u/smf $ gpg --decrypt testfile.txt.pgp > bob
gpg: mpi too large (57092 bits)
What should I try next?                                       Steve Fabac

@_subject: New user problems please help 
I have downloaded the gnupg-1.4.1.tar.gz from as well as gnupg-1.4.1.tar.gz.sig
and followed the steps to verify the
archive by running
gpg --verify gnupg-1.4.1.tar.gz.asc
 (after renaming gnupg-1.4.1.tar.gz.sig to     gnupg-1.4.1.tar.gz.asc )
I get:
gpg: Signature made Tue Mar 15 10:29:15 2005 CST using DSA key ID 57548DCD
gpg: BAD signature from "Werner Koch (gnupg sig) "
