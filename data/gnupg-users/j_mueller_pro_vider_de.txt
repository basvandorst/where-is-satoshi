@_subject: GPG in a PHP-Script 
GnuPG 1.0.6
FreeBSD 4.2
Apache 1.3.11
PHP 4.0.6
When we try to clearsign a file from a command line, everything
works fine:
  % gpg --clearsign -ato test.sig test1.txt
But when we try to implement this as a system command into a
php-script, i.e.
  putenv("GNUPGHOME=/.gnupg");
  system("/path/to/gpg --clearsign -ato test.sig test.txt");
it's not working anymore and in the error_log it says
  /usr/libexec/ld-elf.so.1: Shared object "libiconv.so.2" not found
Does anybody has got that lib compiled for our environment which I
could just copy? What is that lib all about anyway and why does it
work with the command line?
Thanks you very much.
