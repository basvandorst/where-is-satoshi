Does anybody can point me the functions I need to:
. Generate a key pair;
. Encrypt/Decrypt a data buffer using one of the keys.
I'm gonna use gnupg to start a secure client-server connection to exchange a
DES (does DES do the job?) key that will be used to encrypt/decrypt all data
that passes over the connection. I know automatic generation of keys suck
because random number generators suck too, but I'll probably by using an
external hardware to generate true (?) random numbers.
Thanks in advance,
Andre de Leiradella

Sorry, I didn't made myself clear.
I know I can generate key pairs and encrypt/decrypt files using the command
line. What I really need is the C functions witch do it, so I can link them
into my programs.
About the random number generation, don't get me wrong. I'm using Linux
2.2.12 and I know /dev/random is ok, but so much is talked about random
numbers when it comes to key generation that I thought I needed something
more than it.
And thank you Frank for pointing me that DES won't do it. I'm already
looking for 3DES.

It sounds like you really need to look through the FAQ or README that is
distributed with GnuPG.
Why do you think the random number generation in GnuPG is bad?  I'm
assuming you're using an OS, of course, that has a _real_ /dev/random,
such as Linux or the BSD's.
Oh, and DES won't do the job.  Use something that is trusted and has a
decent keysize, such as maybe 3DES.  Look at  for
