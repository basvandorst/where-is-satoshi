@_subject: Create Subkey Binding 
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
I have a DSS/DH key pair that I'm trying to use with GPG. It refuses
to encrypt to the key because there is no subkey (i.e. gpg --list-key
0xMYKEYID doesn't list any "sub" keys). However, gpg --edit-key
0xMEKEYID...toggle lists the ssb. PGP 7.0.3 lists the key as having a
subkey, but doesn't allow it to be used for encryption. Running
pgpdump shows that there is no subkey binding. How can I create a
subkey binding so that this key can be used?

P.S. For those that are curious, I'm trying to import a key from
s-mail.com. If someone has an easier way to do this, I'd take that as
well. I'd still be curious to know if it's possible to add a subkey
