@_subject: Importing Public Keys with PHP 
Can anyone help, I've spent hours trying to get this to work!
My code is:
$pubfile="/home/httpd/vhosts/test.com/httpdocs/pubkeys/$subject" ;
$gnupg_path = '/home/httpd/vhosts/test.com/.gnupg';
$gpg = '/usr/bin/gpg';
$cmd = "$gpg --import $pubfile";
I echo the $cmd
usr/bin/gpg --import
Just to check it is ok! IT IS the correct syntex and works if I type it in
at the command prompt using "putty"
Then I call
Nothing Happens!
Any Help would be appreciated!
