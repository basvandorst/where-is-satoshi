@_subject: depreciated algorithm question 
Wrong order. Search first then ask.
6.13) With 1.0.4, I get "this cipher algorithm is deprecated ..." If you just generated a new key and get this message while encrypting, you've witnessed a bug in 1.0.4. It uses the new AES cipher Rijndael that is incorrectly being referred as "deprecated". Ignore this warning, more recent versions of gpg are corrected. It has been fixed in CVS and the next release will incorporate this.
A -very- quick search of the list archives gives a patch if you don't want to ignore it. Go to Trevor
