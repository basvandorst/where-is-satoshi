Ummm, it was designed that way. The keyservers are setup to merge/add
information in a key. There is no functionality for removing data. The
only option would be to revoke the old user id (with the old comment), add
a new user id and designate the new id as primary if applicable.
Although GnuPG handles the name, email address and comment as distinct,
the OpenPGP standard treats the concatenated fields as a single item.

Copy or rename your file.
You *REALLY* need the stuff in the registry. Here's a snippet:
HomeDir is the minimum requirement. When gpg starts (It's directory in in
your %PATH%, right?) it looks in HomeDir to find gpg.conf if OptFile isn't
set. Keyrings (pubring.gpg & secring.gpg are default names) are in HomeDir
or redirected in gpg.conf. "gpg --version" from the cmdline will tell you
where it is looking for the gpghome dir. Go ahead and and the gnupg
directory to the PATH environment variable in Control Panel.

GPG wants you to type a message because it wants to encrypt something.
This is the default behavior if you don't tell it to do something else,
like import a key from a keyserver.
Escape from the input prompt by typing an End-of-File mark (control-D on
unix; contol-Z on DOS)
Run gpg under windows from a command prompt (COMMAND.COM or CMD.EXE). If

Hash: SHA1
It /can/ be done, but it won't be very pretty. Just about all the defaults
and instructions for installing GnuPG on a Windows box are more in tune
with the way things were done on Win3.1 and Win95. Most of the work will
be in setting up each user.
There's no Windows Installer work done, so you will have to find some way
to create the necessary registry settings in HKCU; keyring directory for
each user; and have a base set of files copied in with default keyrings
and gpg.conf.
Getting gpg onto the %PATH% can be done either by adding it to the system
PATH setting or creating an AppPath entry. Since there is more than one
binary, adding it to the system PATH is probably easiest.
Following the Windows logo recommendations for location and such will
probably make it a bit easier to find ways to do most of this and ease
maintainence later.
My preference would be to get the Nullify build ZIP archive, install it in
%PROGRAMFILES%\GnuPG and use %USERPROFILE%\Application Data\GnuPG for the
location of HomeDir - put gpg.conf and default keyring files there. See
the file install.reg that accompanies Nullify.

Hash: SHA1
No, you got it right.
Even if you kept two distinct keyrings: one with the employee ID keypair
and the other with the radical ID keypair, assume the worst-case and
conclude that the key material (c|w)ould eventually end up being posted to
  keyservers and be re-united into one key.
Two roles && two VERY distinct identities ==> two keys. It would also be a
very good idea not to sign each key with the other, that could also
eventually lead back to both identities. Self-sign each key and leave it
at that.
If you use gpg/pgp at both home and work, it would be prudent to not have
your radical key on your work machine along with your employee key, at
least, not both secret keys (think: plausible deniability).
There is nothing good or bad about having multiple keypairs. It just boils
down to key management issues.

No, you are "correct". The registry entries are /only necessary/ when
GnuPG is located somewhere *other* than C:\GnuPG.
There are a few system management and security practices that would
recommend a different directories: keeping programs and user data
segregated; grouping program files -- applications versus OS files;
keeping user data under the user's profile directory; using the builtin OS
access restrictions to keep data secure...
C:\GnuPG\ as installation and GPG home directory works fine if you are
certain you are the only person that will ever use your machine --
otherwise anyone sitting at the keyboard has access to your keyrings and
any other GnuPG data that may also be there - key revocation cert perhaps?
You pick your threat model and security measures - you should also
appropriately pick your GnuPG installation directories.

Yeah, that avoids adding to the PATH, but is subject to breakage if
versions are different -- e.g. some app depending on a feature present in
version X, but version Y is somewhere earlier in the PATH. One of my
dislikes of WinPT was that it installed it's own copy of GNuPG, even when
one was already already present on the system.

Path is set to the path to said executable (for once the Windows API is
clear, if not blatantly obvious)
This technique also saves one from the multiple versions on the %PATH%
sand-trap as you can only have one key named gpg.exe. Adding the directory
to PATH is somewhat easier with a User-install of GnuPG as you have five
executables to worry about and the (possible) dependency of helper apps
such as GPGshell looking for the exe on the PATH.
I noticed the last couple Nullify releases have an installer exe that lets
you specify your choice of program and home dirs and then sets those
values in HKCU\Software\Gnu\GnuPG. Program and Keyring locations both
default to C:\GnuPG, instead of %ProgramFiles%\GnuPG and
%UserProfile%\Application Data\GnuPG, but it sure is a step in the right
direction, IMHO.

Hi Jeroen,
There are no stupid questions, however, the nonexistence of stupid answers
has yet to be proven. 8-})
There always seems to be some additional changes to Cygwin builds. You
might want to look at the existing Cygwin GnuPG source, IIRC, version
1.2.4 - there's a 90k patch to the gnupg tarball.
Since you're coming from a Windows environment, you should probably
consider MinGW/MSys with a few optional pieces from the SourceForge
GnuWin32 project.
GnuPG builds fine out-of-the-box with MinGW and doesn't have the
additional Cygwin-1.dll dependency.  You'll have some dependencies such as
zlib, bzip2, and iconv unless you static link that code.
If you want I can share my experience with your and get you started.
Just email me at this address.

Robert Golovniov was asking about it over the summer. But getting it to

2) no Win32 equivalent to 1) Microsoft's Services for Unix ships with a Sendmail - haven't even
checked it out, just know that it's there.
2) Wouldn't need to be a .exe. A .pl extension would normally call Perl to
 handle the file. But then the calling code in gpg would need to be hacked
to handle a non-standard call. 8-{(
Just thinking about this earlier in the week. Maybe rewrite entirely in
Perl with modules and then wrap it up in something like perl2exe, but I'm

@_subject: Install gnupg on a network drive (win2K) 
Hash: SHA1
Hello Jeroen,
What you wish to do is fairly straightforward. Forgive the level of
detail, you can gloss over the obvious bits.
You are probably using roaming profiles on Win2000 so that every time you
login, all your files and settings follow you. What makes the most sense
in this case is to install GnuPG binaries and have your GnuPG HomeDir both
reside on the network share.
As an example, let's say your personal network drive is mounted as H:\ and
all the "normal" Windows 2000 profile directories (Application Data; My
Documents; Start Menu;...) live there. I would, in this case, put things
in %APPDATA%\GnuPG. You can find out the value of %APPDATA% by opening a
command prompt (Run -> cmd.exe) and entering the command 'echo %APPDATA%'.
In our hypothetical case we'll use H:\Application Data\GnuPG.
Get the Nullify installer:
I'd prefer Nullify in this case since the installer handles almost
correctly setting the PATH and registry entries which are a common
vexation to new windows installations.
The installer will give the 'standard' close all programs warnings. Click
Next. It with then display the selection dialog for the location of the
program files. The default will be C:\GnuPG. Click Browse and browse to
the location on your network share where things will be installed: example
H:\Application Data (The installer will keep appending \GnuPG as you
browse. When the path is correct click OK then Next. You'll now be
presented with the keyring location selection dialog. Navigate to the same
directory selected for the program files. Click OK and Next. Backup copies
- - your call yes or no. Click Next and the Start Installation screen
appears. Click next and the files will be installed.
The installer will have set the PATH in the system environment table.
Which works is you're always using the same machine, but not if you move
around. Access the environment variables from Control Panel -> System ->
Advanced -> Environment Variables.
Double click Path in the system table, scroll to the end of the value,
highlight the ;H:\APPLIC~1\GNUPG and control-C to copy. Click Cancel.
Double click Path in the User table, scroll to the end and control-V to
paste. If it looks sane (no double semicolons, etc), Click OK twice.
Logoff and login back in. Open a command window and enter 'gpg --version'.
The command should run and also indicate the correct location for the gpg
Import or generate keys. Create key revocation cert. Backup revocation
cert and keyrings to a floppy of other safe media. Edit gpg.conf as
needed, etc...

would be to house all such info as contacts on an Exchange server.

GRRRRR. Morons. I can see why you say they couldn't handle a PCMCIA

I wonder where they get the copy of ntuser.dat (HKCU) to copy into

hehe, I'm old on PCs (Altair 8080 and DEC LSI-11 anyone?) but WinPT's
self-install of GnuPG caused me some minor grief -- version didn't match
what I had just built and installed, but otherwise worked). The worse one
was Cygwin, in that case the version was wrong AND it couldn't find my
keys. Fixed by moving C:\Progra~1\GnuPG closer to front of PATH
You could add a line to Autoexec.NT like
set PATH=%PATH%;H:\blah\GnuPG
  a) it has to be done on every machine
  b) it only works for a cmd.exe shell (aka MS-DOS-box)
  c) the file lives in C:\WinNT\system32 -- good luck with the permissions
     to modify it
  d) The needed registry key HKCU\Software\GNU\GNUPG\HomeDir can't be
     handled this way
It would probably be easier to write a short C program to check and modify
the registry if need be. See .../util/w32reg.c in the gnupg sources

OK, you wrote then:
The crowd that knows about MinGW is somewhat small. The MSys bunch is
*much* smaller -- mingw-msys generates 1/10 the traffic of mingw-users.
Since this is the GnuPG list, you are dealing with the intersection of the
two -- arguably a small domain of experience.
I've seen the behavior you describe. It occurs when running either
GnuPG.org's or Nullify's gnupg build within MSYS's Bourne shell.
The fix is simple. Run gpg from a Win32 shell, cmd.exe.
MSYS's documentation (MSYS_Welcome.rtf) states:
There is enough support for ./configure && make. That's it. I'm not sure
if the MSYS-developer package would help you or not in this case.
If you ABSOLUTELY require a Posix environment, then take a look at Cygwin,
AT&T UWin, or (gackk) Microsoft's SFU. All $free. A quick test shows that
Cygwin's gpg works fine under MSYS's /bin/sh (utilizes $GNUPGHOME and
~/.gnupg instead of Windows Registry settings).
Since you seem to have pegged the problem, you may want to post to
mingw-users or mingw-msys and see if there is a work-around or fix available.

Excerpt: "Why GAO Did The Study: The federal government is increasingly
using online applications to provide access to information and services
and to conduct internal business operations. In light of this trend,
strong security assurances are needed to properly safeguard sensitive,
personal, and financial data, in part by ensuring that the identities of
those who use such applications are appropriately authenticated. When
fully and properly implemented, public key infrastructure (PKI) offers
many of these assurances. In 2001, GAO reported that the federal
government faces a number of challenges in deploying PKI technology
(GAO-01-277). GAO was requested to follow up this work by (1) determining
the status of federal PKI activities, including initiatives planned or
under way at 24 major federal departments and agencies, as well as the
status and planned activities of the Federal Bridge Certification
Authority (FBCA) and Access Certificates for Electronic Services (ACES)
programs, and (2) identifying challenges encountered by the 24 agencies in
implementing PKI initiatives since the 2001 report was issued."

There should really be no need to change to a new key unless the old key expires

Since you mentioned you changed from PGP to GnuPG above, you can migrate all

Your export didn't export your secret key. Exporting secret keys has
certain security risks. See --export-secret-key in the 1.4.0 man page.
BTW, you want to make positive you have 1.4.0a on the Windows box.
On your windows box, open a CMD window and run
I bet only the public key is there.
I don't know your network setup, but you could more easily transfer the
public and secret keyring files (in binary) over a secure network
connection (scp or sftp) or on a FAT formatted floppy.
If the transfer is always going to be from the AIX box to the NT box, you
don't need nor do you *REALLY* want your secret key on the AIX box.
Generate a keypair sans passphrase on the NT box and export the PUBLIC key
to the AIX box. Use that to encrypt TO the NT box. Each secret key should
have only one home - especially one with no passphrase.
If you are encrypting data both ways consider a pair of keypairs (easily
extended to more machines), with each machine having it's own
public+secret keypair along with the public key(s) of the machine(s) it's
sending encypted files.
You can even sign and encrypt using the two keypair scheme: AIX uses its
secret key to sign the file, then encrypts it to NT's public key. The
encrypted data is transferred. NT then uses its secret key to decrypt the
file and AIX's public key to verify the signature.
This is a good approach if you're emailing the files. But if you're
transferring directly from one machine to the other with no relays, you
may want to look at OpenSSH and scp or sftp as a better mousetrap to more
easily solve this problem.

There is no need to uninstall PGP. GnuPG and PGP coexist rather well. You

iconv.dll - covered on gpgconf page above. Download
ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/binary/libiconv-1.9.1.dll.zip, extract
iconv.dll to same directory with GnuPG executables. Warning will go away.
The registry keys control where GnuPG looks for some of its files.
The HomeDir registry key controls where GnuPG looks for/writes keyring
files (This is not 100% the case, but it'll do for 99.9% of the cases).
In your case C:\GnuPG.
The default location of the translation files (*.mo) would be
C:\GnuPG\Locale in this case.
No real need to create a new keypair, unless you want the practice. Your
old PGP keypair will work.

GnuPG is PERFECTLY usable on a multi-user Windows machine, as long as
'multi-user' is limited to WinNT, Win2000, & WinXP - 'multi-user' on
Win9x/ME was after-market bolt-on chrome.
It depends on how it is installed and configured. Storing GnuPG's programs
and keyrings in the DOS-inspired C:\GnuPG is indeed not shareable on a
multi-user machine. But that is a flaw committed by the installing person,
not the GnuPG software.
Take a look at  for a guide on
installing GnuPG in a multi-user manner on a Windows machine: Programs
located under %ProgramFiles% and user preferences and keyrings in
%APPDATA%\GnuPG. It is even possible to create a global registry setting
to default HomeDir for all users. Advanced configs are quite possible with
user's keyrings stored on a network share.
This has been my experience since I began using GnuPG with 1.2.1. Nothing
in this regard is new in 1.4 - it's been there all along.

That response to nslookup tells me your DNS setup is NOT ok. You could be
getting a DNS resolver timeout causing the lookup to fail.
The D-Link 604-e is wonderfully dodgy at doing DNS forwarding - at least
that my experience with ours.
Try this to see if it's DNS that's the problem: list keyserver.kjsl.com in
your hosts file (%winDir%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts on Win2k, /etc/hosts
on *nix):
69.36.241.130	keyserver.kjsl.com
See if your problem 'resolves' itself. You'll need to flush the name cache
on Windows after changing the hosts file (ipconfig /flushdns).
Check your router, see  and setup
your Windows box(es) to use the DNS servers your broadband provider
supplies to the router in the DHCP setup.  I'd suggest some, but I don't
know who's your ISP. Just setup your Windows box to use a static address
on 192.168.0/24, netmask 255.255.255.0, gateway 192.168.0.1, and whatever
DNS servers your ISP says to use.
I think FreeBSD would have the same problems. Your problem looks to be DNS
resolver related. If *BSD was configured with 'nameserver 192.168.0.1' in

Hash: SHA1
BZIP2 support isn't standard in Win32, so MinGW won't have an import
library for it. Ditto ICONV and ZLIB. You can get the deveopment library
files in the -lib packages available at SourceForge's GnuWin32 project.
You'll need the DDLs frmo the -bin archives to be installed on the Windows
system along with your GnuPG binaries.
Since your User-Agent string is showing Mozilla on Windows 2000, why not
build GnuPG directly on your windows platform and avoid the cross-compile
GnuPG configures and builds out-of-the-box under current MinGW/Msys
distributions. The binaries and development packages (-bin & -lib) for
bzip2, iconv and zlib are also needed from the GnuWin32 project at
SourceForge. The MinGW site also has a GnuPG porting file with build
script and handy patches.
Building the GnuPG software from cvs requires a few more packages and a
bit more tweaking.
You can write me offlist if you need a bit more assistance with this.

I can only guess how Werner is doing it. I've not asked him.
Downloading and building the bzip2 sources, then adding
'--with-bzip2=' to configure was the way I used it to static link in
the bzip2 code back before I switched over to the dll from the GnuWin32
'--with-included-zlib' or '--with-zlib=' would do the same with the

Hash: SHA1
I don't know that "extended the standard" is the language I'd use. More to
the point would be "second guessed the IETF OpenPGP WG". Did they even
meet at last week's IETF meeting? The current draft, rfc2440bis-12,
expires in May of this year.
Granted Jon Callas of PGP Corp. is a member of the OpenPGP WG, but I think
PGP Corp. is just trying to predict what will happen in the near term with
DSS/DSA and be ready to market the new solution.
DSS and DSA are NIST standards (FIPS-180 and FIPS-186) and 'official'
changes to them will come from NIST after the usual solicitation and
comment periods. (Much like the selection of AES to replace DES.)
Yes, some of the likely successors to SHA-1 are already implemented in
GnuPG 1.4, but I wouldn't try to second guess NIST (too much of that went
on with AES). Perhaps SHA-256|384|512 and even Tiger will be elevated to
'interim solutions' while DSA-2 is being formulated.
My view is that it doesn't make sense /right now/ to break DSS/DSA by ad
hoc extensions. The new hashes are already in GnuPG 1.4, they can be fully
enabled once the new standard is in place. Changing now is premature.
Until then, if one is *REALLY* paranoid, maybe he/she should consider
using 2048 bit RSA keys. 8-})

NEWS file: Melissa Reese started a nice upgrade thread over on PGP-Basics.  Perhaps
you could check that.
Your upgrade concerns will mainly be dependent upon how you first setup
GnuPG. If you followed the old C:\GnuPG way you'll have more to change
than if you followed the page at (Points go to Werner - his program location is /more correct/ than ours.)
We agree on the keyring location, is all that should need to be changed in
your PATH.
FWIW the only change I had to make after using the installer was to add
the characters "Gnu/" to my PATH environment variable. Of course, YMMV.
If you use other programs such as GPGshell, WinPT, or GPGrelay, they make
use of non-GnuPG registry entries such as OptFile and gpgProgram - You
will have to fix these yourself.
BTW, I had to change some of my build scripts to reference \Gnu\GnuPG
instead of just \GnuPG under %ProgramFiles%, but that will only affect
folks who build the code for themselves.
We'll be rewriting the gpgconf page at the Enigmail site in the next few
days to reflect the 1.4.1 installer.

@_subject: Changing Home Directory of GPG 
Hash: SHA1
The installer didn't change the registry key for GnuPG's HomeDir.
Here's the upgrade step-by-step: (I posted this earlier in the week on
PGP-Basics). This assumes you had everything in C:\GnuPG.
0) Keep C:\GnuPG as your backup.
1) Download and run installer.
  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/GnuPG/binary/gnupg-w32cli-1.4.1.exe (1406k)
  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/GnuPG/binary/gnupg-w32cli-1.4.1.exe.sig
2) Copy keyrings and option preferences. Open a CMD window
4) Fix PATH if necessary. Right-click My Computer; select Properties.
(same as Control Panel ->System). Win2k/XP: Advanced tab -> Environment
Variables. Locate Path among the environment variables and click 'Edit'.
If GnuPG was in the path before, change the location to the new location
(default is C:\Program Files\Gnu\GnuPG). If not present, add it to the
beginning of the string. 'Program Files' may usually be abbreviated
'Progra~1' if you're tight on room. Click OK three times to close the
System Properties dialog.
5) Update Registry values:
a) Using Regedit.exe
   Open the registry and expand HKEY_CURRENT_USER, then Software,
   Gnu and finally GnuPG. In the right-hand panel, double click "HomeDir"
   and change its value to reflect the new Home directory:
   This is the only change required for GnuPG. If you are also using
   or have used GPGrelay, GPGshell, or WinPT, you may have two additional
   values to change:
     gpgProgram = "C:\Program Files\Gnu\GnuPG\gpg.exe"
     OptFile =
   You don't include the quotes (") when entering the values in the
   text boxes. Ignore any other values under this key. Exit RegEdit.
   go to Step 6.
b) Using a Registry patch file. We cover this in great detail on the
Enigmail GnuPG for Windows page (
Briefly you need to use notepad to construct a file containing your new
values and save it with a .REG extension. Close Notepad and double-click
the new .REG file in Explorer - answer Yes/OK to include the file into the
Registry.  Your file should look like (just the stuff between the "++++"
"HomeDir"="C:\\Documents and Settings\\user\\Application Data\\GnuPG"
"gpgProgram"="C:\\Program Files\\Gnu\\GnuPG\\gpg.exe"
"OptFile"="C:\\Documents and Settings\\user\\Application
Change 'user' in the abouve to your user name (servie). The OptFile line
should be all on one line - the email probably wrapped.
6) Test installation. Open a new CMD window, 'gpg --version' should show
something similar to:
C:\WINNT>gpg --version

Hash: SHA1
There is NO officially recommended or endorsed key server.
pgp.mit.edu works fine for older keys. It runs the PGP Key Server (pks). PKS
does not handle V4 key features well. Notable examples of mangled features
are multiple subkeys, a revoked subkey (tag 0x28), duplicate keyids, direct
key signatures (tag 0x1F), revocation signatures on userids (tag 0x30), or
photo IDs. There is also no development or maintenance being done on the pks
platform. One exception to the pks servers is keyserver.kjsl.com, which has
been patched to not mangle keys; however, it drops photo IDs.
The one PKS server at kjsl.com, the LDAP keyservers (only one is still on
the 'net and it's unsynchronized, ldap://keyserver-legacy.pgp.com), and the
SKS servers handle v4 keys correctly.
The current platform of choice is known as the Synchronizing Key Server
(SKS). It is written to fully comply with OpenPGP specifications.
subkeys.pgp.net is a round-robin DNS lookup of four servers. Three SKS
servers and the server at keyserver.kjsl.com.
The address some of my correspondents and myself and refer to most users is
x-hkp://random.sks.keyserver.penguin.de. It's a round-robin alias that is
updated daily with the operational servers in SKS' universe.
For my own use, I use minsky.surfnet.nl. It's easy for me to remember (Yaron

You could edit the message or use sed to replace the build OS and GnuPG
version strings with your choice, but you ruled that out already.
So, the final option is to build your own binaries. (see below)
It's much easier to edit config.h after ./configure and before make and
change the define of PRINTABLE_OS_VERSION to whatever you'd like it to be.

Ummm that won't work. GnuPG looks in the homedir for the conf file, so
putting the homedir option in gpg.conf is rather pointless.  This is also
stated in the man page. You read that, right? ;-}
  --homedir directory
       Set  the  name  of  the  home  directory to directory If this
       option is not used it defaults to  "~/.gnupg".  It  does  not
       make sense to use this in a options file. This also overrides
       the environment variable $GNUPGHOME.
It sounds like you're trying to recreate the work the GPG2GO folks did on
your own.
There are essentially two ways to so this.
1) If you're always moving between the same systems:
Use the default GnuPG HomeDir (~/.gnupg on *nix; %APPDATA%\GnuPG on Windows)
and set gpg.conf to point to the files on the removable media; e.g.
2) The other approach is to set the environment variable GNUPGHOME to point
to where ever gpg.conf and the keyring files are stored. This is the
approach the GPG2GO folks use, IIRC.
Can give better answers if we know what sort of environment you're targeting.

Like you, I refreshed from a SKS server and found 120 new sigs on my key,

Over on PGP-Basics, someone asked what was the purpose of the 'clean'
command in GnuPG. A good friend of mine replied, "It undoes the damage
caused by the PGP Universal key server."
Like you, I regret ever submitting my key to that nightmare. I ignored all
the renewal emails.
I can't say if the PGP signatures were always the problem, but importing my
full keyring to clean it in the process reduced a 750 key ring from ~8MB to
~6MB, just under 1/3 (32%) reduction.
Maybe --clean-keys could be added as a command to GnuPG, like --check-sigs.
Perhaps autocleaning keys is something the SKS keyserver folks will
introduce. They seem to have the only active development taking place.
And I second the thanks to Werner, David, Timo, and the rest of the GnuPG

you can CTRL-C to copy the key in PGPkeys and import from clipboard with
WinPT or GPGshell.
The PGP-Basics Yahoo! group can help you a lot more on this. Several of the

How do I say "It's more trouble than it's worth"? You have to use PGP as an
intermediate step. The CA cert on X.509 certificate is not recognized by
GnuPG 1.4.x and shows up as a signature from keyid 0x00000000. PGP will
consider the X.509 as a valid key if you import the CAs keys and sign them
as a trusted introducer.  For GnuPG to consider the X.509 RSA key material
valid you need to either sign the key with your default key or self-sign the

Also, Enigmail WILL NOT use X.509 keys. You have most likely configured
S/MIME to use your Thawte certificate. That's the 'Security' tab in TB's

You may also specify the keyserver option in gpg.conf.
The first part of the URL; ldap:, hkp:, finger:, http:; tells gpg.exe which
helper program to select.
Not sure what is meant by 'Gnu/Gpg "home" dir'. HomeDir is a registry entry
where GnuPG looks to find an individual user's settings and keyrings
(typically %APPDATA%\GnuPG).  Beginning with 1.4.1, Windows versions of
GnuPG do not use %PATH% to locate the keyserver helpers (gpgkeys_*). From
  "The installation directory of GnuPG is stored in the Registry under
  the key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\GNU\GnuPG with the name "Install
  Directory".  The installer does not change the PATH environment
  variable to include this directory.  You might want to do this
  manually.
  Note, that this registry entry is also used to locate the keyserver
  helper programs (e.g. gpgkeys_ldap)."
Assuming you used the GnuPG installer to install 1.4.2, gpg.exe as well as
the packages keyserver helper .EXEs should all be located in
%PROGRAMFILES%\Gnu\GnuPG (PROGRAMFILES typically expands to
C:\Program Files).

Yes, it's possible spammers will harvest addresses from keyservers. But you'll

I know of only one way to prevent yourself from receiving SPAM - Don't use email.
Yes, make the webmail address your primary UID. But you will still need to have
the other address as an UID on you key if correspondents are to find your key.
Lookup in mail programs is typically by email address. Keyservers may be
searched by name, email address or Key ID.
You may send encrypted mail to anyone using OpenPGP compliant software: GnuPG,

Registry editing isn't as scary as MSFT would make it sound.
But for the Squeemish, defining the environment variable GNUPGHOME and setting
its value to your new location will override the registry's HomeDir value.
(Control Panel --> System --> Advanced --> 'Environment Variables' button).
That will work for GnuPG. I can't guarantee that it will work for all other
programs such as GPGrelay, GPGshell, WinPT. I've never had much luck trying to
change things with GPGconfig; I tend to only use it asa  sanity check to show

Unless you have some specific need, eg work vs play, you /really/ don't need to
generate another key. Just copy the keyring files from your first PC. But since
the emails address is the same, It'd be easier just to use your existing key(s).
Please run the GnuPG installer and accept the defaults for GnuPG's directory
placements. You'll have a *MUCH* easier time by doing so. Using C:\GnuPG is
great for Windows 95 and earlier. It's not so good for XP.
You do need the PATH set if you intend to use GnuPG at the command prompt.

using Enigmail. Check the Enigmail site? There's a windows specific page there,

PGP anf GnuPG store 'trust' settings in different ways. PGP stores it and part
of the key; gnuPG uses a separate file. You should be able to imprt your PGP
keyring files directly into GnuPG, eg.
Imported key *pairs* will need to be set to Ultimate trust. This corresponds to
the 'Implicit Trust' check box in PGP's Key Properties box. Keys that were set
to Full or Partial trust in PGP will need to have those settings reapplied in
GnuPG - You can do this with WinPT or GPGshell or even the command line.

You should also move the trustdb to the pendrive. First copy it then add the
following line to gpg.conf:
--trustdb-name /path/to/pendrive/trustdb.gpg
The default in the registry is %APPDATA%\GnuPG. That expands to
C:\Documents and Settings\\Application Data\GnuPG". You should
probably store gpg.conf on your pen drive and choose one of the methods below
for overriding the default - that way, you are taking the complete environment
with you on the pen drive.
There are three ways of changing it. In increasing priority
1) Use Regedit.exe, navigate to the key HKCU\Software\Gnu\GnuPG and change the
   HomeDir value
2) set the environment variable GNUPGHOME
3) include --homedir /path/to/pendrive/ on the commnd line each time you

The user has installed GnuPG on a flash/USB drive along with keyrings. He's
looking for a GUI GnuPG front end.
OptFile and gpgProgram are not GnuPG entries. They are set by other programs
which use GnuPG, such as GPGrelay.
GnuPG first tries to find gpg.connf and keyrings in its default location:
~/.gnupg on *nix type systems or by looking up the registry value
HKCU\Software\GNU\GNUPG\HomeDir on Win32 systems.
The default location may be overridden by setting the environment variable
GNUPGHOME. The environment variable GNUPGHOME may be overridden by specifying
the --homedir option on the command line. This is documented behavior.
Copying the GnuPG files from the installation directory and keyring files
from one' HomeDir to the USB/Flash device and then setting up an initialization
BAT script that adds the binaries to your PATH and sets GNUPGHOME and you have
GnuPG working on the USB/Flash device. This is the approach used by the GPG2GO
One of the more common applications users want along with GnuPG on a portable
flash device is email. Portable Thunderbird and Enigmail handle this quite well
with no registry involvement. Enigmail also supplies a simple key management GUI
As far as more full-featured GnuPG front ends for Win32, WinPT and GPGshell both
store user preferences under HKCU\Software. I don't recall if there is a
requirement that these be installed in order to function, but I don't believe
there is. If there is enough interest, I'm sure a version of WinPT could be
knocked together that relied on CONF/INI files instead of the Windows registry

Many in the PGP Mobile camp have taken that as a promise that "When Palm OS 6
ships, we'll have PGP Mobile 3.0 ready."
Garnet (Palm OS 5.x) still seems to be Palm's OS of choice. Cobalt (Palm OS 6)
doesn't seem any closer to shipping. And with ACCESS now driving Palm OS
development, an all-Linux Palm OS is rumored on the horizon, even with the
developer site still pushing Cobalt.

I think there is a binary, possibly part of GPG4WIN.
I'd try GPGshell.
You might want to look at the GPG2GO project, I think they may have already

@_subject: Can't propagate key through public keyservers 
I wouldn't, and it has nothing to do with the server choice.
Remember, we're discussing automatic key retrieval specified in gpg.conf. One
doesn't have a forty server drop-down list to cycle through, so it needs to be a
best guess.
What if blackhole.pca.dfn.de is down or otherwise unreachable? Or foo.baz.net?
Or ...? As Bjoern indicated, sks.keyserver.penguin.de is down at the moment even
though it may be the perfect choice otherwise.
Recommending a single server also is *not* good net citizenship in a case such
as this. It is the type of advice that causes servers to be overloaded with an
undue amount of traffic as users take such recommendations as 'Gospel'.
Ultimately it's the users that suffer the bottleneck. In the worst case, the
administrator takes the machine offline; bandwidth costs money - directing all
inquiries to a single server is irresponsible. For a comparison, I'll direct you
to the recent case of D-Link, which had all of their routers throughout the
world hammering a single NTP server in Denmark for time updates. See
random.sks.keyserver.penguin.de is a DNS round-robin updated nightly with the
currently reachable SKS servers. This removes servers that have been down from
consideration. Only if there is trouble that day or at the same time as the
query could one worry about the server being unreachable. A round-robin also
spreads the load among all servers, and since this is SKS, it really is
unimportant which server you use to update or query.
random.sks.keyserver.penguin.de provides the best solution of the perennial
"which server should I use" question. With keyservers just as with keys, it is
best to stick with a default behavior unless you have a clear and sensible
reason not to do so.

Could you be a bit more specific than 'doesn't work'? That's a huge amount of
territory to try and debug. FWIW, this is the first I have heard of such an
issue on either this, the Enigmail list, or PGP-Basics.
When one selects 'Upload Public Keys to Keyserver' from Enigmail key management
window, Enigmail pops up a window with a drop-down selection for Keyserver.
Which keyserver is being selected? Has he tried a different selection?

@_subject: Compiling GnuPG 1.4.5  for Windows on Windows 
Not exactly a GnuPG-Users level question, Unless you have a specific requirement
to build your own binaries, you will find it much easier sticking to the
prebuilt installer.
Most any system administrator or developer with a background in building
POSIX-type software should be able to handle it without too much difficulty. It
is certainly much easier now than it was three years ago.
If you are looking to use any version of Microsoft's Visual Studio, forget it.
The official method is cross-compiling on a Debian system for win32. To build
natively on win32, one would normally start by Googling gnupg+win32+building.
Here's a short summary of the steps needed.
First thing you need is a build environment.
1) Go to the MinGW project at Sourceforge. Install the following packages at a
2) You need a shell to execute configure, make and possibly autotools so install
MSYS from the same site.
3) Now head to the GnuWin32 project (also at SourceForge). Download and install
into the MinGW root:
4) Goto  and download and install the current
curl (7.15.4) IIRC. Can't help with the exact file to download as I built
(openssl and) curl myself
Now you are ready to grab the source and compile it.
Using your browser or ftp client download the GnuPG-1.4.5 source and signature
files. Verify the source tarball.
Open a MSYS shell window
If all went well, running the command 'g10/gpg --version' from the top level
source directory will return something similar to:
You may find detailed step-by-step instructions at Carlo Bianco's "Building
GnuPG for Win32 using MinGW" page, but he takes extra steps that IMO are
unnecessary. The only one I've ever used is patching the one test under make
check. (

@_subject: Synchronize keyrings 
If you're signing keys with local signatures include
   --import-options import-local-sigs
before --import or in each machine's gpg.conf
On the windows box	gpg --import pubring.gpg.linux
On the linux box	gpg --import pubring.gpg.windows
I'll leave it to you to decide the best way to get each of the public keyring
files copied to the other machine. Just make sure you don't overwrite one of the
files when copying.
BTW, this also works for the secret keyring, secring.gpg.
 There is no guarantee that this will continue to work. The keyring storage
format is up to the implementation authors and is subject to change.
The canonical approach is to export, transfer, then import.

There were a couple messages last year on the [cryptography] mailing list wrt
ECC and patents:
      Patents are a major roadblock to ECC's wider acceptance. Even the NSA opted to
avoid any patent-related problems by licensing 26 MQV-based ECC patents from
Certicom in a US$25 million deal. According to the NSA's web site:
  "Despite the many advantages of elliptic curves and despite the adoption of
   elliptic curves by many users, many vendors and academics view the
   intellectual property environment surrounding elliptic curves as a major
   roadblock to their implementation and use. Various aspects of elliptic curve
   cryptography have been patented by a variety of people and companies around
   the world. Notably the Canadian company, Certicom Inc. holds over 130 patents
   related to elliptic curves and public key cryptography in general."
      - Actually the ECC code in OpenSSL was supplied by Sun and is patented by Sun. Sun
contributed the code in 2002, but it was not made part of OpenSSL until 2005, as
part of OpenSSL 0.9.8. On the patented code, Sun says:
   Q7: What about the patented technology in the contributed code?
   Sun acknowledges that it has some patented ECC technology in the contributed
   code.
   Sun grants to OpenSSL users the right to make use of the contributed patented
   technology in the context of OpenSSL.
   Sun does not intend to assert its patent rights associated with the code that
   was delivered to the OpenSSL project. Sun simply asks that anyone holding
   patents associated with the same code agree not to assert them against Sun in
   return.
   Sun does not forbid people from using the donated code on the basis of
   whether or not they make this promise.
