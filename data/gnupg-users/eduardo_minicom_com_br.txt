@_subject: Where's my private key? 
Hi folks.
Yesterday I needed to crypt one config file on my Linux box and was
wondering where is my private key, cause I have the private key in my
desktop (in my company) and I need to open a crypted file in my house.
How can I 'take' my private key from company to work?
