@_subject: Configure error libgcrypt and libgpg-error  
I am trying to install the GPG 2.0 package and need to first install the prereq packages, as listed in the readme.
GnuPG 2.0 depends on the following packages:
  libgpg-error (ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgpg-error/)
  libgcrypt    (ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgcrypt/)
  libksba      (ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libksba/)
  libassuan    (ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libassuan/)
I have just compiled and installed the libgpg-error-1.7 package  (on a AIX 6.1 system -PowerPC Power6) ) .  Then I tried to install the libgcrypt -1.4.4 package next, but the configure step failed with the error,
checking whether padlock support is requested... yes
checking for gpg-error-config... no
checking for GPG Error - version >= 1.4... no
configure: error: libgpg-error is needed.
                See ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgpg-error/ .
although this package did install fine, and this file is located under the default lib dir of /usr/local/lib.
Any idea?
