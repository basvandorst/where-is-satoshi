@_subject: How large is the EEPROM of OpenPGP Card v2.1? 
Hi All,
(Not sure if this is the right list to discuss hardware.)
I've read "
but didn't find any information about its EEPROM size.
Anyone knows how large it is?
Thanks in advance!

@_subject: How to get your first key signed 
So you three will share the same reputation on the mailing list.
If at least one of you commit crimes with your signed messages,
you will share the same legal liability unless proved not guilty
by other means, e.g. your private key was stolen or was derived
from your public key by the others, and etc..
I don't think that's a problem because it doesn't cause any confusion
neither online nor offline.
It's sad to hear that anyone takes it seriously to check that
a certificate's email address matches the originating mail address.
This really messes things up in the sense that it causes
additional inconvenience with little benefit.
I sign my files with exactly the same key no matter if they were sent
from my private email, business email, with IM tools, via http or fax.
In the last three cases there is no originating email address to check.
Of course I can use different keys, but what's the point?
More keys, more smart cards, more easily lost or forgotten,
more difficult to recognize by eye from their fingerprints ...

While the key is used to certify the email / IM name / website, etc.
and not the other way round, it is certainly helpful to check both.
So you are right.
However, note that an email inbox can be hijacked as well as a regular mailbox.
... After some thoughts, I found that for all the contact methods
(various email addresses, IMs, websites) where I use my key, I had
identified myself
by person to my frequent contacts before.
So the signatures really mean that "this email / IM account has not
been compromised",
and not that "this key is probably compromised".

The word "will" does not infer history. You know by reputation
I meant personal reputation, not the arabic numbers
or green boxes shown on the webpage, don't you?
What happened to being guilty once proven guilty until
proven innocent?
Your key is the proof. If you all believe digital signature
can't prove anything, why do you use it at all?

It's a kind of weak proof in China, and is much more than nothing.
I have absolutely no idea of the situation in the Netherlands. Peter knows.
In the U.S., obviously, no proof is needed to convict someone.
I've been *assumed* spying already after another Chinese citizen whom
I never heard of was *only* suspected, only because we worked for
the same department.
Neither digital nor non-digital signatures change racism. So this is irrelevant.

Hello NIIBE,
I tried the combination of
  pcsc-lite-1.8.14
  ccid-1.4.20
  gnupg-2.0.29 (configured with --disable-ccid-driver)
Both 2048 and 4096-bit keys can be generated without error.
Also tried gnupg-2.0.29 using its internal ccid-driver with debug output
enabled in "$HOME/.gnupg/scdaemon.conf". There was indeed a timeout.
Thomas, Thank you for your information! It's good to know
that gnupg 2.1.6 works, though I have have no time to setup
a test system for modern gnupg (2.1.x) at present.
Thank you all, and

Sorry, was too sleepy last night and did not click on "Reply to all".
Ok quite clear, that means if RSA falls, so had ECC already.
Didn't know these cryptosystems before.
Thanks very much for pointing out to these keywords! This is readlly helpful.

This post is just another example to show that your feeling is wrong
because I read your example of hijacked thread.
Now you need one more example to show top posters not reading before
BTW, It is common sense that the Ubuntu community is a mess, and has
nothing to do with top or bottom or front or rear posting.

Just remember that it is you, and not the one questioned you,
who need to look for stuff to support yourself.
A mailing list may recommend bottom posting, and users had better follow it.
This is perfectly fine.
However, arbitrarily concluding that top posters don't read what s/he's
is absurd and insulting, which is definitely worse than not following the
top posting rule of the mailing list.
This is my concluding remark of this thread.

Actually there is reason to discuss it here because the original
problem was if splitting before encryption is necessary.
For the "split" part, a "--filter" option has been available since
five years ago (version 8.13 of gnu coreutils).

Hi All,
All mails from gnupg-users are identified as spams by gmail since
yesterday. Google says that the mailing list "is in violation of Google's
recommended email sender guidelines".
Why does it happen? This is the first time that I see 100% false positive
of the gmail spam filter.

@_subject: Changing PINs of German bank card 
This is probably a general question --
I have never seen a German bank that allows changing the PIN of a card.
So I wonder if it is because using a fixed (non-changeable) 4-digit PIN
mailed in clear text really safer than using a 4 to 6 digit variable length
PIN that never explicitly appears anywhere.
If German banks are right, then should I follow their method and store the
PINs of my OpenPGP cards on a piece of paper?

@_subject: Changing PINs of German bank card 
before delivery. Looks like I'm the last to read it.
Two  other advantages (correct me if I'm mistaken) of self-invented PINs
are, I think,
1) One can prepare and remember the PIN in advance, so there is practically
no need to write it down;
2) A PIN letter is only something I have, while my own PIN record is in
addition something I know. i.e., it may not be obvious to someone else to
be a PIN record / reminder.

@_subject: Changing PINs of German bank card 
change the PIN.
And I don't think the bank needs the hash of the PIN. They may need the
hash of the key(s) protected by the PIN, however.
