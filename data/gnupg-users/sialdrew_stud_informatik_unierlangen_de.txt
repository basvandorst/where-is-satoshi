@_subject: userids and subkeys 
I've got a general question about userids and subkeys. I've already read
the manuals but to me it doesn't get clear.
I've got a view email-address which i use in different situations, one
for private, another to universal correspondence, ... . Because of this, i created a gpg key for my private address and added subkeys for all
others. So far so good.
