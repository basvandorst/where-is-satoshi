@_subject: Using gpg for french law 
I am not a crypto expert but blowfish is 128bit (or less?). ELG key is a
diferent scale all together, and only it only encripts the 128 bit
blowfish session key. That bit count on a ELG key is how large the
number to be factored is.  They are not compairable to each other as far
as strength.  I don't know is this is going to help but I thought I
would throw that out there.  Also a 128bit ELG key I think would be
pretty insecure because as far as a computer is concerned that is a
small number to be factored. I am not a math guru but it seems that way
to me.
Good Luck

The manual, is on line and available in postscript. I downloaded
manual.ps and converted it to a pdf with ghostscript for reading. I
think it is pretty complete. The manpages are nice to refer to.

@_subject: Using gpg for french law 
Ok, so does that mean our friend from France is out of luck because it
is capable of going to what... a 3584 bit Encryption key? Also why I
have your attention what benifet is twofish? Why keep it at a 128 bit
session key? Symmetric keys usually compress faster then Public, right?
With that in mind why not max out what blowfish is able to do. Have you
heard of GnuPG supporting big keys? PGP will do 16K now. I know it is
almost rediculus that we need that key I was nust wondering it is was
Ahh I stand corrrected, the manual let me to believe it was a factoring
At least I score 1... OK a half :-)
pun? :-)

cat messagefile | gpg -sear user | sendmail -v user
This will take the message in messagefile encrypt, sign and uuencode and
send it to user using his/her key.

@_subject: GPG and mail 
I agree, Since the person asking the question did not say what mail
client I was trying to put it at the lowest level possible so he/she
could build from there.
Agreed...  My e-mail client of choice is mutt. It supports gpg/pgp "out
of the box". I perfer it to the GUI types but that is a matter of
opinion :-)

The person asked how and failed to give any kind of
indication of their mail client or platform. As far as I can see the
commandline above will work on any UNIXish platform.. I Would not use it
for normal use... I use mutt and am quite happy with it...
Sorry about the confusion I introduced...

@_subject: lock while verifying? 
gpg dying (or being killed) before it can clear it's locks
To fix it go into ~/.gnupg and delete the lock file(s) there may be more
than one. I forget the names so please be careful and backup before just
rm-ing away. Ohh yeah make sure gpg is not currently running.
Preventing it is a little tougher, find out what is making gpg die and
report it. I have seen this once so far but I have to admin I do not do
a lot of key management or encryption.
Good luck

GnuPG locks memory so it is not swapped to disk. In theory a person
could use swapped info to compromise a key. Some platforms (FreeBSD for
one) require root access to lock pages.
At least that is my understanding.
