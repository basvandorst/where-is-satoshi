@_subject: Signing all outgoing mails on MTA, not on MUA 
Hello List,
We'd like to be able to sign all our outgoing mails.
But not on each client system, which would mean everyone has to install
some plugin or gpg-aware mail client, but on the mailserver itself.
This way nobody has to think about it and signing works transparently
for everyone. We would have one key for all, like a corporate key.
Is this possible ?  I understand we will have to parse and rebuild the
mime structure for this ?
What do you think ?
Thank you for your time,

Hello Harakiri,
Yes, definitely, Harakiri. I already found out. I started to implement
a parsing and signing feature with a filtering script, which works in
very simple cases, but fails in any of the more complex ones.
Since we will not want to buy anything, I guess the DKIM suggested by
the others will be the way to go.
Thank you for your answer.

Hello Chris, Hello Steve,
Thank you for your suggestions. From the quick glance I had at the
wikipedia page of DKIM, that thing will be the right thing for us, I
I will have to convince the management, of course .... and you never
know what path they follow ;-).
