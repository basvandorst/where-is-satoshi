@_subject: Removing a bad signature in a key 
I had imported a few public keys to just experiment locally with
on my Linux box, and one of those keys (Philip Zimmermann's no
less, key ID 0xB2D7795E, imported directly from his web site)
shows one of the signatures as blank in GPA 0.4.3. (its the
first signature shown in the list for that key).
In Seahorse 0.5.0, the key itself is shown as blank, although it
can be expanded where again, the first signature is also blank,
but the other signatures are visable.
On a Windows platform, and in WinPT 0.5.5, if I view the
signatures on this key the "mystery signature" shows at the
bottom of the list as an RSA key, again with no keyid or uid.
Interestingly, I had imported this key from my gpg keyring into
PGP 6.5.8 (located on the Win system), and that particular
signature on the key was labeled as being "bad or invalid". I
made a note of the key ID for this signature so I could delete
it in gpg (0x8DE722D9 if I'm not mistaken, which shows as being
a valid signature on one of his other keys), but once I removed
that signature for some reason I've not been able to get it back
in there (for further testing). After deleting the key, I've
re-imported it from the original file, tried importing the key
from gpg's file, tried exporting the key from gpg, then
re-importing it into PGP, etc. to no avail... PGP no longer
wants to show this signature for some reason.
That's not my problem however, just a little background on what
I've done so far (and makes it apparent that although PGP is no
longer displaying that signature, as mentioned below, it's got
to still be in there somewhere if it's exporting it along with
the key).
Even though PGP no longer shows the signature on this key, if I
export it from there, then do a clean import into gpg using
WinPT, it shows that there is no userid, and has a date of
1970-03-06. A regular clean import into gpg processes the file
with no apparent problems, but it still shows as a blank
signature in GPA as well. When I list the signatures with gpg,
it lists the signature as "[unexpected signature class 0x1f]".
For the life of me I've not been able to get gpg 1.0.6 to allow
me to see, let alone remove this one signature when editing the
key (--edit-key). When it was visable at one point in PGP 6.5.8
I was able to do so there, but I'm wondering what I might be
missing to do this in gpg (I'm also curious as to why PGP
doesn't want to show it anymore, but since I've transitioned,
it's only a curiousity, not a problem).
Anyway, even though I'm just experimenting with this key, I'm
curious... Is there a way to identify, locate, and then delete,
one of these "invalid" signatures in gpg? I suspect that the
signature within the key must be corrupt, but once one of these
is imported, I'm at a loss as to rid the key of it. Any
Thanks for your help!

@_subject: Using "ultimate" Owner Trust 
With v1.0.7, I understand that the handling of owner trust
levels has changed in that when a user creates a key pair, the
key is no longer automatically set with an unlimited trust level
(requiring the owner to set the level manually).
In v1.0.6 the "ultimate" level was only available for selection
if there was a corresponding secret key available. In
experimenting with --edit-key in v1.0.7 I find that I can now
change the owner trust level of public key to "ultimate", even
if no corresponding key is present (making calculated and owner
trust indicated as u/u), making it possible to give ultimate
trust to someone else's public key on my keyring.
Since my previous understanding was that "ultimate" was reserved
for the keyholder (hence requiring a corresponding secret key),
my question is:
When (and why) would someone assign an owner trust level of
"ultimate" to someone else's key? I'm suspecting that this may
have something to do with the now obsolete '--trusted-key'
option (but I'm not sure), and which I had thought was really
only beneficial for those that didn't want to keep their secret
key online.
I had searched through the mail list archives but only came up
with one person's response to another's question as to why this
was now allowed, in which he indicated they should read the
Release Notes (NEWS) to find out. I've read them, too, along
with the man page, but haven't found a clear answer.
If someone could fill me in, or direct me where to look, I would
appreciate it greatly!
Thank you in advance for the enlightenment, and have a GREAT

@_subject: Using "ultimate" Owner Trust 
Yes, the scenario you offered I clearly understand, and was
aware of. However, with regards to that particular question I
was wondering:
When (and why) would someone assign an owner trust level of
"ultimate" to someone _else's_ key? (aside from a server script
scenario for example)
Let's say I've imported my good friend Alice's public key into
my keyring. I've signed her key which gives it fully validated,
or calculated trust on my keyring.
I decide to also set an owner trust level to that key. In
v1.0.6, since I wouldn't have Alice's secret key available I
could only go as far as giving her full owner trust, as ultimate
owner trust was reserved for keys that had a corresponding
secret key available. Now, in v1.0.7, I can clearly assign ultimate owner trust to
whatever public key I have on my keyring, regardless as to who
that key might belong to or whether a corresponding secret key
exists or not.
My thoughts are that this ability was to allow for the scenario
you just mentioned, where you were giving ultimate trust to your
OWN key for situations in which there was a security issue and
you didn't want your secret key available, and as a way to work
around the currently obsolete (but still usable for now)
'--trusted-key' option.
However, since that scenario you mentioned is the only situation
that I am aware of (other than perhaps server scripts or
something similar as mentioned), I was wondering if there was
something else I've missed, or if I'm in the dark on some other
purpose or use for this feature.
In other words, now that I can, *why* would I ever give Alice's
key an owner trust level of ultimate instead of full?
I ask as I'm going to be giving an introductory presentation on
GnuPG to our local LUG in September (not that I'm an expert on
GnuPG mind you... far from it), which will be targeted to new
GnuPG users that have never used the application before, and
will be returning home to create their own key pairs with a
(hopefully) high regard for establishing a sound web of trust.
I had started my presentation slides and article based on
v1.0.6, and my initial reasoning was that for keys in which they
trust the owner's judgment as much as their own, they could
assign full owner trust, but only *their* keys would hold
"ultimate" trust.
As such, I had initially made good points as to why "ultimate
trust" belonged to only the keyholder's key, and why it was they
could only assign that level to a public key that had a
corresponding key on their secret keyring... in other words,
their own key.
Now I'm wondering what I could tell them, or what I SHOULD tell
them, as to reasoning behind why they could now give "just any
ol' key on their keyring" that level of "ultimate trust" if
they'll be using v1.0.7. I kind of liked the restriction in
v1.0.6 (clearly defined structure), but I want to make sure
they're steered in the right direction from the very start (and
I'm able to answer their questions). ;)
So, should I continue along my original path, only with the
revision that they need to be aware that, although they *could*,
they should take care to only assign the level of ultimate trust
to their *own* key? (or what)
Thanks for your response Lionel, and the time you took out of
your day to do so!

Gotcha. Thanks for the example David! If you don't mind I'll use
that when I talk about setting trust levels and the difference
between 1.0.6 and 1.0.7 in what they allow a user to do in the
'--edit-key' portion when I give the presentation.

As Adrian mentioned, you can setuid root on the gpg binary with
chmod. First, change to where your gpg binary is located
(usually /usr/local/bin or /usr/bin) and then 'chmod u+s gpg'.
You could also use the equivilent 'chmod 4755 gpg', which
accomplishes the same thing.
However, if you don't have root permissions on your system, or
should you desire to not setuid root on the gpg binary, you can
also indicate in your gpg options file (~/.gnupg/options) that
you want to supress the display of this warning. You can do so
by editing this file and including the line:
Which does nothing to allow gpg to use secure memory of course,
but only keep gpg from warning you that it's using insecure

@_subject: Signing Keys w/ Multiple User IDs 
Hello all! I have really enjoyed reading through the
gnupg-user archives, and have learned a lot from
everybody on the finer points in using GnuPG, but I
have a few questions that I've not been able to find
the answers to in the manual, FAQs or the many
articles I've read...
I know that when you're editing a key to attach a
signature, and that key has more than one user ID
(email address), you can select the user IDs that you
want to attach your signature to. My questions are:
1.) What benefit does signing multiple user IDs on
this key provide (to both the keyholder and myself)?
2.) When signing another's key where the signature(s)
are exportable, is it best to attach your signature to
all user IDs present?
3.) When signing another's key where the signature(s)
are NOT exportable, such as a key used to verify a
software package, if this key contains multiple user
IDs, is it advisable to sign all user IDs on this key,
or will signing the primary user ID suffice?
Thanks for your help!

Thanks David (and Adrian) for your input! Although when I
refered to multiple uids in a key, I was meaning those that
belonged to the same person (ie: user and
sameuser as are many times included in an

Good point I hadn't really ever considered before. Fortunately I

signatures), but it's only logical... not sure? Don't sign!

So if I understand this correctly, if a software tarball has
been signed by joe yet that particular uid

that one is dev was locally signed by me,
the package would still return a good signature when verified?
Thanks again guys for all your help!

A few weeks back I had posted a message to the list mentioning
MUAs that support, either natively or with plug-ins/tools, the
ability to use GnuPG for encrypting/decrypting and
Thanks to all those that responded, and I include a brief
summary here:
John A. Martin mentioned that XEmacs support should be added to
the list, and also brought to my attention another site with
information on using GnuPG/PGP with MUAs
( I also added
Apple Mail from your list. Thanks John!
Ingo Klöcker brought to my attention that PGP/MIME support in
KMail prior to that which will be released in KDE 3.1 is
available only through a plug-in. Although clearsigning is
native, a correction has been made. Thanks Ingo!
Martin Christensen suggested that the table be added to the FAQ
instead of just being summarized. Done!
Andreas John mentioned that for Win32 MUAs that lack support, a
possible alternative is GPGrelay and enables many email-clients
to send and receive emails that conform to PGP-MIME (RFC 2015).
I'll work this in there Andreas. Thanks!
Janusz A. Urbanowicz mentioned that Elm ME+ suports PGP/GPG
natively for clearsigned messages. That MUA has now been added
to the list. Thanks Janusz!
Heiko Teichmeier mentioned that Postme, a small MUA for Win32,
supports GPG with a plug-in, so that MUA has now been added as
well. Thanks Heiko!
Werner Koch also suggested that, although the GNU project does
not generally mention non-free stuff, for interoperabilty
reasons we should do it (and to split the table as such). Thanks
Werner! Following this advice, the table now stands at:

Another good point, but I think keeping up with issues various

left to those lists that specifically deal with that (such as

@_subject: validating other keys on your public keyring 
It is less secure to use the keyid. Since you're using fewer
bits to check the key with, there is of course a greater chance
that there will exist more than one key with that key ID. Of
course, there's also a very slim chance that more than one key
would have the same fingerprint, but it's certainly less
error-prone to compare fingerprints than manually (by hand)
checking every character in the entire key block.
Say perhaps that your key is out there, on a keyserver or web
page for example. By having your key's fingerprint "advertised"
in your email signature, someone can be reasonably sure that the
key hasn't been tampered with if the fingerprint matches what's
in your email, especially if your email signatures exist
multiple times in multiple places (such as mailing lists). If
the keyserver or web sites lists a key's fingerprint, and that
fingerprint matches what's on your email, it's just another
little measure of security.
Also, by having your key's fingerprint (or key ID) listed in
your email sig, you advertise PK use and may stir a few
questions from recipients, giving you a chance to evangelize and

If you're wanting to change the prefered hashes and cipher algos
in your key, this can be done with 'gpg --edit-key '
This will bring up the interactive key editing menu (type 'help'
to get a full list of interactive menu options). Typing
'showpref' will display the current preferences for the key,
listing the cipher algos, hashes and compression libs. You can
change the preferences in the list by typing 'pref' to compare
the preference values with those shown with 'showpref' (which is
more verbose), and then using 'setpref ' to set your
key's preferences to the values given in the , and then
update the preferences with 'updpref'.
For example, S7 is AES, S10 is TWOFISH, etc. for a couple of the
cipher algos, H3 is RIPEMD160, and H2 is SHA1 for hashes, and Z2
is ZLIB and Z1 is ZIP for compression. Let's say that you want
to change your preferences to use only TWOFISH for the cipher
algo, RIPEMD160 for the hash and ZLIB for compression...
$ gpg --edit-key 0x91EC5F05
Command> showpref

Command> setpref S10 H3 Z2

This will change your key's preferences for the chosen cipher
algos, hash and compression to be used to those you specified in
the .
You can also include in your ~/.gnupg/options (soon to be
~/.gnupg/gpg.conf with the release of 1.2) the option
'--cipher-algo ' where  is one of the supported
cipher algos (can be found with 'gpg --version'), or you could
also also indicate in your options file the line
'--preference-list ' (where  is a list of
preferences as would be used with 'setpref' in the --edit-key's
interactive menu.
I hope this is what you were looking for. More information on
setting your preferences using both the interactive menu in
'--edit-key' and the options file can be found in the man pages
if needed.

@_subject: FAQ update for MUAs supporting GnuPG 
I'm updating section 4.15 (and others) in the GnuPG FAQ file and
wish to update the MUAs that support GnuPG either natively, or
with plug-ins or external tools as the list has grown
tremendously since 4.15 was first added to the FAQ.
I have the following information which I've collected on the
more popular mail user agents:
MUA            OpenPGP  ASCII    How? (N,P,T)
Becky2            Y       Y       P (BkGnuPG)

Eudora            Y       Y       P (EuroraGPG)
Eudora Pro        Y       Y       P (EudoraGPG)

GNUMail.app       Y       Y       P (PGPBundle)
GPGMail           Y       Y       N
KMail             Y       Y       N

The Bat!          N       Y       P (Ritlabs)
TkRat             Y       Y       N
XFmail            Y       Y       N
OpenPG - PGP/MIME, ASCII - Clearsign
N - Native, P - Plug-in, T - External Tool
The information needs to be both confirmed for accuracy as some
MUAs may have added OpenPGP support since being included on this
list, or just plain wrong (my apologies), as well as possibly
So, if you know of a correction to this list, know a plug-in or
tool that isn't listed and provides GnuPG ability to the MUA, or
are perhaps using a MUA that supports GnuPG and isn't on this
list, please respond with an update!
BTW, the table won't be added to the FAQ... it's just to provide
me with accurate information from which to summarize from. Other
corrections and additions to the FAQ will be coming out this
week as well, so I certainly appreciate your help!

@_subject: How_to_delete_a_key_from_server_when_password_isn´t_accepted??? 
If you didn't generate a revocation certificate when you first
created the key pair, you're pretty much SOL as it would require
the keyserver operator to manually remove the key... and even
then, since most key servers sync themselves with others,
eradicating the key from all keyservers is pretty much a long
Apparently, this ability is "in the works" for some keyserver
software, but until then the best you can do is send information
to those contacts that you communicate with that the key is not
to be used any longer.
If you haven't done so already, create a revocation certificate
for your new key pair, move this onto a diskette (or print it
out) and file it away someplace safe. That way, should you find
yourself in the same situation down the road or forget your
passphrase (needed to create the certificate), you will have one
pre-generated that can be used and submitted to keyservers to
revoke the key.

@_subject: FAQ addition 
Why yes, of course I do! :-)
I'll definately look into adding something along those lines, as
I'm all for helping out anyone coming over from Windows to Linux
in any way I can!
Thanks for the input, Oliver, as the GnuPG FAQ wouldn't be what
it is today without all the great suggestions and ideas offered
by the members of the GnuPG lists.
Take care, and have a GREAT day!
