@_subject: Cannot upload updated public keys - "Server indicated a failure" 
disclaimer: gpg is a periphery piece of software in my life. please
don't assume that i'm going to unwind my computer because of this.
i sign emails and software with a gpg key. i had to extent its expiry
now. i cannot upload the updated keys:
$ gpg --send-keys 7437FCBA03E4CB85
gpg: sending key 7437FCBA03E4CB85 to hkp://keys.gnupg.net
gpg: keyserver send failed: Server indicated a failure
gpg: keyserver send failed: Server indicated a failure
i tried various other URLs known to me, same effect. i'm on debian
stretch with gpg 2.1.18. i cannot update my distribution at this moment.
i need to publish my updated key with reasonable effort.
enigmail also won't upload the keys.
thanks for you help!
best, .h.h.
