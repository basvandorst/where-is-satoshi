@_subject: Decrypting multiple files gives errors 
I'm getting errors when i try to decrypt multiple files at the same time with
--decrypt-files. When I do files individually, they seem to decrypt fine.
When I do multiple files, the first file decrypts fine, but all the others
give errors like this:
gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit ELG-E key, ID 12345678, created 2007-01-01
      "John Smith "
gpg: WARNING: multiple plaintexts seen
gpg: handle plaintext failed: unexpected data
I'm using gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.6 on Ubuntu 7.10 and this error is occuring on two
different computers using the same keys.
Please help! I don't want to have to decrypt one at a time!

is there another forum where i can ask this?  i've used gnupg for a long time
and now i'm losing some faith in it's stability due to this problem...
