@_subject: Security of the gpg private keyring? 
Assuming I have password protected secret keys, can I assume that the
gpg private keyring is secure?  I.e., if my private keyring was to
fall into malicious hands, would the aforesaid hands be able to
extract any useful information from my password protected keys?
I am not taking about super-hackers cracking the keys here here...
just things like metadata associated with the keys... email addresses,
who has signed them, expiry date etc...

Thanks for the help, didnt really occur to me how much info is
available in the public keyring, guess you cant do much about it tho.

@_subject: Why do we use a different key to sign than to encrypt 
Not GPG specific, but I was wondering if someone could point me in the
direction of some resources that explain why we use different keys to
sign and encrypt (for cases where the same key _could_ do both e.g.
RSA).  I cant seem to pick anything up on google.

But doesnt GPG generate 2 private keys (as well as public keys) when
you create a new keypair?
Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) RSA and RSA (default)
   (2) DSA and Elgamal
   (3) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only
I can understand if you use DSA and Elgamal (DSA can only sign) but
what about RSA and RSA?
