I'm trying to import a very large public key
( pub  1024/FAEBD5FC 1997/04/07 Philip R. Zimmermann                               Philip R. Zimmermann  ). Am I doing something wrong?

huh... I can't compile anymore under FreeBSD (FreeBSD 2.2.7-RELEASE gcc 2.7.2.1)... I have a make error. I'm just using configure & make, and
it was working for 0.9.8.
    Making all in mpi
    make in free(): warning:
    chunk is already free.
    Segmentation fault - core dumped
    *** Error code 1
Then I've tried configure & make under Solaris 2.6 Intel & Sparc.
I had to use "configure --disable-asm" for Solaris Intel because it
created Assemblor errors during make. But importing Zimmermann's key works
for 0.9.8 and .9 :)
For Solaris 2.6 Sparc I tried a simple configure & make for 0.9.8, and it
doesn't work. I have a zlib problem. I've tried with "configure
--with-included-zlib" and obtained the same make error:
    make[2]: Entering directory `/usr/home/benoit/gnupg-0.9.8/checks'
    ../g10/gpg --yes --dearmor -o ./pubring.gpg ./pubring.asc
    ld.so.1: ../g10/gpg: fatal: libz.so: open failed: No such file or
    directory
For 0.9.9 it works with "--with-included-zlib" ;). And I have been able to
import Zimmermann's key.
So... I'm not sure what to think about all this. I guess there's several
very different problems. "hope it helps!"

Ok, I now use GnuMake 3.77. And I know have _undefined symbols in the mpi
files. The same as Alan Ferrency.

Hey! It could just be a natural 64bits collision ;)
Just for fun. But also to remind that writing code relying on the unicity
of the keyID is *bad*.
