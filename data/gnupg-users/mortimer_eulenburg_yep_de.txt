Is possible with WinPT ->Preferences ->GPG .
I just changed the rings to my USB stick and it works fine.
Dunno how it tells GPG where to crawl around searching the rings ;)

I totally agree about the overall idea being very good to make GnuPG
more transparent and to show an immediate benefit and example for new
Thats why i suggest the whole process should be transparent to the user
and not running in the backyard of his computer.
The German GnuPP- project has Adele, a robot to train encryption and
signing with. Adele listens to adele
Maybe a member of this team listens here and can give some explanations
how the lady is accepted and what experiences they got from it ?

Hi all, my GnuPG (1.0.7a-nr2) got some problems going public via LAN using
http-proxy. Following the manuals i use as options:
note: i added the proxy adress by feeling since i couldnt find any comments
about this in the gpg.txt but guessed gpg would like to know wich door to
knock on..
Getting key(s) 0x5E4B731F from server x-hkp://blackhole.pca.dfn.de ...
gpg: requesting key 5E4B731F from HKP keyserver blackhole.pca.dfn.de

There is a plugin for Outlook using GnuPG for free @
its recommended by the german Goverment for use and they also paid GDATA to
code that. The german office for internet security claims its safe as safe
can under 1024 bit under Windoof. The plugin is as easy to use as the whole

okok, i have to admit the howto is in german :) but i swear it works fine
and i am free of drugs right now.
Make shure u *first* installed the GnuPG software.
Then install the plugin.It asks for the Outlook folder afaik.
Opening Outlook you should find under Options/Encryption/advanced settings
the place to define the place of gpa.exe and gpg.exe
The plugin adds two more buttons En/Decrypt and sign/check sign that do all
the work.
It searches automatically the correct key for the mailrecipient, you enter
the passphrase and the mail goes up & away.
At least on my system that is a Pentium 133, 40 MB RAM, Win98SE, 1Gig HDA
and still going strong, hehe.
If all hell breaks loose mail support
Hope it works, Mortimer

Regardless of quality  provides a rough check
and gives you hint how long it would take to brute-force the phrase with a
Pentium 1 Gig.
They also analyse the phrase if it consists of well known words or often
used characters.
Hope it helps, the site is in German but well understandable for english

The site is run by the governmental "deputy" for communication safety in
Switzerland. I don´t have any problems in trusting the site but i have to
admit being f.i the prime admin of yahoo i wouldn´t go and try my admin
passwords there too. If all you wanna cover is some private .doc´s or

his password is the prime threat for the companies IT-security.
