I have just installed a smartcard reader and set it up. I can successfully read the information on it and managed to generate a new key on it (gpg --card-list / gpg ---card-edit).
How can I use the smartcard in KMail? I cannot choose its keys in the Identity Using a key from the harddrive does work without problems.
Any help is highly appreciated!

No, gpg -K does not list anything.
I have removed the ~/.gnupg directory and issued "gpg --card-status" again. "gpg -K" does still not list anyting...
I am using KMail 1.7.2.
What am I doing wrong? Any help is highly appreciated!
Best regards,
