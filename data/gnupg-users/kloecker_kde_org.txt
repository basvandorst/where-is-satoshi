Try CA-Bot ( I haven't used it myself because I'm using a self-written script for creating challenges with KMail. But I've been sent a few challenges generated by CA-Bot. Last time I received such a message, it said (at least IIRC) that CA-Bot couldn't handle signed and/or encrypted replies. So using CA-Bot you can only check whether the person you send the challenge to can decrypt the challenge, but you can't check whether he also controls the signing Where "control the email address" is different from "is the owner of the email address". Anybody between you and the owner of the email address can intercept the challenge, sign it and send it back to you. This is especially a problem with email addresses which don't contain the name, but just some random alias, nickname or whatever. tmz could be anyone's email address.

That's obviously correct. In this case you could give the key owner a piece of paper with a random string and ask him to send it in a signed message to your email address. Then you know that he can use this key for signing messages. Obviously, you can't check the validity of the email addresses belonging to this key (unless he's got an encryption key you can use for checking the addresses).
But in case of a certification-only key even that won't work.
Among a few hundreds keys I've signed so far only a handful were sign-only or certification-only keys. I did simply sign them with a lower verification level.

The key (i.e. the primary key) could belong to a group, but only one person of the group might be the key owner (i.e.  have full access to the key) or even no member of the group might be the key owner, but only a superior entity like the company's CA. Moreover, each member of the group could have a separate encryption subkey.
This example should explain why sending a signed key via encrypted mail doesn't ensure anything about the key owner.
Of course, with respect to keys belonging to real persons rather than to entities/companies/etc. this example is probably not that convincing.
Except for the Y part this is correct. But the contents of the From address, i.e. Y, means absolutely nothing.

The signature of your message is valid (according to KMail). Which mail application are you using? And which mail application was used to create the clearsigned messages?
If you can show us an example message (it's best to zip it in order to protect it from being changed during transport) then it would be much easier to answer. One possible explanation is a problem with the interpretation of 8bit character, e.g. french accented characters. Another possible explanation could be different treatment of trailing white space.

No. This is (false) security through obscurity. Anyone who is able to break the used encryption will have no problems also breaking your bogus attempt to increase security.
Through brute force anything can be broken. The whole point of the encryption methods that are used by us is that a brute force attack is not feasible.

Memorizing the rule and, more importantly, keeping the rule secret is No, it doesn't. You are still believing in security-by-obscurity meaning that your additional "encryption" only works as long as you and the recipient are the only ones who know the secret rule.
Anyway, why do you actually think that what you want to do would make any sense? If the encryption algorithm you use is too weak so that additional "encryption" methods are necessary then you probably shouldn't use this encryption algorithm in the first place. And if the encryption algorithm you use is strong enough (e.g. AES) then you gain nothing by additional "encyrption" methods unless those additional "encryption" methods are an even stronger encryption algorithm than the first one (but then why apply the first one).

I don't see why such a scenario would make any sense. If the automated attack would have any chance of success then the used encryption algorithm was too weak. Otherwise it doesn't matter whether the automation works for the message or not.
Maybe you have a point. Still using a self-created obfuscation scheme doesn't feel like a really good solution for this threat model.
Sure. But as others have said earlier there are better ways to use a secure channel than to agree on such a stupid additional obfuscation step. If anything, then use a second symmetric encryption step for this special two-way-only communication.

Obviously, to be able to import keys which were generated off-card. Because some people don't seem to be able to sleep without a backup of the private key.
Is that a trick question? Short answer: Security. Longer answer: It's prohibited because if nobody can export the private key from the smartcard then nobody can steal the private key without your knowledge. You would surely notice that your smartcard is missing but you might never know that some trojan horse has stolen your private key.
See above. Other use case: My key is signed by many people. If I couldn't import my key to a smartcard (well, I think I can't because it's no RSA key, but let's pretend for the moment that it were an importable key), then I'd have to regather all those signatures again for my new on-card generated key.

Then decrypt all files with a simple for-loop. Afterwards you might want to kill gpg-agent.

Did you follow the link I provided? The PDFs available on this page contain the test reports. They are in German but it shouldn't be a problem to understand which solutions were tested.
Anyway, KMail was the only Free Software MUA that was tested because testing costs a lot of money. The other tested solutions were proprietary plugins for Groupwise, Lotus Notes and MS Outlook, and a mail gateway running on Linux.
Note that the BSI wasn't interested in testing all available MUAs. They only wanted to make sure that the MUA they have chosen for usage on Linux was interoperable with the other solutions used by them. Obviously, this statement is somewhat simplified (and might even be incorrect). Even though I'm the former maintainer of KMail I was only very marginally involved in the ?gypten project.
Shoot me for using semantic trickery. :-) I only answered Sven's provocative (as I understood it) question whether GnuPG's S/MIME implementation is actually used somewhere and what its benefits are. I didn't want to belittle other MUAs using GnuPG's S/MIME. Au contraire. IMO all Free Software MUAs should use GnuPG's S/MIME instead of rolling their own S/MIME implementation. I'm pretty sure passing the Sphinx-interoperability test wouldn't be much of a problem for any MUA doing so.

Robert neither wrote nor implied this. The lesson you should learn from Robert is that you should not blindly install the version with the higher version number, but that you should first get some information about the difference between the two versions in order to find out whether you really need the one with the higher version number.
With respect to the differences between GnuPG 1.4 and GnuPG 2.0 please refer to the archive of this mailing list, e.g. read Werner Koch's announcement of GnuPG 2.0 [1].
The website ( is pretty cryptic about the difference. All it says is
  GnuPG comes in two flavours: 1.4.9 is the well known and portable
  standalone version, whereas 2.0.9 is the enhanced and somewhat harder
  to build version.
This text could be improved. Or it could link to a page explaining the difference because this is obviously an FAQ. Unfortunately the FAQ hasn't been updated since July 30, 2003.

Having a quick look at RFC 2440 and the signature file ( c) talks about the application files, but not about the signature file) verifies that the signature is of type 0x01:
0x01: Signature of a canonical text document.
         Typically, this means the signer owns it, created it, or
         certifies that it has not been modified.  The signature is
         calculated over the text data with its line endings converted
         to  and trailing blanks removed.
So it's not just line endings but also trailing blanks.

Try whether you can start gpg-agent as daemon manually:
# gpg-agent --daemon
If this works then kill the gpg-agent process and start it with the # eval "$(gpg-agent --daemon)"
This will set the environment variable needed by all applications that want to make use of a running gpg-agent. Next start KMail from the same console, i.e.
# kmail
and check whether it works.
If this works then put a file called start-gpg-agent.sh into ~/.kde/env (or ~/.kde4/env) containing the following two lines:
killall gpg-agent 2>/dev/null
eval "$(gpg-agent --daemon)"
This will ensure that gpg-agent is started whenever KDE is started.
You can add more command line arguments to gpg-agent if you like. For example I added --default-cache-ttl 36000 to increase the duration gpg-agent caches the passphrase.

@_subject: installing gpg on Mandriva 2009 
The warning is a bit misleading. It should read "gpg-agent cannot be connected to" or similar. In order to connect to gpg-agent the application needs to know the "channel" to use for talking to gpg-agent. This "channel" (a Unix socket) is announced with the environment variable $GPG_AGENT_INFO. Therefore only applications running in the same environment as gpg-agent can talk to gpg-agent.
Did you add the file start-gpg-agent.sh to ~/.kde/env (or ~/.kde4/env or whatever folder is used for KDE 4 by Mandriva 2009)? As I wrote in my first reply this will ensure that gpg-agent is started whenever KDE is started, i.e. whenever you log in. Moreover, it ensures that all applications started from KDE are running in the same environment as gpg-agent and thus should be able to talk to gpg-agent.

Exactly. Therefore you should always have a revocation certificate (or even multiple revocation certificates with different reasons for revocation) at hand.
Moreover, I'd say one should explicitely revoke expired keys one does not intend to re-use/un-expire, so that they can never be un-expired by someone else.

@_subject: problems with PGP/MIME 
The application/octet-stream attachment does not only contain your encrypted .odt file, but the whole MIME structure of your message (after signing and before encryption) including the attached .odt file.
That's because KGpg probably does not know how to verify PGP/MIME signatures correctly.
The "ascii-armoured portion of data" is most likely the base64 encoded .odt attachment. Try running it through
  base64 -di < "ascii-armoured portion of data" >foo.odt
base64 is part of the coreutils.
Hmm. No idea unless you did not make sure that the message is also encrypted with your own key.
In theory, PGP/MIME allows arbitrary complex hierarchies of signed and encrypted body parts.
In practice, KMail (and probably most other PGP/MIME capable email clients) encrypt the whole message (except for the email headers) after the optional signing step, i.e. the text and all attachments. Now, if you decrypt the encrypted "attachment" in the received message, you will get something like you write above.
I'm not sure what your use-case is. If it's for backup purposes (as indicated above), then I suggest to sign and encrypt the .odt file with KGpg and then attach this signed&encrypted attachment to a message. This message should then not be encrypted because otherwise you'll have the same situation as above. Signing the message should be okay.

Does it also work with keys like 0xCB0D4CAF or 0xAB1BC4E6 created with PGP 6 (or earlier) where the user ID is not UTF-8 encoded?

So if you want to be sure that the correct key is used you cannot use the user Good to see that it works nowadays for UTF-8 encoded user IDs on systems using a UTF-8 locale.

I'm fully aware of this.
True. Actually, I lied about KMail using key IDs. Since about 6.5 years KMail uses gpgme and leaves all of those hairy details (like telling gpg what keys to use) to this library.
I don't see why harmless changes (see David's example) shouldn't be ignored. If the user hard-coded the key Alice1, then what's wrong with using this key as long as it's valid. Obviously, any changes making a hard-coded key invalid need to be escalated and such a key must not be used anymore by the MUA.
If for some email address multiple matching valid keys are found by KMail (or rather gpgme) then KMail asks the user which key(s) to use (and then remembers the user's choice). This transparency gives me a better feeling than some automagic behind-my-back key selection based on user ID/email address.
Full ACK. That's why MUA developers should use gpgme or an appropriate

@_subject: choosing an encryption target from a User ID 
Yes, I suppose this would be a sensible solution.
If Alice does not tell them, then they might not know this. But I'm not sure whether this is a common problem or more an academic problem. Let's say Alice loses her first key and cannot revoke it because she didn't create a revocation certificate. She creates a new key, but Bob continues to use the old key. Unless Bob automatically imports unknown keys, he will notice that Alice now uses a different key because he cannot verify her signature anymore. And if Bob uses the old key to send an encrypted message to Alice, Alice will surely tell him what happened. So I don't really see the problem with a hardcoded choice.
I agree, but I also disagree. I agree that it's preferable to save the user from having to make a choice. But then again I disagree about the "not have as much understanding of the problem space". People who do not understand to a certain degree how the WoT works would be better off using a centralized PKI. IMO this is a major weakness of the WoT.
See above. I wonder how much of a real problem this is. How many people have multiple valid keys bound to the same email addresses? What is the use case for having multiple valid keys bound to the same addresses?
In the past, when I worked at the university, I used a private/home key and a work key. At home I could read anything. At work I could only read messages encrypted with my work key. So anything I was supposed to read at work needed to be encrypted with my work key. To make things more complicated my home key did have my work address as one user ID. So hardcoding my work address to my work key was basically mandatory.

@_subject: choosing an encryption target from a User ID 
Thank you, the same to you! You really make me thinking.
True, but this could be solved by improving the used tools. People using KMail and OpenPGP will probably use KGpg for key management. So it would probably make sense to make KGpg aware of the "key-bindings" (which are stored in the KDE-wide address book btw, so this isn't strictly KMail-specific) and ask Bob after he certified Alice key. Just an idea.
I have no problem doing this.
This is what is giving me major headaches. Maybe I'm too pessimistic or paranoid, but I trust almost nobody. I prefer to go to keysigning parties and check the ids myself. You are correct, that this is not what the WoT is about.
I see the value in tools doing the Right Thing by default, so I agree that gpg should probably be improved in this respect. Maybe I'm really doing something wrong. Maybe you are right in that I should stick to what gpg thinks is best and only use hard-coded bindings if it's really necessary. Hmm. I need to think about this.
Yes. That's a good use case.
Yeah. That's basically a variation of the above use case.
Hmm, AFAIU, for someone who does not blindly certify such keys this shouldn't be a problem since those malicious keys wouldn't be valid and thus wouldn't take preference over a valid key ... unless somebody else this person trusts is trying to screw them.

Leaving the spam-argument aside (which I agree with Doug is a bogus one) I can think of a good (?) reason for creating an OpenPGP key without email address: Usage of a master key that is used exclusively for the certification of other OpenPGP keys. All signing and encryption keys will be subkeys of this master key. Now the question is whether user ids can be tied to subkeys? (I haven't studied the spec, but from what I know the answer is most likely no. Anyway...)
If the answer is yes, then one could tie certain user ids to certain signing/encryption subkeys and this way have one master key certifying a whole bunch of signing/encryption subkeys used for different purposes. (Not sure whether this does actually make sense.)
If the answer is no, then the master key would be a standalone certify-
only key that would not be used by mail clients for signing/encryption and thus it does not do any harm that the key lacks an email address.

Another use case would be marking a key as deprecated. First, you'd add a new user ID "This key is deprecated; use key 0xAABBCCDD instead" (okay, I'm not really using the comment field here) and then you'd revoke the signatures on all user IDs. Of course, there are other more appropriate ways defined in the spec to do this, but IMHO putting the information right in the users face is much more effective than hiding it in some obscure fields.

The value of Content-Disposition is irrelevant and shouldn't cause any problems. The correct Content-Type for attached messages is FWIW, KMail sets Content-Type message/rfc822 and Content-Disposition inline when forwarding messages as attachment.
KMail can verify signatures of forwarded signed messages out-of-the-box. It nicely displays a signed forwarded message (including the signature status) inline in the enclosing signed message. In fact, this works for arbitrary deeply nested signed and/or encrypted messages. Think Matryoshka doll. :-)

The feature might not break anything now but it will make the software more complex. More complex software tends to break more easily. One of the main design goals of gpg-agent, pinentry, etc., was to keep the code of those small helper applications dealing with the secret keys and the passphrases as simple as possible to avoid the complexity trap.
Also, it's a popular fallacy that adding a feature generates cost only once. Every new feature will increase the maintenance costs and thus generate additional cost for the whole lifetime of the software.

Yes, it's four digits. But it's also a month (there are only 12) and a year (which most likely is less than a few years later than today). Therefore comparing four digits representing a date with a random group of four digits without apparent meaning is a bit weird. Also, I'd remember the date as January 2012 and not as Oh-One-One-Two.
No. You are actually slow. :-p
There are techniques which allow people trained in those techniques to remember such a string of characters in a much shorter time, e.g. you could "invent" a story with 22 words starting with the 22 characters.
As you wrote in another message: This doesn't come for free. One has to train this.
FWIW, I have a fairly complicated totally random 20-character passphrase (letter, digits, symbols) which I have memorized pretty quickly after using it for a few days having to type it each time I start my computer. (I memorized it without using any of those techniques I referred to above.) Then again, I can't really tell you this passphrase. I can type it (with all 10 fingers) but I couldn't tell it to you without simulating typing it. Maybe I'm a freak of nature. :-)

I don't think it's worth the effort thinking about this. In fact, it might be better to ignore the problem because everytime a user of such a mail client asks you why you've sent him such a strange message you can tell him that his mail client is broken and that he'd be much better off with standard-compliant mail client .

"figure out that the signed headers match the actual ones" may sound easy, but it's actually an extremely tough task. Any mailing list mangling the Reply-to header will break the signature. Any MTA, virus checker, etc. beautifying or otherwise changing the existing headers will break the signature. There would need to be some canonical format for headers. But that's magnitudes harder than converting the body of an email message to the canonical text format.

No, sorry. I haven't been using inline PGP signatures for ages and neither do most of the people I exchange emails with. Therefore I cannot provide real world examples.
Back when I was still using inline PGP signatures I regularly got replies with a full quote of my inline-signed message where the signature on the quoted message was broken. You might say that it's not relevant because it's just a quote. But I say it is very relevant if such a reply is forwarded to a third party. And also if it isn't forwarded a bad signature is still highly irritating (at least to me).
Of course, my experience is from a time when UTF-8 wasn't used in email. But do the standard mail clients (Outlook, GMail, Thunderbird) really default to UTF-8 nowadays? Expecting people to properly configure their mail clients is an unrealistic dream.

Just looking at the numbers I'd say that "signed" is the number of keys signed by the valid keys. In your example, there are 26 keys that are signed in depth 0. And there are 26 keys that are valid in depth 1 (because they are validated by the ultimately trusted keys from depth 0). The same pattern repeats for signed keys in depth 1 and valid keys in depth 2.
In my keyring I only see this pattern for signed keys in depth 0 and valid keys in depth 1. OTOH, for depth 1 I get signed: 206, but in depth 2 I only get valid: 37. My guess is that "signed" counts the number of all keys in the keyring that are signed by any of the valid keys in the corresponding depth. In particular, this number also includes keys that are valid in the same depth or a lower depth. If your test keyring is a tree (or a set of unconnected trees) then this would support my Of course, I could be completely wrong and the "signed" number is something entirely different. :-)

If your key is stolen, but not compromised, i.e. the attacker has not cracked your password, then the key is useless to the attacker regardless of any expiration. OTOH, if your key is compromised then the attacker will simply set a new expiration date.

I have verified that one can generate a revocation certificate without entering a passphrase if one has previously signed something (e.g. an email). So, it was probably just a very nasty prank.
Maybe gpg shouldn't use the cached signing passphrase (or any cached passphrase) for generating a revocation certificate.

Why do you think so? Define "really safe".
That doesn't make any sense. If you use symmetric encryption then you have to tell the recipient the passphrase you used for encryption via a safe channel.
If you use a private key then you have to tell the recipient the private key and the passphrase you used to protect the private key again via a safe channel. Of course, you could choose to leave the private key In both cases you have to share a secret with the recipient via a safe channel. So, where do you see the advantage of using a private key? A possible reason would be re-use of the private key. But then you could as well re-use the passphrase.

Ideally, the users wouldn't even have to notice that they are communicating via encrypted email.
Unfortunately, I think email is a lost cause because there are so many different mail clients that will never support encryption.

KMail also says that the signature matches.
Looking at the two pastbins, it seems that you are trying to convert OpenPGP/MIME-signed messages to RFC 4880-style cleartext signed messages in order to verify the signatures. This transformation is not always possible. In this particular case the signed data contains trailing whitespace. If the sender (resp. his mail client) would have followed the RFC 3156 then this trailing whitespace wouldn't be there. But it's there. And that's what causing the trouble because the signature of a cleartext signed message is computed with trailing whitespace removed. That's why the signature does not match.
You have to verify the signature the way one verifies signed data with detached signature.

I would not allow re-usage of email addresses because even a 1 year "fallow" time might be too short, e.g. for some services you might get an invoice once a year and, since you are obviously concerned about privacy, you surely wouldn't want this message to be sent to the wrong person. IMHO used email addresses are burned for all eternity (unless, some time in the future, there will be other mechanisms, e.g. ubiquitous end-to-end encryption, that prevent the disclosure of private information in emails that have gone astray).
No. Each signature has an individual expiration date (or none). When you sign a user id which has an expiration date then gpg proposes to use the same expiration date for your signature, but you are free to set another expiration date (including no expiration) for your signature.
As mentioned above you could use a 1-year-expiration for the certification of the user's key with the site key.
Definitely makes sense.
Given 2. you should always take the prefered key first. If there's no prefered key, then I'd follow gpg's practise and take the newest valid key (and ask the user whether he is okay with the choice).
KMail relies on gpg to make the best choice. I suggest to do the same. I see no reason to invent a new trust-scheme.

In general the message digest hashes will differ.

I'm not surprised. It seems that Francesco Ariis has left out a crucial step (or you have removed it when you quoted his message). RFC 3156 Upon receipt of a signed message, an application MUST:
   (1)   Convert line endings to the canonical  sequence before
         the signature can be verified.  This is necessary since the
         local MTA may have converted to a local end of line convention.
   (2)   Pass both the signed data and its associated content headers
         along with the OpenPGP signature to the signature verification
         service.
It shouldn't matter.
The charset should be irrelevant because quoted-printable encoded text does not contain any non-ASCII characters.
Concerning (1) in the excerpt of RFC 3156 quoted above, you have to tell Kate to switch the line endings to Windows line endings (Tools->End of Line->Windows/DOS) before saving the text to a file. Or run unix2dos on the saved text to convert the line endings on the command line.
If you do all of this correctly, then you might be lucky that the signature verification succeeds. You might not be so lucky when the next signed message arrives.
IMHO trying to verify an OpenPGP/MIME-signed message by hand is at most a nice exercise, but it's certainly nothing one should do regularly.

KMail does not. At least, KMail does not support creating such messages. It's possible that KMail would be able to read such messages since the decryption is delegated to gpgme. And for the odd message (containing an inline PGP MESSAGE block) sent to this list gpg-agent asks for a symmetric encryption password when I open the message in KMail.
I think you underestimate the development effort. Besides, AFAIK, there is no standard for this.
There are plenty of reasons. I already mentioned the lack of a standard. Then there's the problem of key exchange which you completely ignore. Related to this, you did not answer Robert's question "if you already have a secure channel over which you can send a key, why not just use that channel for your communications?".
Instead of support for symmetric encryption I'd rather love to see automatic asymmetric encryption to be added to mail clients: OpenPGP keys are created and uploaded to some key server automatically, and they are looked up and used automatically (e.g. with trust-on-first-sight similar to SSH keys) when sending a message. I'd prefer this to be done in an opt-out fashion, i.e. unless the user explicitly tells the mail client not to do it, the mail client would simply do it.

Sure. But the fingerprint is only used once (for verifying the key). And it's not even secret information, so exchange via an insecure channel is not an issue (at least, not a severe issue).
OTOH, symmetric keys really should be exchanged via a secure channel. Moreover, reusing a symmetric key is a big no-no. And exchanging a new symmetric key for each new message is completely impractical (unless you use assymmetric keys for this). Exchanging a large number of symmetric keys at the same time is a bit less impractical, but then you need to keep track of which symmetric key is used next.
Long ago people have found a good solution for all those problems concerning the exchange of symmetric keys: Assymmetric encryption.

Sure. But the NSA already knows the correspondents of all of our mail anyway. Keyserver lookups do not add any additional data (except of the information that you are trying to look up a key resp. that you are talking to a keyserver). Okay, the keyserver owner may collect data. But the keyserver (owner) has to be trustworthy anyway.
So what? My scheme is not supposed to work instantaneously. It is supposed to work eventually, i.e. it will work after the propagation delay has passed. This is way better than our current status quo: No encryption at all for almost all email.
Good point. Automatic decryption should be possible for those that want it. My scheme is mostly meant as in-transit encryption which again is way better than our current status quo.
How exactly does one harvest email addresses from the keyservers? Can I ask keyservers to give me all keys it has in storage? Or do I need to search for keys matching a certain substring? I honestly don't know. Anyway, if this really becomes a problem than key lookup probably needs to be made as inconvenient as trying to send email probes to randomly generated email addresses.
For my scheme to work the keyservers would only need to return keys where the email address part of a uid exactly matches the recipient's email address. Moreover, for my scheme to work no key certification is necessary, i.e. crawling from one key to the next via certification signatures wouldn't be possible.
The scheme has more issues: For example, there's no message integrity protection (via signing) whatsoever. But that's the current status quo

Yeah. Let's add yet another button to the UI. Let's add an "Encypt symmetrically" button and let's rename the "Encrypt" button to "Encrypt assymmetrically". If we add enough buttons then users will eventually start pressing them. (Sorry, for being sarcastic, but I really don't see how adding another button can possibly improve the users' willingness to use email encryption.)
There is a difference between symmetric and assymmetric encryption that could make it a bit more difficult than simply calling a different gpgme function. The latter doesn't require any user input, hence it can be done synchronously. OTOH, the former requires user input, the password to use for symmetric encryption, so it's advisable to do it BTW, additionally to the above mentioned new button the user has to press he also has to enter a password for each message he wants to send encrypted. How this additional inconvenience is going to win us more OpenPGP users is beyond me.
This is for inline OpenPGP and that's not part of any standard about email encryption I know of. Since you are also using KMail I invite you to test whether KMail is able to decrypt symmetrically encrypted OpenPGP/MIME messages out-of-the-box. It might just work, but I'm too lazy and too tired to test this right now.
Probably by using the same trivial password for all encrypted ZIPs they exchange with anybody. Which brings me to another issue I have with your proposal: How do you want to prevent the users from using the same trivial symmetric encryption password for all "encrypted" messages?
And what's your threat model, i.e. what do you want to achieve by your symmetric email encryption scheme?
Let's check the PGP 2.6.3i User's Guide Using Just Conventional Encryption
Sometimes you just need to encrypt a file the old-fashioned way, with
conventional single-key cryptography.  This approach is useful for
protecting archive files that will be stored but will not be sent to
anyone else.  Since the same person that encrypted the file will also
decrypt the file, public key cryptography is not really necessary. To encrypt a plaintext file with just conventional cryptography,
    pgp -c textfile
This example encrypts the plaintext file called textfile, producing a
ciphertext file called textfile.pgp, without using public key
cryptography, key rings, user IDs, or any of that stuff.  It prompts
you for a pass phrase to use as a conventional key to encipher the
file.  This pass phrase need not be (and, indeed, SHOULD not be) the
same pass phrase that you use to protect your own secret key. [...]
Apparently, Phil Zimmermann had a specific use-case in mind for "conventional encryption". And this specific use-case does not require any symmetric key or passphrase exchange with a second user. I doubt that Phil Zimmermann meant "conventional encryption" to be used for exchanging encrypted messages.
I very much disagree, but I think we have very different threat models in mind.
Little effort for whom? For the developers of email clients? Maybe. Maybe not. For the users of those email clients? I don't see "coming up with and exchanging passwords" as very little effort for the users.
Contrast this with my proposal: More effort for the developers, but, in the extreme case where the mail client does everything automatically, no additional effort at all for the user.
No. You snipped this part of Robert's message and didn't reply at all to it. Later you did give an answer to this question in your reply to Doug Barton's message (who also pointed out that you "skated past" this question) though.
See above. Yes, more effort to implement, but magnitudes less additional effort to use (and in the extreme case even infinitely less effort because "some non-zero additional effort to use" for your proposal divided by "zero additional effort to use" for my proposal equals infinitely more additional effort for your proposal).

Actually, concerning your proposal, I'm more talking about usability. To encrypt a message using your proposal the sender needs to
* write the message,
* tell his mail client that he wants to encrypt the message,
* come up with and enter the password that should be used for encrypting the message, (-> minor inconvenience)
* tell the recipient the password, (-> major inconvenience)
* and, finally, send the message.
That's three more steps than for sending an unencrypted message. And for one of those steps a completely different communication channel needs to be used. This is so inconvenient that I cannot see this helping our

It doesn't feel right to automatically sign messages with automatically created keys. Also, signing is irrelevant for my use case: end-to-end Yeah. Usage of multiple machines/devices is an unsolved problem.
Right. I guess I simply grabbed the opportunity.

Good news: I think we do have such a way. It's called DANE (DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities) [1].
Support for DANE has been added to Postfix a few months ago and a few German mail providers recently started using it.

And/or store it on a smart card.
Storing the revocation certificate together with the master private key is suboptimal. If you lose the USB stick or it stops working then you won't be able to revoke your master key. I suggest printing the revocation certificate on a piece of paper and storing it at a safe place. You could even print multiple copies and store them in different safe locations to reduce the risk of losing it through fire/water/theft/whatever. The worst that can happen if somebody gets hold of one of the copies is that he can revoke your key. That'd be annoying, but your data would still be protected.

Adding additional junk keys doesn't help if the recipient (or the recipients) expect a certain number of recipients. If the message is encrypted to more than (expected number of recipients)+1 (for encrypt to sender) then the recipients most likely will wonder who the other recipients are. You'll have a hard time convincing them that the "other recipients" are just fakes to confuse a third party intercepting the messages.

How do you plan to encrypt multipart messages with "a more ad-hoc approach which interoperates with more mail clients"? PGP/MIME solves this problem in a standardized way that all mail clients that support PGP/MIME can handle.
Sender address and recipient address are part of the mail envelope. As long as you use SMTP there's not much point in trying to hide the From and the To header. OTOH, due to SMTP's nature simply putting some dummy email addresses into From and To is trivial. I just think that it serves no real purpose. Who do you want to hide the From and To headers from who does not have access to the mail envelope?
Also, Werner Koch has mentioned several (?) times on this list that the obvious solution for this to attach the actual message to a wrapper message and encrypt the whole thing with PGP/MIME. Any fully MIME- and PGP/MIME-

Why? All it takes is one API call which takes a MIMETree and returns another I don't understand what you mean. Do you refer to the removal of trailing white-space? What's hairy about that?
So you've come to realize that writing an email client isn't all fun? Welcome to the real world.
The key of this statement is that they write off "e-mail as a lost cause" because this is unfixable in SMTP. The only solution is not to use SMTP.
I'm sorry to disappoint you, but you won't help the masses communicate securely by writing yet another mail client. The masses won't use your mail client (or any other niche mail client). The public masses use Google mail, the corporate masses use Outlook/Exchange, and the smartphone masses use whatever mail client comes with their smartphone.
If you want an achievable goal, then don't aim for the masses but for those people who really need means for secure communication. I expect those people to use PGP/MIME-capable mail clients (or no e-mail at all) and not some other mail clients with non-standard, homebrew encryption.

Speaking for KMail how can I be sure that somebody who claims that his validation server can be trusted can actually be trusted and should therefore be added to the whitelist? KDE avoids this problem for the CA certificate bundle by relying on the certificate bundles provided by the Linux distributors or by Mozilla.
Well, the keyservers do not make any claims with regard to the authenticity or the integrity of the keys. Those checks are left to the clients. I do not have to trust any of the keyservers.
The validating key server proxies claim validity of the UIDs (to a certain degree). I can see myself marking such a proxy as trusted by adding it to my gnupg.conf (or to KMail's configuration). But I cannot see myself adding such a proxy to the whitelist that's shipped with KMail.
Another problem I see with whitelist management is revocation in case the validation key of a validating proxy is compromised. Again, for the CA certificate bundles that's handled by the distributors and not by individual application developers.
I'm confident that the smaller mail providers who focus on security would be willing to add such an interface. Frankly, I do not care that much for the big mail providers. People who really value privacy should use mail providers that value privacy.

A possible benefit would be that the user can choose not to upload the validation signatures to the keyservers.

Devil's advocate: "Regular users don't use Thunderbird+Enigmail, let alone KMail. Regular users either use webmail or a corporate email client like Outlook. WKS is of no use for them."
Of course, setting up WKS for a domain is non-trivial and nothing regular users will do. But, hopefully, some email providers of those regular users will do it. I'm pretty sure that sane email providers like posteo.de, etc. will implement it. Devil's advocate: "Regular users don't use email providers that are not gratis. They use gmail, gmx, yahoo, etc. And corporate users use the mail server of their corporation. WKS is of no use for them."

Ironically, users of whatsapp get end-to-end encryption even though they don't care. As long as email encryption is not as easy as with whatsapp and other chat apps that sport end-to-end encryption without requiring any additional user interaction whatsoever, email encryption will never be used by regular users.

To prove/disprove this claim all you need to check is the encryption key(s) (which you already did with "gpg filename.pgp"). The output of "gpg filename.pgp" should contain
  gpg: encrypted with  key, ID , created where  is ID-A or the ID of an encryption subkey of the key with ID ID-A.

@_subject: Best practice to use several smartcards for a single key? 
I see little reason for setting up a second smartcard for subkeys as disaster recovery backup for the first smartcard. Reasoning below:
Yes, unless they explicitly specify multiple subkeys gpg will use the most recently created valid encryption subkey.
Yes, but why a second smartcard? The reason for making a backup of the encryption (sub)key is that this will allow you to decrypt messages even if the smartcard dies. But if your second smartcard also dies, then all is lost ... unless you have an off-card backup of the private encryption key. But this off-card backup would allow you to create a new smartcard _after_ the first smartcard dies. So, instead of setting up two smartcards with identical encryption keys I suggest to save the money for the second smartcard and instead create an off-card backup of the private encryption key that you store somewhere safe (see Erich's mail).
Yes, but what purpose serves the second smartcard? Again, you can easily setup a replacement smartcard _after_ the first smartcard dies. Typically, you would create the signature (sub)key on-card to avoid any risk of compromise of the private key.
Yes, for the authentication use case setting up a second smartcard does make sense because otherwise you'd lose access to the machines if the first smartcard dies. But you could as well keep an off-card backup of the authentication key. Or you could create a second "master" authentication key off-card and store it somewhere safe. One argument for using a second smartcard instead is to avoid any risk of compromise of the private authentication keys.
Yes, but only with the unreleased development version of GnuPG. With 2.2.25 trying to add a subkey from an existing key from card failed here. There have been quite some fixes with regard to smartcard support in the development version in the last few weeks.
What I did:
Remove the first smartcard. Insert the second smartcard. Then

Both cards were inserted after I was asked to insert the first card. I have not tried the above with both cards inserted from the start. Even if it works, I think it's easier if at first you only insert the second card (i.e. the card with the key you want to add as signing subkey) because it will make the selection of the key from the list of available keys easier.
The request to enter a certain card is merely a hint (in this case a bogus hint) for the user. gpg will look for the key on any inserted card regardless of what card it asked for.

@_subject: Protecting your private key - passphrase 
I'm sorry, but in my opinion this is snake oil.
If you think that you can increase entropy ("randomness") by hashing a passphrase a user came up with, then you should really take a basic course on information theory.
If the user comes up with an easy-to-guess passphrase and runs it through your program, then s:he will get a hashed easy-to-guess passphrase with a little bit security-by-obscurity sugar on top. But this doesn't add any real security. It only adds complexity (which often means less security; I mean you are putting the passphrase on the clipboard from where it can be grabbed by any other application) because now one needs to use two programs to decrypt something. First your program to calculate the actual passphrase to feed into gpg and then gpg to perform the actual decryption.
Why do you think you need "good random input for GnuPG"? GnuPG does have a state-of-the-art key derivation function.
If people want to generate a secure random passphrase for gpg, then they should use a secure password generator.

The secret key of subkey 4BB3049F19616A80 is not available (it's listed as "sub", but not as "ssb"). Only the secret keys of the main key and the expired subkey are available.
I suspect a gpg1 vs. gpg2 problem, i.e. the secret key of subkey 4BB3049F19616A80 is only available to gpg1 or gpg2, but not to both (they use different key storages). Fedora 30 probably used gpg2 when you run 'gpg' while the previous version used gpg1.
Possible solution:
* Make a backup (just to be sure).
* Re-run the migration of the keys from the old storage format to the new one. I think all you have to do is to remove the file ~/.gnupg/.gpg-v21-migrated.

You might not want to store your personal master key on a computer provided (and controlled) by your employer.
Also: Ask yourself what happens when you change the employer. Your employer might want you to revoke the key. And your new employer probably doesn't want the old employer's UID on the key you use for the new employer.
If you are self-employed and/or use a smartcard for you master key, then those reasons may not be that relevant.
But I suggest to ask the opposite question: What benefits are there for _not_ having separate master keys for personal and professional use?

@_date: 2020-07-15 11:03:53
@_author: Ingo =?ISO-8859-1?Q?Kl=F6cker?= 
@_subject: Multiple UIDs or multiple master keys? 
Yes and no. Yes, because your master key cannot be compromised if it's kept off of the computer controlled by your employer.
But it will create problems for people who want to send you encrypted messages because there's no way for them to know which of the encryption subkeys to use. You may work around this by making sure that the non-personal encryption subkey is newer than then personal one because, AFAIK, gpg will automatically select the newest encryption subkey. But that's a fragile setup.
Those benefits make sense if you use your personal user account on your personal computer also for professional stuff. Otherwise, I see no benefit in having identical configurations on different computers. My work-work computers have always been configured completely differently from my personal computers.
In my opinion using separate master keys outweighs those minor conveniences of using the same master key by far. I have always used separate master keys in the past. And, in fact, I find it more convenient because it saves me the hassle of juggling around with different subkeys. Your mileage may vary.

Probably, no matching cipher suite. According to ssllabs.com/ssltest openpgpkey.torproject.org (well, at least one of the actual servers) only supports the following cipher suites:
# TLS 1.3 (server has no preference)
# TLS 1.2 (server has no preference)
I think none of those matches any of those in the output of ntbtls in your

@_subject: Checking multiple smart cards before asking for one 
Maybe you should optimize for what appears to be your usual scenario (laptop + card reader versus other machines + yubikey) and simply remove the yubikey key from the laptop and the card reader key from the other machines. If gpg only knows about one of the two keys, then it shouldn't ask for the wrong key. If you ever want to use the yubikey on the laptop, then you can simply (re-)import the yubikey key on the laptop.
The downside is that this will make synchronization of ~/.gnupg between your laptop and the other machines more difficult. But then you really only need a single key per machine for decrypting your passwords, i.e. you could use dedicated GNUPG_HOMEs just for the encryption keys.

@_subject: keys require a user-id 
Because in GnuPG the validity of keys is bound to validity and owner trust of UIDs. No UID -> invalid key. Why do you want to be able to import a key in GnuPG that would be utterly unusable?
To cite Robert J. Hansen:
"Unless you know what you're doing and why, use the defaults."
Consequently, it's a good thing that GnuPG, by default, doesn't bother new users with difficult decisions.

I suppose you also entered an empty string for "Email address":
$ gpg --gen-key
Note: Use "gpg2 --full-generate-key" for a full featured key generation GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.
Real name: Email address: You selected this USER-ID:
    ""
Change (N)ame, (E)mail, or (O)kay/(Q)uit? o
gpg: [internal]: no User-ID specified
Generating a key with empty "Real name" and non-empty "Email address" (and vice versa) works:
$ gpg --gen-key
Note: Use "gpg2 --full-generate-key" for a full featured key generation GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.
Real name: Email address: foo at example.com
You selected this USER-ID:
    "foo at example.com"
Change (N)ame, (E)mail, or (O)kay/(Q)uit? o
A key with above User-ID is generated.
I agree that there could be a more user-friendly error message than "gpg: [internal]: no User-ID specified". In particular, it makes little sense to ask the user if everything is okay if the empty values the user entered do not result in a valid User-ID.

Could also be caused by antivirus software. Such software prevents access to new files until it has checked those files. Maybe telling the antivirus software to ignore S.gpg-agent files helps.
As for gpg-agent, maybe it could retry binding the socket a few times (with some delay) if an unknown error occurs.

@_subject: Clarification on getting a validity reason in GPGME 
In the C++ bindings the equivalent for validity_reason is, more appropriately, called nonValidityReason. Also, validity refers to the (local) validity of the certificate that was used to make the signature. As far as I can see, in case of gpgsm validitity can take only three of the above mentioned 6 values:
* FULL (if the signature is good; the signature cannot be good if there is a problem or an untrusted key in the certificate chain; in this case validity_reason is 0)
* NEVER (if the certificate chain is invalid; in this case validity_reason gives more details)
* UNDEFINED (if there was some other problem while validating the certificate As mentioned above the variable is just named badly. It would better have been called non_validity_reason (as in the C++ binding).
I'm wondering what kind of reason do you expect for a good signature? I mean there's exactly one reason for a good signature: The signature is "cryptographically correct" and the certificate that was used to make the signature is valid. In all other cases the signature is not good and then it makes sense to ask for the reason why it's not good.

@_subject: cannot verify .sig 
GnuPG consists of several applications (e.g. gpg as frontend called by Kleopatra and gpg-agent as backend) that talk to each other. I'm not sure whether this communication requires local network connections on Windows. On Linux it's done via socket connections. Anyway, maybe blocking network access also blocks the local communication between gpg and gpg-agent. You may have to allow local network access for gpg.

Is this id really the keygrip of the key? Or is it probably the key's fingerprint? You need to add --with-keygrip to make --list-secret-keys show the keygrip.

@_subject: [cross post] Why does verification of a detached signature result 
OpenPGP.js?
Could be a problem with text mode vs. non-text mode. By default, gpg uses non-
text mode when signing something. Try adding --textmode to gpg's command line.
This is just a wild guess, but fromText() could imply text mode in OpenPGP.js.

@_subject: GPGME (for python) questions 
On Freitag, 23. Oktober 2020 21:48:49 CEST Hammett, Rich via Gnupg-users Check the documentation of gpgme. The README of the current version reads
"For support of the OpenPGP and the CMS protocols, you should use the
latest version of GnuPG (>= 2.1.18) , available at:
Note that GnuPG 2.1.x is no longer supported (even if it might still work with In general, old functionality in gpgme that worked with an old version of GnuPG should still work with the latest version of gpgme, but there are no guarantees. New functionality of gpgme usually is only developed to work with the current GnuPG release (because often the new gpgme API needs new internal API in GnuPG and its helpers).
So, if possible, use the most recent GnuPG 2.2 release with the most recent release of gpgme.
Note that gpgme now includes the Python bindings.
I suggest to check out the tests of the Python bindings, in particular,
t-decrypt.py and t-callbacks.py (for passphrase callbacks).
A common recommendation on this list is to use a passphrase-less secret key for automated decryption because this isn't really less secure than storing the passphrase in cleartext in some script file next to the secret key.
Another approach is to inject the passphrase into gpg-agent's passphrase cache with an unlimited (or near unlimited) expiration time. The latter approach requires human interaction (or scripted interaction from another system) for entering the passphrase into the cache after every restart of gpg-agent (e.g. after a system reboot) and is obviously much more error-prone than a passphrase-less key.
The archive of this list is available via the link at the bottom of this message (which is added automatically by the mailing list).
