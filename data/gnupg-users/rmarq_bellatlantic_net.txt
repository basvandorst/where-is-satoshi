Hash: SHA1
If it isn't listed somewhere, this is the type of information that would
nicely fit into the PGP Interactions page that I maintain.  The purpose of
the page is to determine what versions of PGP will use RSA keys, DSS keys,
etc.  (Lately the purpose has grown to include differences in features as
well.)  I also have a (slightly out of date) GPG
Page.  I'm willing to add the information if someone could please send it to
me.  RJ    :)

@_subject: Question regarding clearsigning emails automatically 
Hash: SHA1
I'd agree, except for this:  What software allows you to sign messages
without ever entering the passphrase?  With the pine/pgpenvelope/gpg setup
I use, I have to enter it each time.  I know the Win versions of PGP have
a "timeout" where it stores the passphrase for so long (up to 5 minutes
IIRC), but you still have to enter it once.  That's where your analogy to
the "signed but blank stack of documents" breaks down.
I disagree that signing every email "cheapens" the process for that
I sign most of my list email for several reasons:  the more PGP/GPG
traffic floating around, the less attention each one receives.
Also, don't we look a bit foolish if we claim to be advocates of PGP and
GPG, but don't even use it amongst ourselves?  ("Practice what you
preach.")  It doesn't hurt to use the signed messages.
Plus, if I didn't I might forget my passphrase.  :)

I send signed messages to a YahooGroups list without any problems (at
least, no one has said they don't verify).  Check your line wrap settings
and all...  RJ    :)
