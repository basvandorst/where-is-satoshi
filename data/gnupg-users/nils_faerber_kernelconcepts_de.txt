Errr... you need the OpenPGP smart card to us it with GnuPG as a
key-storing smart card. This does not work just with any card ;)

@_subject: Card-reader tests 
Maybe it is of interest for some of you, I have tested a bunch of
readers lately and here are my results.
All tests were performed with GnuPG SVN head as of 14 October 2009 with
an OpenPGP V2.0 card.
working with GnuPG-CCID *and* PC/SC:
- SCM SCR-335
- SCM SPR-532 (with pinpad when using GnuPG CCID, without pinpad when
using PC/SC)
working only with PC/SC:
- Omnikey Cardman 4040 (PCMCIA)
- Gemalto USB Shell Token V2
- Gemalto USB PC-Twin
- Gemalto USB SL
- Gemalto PC Pinpad (keypad and LCD not supported)
- Gemalto PC Card
untestet but quite likely to work:
- Gemalto PC Express Card
not working with either GnuPG CCID or PC/SC:
- Omnikey CardMan 3121
- Omnikey CardMan 3021
- Omnikey CardMan 3621
- Omnikey CardMan 6121
Interesting is that though Gemalto claims that their USB readers are
CCID compliant none of them works with the GnuPG CCID.
What might be the reason? Since I happen to have access to all of them,
could I potentially fix this?

Well, yes and no.
With a pinpad at least you have to confirm any transaction so that
transactions cannot take place "under the hood" without you noticing.
Assuming the attacker got hold of the PIN a malicious software could do
an almost unlimited number of transactions without the user being able
to notice (well, at least most of the card readers I know do not have
something like an activity LED).
The non-obvious content of the transaction, what you say as "you do not
see what you sign even on the PIN-pad" is an issue that has been
discussed a lot of times already - yes, it is definitely an issue but
very hard to solve. IMHO this would require a card terminal that
understands the data to be signed and present the user with a meaningful
But it strictly assumes again that this terminal cannot be compromised
too. And being more intelligent (in order to display complex data) means
to be a more complex device containing more complex device software
which again opens new possible security holes.
Very difficult... I once worked in a consortium on such a specialised
solution where a PDA would be used as a crypto token and was sent a
parsable XML which was to be signed. The (parsed) XML could be presented
to the user, a hash calculated and be signed, all on the PDA token
terminal. But of course this only worked for the project's special XML

Well... I am not a security/crypto hacker but a kernel hacker. And from
a kernel hacker's perspective this could be easy to solve!
I could write a very simple driver which provides a mmap()able memory
area which the application can use, protected by the kernel, and which
will be automatically cleared upon suspend.
Would that solve the problem?
How much memory are we talking about here? Bytes? Kbytes? Or Mbytes?
This would of course not be portable, i.e. it would only work in Linux.

Hmm... cool ;)
So, what do you think, would it be worth the effort?
If it would help GnuPG and if you would like to use it I would offer to
implement it and try to push it upstream.

We have been shipping cards to the US for quite a while now and never
had any issues.
As far as we know, and we tried to thoroughly research this, the OpenPGP
card does not fall under any special regulations, i.e. neither crypto
im- or export nor customs issues.
We also try to minimize postage&packing cost as much as possible - so
organising a collective order is a very welcome idea!

Well, at least similar, let's say.
The CryptoStick uses an AVR microcontroller as cardreader chip and the
sotware to that AVR is also AFAIK free software.

Am 12.06.2013 07:24, schrieb Navin:
IANAL but from my understanding:
1. by invocation of the commandline commands: Yes
2. invocation of GnuPG exe: Yes
3. Linking, dynamically or statically, against a GnuPG DLL, presumed
that it is licensed under GPL: No
The DLL usage would require the DLL to be licensed under LGPL, which
is the very reason why LGPL was invented.
Im am not sure which parts of the GnuPG suit are licensed under which
license though, e.g. if the GnuPG DLL (if such exists at all) is
licensed GPL or LGPL.

AZO colours make up the majority of artificial colours used for all

own especially on special types of sensitive people (like ADHS) and are

So no AZO colours would mean that your stomach will not hurt because of
the colours after having finished your hat :)
