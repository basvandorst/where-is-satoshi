@_subject: Problem with messages sent using PGP 7.0.3 
I used to use PGP 7.0.3 and switched to GPG a few days ago. I imported my public and private keys from PGP with no problems. One of my colleagues still uses PGP 7.0.3 (freeware) and is using my public key to encrypt messages to me.

Can anyone help me in figuring out this problem?
