@_subject: compile 
This is a known bug; it has been mentioned here before (when it bit me ;-)
It wants to link against zlib, and you don't have the developer files (i.e.
zlib-devel-blahblah.rpm) installed.
Either upgrade to 0.9.10 (which wont link against zlib unless you tell
./configure to) or install zlib.
Hope I got that right.

@_subject: UTF-8 encoding in key IDs 
A simple question.
The 'o' in my first name 'Jorgen' is in reality an 'umlauted' o, and that's
what I used when I created my key.
Shouldn't I have done that? I have fooled around a bit, and I can't find a
way to make GnuPG display my name properly e.g. when I list my keyring.
It is always printed as 'J\xc3\xb6rgen Grahn' - and after consulting the RFC
that explains UTF-8, that seems correct; the single Latin-1 character is
encoded as two octets with the MSB set, while plain old ASCII characters are
left untouched. It would be nice though to be able to see it in its proper
Latin-1 form...

@_subject: Compile glitch? 0.9.8, -lz 
I recently tried to compile gnupg 0.9.8 on my Linux box (Redhat 5.2).
At least in the 'tools' directory, I got linking errors due to the presence
of the -lz flag (zlib, that is).
The problem went away when I installed zlib-devel.
However, I suggest it is a misfeature, because I got it regardless if I
configured --with-included-zlib or not.
I did not have the problem when I compiled 0.9.6.

Assuming the mail from you is signed and composed like the Mutt mailer does
it (which is the format described in RFC2015), it looks like this to a
MIME-aware reader:
The mail is multipart, of the "multipart/signed" subtype.
It consists of two parts ("attachments"). The first is plain text (content
type "text/plain") which any reader should know about, the other is
"application/pgp-signature", which only RFC 2015-aware mailers know anything
Any MIME-aware reader should be OK with this. How it should _display_ the
mail is another question. If it doesn't know about RFC 2015, it cannot grok
the "signed" in "multipart/signed", and might decide that nothing should be
displayed "inline". You then get exactly what you describe above.
However, if I was a mail reader and saw a multipart mail where exactly one
of the attachments was plain text and all the others were non-displayable, I
would display that text part. But I don't think MIME says I _must_ do it.
Sorry about all the "quotes" above ;-)
