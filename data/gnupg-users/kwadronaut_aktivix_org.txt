@_subject: Sha256 - gpg.conf 
That's quite an accomplishment. Only that file or a whole storage device?
gpg --version and gpg2 --version will tell you were there configuration
file lies, and they're very likely both going to use the same file.
Thanks to the developers that goes just fine (up until now, for me).
'Any special security commands' is vague, are you looking for ideas
along the lines of "personal-digest-preferences SHA256",
"cert-digest-algo SHA256", or something totally different?

@_subject: invalid gpg key revocation 
Never underestimate family, friends, neighbors and above all: pets! I've
witnessed the combination of toddler + cat writing and sending encrypted
and signed garbage to an ex-partner.
That's like a pretty bad idea. A cached passphrase could be used for a
thousand different things which are more nasty as a revocation. If you
don't like that: don't let it be cached. That's already configurable.

@_subject: Proper revocation 
Big thanks to Daniel who helped me once again by putting me on the right
A solution, with some comments in between the commands, so people can't
simply copy-paste but think about what they're doing.
$ cd $(mktemp -d)
Mind what you're doing, others might be able to read in that directory.
$ gpg --export $KEYID | gpgsplit -v
I think gpgsplit people deserve a big thank you.
$ gpg --expert --delete-keys 0x3F6C6602
expert because it would usually be a silly thing to do; removing the
pubkey when there's still a private key for it.
gpg: there is a secret key for public key "$KEYID"!
gpg: use option "--delete-secret-keys" to delete it first.
$ rm 000002-002.sig
Don't know what packet you need to remove, but you know what a backup
is, right?
$ cat * | gpg --import
apologies to the list-maintainer for extra work

@_subject: key revocation reasons in frontends/gnupg 
I was thinking/discussing rfc2440 5.2.3.22. Reason for Revocation. I'd
love to hear opinions why it would or wouldn't make sense to have this
information easy(easier) available with gnupg or some frontends. I
personally find it very convenient to point people to that packet to say
that I for example have a new key that superseded the old one. But maybe
you have other opinions? For sake of easiness I'll paste here the
relevant RFC section:
   (1 octet of revocation code, N octets of reason string)
   This subpacket is used only in key revocation and certification
   revocation signatures. It describes the reason why the key or
   certificate was revoked.
   The first octet contains a machine-readable code that denotes the
   reason for the revocation:
       0x00 - No reason specified (key revocations or cert revocations)
       0x01 - Key is superceded (key revocations)
       0x02 - Key material has been compromised (key revocations)
       0x03 - Key is no longer used (key revocations)
       0x20 - User id information is no longer valid (cert revocations)
   Following the revocation code is a string of octets which gives
   information about the reason for revocation in human-readable form
   (UTF-8). The string may be null, that is, of zero length. The length
   of the subpacket is the length of the reason string plus one.

@_subject: determine encryption key without trying to decrypt 
Quoting Hauke Laging :
Because of the --hidden-recipient (or --hidden-encrypt-to name)  functionality, you're sort-of obliged to simply throw whatever secret  keys you have at it and hopefully be able to decrypt it. Why don't you  use the option from the faq [1], is there something wrong with:
  gpg --batch --decrypt --list-only --status-fd 1 2>/dev/null | \
   awk '/^\[GNUPG:\] ENC_TO / { print $3 }'

@_subject: Signature timestamp ordering and dissecting 
Up until now, I always see signatures on a key ordered in chronological
fashion, with GnuPG, sks' web interface and enigmail. It's always in a
format with day, month and year (sometimes year-month-day or another
format of that data). Now I'm curious to see when a signature has
*exactly* been made. Can I see the exact time stamp of individual
signatures? And the next question would be: how? And: is there any
specific rationale behind ordering the signatures in a chronological
way? Can signatures be made at the exact same time?

@_subject: CryptoList - Looking for beta testers 
?re you also aware of Schleuder? [1] I don't want to surpress your
enthusiasm, but if possible, maybe, you can ameliorate that other thing
even more?
With Schleuder:
Or an outsider, depends on the configuration. There are some good use
cases, for example if a list address is used as a contact address.
Depends on configuration, see above.
I guess that's a default minimal basic thing everyone expects to be done
Same as Schleuder
If this part was missing I wouldn't call it mailing list software ;-)
Sound like you created a mitm! ;-)
So, I'm sorry that I'm not here to beta-test, but would rather see
Schleuder getting better as someone reinventing the wheel. Maybe your
wheel is more round or has better brakes, I don't know. [2] It has
happened to me before that I enthusiastically spend a lot of time on
something that someone else already did. And sometimes that other
project served as a good example or inspiration.
I might be asking (too) much, but I'd suggest to reconsider SourceForge,
they now try to push some drive-by installer in everyones mouth. I guess
a discussion on that subject is too much off-topic for this list, so
I'll stick with a link to a simple rant. [3]
All in all, I hope I found the right tone in my mail, don't get it
wrong, I applaud your energy and enthusiasm! And if someone figures a
way to do group public key encryption, I'd be interested in hearing how
that would work.
[1] [2] I wonder, were the first wheels in humankind equipped with brakes?

@_subject: How to convert (ancient) key in "version 2" to more modern 
Such a tool would indeed be nice. Have you come across one or know of
one? It's probably not straightforward, giving the many formats this
data comes in (inline in e-mails, textfiles, PGP/MIME, ?)

@_subject: Expired cert with HSTS for this list 
Seems like this fragile thing called time has taken over again.
Validity of the TLS cert deployed on
 goes until Monday,
December 18, 2017 at 9:13:00 PM, and that time was yesterday for me. It
breaks many browsers with the included HSTS, luckily I still have lynx
around. Might be time to let LetsEncrypt refresh the certs automagically
every once in a while.
Thanks to the lovely sysadmins for keeping these lists and archives online!
