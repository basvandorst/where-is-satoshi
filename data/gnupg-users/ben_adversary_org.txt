@_subject: multiple subkeys and key transition 
doing a (long-term) transition to them.  This is partly to respond to
known flaws with SHA-1 and take advantage of SHA-256 and higher.
There is currently a push to move away from SHA-1 usage by the end of
2010, although it will almost certainly take longer than that.  There
is a discussion of some of the issues involved here.
At the moment I am planning on using an RSA signing key, but I have
not made my final decision on the encryption subkeys.  I am leaning
towards Elgamal, but that's by no means certain.
The other option, of course, is to create a key with both RSA and
Elgamal encryption subkeys, which does lead to questions:
1) I've forgotten how GPG handles the subkeys, does it choose the
strongest key or the newest key by default or does it encrypt to all
active (non-revoked or non-expired) subkeys?
2) How does PGP (of any version) handle multiple subkeys?
3) Does anyone know of any problems or issues with any version of PGP
or GPG when handling keys with multiple subkeys?
4) Which encryption algorithm do people prefer of RSA and Elgamal, if
either, and why?  I'm doing my own research here, of course, but it
doesn't hurt to ask (yes, I'm already aware of Sam Simpson's
informative FAQ and am re-reading it).
The opinions of the list on any or all of these questions would be
greatly appreciated.
P.S. Apologies to readers of PGPNET and/or PGPMIMENET, who have
already seen this message.  ;)

That would matter if I had/used smartcards, but I don't so it doesn't.
I prefer to simply have complete physical control over any system
which my secret keys are installed on.

Userful to know, can I track the WG's progress through this list or is
that done through the IETF or the OpenPGP site?
Urgh, what a hideous thought.
Well, my current key has been perfectly fine since it's creation
nearly a dozen years ago.  I'm still sufficiently sure that there is
no imminent threat, so I'm happy to just watch and wait and see what
the WG says.

I've already switched the hash preference on the key, it will now use
RIPEMD-160 before SHA-1, but it won't accept the higher SHA
algorithms.  Currently it only switches back to SHA-1 when I'm signing
and encrypting to other keys which can't handle RIPEMD-160.
Since it has already been mentioned that smartcards only work with
RSA, that could be a factor.  I suspect their development, which I
haven't followed too closely, was to address the concerns of OpenPGP
users who were unable to control the hardware on which their mail
and/or keys were stored and required an additional level of physical
security to prevent an unscrupulous systems administrator from
accessing a secret keyring (and possibly brute forcing the
It's possible, at this stage unlikely, but I won't rule anything out.

Effectively.  The server is always on, but my secret keyring is not
installed on the server.  The only active system with the secret
keyring is only running when I am in front of it.
Well, I suppose there's the threat of people kicking in the door, but
if that kind of situation were to become a possibility (again), my
concerns wouldn't pertain to my email and/or files, my concerns would
be more in the nature of defending life and limb.

Ah, a debate, excellent.  Now let's make it a little more
entertaining, where do you see RIPEMD-160 in the scheme of things?
I ask because that seems to be the only update my current DSA/Elgamal
key can accept (via setpref).
Thanks, more reading material is a welcome addition.
Is it possible that this current transition push is partially aimed at
reigniting the WG's discussion by creating a new de-facto standard?
In much the same way that PGP 5.x became the foundation for OpenPGP
(RFC 2440 and then 4880).
What is the likelihood of that actually being the case?
Good to know.  Should I make the transition now/soon, my current plan
is either of these two options:
1) 4,096-bit RSA signing key with a 4,096-bit Elgamal encryption key.
2) 4,096-bit RSA signing key with a 4,096-bit RSA encryption key and a
4,096-bit Elgamal encryption key.
Since I prefer a more long-term approach, this should eventually lead
to 8,192-bit encryption keys when 4,096-bit becomes the default.
That's probably a fair way down the track, though, very likely several
years away.

Well, I changed the prefs on my key to this:
[ultimate] (1). Ben McGinnes      Cipher: AES256, TWOFISH, CAMELLIA256, AES192, CAMELLIA192, AES,
CAMELLIA128, 3DES, CAST5, BLOWFISH, IDEA

     Compression: BZIP2, ZLIB, ZIP, Uncompressed

Yet it still ignores everything which precedes RIPEMD160, presumably
because it's a DSA1 key and can't handle the SHA-2 digests.

I'm glad I'm not the only one who likes to find answers this way.  :)
For some reason I thought SHA-1 was 128-bit, but I've no idea why I
thought that.
That sounds an awful lot like security through obscurity.  Or, more to
the point, the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence (of a
security flaw).
Yeah, I'll get to Robert's response next.  ;)
Which seems reasonable to me.
My current key was created at the end of 1998, I'm pretty sure that
DSA2 wasn't around then.  Back then the biggest argument was
maintaining compatibility with PGP 2.6.x (and earlier); when many
people would not update because of fears of backdoors being inserted
in software that was able to be exported outside of the United States.
Ah ... the Crypto Wars, how we don't miss them!
Okay.  My key doesn't have that many signatures, but I like the ones
I've got.  Still, I suppose the sanctity of my own signatures should
be of just as great, if not greater, concern.
Fair enough.
Yep, okay.
I assume that there's still no indication of if and/or when that might
be viable?
I suppose a better question is: is a preimage attack against SHA-1
simply a matter of time?
Is this why a revoked key can still be used to decrypt data that was
encrypted with a non-revoked copy of the key?
Why do I get the feeling that this bit is addressed to Werner ...  ;)
Okay, I just looked that up and in spite of a tentative statement that
the final round would be announced this year, there doesn't appear to
be any statement on that front.  I suppose that could happen in the
next three weeks, but it could also mean delays in the process.
Hmm, I'm beginning to be swayed again.
This is somewhat encouraging.
I'm not sure I do either, which brings me back to the RSA vs. Elgamal
debate (and more reading).
I know better than to ask for that kind of prediction, especially with
EC possibly entering the arena.  Thanks.

That sounds an awful lot like the reason behind creating my current
key.  Actually, that's not true, there's a set from about six months
earlier that I thought I new the passphrase to, but ... you know the
rest of that tale (just about everyone does that at least once).  ;)
Well, I have rather enjoyed the fact that the 4096-bit Elgamal key I
created a dozen years ago is still considered practically impossible
to defeat (not counting if I ever managed to piss off the NSA/DSD).
Any larger would start getting a bit ridiculous (although I do know
which bit of keygen.c to tweak to make it possible).

Yep, they were standard issue when I worked at Sun.
The Sun ones are authentication tokens, combined with RFID security
Yeah, I can see the value of them, but I don't really see how they
would make enough addition to my security requirements to justify
either the monetary or operational expense (i.e. additional
complication).  If I piss off a TLA or the local equivalent (a couple
of them have four letters) then they've got other ways of getting what
they want.
Not in the sense you mean.
Actually, since writing what I did earlier, I did a quick
double-check.  And I do recall everything the keys were ever backed up
to and I really do know exactly where they all are.  I was quite
impressed given the age of the key.  ;)
It always does.
Highly unlikely I'd ever do this.

a way that would be just too damn depressing.  Contrary to most films,
it is *not* cool.

constructed argument, only to consider a possibility which presents a
huge gaping hole in it?  ;)

using smartcards.  So it would be clearer for me to say that I don't

Bigger is better mentality.  I'm happy to be corrected to whatever is
most usefully secure.  When I created my current key I was essentially
moving from a 1024-bit RSA key made with PGP 2.3a and there were a
whole bunch of reasons to go with something stronger.  At the time I
erred on the side of caution and picked the largest key size available
to me.
Good to know.  Presumably the same goes for Elgamal.
The last bit of documentation I saw on ECC is a little old and stated
that it wasn't well known enough to consider using.  I guess that's
changed now.
So my 4096-bit Elgamal key with an AES256 cipher would be somewhere
between SECRET and TOP SECRET (discounting the real information
security policies that are applied by any DoD/spook personnel, in
either your country or mine).
Okay, it looks like I've got more reading to do, so I know what to
expect when it puts in an appearance.  Thanks.
Since you're backing it all up with verifiable and useful data, I'm
happy to take these suggestions.  In the past I've seen similar
arguments, but rarely with the relevant reference material to back the
assertions up.  So this is all most welcome.
As for more questions, no doubt I'll have more as I plough through all
this stuff.

That's what I've got.
Which is what I'm trying to formulate.
Just to clarify, does this mean that SHA-256 or 512 (or whatever)
truncated to 160-bits prevent the potential collision attacks that
might be able to be launched against SHA-1?
Ah, cool.

The last thing I read on ECC was Sam Simpson's FAQ on PGP, which was
published in 1999 and was saying exactly that.
That's a fairly significant update.
The DSD over here have fairly similar recommendations, but then they
work very closely with the NSA.  The unclassified version of their
Information Security Manual is here:
And a lot of vendors supporting those contractors and other personnel.
It doesn't help if the rules are ignored, though, as recent events
have demonstrated.  I've no doubt there are people inside the NSA
reaching for the LARTs and the Clue-by-Fours.  ;)

Cool.  I've already had a play around with that, but having the option

SSL Certificates have nothing to do with the encryption or security
and everything to do with a third party confirmation that the site is
owned and operated by the organisation that it says it is.  The CAs
have managed to carve a nice little niche for themselves by preying on
the fears of people who don't understand this and have made that a
de-facto standard business practice.

Excellent.  :)
Bear in mind that UTF-8 may become the standard in the
future, but as long as your gpg.conf matches the character set for
your email client and/or editor it should be fine (I explicitly set
UTF-8 for GPG, Thunderbird and Emacs).

@_date: 2010-11-14 12:13:47
@_author: Ben McGinnes 
@_subject: problem with german umlauts 
Yes, I saw that before and have seen similar behaviour with character
set conflicts on other systems.
You'll find that they either appear as question marks or an empty box,
depending on the display format (command line or GUI) where the
character cannot be represented.  In a GUI where it is a unicode
character that cannot be represented the square box will contain the
four character hex code for the unicode character (e.g. 00fc instead
of ?).
Okay, I'm not familiar with 40tude, but I have a theory.
This makes some sense, Thunderbird needs to be told which character
set to use (most will default to iso-8859-1, but it depends on the
version installed).
You should be able to change the Thunderbird setting to UTF-8 and make
it behave in View -> Character Encoding.

Okay, what about the preferences for Thunderbird?  I'm assuming you're
using Windows for all these, in which case go to Tools -> Options ->
Display -> Formatting -> Advanced.  Character Encodings for both
outgoing (composition) and incoming mail are set here (I'm assuming
that your setting was only in the View -> Character encoding
section).  You'll want this to match everything else (although it
shouldn't matter if View -> Character Encoding resets itself to
ISO-8859-1 if the other two are set to UTF-8).

Cool, I just double-checked in a couple of other messages, one in this

umlauts in both the body and in the headers (From field).  The
characters checked were ? and ?.  With UTF-8 it also has no problem
with most other characters incorporated in the unicode character set
(this can sometimes be affected by additions to unicode after the
release of the operating system or software used).
Somewhere around here I've got an auto-response to a mailing list in
Chinese with the Chinese characters in both the headers and the body.
In that case I was able to copy those characters into Google's
translation page (which is how I know it was an auto-response) and
paste my own translated response to it.  All of this displayed fine in
Thunderbird, even though I didn't use the unicode codes when I entered
my response.

I used to use Altavista's Babel service, which was pretty good too and

caught up on that front.
I can see the signature in the header, but Enigmail did not detect it
at all.  I think it will only check the body for in-line signed or
encrypted blocks and PGP/MIME.

# Any time "mynames" is a recipient (-r or --recipient), it will be
# expanded to the names "paige", "joe", and "patti", and the key ID
# "0x12345678".  Note there is only one level of expansion - you
# cannot make an group that points to another group.  Note also that
# if there are spaces in the recipient name, this will appear as two

Enigmail provides similar functionality via the Per-Recipient Rules.

Messages sent in OpenPGP/MIME format (with content type set to
"multipart/encrypted" and "application/pgp-encrypted") encrypt the
attachments automatically.  Messages sent with the body of the message
encrypted with ASCII armouring inline will not.
Most email clients which support OpenPGP/GPG either natively or via a
plug-in do the former automatically.  I use Thunderbird with Enigmail
and it will encrypt an attachment to an encrypted email without any
additional configuration or installation of libraries.

You shouldn't need to worry about changing the preferred order.  GPG
will determine the most compatible combination of ciphers and hashes
based on the keys used to encrypt messages.  For example, my preferred
symmetric cipher is AES-256, but on a certain mailing list I'm on
encrypted messages sent there use Triple-DES because of the
preferences/limitations of other recipients' keys.  That's all the
settings I listed were, an order of preference and not forcing one
particular algorithm to the exclusion of all else.

I'd only add that in-line is fine for encrypting messages since all

I usually responded with a pre-written explanation of what it was, why
I used it and why their (usually Microsoft) MUA couldn't handle it.

Right, so FM's only spoofing ability via a key would be to create one
in the same name as Martin and hope that people collecting keys would
just add it and not double-check the key ID/fingerprint.  I'd misread
that as FM doing something sneaky to generate a key that had a
matching key ID (though probably not a matching fingerprint).
That's probably the case for a lot of GPG usage.
Which is one of the valuable sides to signing all or most messages.
It helps prove when spoofing has occurred.
Yeah, I played with that years ago, but for the most part it was just
too irritating for most things I wanted to do.  Anonymity and
pseudonymity can be useful, but for my part that's only for certain

@_subject: hashed user IDs [was: Re: Security of the gpg private keyring?] 
Ah, but the keyID can already be used to locate a key, that's not what
MFPA is getting at.  What he wants is a function built into GPG and
the keyservers, possibly via some kind of proxy tool, to do this:
* User generates a key, when prompted for a name enters "Joe Citizen"
  and when prompted for an email address enters "joe at example.net"
* GPG or interface for it takes those strings and generates a hash
  (let's use SHA256 for this example) so the UID for the key appears
  to be:
  "7b7581fe6670a6a4a29b2fd46eaf5ac34a6a86d134fe8931729e66970b707349
  <466ffe71badce782db1808ee80bd01dabf0d95e4a3b8ccbbe5fcdc68b86c2bb9>"
* Anyone trawling through keys on a public server or downloading
  random keys cannot see who owns that key or what their email address
  is, but anyone who knows Joe or his email address can search the
  keyservers for that data because the hash can be calculated from the
  data they do have (e.g. joe at example.net) and search for the key with
  the matching hash.
This would allow someone to use a single key for multiple identities
or pseudonyms, without the information about those identities being
learned by different groups.  Well, probably not.
Personally, I think it's an interesting idea and I can see the value
in it, but I'm not sure there are enough people really pushing for it
(yet).  With things like the data retention legislation being pushed
in Europe, Australia and other countries, that may change.

That seems unnecessary.  The conversion of a search string to a hash
can be performed locally and the hash can then be passed to the
keyserver.  If there is a match, the key can be retrieved or updated
and since a specific key will be requested there is no need to conceal
the search parameters further.

I'd agree with this.  There are enough increases in prying eyes from
governments and corporations for more and more people to consider such
obfuscation warranted or warranted under some circumstances.
I have.  Many, many times.  There's no point doing it for a free email
service provider's domain (e.g. gmail.com), but sometimes there are
advantages in checking for keys belonging to people at particular
organisations (e.g. government departments).  This is one of the
reasons why I'd prefer MFPA's suggestion, were it ever implemented, to
be optional rather than the default.
If that feature weren't available, I doubt I would've found this:
pub   1024D/B3F77236 2000-09-21
uid                  Stephen Smith sub   2048g/0E0EEE5F 2000-09-21
Stephen Smith was in Opposition when he made that key, but now he's
Minister of Defence.
In the mean time, those who would be more likely to do this end up
creating pseudonymous accounts and separate keys for each case they
wish to deal with.
Good idea.
Ah, but will that be in our lifetimes?
I don't know how much effect that will really have on spam, but I can
see signatures helping to prevent things like this:
Following the revelation that the email at the centre of the scandal
had been faked by Godwin Grech, I did email my MP suggesting they
start using OpenPGP signatures.  Apparently the DSD had cleared
OpenPGP compliant software for use by government departments years
ago, but it was up to each department to decide whether or not to use
them.  Presumably Treasury and the Department of the Prime Minister
and Cabinet chose not to.

I can certainly see where a number of people would be interested in
this aspect, while those people wishing to publicly announce that
they've signed particular keys can do so by not utilising the hashing.
This, can only really work for the identities associated with a given
key.  At the end of the day, Alice still has to send an email to Bob
and a truly determined adversary who can intercept that email can at
least derive the key IDs the message is encrypted to.  Unless that
(incredibly annoying) feature of checking all secret keys is enabled,
of course.  I've forgotten what the option is called.
Yeah, well, I got so sick of changing my email address that I got my
own domain name (no, that wasn't the only reason).
With the way most spammers operate, I think this is of little effect
until such a time as the majority of global email users have keys on
the keyservers.  Most spammers just generate usernames at a target
domain name.  At least that's what my Postfix logs indicate.

There's nothing stopping you from creating an alternate gpg.conf file
(invoked via the --options flag) which points to different default
keys and even alternate keyrings.  Put the entire lot in a TrueCrypt
volume and when it's not in use, people won't be able to decrypt
enough to know about the alternate identities.
Not necessarily.  You can put anything you like in the UID and people
can search on that.  Just running "gpg --search-keys
alt.anonymous.messages" should show a good list of keys where people
have done exactly that over the years.
There are plenty of ways to reveal the identity of of correspondents
unless a certain amount of effort has been put into anonymising the
transmission.  Anyone wanting to do this (including just to play
around and see how it works) would be well served by looking into Tor
and remailers.
Yes and it would be dangerous to create something which instills a
false sense of security.  This hashing idea is an interesting method
of preventing the revelation of a given identity (real or
pseudonymous) from a casual observer, but it does not prevent a number
of things which enable that information to be determined, including
traffic analysis.
The thing is, the hashed UID idea isn't attempting to address an issue
with GPG per se.  It's attempting to address an issue with privacy of
identity in a larger context; to whit, by attempting to conceal names
and social connections as they are displayed as UIDs and signatures or
certificates.  There are other ways to obtain this information, even
without utilising GPG or examining the body of a message.  Traffic
analysis alone reveals far more than who may have signed someone's key
at some point in time.
Robert's already covered this pretty well.

Currently I can run "gpg --search-keys aph.gov.au" and get the keys

unless the person generating the hash specifies additional hashes to
be included then that will cease to work.
As much as I find your idea interesting, I think I'd rather have the
ability to search on sections of a UID.  If I ever want to be
contacted in a way that is separate from my name, then I'll just go to
the effort of creating a new key with a pseudonym and relevant mail
If your hashed UID were an optional feature that were not enabled by
default, I doubt I would object, but I think the current use of UIDs
has value that I would not want to see superceded by the hashed

There's something else about this which has been nagging me, how would
you address this:
Currently a user's public keyring contains easily readable UIDs and
can be examined in any way they see fit.  If hashed UIDs were adopted
it would be possible to have hundreds of keys in the keyring which
only display hashed UIDs when listing the keyring.  Some of these may
belong to people the user corresponds with, some may have been picked
up in order to try to verify the WoT and some may have been picked up
to verify signatures on correspondence (e.g. in mailing lists).
So, my question, how would you enable a user to display those keys
with known names or identities without searching for a specific key
belonging to a particular person?
Say I ended up with a couple of hundred keys using only hashed UIDs
and I know that around 40 of them are people I correspond with, the
rest are from signatures on mailing lists or whatever.  If I wish to
split those keys off from the others into a smaller keyring, instead
of leaving everything in the default keyring, how do I determine that
without wading through large email archives to find the key IDs of
those people I have corresponded with?
Also, when I am viewing the signatures on keys and I see signatures
containing hashed UIDs of other people I do know and also have keys
for, how do I know which one is which in order to differentiate them
from the hashed UIDs of keys I may have, but don't know the identities
It could be done with a local db or address book which maps previous
key searches to the hashes and keys they match, but this seems to be
an additional level of complexity just to achieve a current feature
and could also be used to circumvent the entire idea if performed on a
large enough scale.

Don't depend on the mailing lists, we're a very small subset of GPG
users.  All relevant documentation will need to be included for those
users where connectivity to the Internet is sporadic at best.
That too is an understandable argument.  Especially when it comes to
searching the keyservers, but less easy to maintain in relation to
searches of a local keyring (as I discussed in my other message).
I'd definitely say the default should be off and enabling it only via
expert mode would probably be wise.
That appears to be the case.  Certainly for individuals like yourself
I can see the appeal.
Yes.  Although to be honest, even if this feature were added, I don't
see it becoming very popular.
That would require an OpenPGP policy being adopted which is not
exactly common with most organisations.
I doubt there would be much change, although it does raise another
question: if you have a key that only has hashed UIDs of your real
name and email address(es), would you wish to prevent signatures of
your key from contacts who did not use the hashing function?  If the
concern is preventing your personal information being revealed and
someone who knows you, but is less concerned about this is willing to
sign your key, would you attempt to stop them?  After all, a
relationship could be determined by their identity and if there were
enough such signatures from people you know in real life, it may be
possible to determine your identity that way.
It seems that the only real strength the hashed UID has is if it is
adopted by every user, regardless of whether they want it or not.
Anyway, the more we discuss this, the less likely it appears that it
will be added to either GnuPG or any of the commercial PGP products,
let alone the RFCs.
Still, the advantage of GnuPG is that it is released under the GPL
(version 3, last time I checked), so there's nothing stopping you from
creating your own fork to add the feature.  If it became popular
through practical example then the chances of the feature being
incorporated in the main release would be vastly increased.

Maybe when 2.1 actually reaches the next stable release (2.2) I'll
have to have another look.
I'd hardly call it "flashing lights" just to be listed on the
keyserver, especially when the same data source also contains a large
amount of effectively useless data in which any key on the servers is
buried amongst.
Speaking of which, I presume key ID 0x992F6351 is one of your tests?
If so, you probably should've used example.net as the domain name.

I can't speak for everyone else, but I've always taken the term of

I think that if spammers were harvesting addresses from the keyservers
then you would have received some by now.
I don't think they bother because:
a) The effort required to harvest the addresses would be better spent
elsewhere and most, if not all, spammers are lazy.
b) It would be easier to just generate usernames at a target domain
name than to work from a large list (these days).
c) It is more likely that OpenPGP users are going to include people
who will hunt down spammers and get their upstream providers to
disconnect them.

Which just shows how your use differs with that of others.  I have a
number of keys on my keyring and when I list them I like to see which
key belongs to which identity/account (I don't care if it's a real
name or not, just as long as I can see something that makes sense to
me).  Hashed IDs, depending on how common they became, would make this
and key management difficult.
No offence, but I think this is more a lack of imagination.  I think
my second key ever used a pseudonym with no email address or comment
and it was made the same day as my first one.
Perhaps.  As long as it is not a default option and it is well and
truly clear what limited privacy options it provides.  It would be too
easy for people just discovering it to believe that it provides
greater security than it really does.
True, but if the aim is not publishing personal information in the
clear, then other means of revealing that same information make this
"protection" little more than an annoyance to others.
Perhaps inferred is better, at least at first.
Alright, I can see how some might find that useful.
If all the UIDs were hashed then it would be considerably more
difficult to determine the identity of one of them, even if they had
signed each others' keys than if only one person had their name and
addresses hashed.

be included as part of the message body and will be part of the signed

will generate the error seen on the list.
To be sure that a text signature is appended without interfering with

Yep, I got essentially the same thing:
bash-3.2$ gpg -vvv pgp-easy.tgz.pgp
gpg: using character set `utf-8'
:symkey enc packet: version 4, cipher 3, s2k 3, hash 2
gpg: CAST5 encrypted data
:encrypted data packet:
gpg: encrypted with 1 passphrase
gpg: decryption okay
gpg: WARNING: message was not integrity protected
bash-3.2$ pgpdump pgp-easy.tgz.pgp
Old: Symmetric-Key Encrypted Session Key Packet(tag 3)(13 bytes)
New: Symmetrically Encrypted Data Packet(tag 9)(512 bytes) partial start
New: 	(13 bytes) partial end
I symmetrically encrypted another file with CAST5 (same version of GPG
as you) and tried the same trick.  The !=X string did not produce the
the same message.  Instead I received the expected "decryption failed:
bad key" message.
Ah.  I suspect that it will either be something weird to do with
whatever software was used to encrypt the file or someone has found a
way to be sneaky with it.  Either way, when all is revealed please
post a follow-up.
Sure.  There has only been one other response which it does not appear

Just obtain the session key and stop there?  I've already tried -n

I can think of two reasons why there may be some value in including
the second signatures.  The first being if you have added a new UID to
your key and the new signatures are now applied to that.  The second
being to show that the key is consistently under your control.

No doubt someone else will encounter that scenario and see the value,
though (my key acquired a new UID just the other day, though it won't
get as much use as this address).
I think it's more in the nature of circumstantial evidence, the
strength of which is determined more by the person doing the signing
and their policy regarding key signing.  It can show a consistency of
control of the key and/or email address(es) associated with that key.

I'm most of the way through a test compile (in /opt/local) on OS X
10.9 (64-bit) here and it's mostly okay, save for pinentry.  This is
where I encounter what is likely to be a *big* deal in the not too
distant future.
Specifically with OS X Apple have moved from using libstdc++ as the
default to libc++ as the default and they're not binary compatible.
Since Apple's decision apparently relates to the license, there's a
lot of speculation that libstdc++ will be dropped entirely in a future
release of OS X.
Now since the configure script for pinentry is about 13,000 lines
long, I'd appreciate some pointers regarding which bit I need to
change to tell it to use libstdc++ and behave itself (obviously
getting the code to work with libc++ is a much bigger job).

I went looking for an explanation for the ld and clang errors and
found a rather large amount of grief on StackOverflow where people had
discovered the libstdc++ vs libc++ issue.  Clearly here it's tied to
gtk2 stuff, whereas Qt should be able to be handled by installing the
Qt libs directly.
Anyway, if it is the C++ thing, then in theory pointing things to
It's just that none of the options I tried to pass to LDFLAGS seemed
to do anything.  Plus the view that Apple deliberately broke something

I'll try that later.  At least this time it's getting a lot further

A very interesting project and nicely timed too since the protection
of header data will very neatly address a major concern which is now
relevant in Australia with the passing of mandatory data retention
legislation.  Yeah, now officially a police state, within 18 months
everyone will be under constant surveillance.
The custom and single client, as MFPA pointed out, might be
contentious for some users, but there are reasons and clear benefits
too.  I think the major features I'd request would be:
* The ability to load a new message or reply in the editor of your
  choice from the client when drafting, which ought to cut down on a
  lot of the UI debate.
* A client API so that people can extend it further the way they want,
  effectively creating multiple clients from the required base.
After that, the rest will attend to itself.

@_subject: SOLUTION: GPG 2.1.x not compiling on OS X (any version) 
encountered a most annoying error when compiling or attempting to
compile both pinentry and GnuPG itself.  It was a linker error where
x86_64 architecture was not recognised.  Online searches led to
similar problems affecting Qt and the solution for those users had
been to specify a different C++ library.  This, of course, only led to
further confusion here because there isn't any C++ in GPG or its
So I put the problem aside and turned to other things.  With the
Enigmail decision to drop support for 1.4.x, however, I decided that
it was time to have another crack and this time pursue a different
course of action.  By this time 2.1.2 had been added to MacPorts and
they clearly weren't seeing the same errors.  Off to Freenode to track
down one of the maintainers and pick brains I went.
To cut the entire process somewhat shorter, it apparently does not
matter which arguments and flags you pass to configure pointing to the
new libiconv library you just installed because OS X will ignore that
and use its own (in /usr/lib or wherever it is).
The solution is to do a full source install (sudo port -s install
[--force] gnupg21) with MacPorts.  It may still die in the final part
with GPG, but changing to the build directory and running the commands
again is fine.  If you wanted to tweak something before compiling,
this is the time to do it (or use the -k flag to keep the source and
then go back and run it manually later).
Special thanks go to Ionic, the MacPorts pinentry maintainer, who
correctly identified the libiconv fault.

@_subject: One alternative to SMTP for email: Confidant Mail 
Now you're making an assumption that all email addresses are created
for individuals.  Yet you also see a possible future of businesses use
it.  So if it is ever used by a team of people who all send email from
something like support at acme.com, you will encounter that scenario very
quickly.  Hence it would be better to simply have warnings of a
potential conflict rather than forcing the recipient to only choose
one sender.
Meaning that if you run your own server you don't have to maintain the
account too much if it sees very little traffic (initially).  Good.
Not to mention a good way to circumvent mandatory communications
surveillance and transnational corporations who believe they should be
able to view all your communications to make sure you're not quoting a
film without paying a tithe.
Heh.  Yes, it would be a good solution from them, but from what I've
seen they're just as lazy as the Stratfor employees (which is why
Stratfor got cracked and the others got arrested).
Cool.  There are definitely still aspects of it which need work,
mainly on the user interface end from what I can see so far, but it
answers so many problems (including Moxie Marlinspike's recent
complaint about OpenPGP and forward secrecy) that it could make a real
difference for a lot of people.
I still think, though, that the better solution for the UI issues is
to provide the specifications and an API so people can either adapt
their existing favourite clients to support CM or write whole new
ones.  It's the sort of system which nmh would handle very well, for
example.  No doubt there would be assorted other types of solutions
being adapted to it (I'd expect some people to treat it more like an
IM program than an email program too, depending entirely on how they
made the UI appear and behave).  By all means, use your own client as
an example, but if you want wider adoption then take advantage of
others wanting to do their own things with it.

Great plan ... how does the shell know that the angle brackets are a
part of the GPG UID format?
If I run these commands currently:
gpg -k foo at example.org
gpg -k gpg -k "foo at example.org"
gpg -k ""
The first, third and fourth all work, but the second complains, as it
rightly should, because bash uses < and > for other purposes,
specifically manipulating STDIN and STDOUT.  So I think you might find
it to be something that can't be fixed within GPG.  Instead the MUA
needs to either accept both formats (a bug in The Bat!) or enclose all
GPG key UIDs in quotation marks in order to mitigate that (a feature
request for The Bat!).

@_subject: gnupg preferences 
There should be a sample gpg.conf file installed to a directory close
to the installation directory.  The file is called gpg-conf.skel and
it is most likely to be in /usr/share/gnupg or /usr/local/share/gnupg.
This one sets cipher, hash and compression preferences for a key at
the time it is generated.
I haven't played with these so much, so I'll leave that for someone
else to answer.
It's related to the first one, but only affects the symmetric cipher
used to encrypt files and messages.
It is possible to set a default set of files to be added to a new
user's home directory when created, but the recommended method varies
by operating system and, in the case of Linux, by distribution.
The preferences for any key can be modified by editing the key and
updating the algorithms with the setpref command.  I am not sure which
GUI interfaces permit this, if any, but if that is limited then the
most likely one that would allow it is GPA.
In the keys, so that GPG can determine which algortithms a recipient
can use, though GPG itself needs to have those algorithms included
with its installation.  For example, the cipher preferences on your
key are:
Cipher: AES256, AES192, AES, CAST5, 3DES, IDEA
On mine they're:
Cipher: TWOFISH, CAMELLIA256, AES256, CAMELLIA192, AES192, CAMELLIA128,
AES, CAST5, BLOWFISH, IDEA, 3DES
If I were to send you an encrypted message, though, GPG would use your
preferred cipher, AES256, because that's the first shared preference.
Yes, but it can be changed.
This one is usually best set in a gpg.conf file, often with the
--encrypt-to option (to always encrypt messages to your own key).
These two are interchangable and used to override the default-key for
either signing or decryption purposes.
These are alternative methods of always encrypting to a specific key,
but are intended for when that key is not the default-key or when the
default-key or encrypt-to options are not set.
There is a GPG4USB project which provides versions for Windows and
Linux, but Linux users are much better off using the version which
comes with their distribution.
No, that adds an additional layer which could very easily be exploited
to compromise your information.

@_subject: Making the case for smart cards for the average user 
The function and operation you're after is reasonable, no arguments
there, my question is whether this is something which is actually a
fault with GPG or if it's your MUA.  I strongly suspect the latter and
here's why:
Using one of the more unique UIDs on my key (the 4th one) if I enter
that in the Enigmail Key Management window it returns my current key.
The same behaviour is seen with angle brackets at each end.  This
behaviour is replicated on the command line (bash) by including both
variants inside quotation marks, effectively telling bash to treat
them as part of a string.  It's only when that's not done that a
failure is produced.
*NOTE*: the 2nd and 3rd UIDs have been removed to make it clearer.
 Obviously you all know how to see those addresses.

get similar or possibly identical results.  If so, then chances are
pretty good that The Bat! is doing it wrong.
Yes, that's the point, they're the 4 most likely ways a mail client
might send a UID to GPG to look for a key, that was intentional.
Right, so for the MUA to match them as a string they do indeed need to
be escaped and it is precisely that behaviour which The Bat! needs to
implement for it to just work.  The way we know this is by seeing the
way Windows represents directory paths with spaces in them; that being
to enclose the string in quotation marks.
I'm happy to be proven wrong on that score, but since The Bat! is the
only client this happens with, even on Windows, I'm still fairly
confident that it's the cause.

@_subject: Making the case for smart cards for the average user 
Let me see if I've got this right ... the issue is one which can only
occur when the key owner has deliberately overridden the defaults by
using the "allow-freeform-uid" option, allowing them to drop the
standard format of "name " and then they're shocked
that doing so might produce unintended consequences?
Perhaps I'm being unreasonable, but surely if you go out of your way
to make sure that a particular pattern does *not* appear in your UID
then it is intended that searching on that pattern should not match
your UID.  Now granted, that intention may have been poorly considered
by said key owner, but I'd hardly call it a bug in GPG for not
anticipating that.  After all, all it is doing is matching the pattern
specified by the owner of the key.

Ah.  Alright, fair enough, *that* is a bug.  The previous descriptions
made it sound like a key with the first of those test UIDs wouldn't
show up when searching for "" to which my response
was, well yeah.  The basis of my concern there being that partial
matches on email would have even more unintended consequences when
gTLDs matched ccTLDs and the inevitable can of worms that leads to
(and certainly has in the past in a more general sense).

Said OP needs to spend about a year running an SMTP server before
making a design decision like that, but anyway.
Ah, but if it is truly just the email address then is it sitting in
the email field of the UID or the name field?  If it's the latter then
you could match any part of it you liked normally.  An email client is
likely to have a small fit at that point, but the email client is
designed to interact with a specific set of transmission protocols, in
this case SMTP.  So if a GPG user wants a UID that does not meet the
criteria for SMTP addressing then the GPG user can't expect it to work
automatically.  As for a vendor foisting poor configuration on end
users ... well, the instinctive reaction is to reach for a LART, but
that won't be necessary really because that vendor will be out of
business within a year.

I had this problem a while back when a certain person (I've

check for this key and deleting it:
    0xB4156B9700000000
The problem occurrs when multiple keys with a short key ID of all
zeroes is created and entered.
You'll probably need to delete and rebuild your trustdb from scratch
and then avoid importing keys with short IDs like that.

It's even more amusing if you've ever run the numbers on any country's
direct economic benefit from Internet commerce (which usually doesn't
count things like banking online).  I did for a white paper released
in 2009 during Australia's "clean feed" Internet censorship debate and
the figures were massive and growing at a ridiculous rate.
For any country with an equivalent GDP or larger (and most smaller),
mandatory backdooring of encryption is economic suicide.
Exactly.  Sometimes governments will produce some ridiculous things
which nearly become law, my own came precariously close to it a year
or two ago ... which is why one of the first things I added to any of
my commits for the GPGME stuff was a completed ITAR questionnaire.
So much confusion and FUD simply because the term "public domain"
means "no copyright/no license" to most civilians, but means "publicly
available" to DoD.

things because it would be absolutely sacrosanct.  ;)
Right.  Then there's the recent-ish revelation that SSL/TLS was doing
stupid things with sharing primes (maybe SSH was too), which was
almost certainly why all the NSA docs we've seen so far from Ed
Snowden kept referring to SSL as breakable and not so with GPG.
It works because it accepts the reality that one side will keep trying
to take power and hoard it, while the rest of us instinctively reject
it (no matter how much we may or may not agree with those attempting
to seize that power).
It starts becoming a problem, however, when I'm viewed as an evil
bastard because I don't show enough loyalty to the United States by
objecting to the NSA reading everything I write no matter what it is

packages to change the dependencies from gnupg2 to gnupg21.

@_date: 2016-06-11 00:30:03
@_author: Ben McGinnes 
@_subject: Installing gnupg 
I have a few gripes with them, including the default config that
results in things like:
1. Because GPG 2.0 and 2.1 conflict, GPGME and anything that
   subsequently depends on it cannot be installed without
   modification.
2. The incorrect names you mentioned.
3. While there are a couple of variations of config that can be
   chosen, the variation options do not include enabling support for
   increased secmem or larger RSA key sizes.
OTOH the packages are all sourced from the original projects, so the
source code is the tarball from gnupg.org.  Unlike, for instance,
Homebrew, which uses github as an ad-hoc package management repository
and while their GPG sources might not be modified in some dodgy way,
there is absolutely no way of knowing without comparing each file line
by line with the originals.
Since macports does let you modify the configuration parameters by
editing the portfile and compile from source, all those issues can be
fixed manually, but it's still a little irritating.  The obvious
"solution" is to skip it and compile GPG from source, but if macports
doesn't know about that it gets in the way of things like GMIME (which
then gets in the way of running Mutt and so on).
I think I might have to wander over to the bug tracker and raise a bug
on the names anyway.  As for the conflicts between 2.0 and 2.1, that
ought to get sorted out once 2.0 goes away, or at least gets EOL'd.

@_subject: Where is /usr/local/gnupg-2.1? 
There are two other possible explanations: MacPorts (see macports.org)
and Home Brew.  By default Mac Ports installs software to /opt/local
and users always have the option of compiling anything from source.
Ports tend to have a a specific set of generic compilation or
configuration options so more ofteh than not I'll use it to grab the
libraries and then do some serious customisation on the last two
packages (GPG and GPGME).
Home Brew, however, is an autocratic little pain in the butt, but
because it uses GitHub as an ad-hoc package manager it is very
popular.  The price os using home brew means that /usr/local is
off-limits for your own projects (a deal breaker for me), it won't run
if MacPorts is installed at all (another deal breaker), it doesn't
source its tarballs from their origin projects they're all separate
github repos with who knows what modifications or added.  Plus it

You know what might, though, if someone were to take up the old GPA
project perhaps ... maybe port it to GTK 3 or implement a Qt version.
Or make a free thing that does what that GPGShell GUI thing so many
Windows users seem fond of, but isn't even available under a BSD or
LGPL license, let alone GPL 2 or 3.  I've never used that one, but so
many of the PGPNET subscribers swear by the thing for ease of use as
well as effectiveness.
And those of us used to using shells have probably rolled our own by
this stage.  In my case gpg1 is a shell wrapper for GPG 1.4.x and an
alternate homedir so I really can keep using both keyring formats,
gpg2 is 2.1 with some kind of proper-ish trust model, gpg21 is the
same except it also reloads dirmngr to use tor and gpg runs the 2.1
binary with trust-model always.  Although all mine still use and
accept all the standard flags, they just load slightly different
configurations for the most part.
Also with the old Emacs binding of EasyPG (now under the EPA banner).
There's already a port of pyme to Python 3, it's pretty much ready to
go save for some final PEP8 checks which I'm working through the last
of currently (in between the occasional local unrelated catastrophe,
of course).  The 99% ready code is in one of my branches in the gpgme
repo on playfair.
Given most of them should be in the gpg.conf file anyway, they
normally only need to be set once.  Sometimes toggled back and forth
(e.g. with --expert), but mostly it's set once and leave it that way
(e.g. enable-large-rsa, enable-dsa2, allow-freeform-uid, etc.).

The thing about training in GPG is people have to want it.  In my
experience everyone in the general public decides that "it's all too
hard" right up until the moment where it is actually their freedom on

learn the basics within 1 to 2 hours and love it.  Funny that ...

You might try experimenting with gpgme-tool then, it's one of the
undocumented/self-documented extras which comes with GPGME.  It
provides a socket interface with which you can interact with portions
of the GPGME functions, including most of the most common functions.
You can also pipe its commands to it through a shell, so start with
something like this:
    echo help | gpgme-tool
Or this:

Which is something I want to get right from the outset with GPyGME,
even knowing that it's going to make the job much bigger in the
process.  With the PyME bindings, for instance, the documentation
consists of "read the GPGME documentation" and that documentation
basically consists of "this documentation is generated at compile time
from in-line code snippet comments."
Then people wonder why GPGME isn't used more often ... that right
there is precisely why it isn't used more often.
And that doesn't even get into the issues involved with selecting a
format for producing the documentation in.  Consider the following:
1. As a Python 3 project there is an expectation that source
   documentation SHOULD be in reStructuredText, as with all other
   Python documentation (including python.org docs).  This facilitates
   generating end user documentation in [X]HTML 4 at build/install
   time with Sphinx.
2. As a GNU Project official project there is an expectation that
   source documentation SHOULD be in Org-Mode text, as with all other
   core GNU Project projects.  This facilitates generating end user
   documentation in texi (for man and info pages) and (optionally)
   [X]HTML 4 at build/install time.
3. Most contributors not familiar with either standard Python practice
   or stnadard GNU Project practice will prefer to fallback to
   Markdown, particularly the GitHub variant.
4. Pandoc based conversions between reStructuredText, Org-Mode and
   Markdown are not always entirely consistent.  This is because all
   Pandoc conversions convert to the Pandoc specialisation of Markdown
   first and then convert to other formats.
5. Best practices for technical documentation, especially with
   multiple contributors favours mark *up*, such as an XML dialect as
   it is easier to guarantee consistent source and to produce
   consistent output.  Whereas managing multiple text-based source
   documents becomes more and more unwieldy with each additional
   contributor's chosen/preferred format and implementation.
6. Current best choice for technical documentation of anything with
   many components and/or subcomponents (which both GPGME and GPyGME
   definitely qualify as) is to use a topic based XML format.  The
   lead candidate for this being the DITA implementation of XML,
   particularly since it allows for project specific specialisation
   *without* breaking the DITA standard (unlike DocBook).  See also:
   Obviously there's a few contradictions there ... ain't it fun!  ;)
I favour DITA (usually with the DITA for Publishers specialisation),
but I also realise that most contributors will be coders first and not
writers first, so I may just have to accept that XML can't be used at
all.  In which case chances are I'll need to send everything through
Pandoc to produce both .rst and .org output and call both of them the
source files.  On the other hand, there's still time to try a few
things and make a final decision, though it will probably require both
.rst and .org files existing prior to build time just to conform with
existing systems like the GNU build toolset and the Python setuptools
and docutils libraries.
As for my preference for DITA and what it can do, I have been
experimenting with Don Day's rest2dita XSLT with good results on basic
transformations, which means it *might* (and that's a fairly big
might) be possible to produce fully searchable webhelp versions of
documentation with a reStructuredText source.  This is because
docutils has its own XML format which is able to be generated from
reST and perform the reverse to generate reST.  I have yet to see if
Don's project will go the other way and produce docutils XML from
Fortunately for me, no decision even needs to be made until the GPGME
overhaul is complete and GPyGME final design decisions can be set in
stone.  Until then I get to keep trying things, listening to different
suggestions and trying to chart the most effective and uncluttered
Sounds familiar, when checking or double-checking anything I usually
check that the command I'm thinking of exists with "--dump-options"
piped into a grep and then check the resulting command or commands in
the man (or info) page(s) to confirm the right syntax or instructions.
Still, I only reached this point following years of practice with PGP
2.x, PGP 5.x, PGP 6.x, GPG 1.2.x, GPG 1.4.x and now GPG 2.1.x (I did
play with both GPG 1.0.x and 2.0.x, but kinda leap-frogged both of
them for general use).

Primary keys MUST be C-usage and MAY be SCA usage, by default they're
SC, but simply creating an S-usage subkey moves the S function to the
subkey (by default GPG will select the newest subkey with a given
capability to perform that function).  Since default key generation
does not include authentication (A) keys for SSH, the result is
usually an SC master with an E subkey of matching bit sizes.
Some people like to fiddle (i.e. use expert mode), so you may see keys
with only C set for the primary key and subkeys for everything else.
I like to fiddle too, but selected a middle of the road option (SC for
primary, but an additional S subkey and an E subkey).

Right, possibly more about targets really since the purpose of
documentation is to help the end users use the software, not to help
developers tick a box on the feature list and say, "yeah, we've got
(extensive) documentation, sure."  [I do realise that saying that is
sacrilege in some circles.]
All excellent examples, especially that last one (which is often
overlooked by software projects until someone affected by it raises a
bug).  All of which, just in the asking, actually move things more in
the pro-DITA direction since there are existing DITA transformations
for XHTML 4 (strict & transitional), HTML 5, XHTML 5 (i.e. HTML 5 with
XML), EPUB 2.0, EPUB 3.0 (which covers the DAISY Consortium's primary
concerns with Accessibility), Docbook 4.2 & 5.0 (plus anything they
can be transformed into, including a proven track record with dead
tree versions), CHM output, ODF output, RTF output, Eclipse help
output, PDF output (usually via a FOP or [X]HTML+CSS rendering) and
with my setup there are three different types of WebHelp output
(standard, mobile and one with builtin feedback/comments system, but
the last needs to be built with SQL db support).
For examples of dead tree versions of things made with either DITA or
DocBook that actually sell, there's XML Press (not a huge surprise)
and also O'Reilly Media (which uses the same editor I do, see below).
For the EPUB files, results vary depending on which transformation and
source is used, but all the output is better than anything produced
with Pandoc, Calibre or Sphinx.  Sphinx can't produce a validating
EPUB 2, let alone EPUB 3; Calibre dumps everything in a single
directory regardless of what it is, but still manages to produce
validation errors (mainly in the XHTML) and can't produce EPUB 3;
Pandoc can produce both EPUB 2 & 3, but cheats outrageously (say
goodbye to all chapters, say hello to everything in a single XHTML
file and hope the end user device recognises the markup defining what
a chapter or section is).
Whereas the D4P EPUB transformation will retain your project's
directory structure inside the .epub zipfile and will produce a fully
validating EPUB 3.0.1 file in almost all circumstances.  The
exceptions are if a smaller cover image is included to display in
Apple iBooks, it will appear twice in the manifest and is easily fixed
with a manual edit.  The other issue is it currently uses XSLT 1.0,
which can't convert the build system's time to UTC and this may cause
issues depending on timezone, also easily fixed with a manual update
or possibly scripted or running the build on a system set to UTC.
For examples (other than me) of groups or orgs using the D4P EPUB
transformation, the biggest one I can think of is HarperCollins.  They
did, after all, pay to have it done and didn't mind having it licensed
the same way as the rest of the D4P project (Apache 2.0) and as freely
available as both that project and the DITA Open Toolkit (they're both
on GitHub).
Yet ever so rarely are able to provide suggestions which meet all the
No doubt there would also be objections to learning an entirely new
XML syntax, but then much of the most common mark-up is very similar
to HTML (e.g. b for bold, i for italics, u for underline, p for each
paragraph), linking is a little different, but not hugely (i.e. GNU
Privacy Guard, links within the same project don't need the
scope and format bits) and images also differ slightly ( instead of ).
On the other hand, once the realisation hits home about how much
content re-use is supported and being able to make document-wide
changes with a little careful design (including conditional output
generation based on things like, say, software versions or supported
feature sets), some of that grumpiness might dissipate.  Maybe.  Well,
OK, probably not.
In some respects it becomes even harder with an official GNU Project
like GPG and its sub-projects as there's that additional requirement
(usually) that all components must be licensed under the GPL or LGPL
(of whichever versions are relevant).  DITA itself is an open enough
standard to qualify, it's an OASIS standard, but the defining
implementation (see dita-ot.org) and most public specialisations, like
DITA for Publishers (see dita4publishers.org), are deliberately
licensed more permissively (both use Apache 2.0).
My setup is even "worse" since it mixes some more proprietary stuff in
the implementation (but that's primarily the editor and some
components which usually have Free/Libre or Open alternatives, albeit
with greater potential for frustration).  As the DITA-OT relies on
something I loathe (Java) and I was quite prepared to shell out a
modest sum to get what I wanted (generating valid EPUB 3 files and
editing them without breaking them, since Sigil can't), I ended up
getting oXygenXML Editor (their idea of support is in my experience
unparallelled: it extended to full support to a freebie trial version
and included adding a feature within 24 hours of asking about it
during said trial; first as a plugin and later as a built-in).  Oh,
yes, I can load any file I have open in oXygenXML in Emacs from within
it and doing so automatically loads nxml-mode, it's even bound to the
same key sequence as It's All Text! in Firefox.
Still, without a GNU implementation of DITA, it's still possible to
produce everything with the DITA-OT I've mentioned so far, except the
fully searchable WebHelp output (the XSLTs are part of oXygenXML
Editor) and possibly not the rest2dita thing (depending on which
version of Saxon is which, I keep getting them mixed up, but I've got
it working with Saxon-HE 9.6.0.7).  I know some people might argue
against the DITA-OT itself with the Apache 2.0 license, but then turn
a blind eye to Markdown (BSD license) and since both are GPL
compatible I'm likely to ignore that argument.  I will, however, pay
more attention to arguments in favour of accessibility issues
(e.g. generating screen reader friendly material) and translation of
material (that's actual translations, not merely piping said material
through translate.google.com).
P.S.  The schemas I mentioned a few days ago are now in the ben/xml
      branch of GPGME on the git server.  Licensing is the same as
      GPGME plus Apache 2.0 because it can't hurt.

Nor is it likely to be at the moment, PyPi is ... one of the least
impressive aspects of Python, unfortunately.
The Python bindings are updated with each GPGME release and compiling
GPGME should result in the current bindings being built and installed
in the versions of Python 2 and 3 found on the system.
IIRC the bindings with GPGME 1.8.0 used the module name of gpgme, that
has since been changed to gpg. and current behaviour is very pythonic.
For example, here's about the simplest clear signing method (using the
default key of the user running the code):
    import gpg
    from gpg.constants.sig import mode
    with gpg.Context() as c:
        signed = c.sign(b"Test message", mode=mode.CLEAR)
    afile = open("filename.txt.asc", "wb")
    afile.write(signed)
    afile.close()
Encryption and decryption don't require much more than that either.
Yes, you can encrypt data as a class and then import that upon
decryption if your intent is to securely store authentication tokens
as part of something else.  In fact, that's what prompted what led to
these bindings being updated to Python 3 in the first place.

It's possible, but it's highly unlikely that anyone would bother
creating what is essentially Gravatar for GPG.
Especially since the protocol already supports key owners including a
pictrure with their key.  Most people don't do that either.
You shouldn't need to memorise it.  In Enigmail you can create rules
for addresses to link to preferred keys, as well as set whether or not
to encrypt all messages or just sign and so on.  Most MUAs which
support GPG provide some method of doing this and GPG itself supports
that function with group lists in the gpg.conf file.
If the version of GPG you have installed supports it, you should
probably add this to your gpg.conf:
    trust-model tofu+pgp
    tofu-default-policy unknown
That will gradually build a more practical web-of-trust which keeps
track of seen keys for you.
Yes, this has been possible for a long time now.  Most people use a
64-bit view for that reason.  This is now the default view in GPG 2.1,
along with displaying the full finterprint.  If you do not have GPG
2.1.x installed, such as if you're using GPGTools on OS X or GPG4Win,
then add "keyid-format 0xLONG" to your gpg.conf file.

That's pretty much exactly what it does.
TOFU stands for Trust On First Use, so even if a key is not explicitly
trusted or signed, GPG will maintain a record of the number of times a
signed message has been seen from it, associated user IDs and email
addresses and so on.  It will also report discrepancies.  It's pretty
much how most people had been unofficially handling things anyway in
order to favour encryption even with unknown parties.
It is, of course, another reason why people tend not to look back

noticed XML output with gpgme-tool:
echo "KEYLIST 0x3ADBFA6D00A1E6FE /bye" | gpgme-tool > 0x3ADBFA6D00A1E6FE.xml
The output will need to be trimmed of the GPGME header at the top, the
"OK" disconnection at the bottom, the "D " at the beginning of each
line and the "%0A" at the end of each line.  I'm sure you can script
it to trim all that for you before writing the file anyway.  Although
I've attached that example here.

What are the customers running?  More SunOSand/or Solaris or something
How big are the files and what kind of files (as in file type rather
than business use case)?
It's actually SPARC?  Not UltraSPARC?  That hostname is hinting
towards a T1.  Is it really or is it something else?
Also, which filesystem(s) are you running?  ZFS or something ancient?
Are you trying to do this across NFS?  Are there also either a SAN or
NAS involved, if so, which (and did it come tith the Sun kit or was it
hooked in separately.
Well, may as well try the easy bit first ... run this as root:
    iostat -En
Check the drives for collisions, if two of them are reporting massive
numbers of collisions then one is dead and the other is on the same
bus and is getting overloaded by the redirected traffic (which will
slow the rest of the array down).
That's the usual problem, but if it's not then we'll see.  Still
Solaris 10 has lots of nifty diagnostics tools to narrow things down
beyond that.
Plenty, but I need to know what the system specs are before I can
determine what's actually feasible with that model.
The Solaris patch version indicates it's several years old as it is
and I'm guessing they're out of the warranty period.  Or maybe not, it
could just be that now that Oracle have fired all the old Sun
engineers there's no one there who can help ... and the fact that the
E25Ks and the M9000s are truly doomed is such a damned waste, but I
Don't be too disheartened if the model was produced prior to Oracle's
acquisition of Sun either, most of those systems were still well ahead
of any of what we called "x-boxes" (i.e. the X-series or anything with
an x86-64 architecture; IIRC they were all AMDs).  Besides, if it's
pre-2009, then I'll have at least a decent portion of the old SunSolve
handbook for the model in archive.  Yes, that is the massive trove of
Sun documentation that Oracle took offline in the first 3 months or
so; and no, it's not the whole thing (which was *huge*), just the
portable version).

That seems a bit long.
Yeah, fair enough.  Since the make check was clean you can just try
running make install again (presumably you are doing that part as
root) and seeing if it completes.  If it does, great; if it doesn't
and just seems to hang then either post any reported errors here or
try moving on to the next library.  Eventually there will be a package
that has it as a dependency and if this install didn't actually work
you'll find out during the configure stage of the one to have it as a
There's a reasonable chance it has actually installed, but done
something silly in reporting that fact during the installation.
Proceeding won't really hurt because the worst case scenario is just
going back to this point in the installation process and doing it
again.  It doesn't matter if binaries and libs are copied over during
a subsequent installation attempt since that's precisely how upgrades
occur anyway.

True, but what it does have available still covers a *lot* of what
people do mainly want to access programmatically.  My trusty key
counter is now done that way (it takes a while to run, but that's due
to the size of the keybox, not due to GPGME).
There is a cunning plan which may provide a bridge to at least in part
address that.
That would be brilliant, but it requires convincing developers to not
simply document their work, but to actually step back from their
focussed POV and abstract what they're intending to do so we can
determine what will actually be useful to procide all developers.
Otherwise we'll just end up with a bunch of feature requests specific
to the problem each developer happens to be working on at the time
they notify us.
If you can work out a way to get engineers to understand why that's
important ... you'll become very rich shortly thereafter.  ;)
Most of the worst of those examples are in bash, how're you going to
tell the difference between that and a user?
And people accuse me of being combative!  Wow ... you're brave ...
Moreseriously, though, let's besure we've got an alternative method to
replace whatever their pet project's method is first.
Arguably gpgme-tool might already do that, but we'll see.
I'm already laying the groundwork on the API side of things, as well
as working on doumentation.
Indeed.  I didn't check your buglist ... but I did recall that one of
the dependencies of GMIME is GPGME.  Pretty sure that'll affect a few
packages and libgcrypt & libgpg-error are a dependencies for lots things.
It's exactly this sort of thing which led to the popularity of
installing things the users wanted in /usr/local or /opt or wherever
specifically to prevent the end user use case adversely affecting the
system's use case.

@_subject: How can we utilize latest GPG from RPM repository? 
Ah, now *this* is a pertinent fact that would've helped at the
beginning of the thread and the fact that it wasn't is a clear
demonstration of a tangential point I made further along about getting
people to step back from their drilled in focus so we can identify the
actual needs.
Because these two lines explain *precisely* why you need something like
RHEL or CentOS (certified systems to go with the auditing) *and*
updated crypto.
That's funny ... I'll leave it alone since there have been gaps in my
posting recently.  In future, though, maybe double-check LinkedIn
before making assumptions about everyone here, or anyone.
Some of us have dealt with things a good deal more rigorously
scrutinised than mere PCI-DSS.
Not for RPM, not without compiling it yourself, but you said you
didn't want to do that.
As far as I'm aware there's nothing like FreeBSD's port system or pkg
system (or like MacPorts) in addition to rpm with any of the current
distros by default.  They all pick their preferred package manager and
that's their salient feature (along with the current "systemd vs
lol-no-never-in-hell" debate) and point of differentiation.
Although another part of this thread gave Werner an idea for an
addition to 2.2.5 to improve the static-vs-shared libs issue with
GnuPG and the rest of the system.  That might in future improve the
ability for package managers to have independent system libs and user
accessable libs and more recent versions to meet both user and system
requirements more readily.
Precompiled binaries are always going to be architecture dependent or
packed full of extra code to support a broader architecture.  Plus for
auditing purposes you are actually better off using a compiled version
using certified compilers and glibc (which RHEL brings to the
situation).  There's a lot of focus here on Debian and those
distributions it spawned, due to overlapping involvement for some team
members, but even with that hasn't resulted in "official Debian
packages" or whatever.
There are binaries for some system types for which prior releases were
sporadic (early OS X builds, non GPG4Win win32 executables, that sort
of thing), but nothing like you described and specific to a
distribution which is known to remain on much older versions of
everything and backport security fixes to those versions.
In which case, perhaps it is better to simply bite the bullet and
manage a local repo where everything therein meets those requirements.
If it does, I can think of one way to make it pay for itself and it
runs along the lines of subscriber only access to a repo explicitly
intended for PCI-DSS compliance, though it may require more frequent
audits of that part.

Also nice to see it's py3 and so I've already forked it.  At some

first and import all the keys that way, then revert back to your code
once the db is built from that.  At the very least it'll make for a
nice demonstration to compare the CLI with colons vs API methods of
doing the same thing (key counting doesn't really achieve that too
well since it's about three lines of code).

In all likelihood, yes ... however open-scap.org is a RedHat service

compliance along with direct support via their service contract.
If, however, this particular case actually deals with CentOS systems
and not RHEL, then the OP has elected to forego that type of
professional service contract from the vendor in order to do it
Which brings us either back to this thread, or a business decision at
their end regarding whether or not bring their systems back to RHEL
(it requires changing two files, IIRC, assuming they haven't massively
modified things) and paying RedHat whatever it takes to get the job
done.  I cannot predict which they will choose, nor am I willing to
make a recommendation solely on what's been presented here.
Still, the OP wanted options and now they've been provided.  :)

That just spreads the potential points of human failure and you run
the risk that anyone with access to this guard key would be able to
abuse the position to access an employee's credentials (saying they
don't have access to the private key doesn't hold any weight on a
company intranet where they've probably already got root/admin
access).  So it'd be too easy for some unscrupulous sys admin (you
might trust you, but what happens when you leave, do you know your
successor?) has a personal issue with someone in, say, marketing and
stitches them up with a few choice forged and signed emails.
No, that's a *bad* plan and creates all sorts of horrible legal
problems for the company or at least has the very real potential to do
It seems to me, though, that the idea was to provide a means for the
company to repudiate an employee's key even if the employee was no
longer available.  Perhaps they were fired or just became very ill or
any of a host of reasons with varying degrees of potential drama
attached.  This is a legitimate issue in the corporate environment,
but the solution to it is not to maintain an escrow on private keys
and passphrases which could subsequently be abused by a technically
proficient person within the company.
What you should do instead is keep an encrypted and archived copy of
the revocation certificate for each employee's key.  That way it is
still possible to declare that the key and/or employee is no longer
sanctioned, but without providing a means where anyone with access to
this system could either intercept encrypted communications sent to
that key or forge messages appearing to come from it.
Any other option is going to end up in a legal dispute eventually and
will probably cost *far* more than what you think you're saving
yourself from now.

@_subject: [gpgme] generate a wheel of the python bindings 
With GPGME as a dependency ... Claws or Mutt/Neomutt?
This is pretty much always going to run into trouble with these
bindings due to the nature of what they are.  Unlike other wrappers
(e.g. python-gnupg) they're a bit more than simply wrapping the
command line executables with subprocess invocations.
The GPGME Python bindings are built against the version of GPGME it's
released with; functions are linked to their C counterparts with SWIG
via the gpgme.h header file for that version.  In order to have
functional bindings in the python module, you must also have a
functional copy of GPGME built at the same time, for the same platform
(architecture and OS).
Which means providing a separate, precompiled python binary like a
wheel will almost always introduce unexpected errors and failures.
Interesting.  I can definitely answer one part of it, though:
The reason you ended up with an "empty" module was because you were
just trying to build the module as a stand alone Python module.
Without the rest of the GPGME C API to which it's bound, it is
effectively useless.  With the two together, however, it provides a
pythonic interface to the entire GnuPG suite of software and
When GPGME is compiled it produces the gpgme.h file most relevant to
that host (from src/gpgme.h.in) and once that's done the building and
installation of the various bindings in lang/ are performed against
that gpgme.h file.
No chance.  It'd introduce too many points of failure and an
expectation that these bindings will behave the same way as PyNaCl or
Also, your repo there looks like an old release, somewhere in the beta
period before 1.10.0 was released.  There have definitely been
significant updates to both GPGME and the python bindings since then.
Yeah, I saw that, but it seems I missed you by a couple of hours or
I'm not really familiar with NixOS, but from what I've read it's
another Linux distribution with its own take on package management.
If that system can handle both binary packages and compiling packages
from source, like many other package managers, then it should be
If it only has the facility to provide binary packages then you will
need to build those binaries for every single architecture and OS type
Nix supports in order to do so.  Either that or go bloat happy and try
to support as many as possible.  This is very much *not* recommended,
however, because it is quite possible that incorporating something for
one set of architecture and system version could very easily cause
problems with others.
There are certainly other package managers which are already quite
capable of correctly building GPGME and the Python bindings.  I build
it regularly on OS X with a slightly mixed approach.  I use MacPorts
to grab all the library dependencies and build from source (actually
most of my ports are built from source, but not quite all); the gnupg2
(i.e. GPG 2.2.x) has a slightly modified configuration (compared to
the standard portfile) and then built from source.
Then I build GPGME manually while referencing the dependencies in
installation of Python 3 instead of the MacPorts one).  After running
autogen.sh I use this configure command:
    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --exec-prefix=/usr/local \
    --with-libgpg-error-prefix=/opt/local \
    --with-libassuan-prefix=/opt/local --enable-maintainer-mode
Followed by the usual make, make check, sudo make install (though you
can use gmake instead if there's a difference on your system).
I also adjust the portfile for Neomutt to use my manually built GPGME
in /usr/local instead of the one kicking around in /opt/local (which
is just there to tick the dependency boxes for other packages).

Firstly, kudos for going straight to GPGME instead of wrapping the GPG
binary.  ?
Does the website encrypt the file uploaded by (eventually) some end
user or do they encrypt the file first and then upload that which your
code subsequently decrypts?
Hmm, that's interestingly odd.
Maybe ?
Yeah, this is strange, but we'll need more info to work out what's
going on.  Are you able to share the code for what's happening here
and, if the website also encrypts the uploaded data, that bit too?
No, that's not normal and I'm wondering how it happened, but there are
some functions which might do it and it may also depend on which
version(s) of GPG and GPGME you're using.  Which are they, by the way?
If it's not using the current release of GPGME; the first bit of
advice will be to try the current version checked out from the git
repo and see if it continues to do the same thing.  GPGME has received
a certain amount of love and attention over the last couple of years
more than it may have in the past and though there have been one or
two hiccups, it's still vastly improved for that (ongoing) effort.
Which at least means that it's a good time to start with it because
enough people are looking at its innards that answers shouldn't be too
far off.  ?

Very nice article and it will be a useful one to forward to a number
of people.
I also liked ProtonMail's more technical one which addressed the
specifics of their own setup and demonstrated that the allegations
levelled their way were not well founded.  On the other hand, they use
OpenPGP.js very differently to most, if not all, of the other projects
which have since adopted it and are acutely aware of the inherent
weaknesses within JavaScript itself, so they don't drive their entire
systems with it.
I agree with most of the article and largely with the need to break
compatibility to an ancient flawed design.  Particularly since we
still have a means of accessing those ancient formats if we have to in
the form of the GPG 1.4 branch.  The ancient archives are as safe as
they've ever been (for whatever definition of "safe" is being implied
by the user/archivist).
There is, however, one aspect of this issue that you touched on
lightly, but didn't really delve into and which is at the centre of
my, mostly unvoiced (until this email), criticism of the Efail team.
That being the *incredibly* unhelpful and likely actively harmful
recommendation to remove encryption and decryption functionality from
vulnerable MUAs.
To say, ?we have this edge case scenario that really needs an active
targeted attack on a case by case basis, so everyone should just stop
integrating encryption? is the kind of thing that can get people
Indeed, this particular release may still succeed in producing a body
count.  I am not yet aware of any confirmed fatalities stemming from
people panicking and stopping using crypto because they listened to
Efail and/or the EFF, but there is one particular community I'm
watching for just that issue right now.
By comparison to that I don't really care so much that Efail dropped
the ball with disclosure to GnuPG or any of the other projects.  It's
a bit annoying, but we can all cope.  I *do*, however, care that their
recommendations may have lasting and potential final consequences for
OpenPGP users living with and attempting to mitigate real threats to
their lives and/or liberty.
Playing with that sort of thing with the recklessness with which the
Efail team have done is, in my not so humble opinion, an absolute
You pointed out that the vast majority of OpenPGP use is no longer
email or other communications encryption.  This is both true and a
valid point of discussion.  Nevertheless, there are still a
considerable number of people who do use it that way and a number of
them have to deal with threat assessments with considerably higher
levels of personal risk than security researchers in academia or
cryptographic developers.
We must not forget these people.  Ever.  Even if we never hear from
them.  Their cases are also not a matter of being apathetic; it's that
their priorities are surviving the world they're in, so they need to
rely on the tools we provide (and I get the community apathy issue is
actually a more general thing, so this isn' having a go at that part).
The Efail researchers did forget them and their conduct demonstrates
this.  While they may have made some useful technical contributions
regarding S/MIME and highlighting certain poor implementations in
MUAs, that's no justification for reckless disregard of the lives of
end users.
So in my opinion it's not the merits or lack thereof in the
demonstrated attacks they released that have the gravest consequence
here, it's that the number one recommended mitigation technique is to
remove cryptographic functions from MUAs.  Even though they still said
to basically perform those functions manually and independently, which
does imply not opposing using cryptography itself.  It's still a
recommendation which is sure to create far more dangerous outcomes for
end users.
It's a bit like that scene in Erik the Viking where a woman is being
raped and Erik kills the rapist, but his sword goes right through the
rapist and kills the woman too.  He did stop the rape, but that
doesn't make his action a successful one.
I think it's fair to say that most, if not all, of those of us working
with this tech are reasonably intelligent.  So surely we can operate
at a level with a bit more forethought than a viking, fictional or

I could have given them that benefit of the doubt on the initial
article too, but the FAQ they now have on the Surveillance
Self-Defense website does rather eviscerate any hope of that:
?What if I keep getting PGP emails?
You can decrypt these emails via the command line. If you prefer not
to, notify your contacts that PGP is, for the time being, no longer
safe to use in email clients and decide whether the conversation can
continue over another end-to-end encrypted platform, such as Signal.?

That is a good point and a fairly common situation; possibly the
second most common form of engineering blindness (the first one being
having a favourite tool and applying it to every problem regardless of
relevance ? when armed with one's favourite hammer, everything looks
like a nail).
Indeed ?
Had their publications been limited to the articles on the 13th and
14th, I could buy that.  Unfortunately the updates to the SSD website
on the 15th really strain things, especially the FAQ.  Not only is it
potentially panic-inducing, but they recommend an approach of having
end users campaign against using OpenPGP at all with all of their
contacts with no regard for what additional circumstances those
contacts have.
They've literally created a FUD-virus as a meme which will
self-replicate throughout the web-of-trust.  I'm sure we'll be
encountering people advising others not to use OpenPGP long after the
last of those affected MUAs are patched and *that* is stretching the
edges of the term reckless (as it is usually used in legislation,
e.g. reckless endangerment of life as opposed to, say, wilful
endangerment of life).
I also don't believe they can actually fix this now that they've
created it without a complete reversal of their current position;
which they can't do because of the MUAs which are affected and some
users could be targeted.  By the time the conditions are such that
they can consistently give the ?all clear? on the matter, the
FUD-virus will have spread too far and be too independent of them to
stop (but will still gain credibility and traction by trading off
their name and reputation).
Sure; doing nothing and ignoring the affected MUAs does no one any
good, but this response is likely to do more harm than the thing it's
intended to stop and it didn't have to be that way.
Not to mention the little matter that their sole recommendation of a
viable alternative in all circumstances is a service which is entirely
dependent on a centralised server (or network of servers).  One which
explicitly cannot be implemented in a federated manner and all
attempts to fork it in order to do precisely that have been abandoned
as a result of Moxie's opposition to them trying to connect to his
network to communicate with Signal users.
It's simply not a complete replacement in spite of EFF's wish that it
is.  It's a great addition to a suite of of services and tools, but
relying on it as a replacement for OpenPGP is misguided (not to
mention impossible for some people and/or networks and/or pseudonymity
I won't going beyond the current statement describing it as reckless

damage control in their own review.
Appreciated, but in this particular case it would probably be a crime
for you to do so, at least directly to said group, whereas it's
perfectly legal over here.  It might depend a little on the
interpretation of the First Amendment over there, though, and it is
still possible that those laws are unconstitutional, but it's too
early to know for sure yet and it doesn't look like there are too many
organisations over there wanting to challenge it (yet).

Mine too, it's why I keep a copy of 1.4 installed at all.  It's been a
while since I've needed to access something encrypted to the first key I
ever made way back in 1995, but I know there are archives which might
require it and possibly even some which have not already been migrated
to a newer key and encryption method.
That's okay, though and it doesn't need current dev practices to
retain those functions since there is a means of still opening that
door, even if I'm no longer using DOS and thus PGP 2.3a for DOS is no
longer available.  No doubt the worst issue would be sanitizing such
an old file of carriage returns or something like that.
Depending on what it was, though there may even be WordPerfect 5.1
files buried in those archives and IIRC LibreOffice dropped support
for those files a while back.  I suspect that sort of issue is more
likely to be a cause of angst for people needing to access old data
than whether they need to run GPG 1.4.x manually to decrypt it first.
It gets mentioned here periodically, usually in conjunction with
discussions of differing threat models.
The EFF even have a great big section on their SSD site about
conducting your own risk or threat assessment and that these things
will be different for people in different circumstances.  Then they
decided to ignore their own advice in its entirety.
Hmm, maybe, but I'm not entirely certain that's instigated by Signal
or Whisper Systems.  No doubt they're enjoying it, but I think there's
another reason for that.
It's completely incapable of replacing either email or OpenPGP.  Here
are two things I do regularly or constantly which Signal is
fundamentally incapable of:
 1. Running my own server which enables me to set certain types of
 controls or filters on my own server and not shared with any third
 party (including Moxie).
 2. Encrypt files which are not intended to be sent to anyone and
 never were intended to be so.  The same is true of certain files
 which are digitally signed and archived in a way which lets me prove
 when they were written later (it's a copyright thing and set to
 specifically circumvent a particular niche of morons that are
 unrelated to the issue at hand).  Mostly, however, I mean things like
 keeping a journal and making damn sure that it won't be used against
 me.
Signal can't do any of that.  At all.  It also can't provide a genuine
means of establishing a pseudonymous identity unless you live in a
country that lets you buy lots of cheap "burner" phones and/or SIMs.
Maybe that is easy in the USA, maybe even elsewhere too.  It's pretty
much impossible in Australia.
So if there were something I needed to raise somewhere pseudonymously,
say via Tor and some web forum, what does the EFF suggest I use?
Signal?  How?
I'm guessing that none of these commentators have ever actually
personally faced a threat which threatened their lives, especially as
part of some kind of minority, where the threat is both targeted and
impersonal simultaneously.  There are still millions of people in the
world facing torture or even death just because of something they were
born with (even something which may not be apparent until they reach a
certain point after birth).
In fact one minority I'm aware of is still so greatly at risk that
there's only one country in the world which provides legislative
protection for them.  All the others permit and, in some cases even
encourage or promote, some rather nasty practices (and I've seen some
of the evidence presented to the UN's human rights reviews, including
photographic).  This group is *not* the same community I referred to
in my previous message (the one you replied to, not the second one to
Rob) There is almost certainly some overlap, though, since there will
be members of this minority in that other community just based on
statistical prevalence.
I don't think it's necessarily for Signal, but Signal was created by
someone who shares that view and, more often than not, for much the
same type of reason.
I think the majority of those people who adhere to that view are geeks
of a certain age, approx. 40s to 50s, who came to the crypto world
back during the first Crypto Wars.  As much as they loved the idea of
PGP, one of two things happened: either they couldn't understand it
will enough to get it to work properly or, the more common story, they
couldn't get others to use it due to the difficulties in doing so at
that time.
In their minds OpenPGP usage is "difficult to use" or "not worth the
effort" because in their minds it is still their recollection of the
experience back then.  They've given up on it and they've dug their
heels in so much they now react almost aggressively against anyone
still seeking to use the thing.
It's porojection and it says more about them than anything.  How can I
be sure, well obviously my reference to my first key indicates I was
getting my intro to things around the middle of that era.  The two
biggest problems back then by my recollection was the lack of
accessible documentation explaining the concepts without requiring a
mathematics degree and practical setup guides.
Over time the latter became more prevalent and eventually some good
examples of the former arrived.  Those coupled with the *vast*
improvements to software over the intervening years means that the
difficulties of the '90s are not as great as they were.  There is
still some effort required and people do need to think about what sort
of security they need, but that just leads into the other aspect of
this: it was never about the degree of difficulty, it was about the
motivation to use the thing.
If someone feels a genuine threat to themselves or their loved ones
and OpenPGP usage is the key to ensuring that threat is kept at bay,
you just watch how fast and dedicated they become.  I've seen some
rather surprising examples of precisely that over the years too and
it's really at the core of that old argument.
We can advocate about something we find fascinating until we're blue
in the face, but for someone else to use it, they have to be motivated
enough to want to.  Signal is so simple that it's almost impossible to
fuck it up (except when it resends an unencrypted SMS to someone not
on the network hundreds of times without the sender knowing that's
what happened and wondering why their friend or whoever is pissed off
at the walls of repetitive messages), but it achieves this by moving
all the options and decisions to the developers and the servers.
Anyway, I think the pro-Signal commentariat is pro-Signal not because
of some concerted effort to build Whisper Systems into the One True
Centre of Cryptography (complete with secret handshake and, maybe, a
"No Homers" policy), but because their personal experience of
difficulty 20+ years ago convinced them that the solution was that
everything must be so simple as to be unnoticable.  Then Moxie came
along, someone whose story includes a free admission that he feels the
same way and he wrote this thing that's simple to use.  This seems
like validation of their belief and so they latch onto it with a near
religious fervour.
None of this is really that new in IT-land, but in this particular
field it has the potential to have very bad consequences for people
who are more worried about things that could get them killed or
tortured or beaten or whatever than something that may have just been
a bit frustrating or even embarassing.
Those commentators still need to learn that it's not about them, nor
is it about us; it's about the people who need it, when they need it
to not get beaten, raped and/or tortured to death ... or whatever
other nastiness they're trying to avoid.
Besides, I'm pretty sure I can out-do the lot of them for embarrassing
fuck-ups with PGP during the '90s.  I once sent an encrypted email to
Phil Zimmermann which was supposed to just be a "thanks for the nifty
software, this so cool" message and I got a reply asking why I'd sent
an encrypted empty message.  Yeah, really, and of course I was
I did, however, stick with it and (eventually) learned.  A long time
later I was able to contribute in more useful ways particularly from
about three years ago onward (and this year is definitely adding to
that opportunity).  I even still cringed at the thought of sending
Phil Zimmermann that empty message for quite a while.  Now I barely
think about it at all and, when I do, it's just a little amusing.  I
doubt Phil would even remember it at all.
So what made me stop cringing at the thought of it?  I couldn't give
you a precise moment or thing, but it was either learning far more
about the topic and being able to pass some of that along or it was
experiencing some things that were far worse than mere embarassment.
Maybe a little of both.
The commentariat to which you referred, however, apparently still
haven't learned to move beyond their own embarassment or their own
problems.  Which would be fine if it only affected themselves, but
they're making sure it doesn't and preaching it to others; including
some with concerns a bit more significant than whether they do
something stupid.  They seem to be more interested in the security of
their ego and pride, perhaps reputation, over the actual consequences
which others may pay if they follow the wrong advice for their
So again the real issue is not that they're pro-Signal, that's really
more symptomatic.  The real problem is that for whatever reason,
though I strongly suspect the majority will be as I described above,
they've developed a hatred for one particular piece of technology, in
this case OpenPGP.  Now they push any other option, currently Signal
in many cases (no doubt WhatsApp would've been a contender, but lost
points when bought by FarceBook) in all cases because they're more
interested in hating the thing they hate than in providing relevant
advice or recommendations that are geared towards helping people
analyse their own threat model and implement the best tools to meet
that threat.
There's a really easy way to prove this too.  I dare any of the Signal
addresses all crypto needs" people to go to Mexico and provide info to
that country or conduct citizen journalism and investigative reporting
specifically on the cartels and corruption.  Using Signal and a
Mexican phone number.
I mean if Signal is the answer, that should be enough to prevent
discovery and execution, right?
As for my advice on the Mexican scenario: do not do that unless you
want to be executed!
Last I checked Mexico had a nationalised telecommunications carrier,
so the cartels only need to bribe or threaten one engineer and that's
that.  So once a relevant Signal contact is established, well, that's
enough information to take to the national carrier with an Uzi and a
demand for cooperation.  You really think the telco tech or customer
service rep is going to take a bullet for a customer and would anyone
expect them to?  Of course not and they shouldn't have to either.
Whereas being able to maintain a pseudonymous identity online with the
ability to verify that pseudonymous person is the same individual, but
without revealing their real location can be done with other tools and
for the Mexican scenario could even be done with their own domain (but
with a light weight enough implementation to remain on the move).  No
doubt many people on this list will have already thought of a few
options to handle various aspects of that kind of problem, with a few
different configurations depending on specifics lacking in this
No need to really delve into them, the point is that there are a few
ways to do it with differing degrees of using different technologies
depending on more detailed specifics of what needs to be done.  So the
solutions vary according to the needs of the person who will use it,
not simply pushing Signal as some kind of mythical cryptographic Soma
on everyone for every purpose.
The best security advice is, and always has been, the advice which
meets the needs of the person requesting it after having analysed that
person's situation and that of the community or communities they're
in.  It will never be a one-size-fits-all magic pill or glib answer,
not even Signal.  Not even OpenPGP either; as it doesn't actually
provide a transport method, just the structures for use with one and
thus does not provide a means of guaranteeing anonymity or
pseudonymity entirely on its own.  In conjunction with other things it
can be made to do so, of course, but that's the point.
All right, there you go, if there is one part of the problems here
which actually originates with Signal then there it is: conflating the
protection method with the transport protocol.  Signal as a solution
can only ever be used with Signal the network, it can't be adapted to
alternative transport protocols too readily, whereas OpenPGP can be
and has been to varying extents.
That, however, was a deliberate design choice made by Moxie as part of
his approach of dumbing everything down to try it make it impossible
for it to be too hard to use by most people and so Whisper Systems
view that as a feature.  Arguably it is indeed a feature, but it's the
feature which should have been recognised by its supporters as being
potentially dangerous for some types of threats and not the reason to
pronounce it the solution to everything.
So I think it's still fair to say the greatest problem is with the
commentators and the real reasons motivating the nature of their
commentary rather than what Signal is; and what it is is just fine if
you're in a relatively privileged class in the western world who
doesn't need to deal with anything requiring anonymity or
pseudonymity.  For everyone else, however, it may have some uses under
some circumstances, but the degree to which it will do so will vary
considerably and in quite a number of cases will either be very
limited or will be a direct threat (or contribute to direct threats).
As for the problem of the motivations of the commentators, regardless
of whether or not my theory regarding experiences during the Crypto
Wars is accurate or not, the real issue there is that they're letting
their personal gripes override the specific situations others have to
face and they don't seem to care if someone else dies as long as they
get to push their agenda.
I'm going to have to assume by this point two things:
 1. that if they're that far into their own little world there's
    nothing that will convince them that maybe that's not so cool; and
 2. that no one else here will be overly surprised if I (and perhaps
    others) disregard any degree of ethics or credibility of anyone
    who is so committed to a particular absolutist stance that they'll
    risk the lives of others (but never their own) on the
    righteousness of their cause.
No doubt they won't care about either of those things either; or, more
likely, they'll simply disregard everything postedto this list.  This
is something I will gladly accept if they will at the very least start
giving a damn about the concerns of others facing much more heinous
threats than the rest of us and needing real support from those of us
involved in any aspect of the information security world, not just
glib and unthinking answers which do more for a personal agenda than
the person under threat.
P.S.  I considered not sending this due to length and, possibly,
      responses to my disparagement of those who may value their own
      personal agenda over the needs of the end users seeking
      guidance.  A subsequent conversation with someone linked to the
      originally referenced community had indeed disregarded OpenPGP
      due solely to the advice of old geeks saying it's too hard,
      don't even consider it (before the current thing).  So the
      attitude of the commentariat is definitely a problem simply
      because they persist in pushing their old experience on a new
      audience as gospel instead of leaving the selection to a proper
      risk assessment and the needs of those people.

Which is fine as long as no one you correspond with uses an elliptic
curve key when corresponding with you.  1.4 has no support for any of
the curves and they're not being backported to it.  In fact the last
time I tried doing anything at all with a key containing a curve even
just what was supposed to be optional subkeys, 1.4 had significant
problems doing anything with those keys.
That sort of thing is part of the reason for maintaining a separate

Though I believe 1.4 may have been slightly modified and/or using
whatever was last added to its branch rather than actually be 1.4.22's
stable release.
Anyway, even though my current key doesn't yet include any of the
curves, I do still need more than a few components of the current
branches.  There are people I correspond with who use keys with
curves, I also definitely need GPGME and the its Python bindings (not
having them would make my work very tricky indeed).  Plus the boss is
a huge proponent of the modern branch and arguably its greatest
advocate.  ?

Depends on the size of the organisation really, but yes there would be
complaints if the code retained explicitly for accessing pre PGP 5
keys and data as well as running on certain types of headless systems
(e.g. routers) were to be terminated in a short period of time.
Which is why I doubt 1.4 will be EOL'd, but the existing policy of not
updating it without a massively hugely justified reason and the
ongoing and strong encouragement of migrating to 2.2.
Anyway, even if this wish to expunge 1.4 were to be realised, it still
would remain available in some form no matter what.  This is because
the GnuPG Project uses git and the 1.4 code, the 2.0 code, the 2.1
code and the 2.2 code is all in the same repo with different branches
and tags and so on.  Anyone even vaguely worried about losing 1.4
(don't worry, we're not revisionists) only needs to clone the whole
repo somewhere and git being git, that's the entire job done.
Yeah, the Py2 EOL extension was a bit excessive.  Frankly it should've
just been pegged to when Twisted was migrated and then paying them to
do it faster.
At least with GPGME's Python stuff when faced with a 2 versus 3
decision it was pretty simple: we're going with 3, albeit with a
degree of support for 2.7 (i.e. it works in 2.7, but all the examples
and instructions are written for 3).
Well, I can't argue with that after seeing what Sun's customers did.
I think you might be overestimating your familiarity with all
industries which might be running it and any cases where hardware
limitations or certification requirements are a factor expecially if
that includes organisations which aren't, strictly speaking, standard
commercial or non-profit organisations.  Plus I would be rather
unsurprised to learn that there were live systems utilising 1.4 in
some way which really needed to remain running no matter what and if
it didn't then the people in the relevant region might legitimately
complain about losing power or water supply or whatever.
Do I know that sort of thing is going to be a guaranteed case?  No.
Still, as you say, 1.4 has been active for a long time and has no
doubt spread to all sorts of interesting use cases by now.  In this
case setting a short EOL to try to force change may not produce the
result you wanted.
Given how little that active burden currently is, it may not save that
much and appears to be mostly backports of certain major issues which
were first fixed in a more recent release.
That sounds rather deceptive; charging someone for maintenance of a
specific product and instead of spending that on the thing they're
paying for then spending it on a totally different thing that they're
willing to pay to avoid having to migrate to.
There's a far easier way to ensure that migration without
disadvantaging legitimate archival needs and it will be largely pushed
by the other end users: that being when the shift to elliptic curve
keys becomes standard and possibly even if it becomes a default
configuration (though I expect to see more hybrid keys such as RSA
primary keys and either curve subkeys or a mix of curves and
asymmetric subkeys first).

To be fair, 2.0 wasn't so happy on all platforms ... which is why I
completely skipped it (save for one attempt to use 2.0 somewhere in
the middle and one subsequent attempt to use 2.0's gpg-agent with 1.4;
the former failed and the latter worked for a bit and then imploded)
and only migrated once 2.1 was a thing.
Yes, well that's fair.
Well, if the use case is solely accessing archived data (my use case
for keeping it to hand or the code handy) then it's less a matter of
maintaining the code base and more a case of, "as long as it compiles
from now until whenever and behaves as it did, then it can access the
data I need it for" and anything beyond that is just a bonus.
Well it depends on which river, I guess.  No one said beaches had to
be by the seaside; that's just a conceit which has been largely
supported by English literature.
Not to mention the little fact that all this code has been released
under the current dual licenses for a *very* long time and those
licenses aren't going to be broken now.
Plus while some of us may even still have certain archives which do
require the possibility of using old keys, we also generally knew
about it for quite a while and thus were already aware that 1.4 was
the solution and maintenance was infrequent with no guarantees.  The
solution was to use it on that basis and/or migrate data and if the
latter isn't possible (e.g. for legal or historical preservation
reasons) then make sure you know what you're doing in house with the
code that is available.
From my POV, as someone who still has a working copy of his original
v2 key; even EOL'ing 1.4 would change nothing.  I can think of some
reasons why it might do bad things, but the flip side to that is the
1.4 code is a lot simpler (and self-contained), so anyone with a
really scary need to maintain it should hire g10code or their own
dedicated in house specialists (or both).
I expect national archives and libraries will also keep copies handy
for the performance of their legally mandated tasks in preserving the
historical record (and if a public archive of a mailing list includes
messages with signatures from v2 keys, that's the ball game from their
POV and the law is the law).  Still, those types of organisations are
used to employing specialists in accessing legacy formats and properly
archiving data, so I doubt they'll complain.
It's hard to care about anything beyond that, though and I'm sure it
will be a very long time before we see 1.4 not compiling on
something at all.  Maybe double-check after January, 2038 just in
case, but otherwise ? meh.
