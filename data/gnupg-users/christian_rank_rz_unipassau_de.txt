@_subject: OpenPGP card "factory reset"? 
Hallo list,
is there any possibility to perform some sort of "factory reset" on a
OpenPGP smartcard, esp. to clear the keys stored on the card?
Thanks in advance,

according to a notice at  the BasicCard manufactured
by ZeitControl cardsystems GmbH should support the OpenPGP smartcard
specification. Are the OpenPGP cards sold by kernelconcepts.de such

So the OpenPGP cards are ZeitControls's BasicCards with RSA encryption
and the OpenPGP application loaded and put in state 'RUN' (no further
programming of the card possible)?
What I'm missing from the OpenPGP card is the ability to load a PCKS
structure on the card. This would make it possible to use this card not
only for signing and encryption, but also for WWW authentication with
client certificates. Is something like that planned in the future?

This sounds very promising ...
The current PKCS emulation for the OpenPGP card is for version 1.0
and is read-only, so you can't load PKCS data structures on the card
(I tried it myself without success). I also tried encryption and signing
operations without success, but that may be due to the fact that I have
an OpenPGP card version 1.1, while the OpenSC support is for version 1.0.

Hello Patrick,
I've tested the new version with my OpenPGP Smartcard and Thunderbird 1.0.2.
In the function "Manage SmartCard", the fields "Firstname" and "Name"
seem to be swapped.
The functions "Edit Card Data" and "Change PIN" work perfectly for me,
as well as signing operations.
I have the following suggestions for improvements:
Since accessing the smart card takes a few seconds, it would be nice if
during smart card operations an alert box like "accessing smart card,
please stand by" would be displayed.
If smartcard operations are attempted without a smartcard in the reader,
 just the gpg error messages are displayed. It would be nice if a prompt
like "please insert smartcard" would be displayed.
Thanks for developing this great tool which makes encryption and signing
of messages really easy!
Best regards,
