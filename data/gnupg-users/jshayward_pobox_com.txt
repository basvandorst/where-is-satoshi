I'd second the basic statement.
I'm trying to spend a month not slamming spam and MicroSoft, because the
mental energy I use to detest them could be put to better use. One thing
I've realized in not making anti-spam jokes is that spam is not the Evil
Beyond All Other Evils. It's a pain in the neck, it wastes time, blah
blah blah, and spamhunters make the web a better place, but *some* spam
isn't all *that* bad.
One other possibility--comments, list owners?--is to autopost messages
from list members and send non-member messages to a moderator. That
seems a happy compromise of letting next to no spam get through, while
not requiring moderators to read most normal traffic (given that 90+% of
list traffic is from members, the moderator wouldn't have much to do).
