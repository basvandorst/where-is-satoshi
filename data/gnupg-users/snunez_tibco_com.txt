@_subject: Compile on Solaris 2.6? 
Hi Everyone,
   Has anyone got version 1.0.o to compile on Solaris 2.6 (sparc)?
I've tried but keep getting an error in the make:
make: Fatal error: Don't know how to make target `mpih-add1.lo'
Current working directory /usr/local/src/gnupg-1.0.0/mpi
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `all-recursive'
Current working directory /usr/local/src/gnupg-1.0.0
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `all-recursive-am'
Any ideas?

FYI:      Martins' suggestion of using gmake works fine. Thanks Martin.

@_subject: make check w/egd.pl 
Hi Folks,
   gnupg is now compiling fine, and passes 'make check'. However it
only does so _without_ egd. I've got the latest version of egd (0.6)
and it install and passes its checks with no problem. I've started it
up with "egd.pl ~/.gnupg/entropy", recompiled gnupg with "configure
--enable-static-rnd=egd" and now "make check" fails on 18/23 tests!
Most of them appear to be related to not being able to find
./entropy, like so:
FAIL: detachm.test
"expect" needed but not found - test skipped
PASS: genkey1024.test
(../g10/gpg --homedir . --passphrase-fd 0 -c -o x --yes plain-2) failed
gpg: fatal: can't connect to `./entropy': No such file or directory
secmem usage: 2496/2496 bytes in 8/8 blocks of pool 2496/16384
FAIL: conventional.test
18 of 23 tests failed

Does anyone know how to get around this problem?

@_subject: signature verification in 1.0? 
Hi folks, I've had gnupg/vm/mailcrypt running for a few days now and am happy
with the results (thanks guys!). I'm able to encrypt and decrypt files
with no problems. Recently I began testing the signing facilities, but
found there to be a problem. Mailcrypt was failing each time I sent
myself a message and tried to verify it, so using the Mini-howto, I've
tried it on a file, like so:
dev% gpg --clearsign foo
so far, so good. I've now got a foo.asc file, just like in
mailcrypt. Now try to verify the signature:
dev% gpg --verify foo.asc
gpg: Signature made Tue Sep 14 16:51:30 1999 SGT using DSA key ID A901627E
gpg: BAD signature from "Steven Nunez (Tibco email account) "
Am I doing something wrong here?

I'm positive I didn't edit the file. In fact, I just did it again and
there isn't any "Hash: SHA1$" line at all in the message. See listing
below (I had to create a new foo file, I deleted the last one I gave
you). Why would your version of gpg create this header line, but not
mine? I haven't edited the code at all.

Interesting. As it turns out, it's the --no-options flag which seems
to toggle the insertion of the hash header. Without this flag, no
header line, with it, I get the header. See shell output below if
interested. Is this a bug?
