"In a properly secured O/S an application program can't do any damage"
No damage, yes.  But additional alterations can happen.  Software installations alter the base O/S--especially the Windows registry.  Keep in mind things such as Anti-virus software need to put in hooks to intercept normal/original processing to test files/programs.
I've wondered how this same subject works with application whitelisting.
Also, I believe device drivers still run in RING0 on Windows.  Although I haven't heard/checked whether that's still true in Windows 7.

@_subject: Non-interactive use of gen-key 
I'm looking to automate key generation for gpg.  I found this link in the list archive:  The message suggests using the --batch option and either feeding parameters form stdin or from a file.  It also states, "Check out the file DETAILS. It should explain everything."  However, I can't find a DETAILS file in either the documentation or the uncompressed directory tree.
Does anyone know where to feed parameters from a file is documented or can someone explain it to this newbee?
Here's the pertinent part of the old thread:
          .          .          .
          .          .          .
          .          .          .
It documents what goes in the file, but not how to specify the file on the command line.

That's interesting.  I heard a very similar story where the "check" was written on a piece of tree bark.
I believe the "Check 21" legislation (intended to bring check-banking into the 21st century) has changed all that.  The pumpkin might still be a legally binding contract, but I think today banks only deal with electronic images of checks.  There's a whole bunch of regulations related to what constitutes a check.
I know that we can accept checks from other countries where the regulations are different.  But the processing fees for special handling are quite high.
(I also need to present a disclaimer--I am not a lawyer.  I just work with our Accounts Payable folks to produce checks that make it through the U.S. banking system.)

I especially can appreciate Mark Wood's comment on "The telephone quandary."  My use of encrypted e-mail is severely limited because so many of those with whom I communicate wouldn't have a clue how to acquire, install, configure, or use encryption.
The proposal doesn't preclude those that "might have something to hide" from seeking other sources of encryption keys.  It merely allows far wider use of encryption in general.

Using GnuPG 1.4.11 is there a way to check the fingerprint of a public key before importing it to the keyring?  The key was exported using the --armor option.  i.e., The file I have is named exported-key.asc
Also where would I find the instructions for this in the documentation? (So I won't need to ask again.)  The documentation I've located is either for GnuPG 2 or rather sketchy.

I would be one who fits in the other case.  I've never signed an e-mail--no one at our organization does.  (Not that I wouldn't like to, but nearly all those with whom I communicate wouldn't have any use for nor comprehension of the signature.)  However, I've written scripts to routinely sign files for transmission to our bank.  I would definitely count us as serious users.  We would be very upset if the bank started rejecting transmissions due to the lack of a valid signature.  Seeing that our bank is a very large one, I'm sure there are plenty of others who also sign their business transmissions using GPG.

Yes they verify the signature on the file.  In fact, I spent quite a bit of time working with them to get the signature to successfully verify. (It finally turned out that they did not want clearsign, but I had been specifically told to use both clearsign and armour.)  I'm quite confident they are verifying the signature on all files transmitted via the platform we're using.

Except you'll have to repair your private key every time you want to decrypt anything (unless I'm grossly mistaken). When something is decrypted with your public key, you can only decrypt it with the private If you're only encrypting things for long term storage and infrequent access, perhaps this won't be so challenging. But if so, then why not simply store them on some media secured away in something like a safe? If you will need frequent or even occasional access to the encrypted data, I would think it far easier to learn and remember a password. Or better yet a smartcard with a simple PIN--as has been suggested.

Which of course would not be possible if the public mailing list was all I can't count how many times I find relevant and information that helps with the task on which I'm working by using a search engine. At times, the helpful results are from mailing lists I've never heard of much less subscribed to. Other times the information is on a mailing list I'm familiar with, but don't have the time to follow on a regular basis. I get too much in my inbox as it is. But be able to find the information from a general search engine can be of immense aid.

The discussion has been most entertaining and enlightening. Both sides have valid points. I believe no software will ever do everything everyone wants. (I know mine doesn't.) I, too, get passionate about my thoughts at times. Then I simply try to remind myself it's software and generally not a life-and-death matter.

I agree. Absolutely. Employers have been held liable for hiring people with a criminal record. e.g., Someone convicted of child molestation might not be the best choice for a school bus driver or even school janitor--even if they've "paid their debt." Or another less extreme example: hiring someone as a cashier who has a criminal record of armed robbery. Perhaps they could still be a candidate for a job, but the previous record would be something to discuss with the individual before hiring or perhaps even before dismissing them as a job candidate.
I don't suggest we forever treat anyone as guilty of and punishable for a crime, but there are reasonable limits to how much we trust someone who has been convicted for certain crimes. A criminal records check can establish patterns or the need for greater supervision in various
