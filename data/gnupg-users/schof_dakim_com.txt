@_subject: How to receive keys from a keyserver when you don't have a key ID, 
I'm setting up an experimental private keyserver network and trying  to write scripts to interact with it from the command-line. (OS:  Ubuntu Linux 5.10)
Let's say that my script is asked to encrypt to a unique user ID.  (All user IDs will be unique; this is a closed system and I can  control that.)
If the local machine has the key in its keyring, it can just enter  the following:
gpg -se -r $RECIPIENTID -o $TARGETFILE -u $SIGNINGID $SOURCEFILE
However, if the $RECIPIENTID does not exist in the local keyring, gpg  fails. Fine. I should be able to request the key from the keyserver.  But in order to request the key from the keyserver, I need the Key ID  (ie 0xEE3A668A) rather than a unique identifier (unique.id. But if I don't have the key, how do I get the Key ID? Do I have to  store that separately and pass it to the script?
Am I missing something obvious here?
