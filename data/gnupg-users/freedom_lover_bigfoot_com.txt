@_subject: Idea how to leave double-mails out? 
Hash: SHA1
The list software is Mailman.  It is not really a problem with that software
that it doesn't add (or change) the Reply-To: header.  It is a deliberate
setting that is up to the list admin.  There is some discussion in the
Mailman admin area regarding the Reply-To: header.  Here is that discussion
for those without access to a Mailman list admin area:
    There are many reasons not to introduce or override the Reply-To: header.
    One is that some posters depend on their own Reply-To: settings to convey
    their valid return address. Another is that modifying Reply-To: makes it
    much more difficult to send private replies. See `Reply-To' Munging
    Considered Harmful[1] for a general discussion of this issue. See Reply-To
    Munging Considered Useful[2] for a dissenting opinion. [1] [2] Mailman's default is to leave the Reply-To: header unchanged.  The list
admin is free to change it to be the list's address, which is what many list
admins do.  This makes folks that want this behavior happy.  It also annoys
those users who prefer the current behavior.  On lists that I run, I use the
list address as the Reply-To: as I am not swayed by the arguments against
doing so.

@_subject: User ID length requirement 
Hash: SHA1
Does someone know if it's required in the OpenPGP spec that a user id be 5
characters or greater?  I am "cursed" with a 4 letter first name and when I
try and generate a new key or add a new user id with just my first name, gpg
gives me the error "Name must be at least 5 characters long."  I can easily
work around this by using Todd. or something like that (or by using pgp,
which doesn't seem to care about the uid length).
I see this comes from g10/keygen.c and looks to be easily modified, but I'm
curious if this is part of the spec or not.

Ahhh, thank you.  I don't know how I missed that in the fine manual. :)

@_subject: extracting photo (was "Re: photo in gpg key") 
Hash: SHA1
Would this example from the 1.0.7 options file suffice?
# This one saves a copy of the photo ID in your home directory:
# photo-viewer "cat > ~/photoid-for-key-%k.%t"
