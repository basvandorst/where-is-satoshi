@_subject: Malformed Revokation Certificate? 
I submitted this revokation certificate to a couple of servers and
they said it was malformed,
and I had trouble guessing how to generate anything different. So, I
imported the revokation certificate, exported the whole key, and
submitted that. It worked.
Thanks to the availability of PGP 2.6.3i, I am now the proud user of
a public key that has my name and my email addresses on different
packets, and for which the encryption key and the signing key are
identical. Thanks to the availability of PGP 10.x, a photo is on my
public key. GPG won't put photos on PGP 2.x keys. It can. No matter
what the relevant Request For Comments (RFC) says, it can. It makes
the key unimportable by PGP 2.6.3i, and the key servers have it.
I have a hybrid key.
The key servers can also import public keys designed for SSL and
S/MIME. PGP 10 will export them. GPG won't import them, though --
something about invalid user ids. It says the same thing about the
public key for a time stamper (invalid user id). Maybe GPG should be
more tolerant.
Sigh. The public key I want to use is already on my GnuPG public and
private key rings. When the signature on this e-mail failed, I went
in to the GUI key management, and found that I am using a different
version on the CLI. We are _losing_ features, here. Maybe it'll
import into version 2.x if I delete the photo.
