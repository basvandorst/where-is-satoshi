@_subject: Cannot import public key 
I've just installed GPG 1.2.1, and I'm having=20
trouble importing a public key from one of our=20
vendors. The error message I get is:
# gpg --import PHH.key.6.5.2.asc
gpg: key 9D8380B1: no valid user IDs
gpg: this may be caused by a missing self-signature
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:           w/o user IDs: 1
Here is the public key that I'm trying to import:
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: PGP 6.5.2
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
I have no trouble importing the same key into a Windows based PGP Freeware =
Thanks for your help!
