@_subject: GPG Bus Error on Irix - still there 
Hi all!  At  it says:
[ **]  1999-02-22  0.9.3
    Bus error on IRIX 6.4: Crash while doing a keygen. I think while
    the prime.  Other bus errors are reported when doing a "gpg README"
    on sparc-solaris2.6.
    --> Solaris fixed.
    --> IRIX bug still there but someone should test this again!
        ( reports that it is still alive in 1.0.0)
        (seems to be fixed now. wk 2000-01-14)
I'm having this same problem.  I could not find a fix for it.  Does
anyone have any suggestions on fixing this problem?  I'm compiling
with egcs, and actually could not figure out how to get it to compile
using /usr/bin/CC.
