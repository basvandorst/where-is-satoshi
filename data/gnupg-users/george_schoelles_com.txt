It sounds like gpg doesn't see your key rings.

Once on the keyservers it's pretty much there to stay.
Hell one more signature only increases your trust and decreases that
of the signer.

I'm trying to use my RSA key that I created in PGP band each
time I do my DOS window crashes.  DH keys created in PGP 6.x and
those created in GnuPG work fine though.  Is this a failure I
have to live with or is there a fix?
Thank you,

Use the numeric ID instead, works perfect here.

You could also try using GnuPGShell which has an interface for editing
basic defaults in the options file.

RPM's are installed suid.  /me thinks you'd have to build it yourself to make the recommended changes.
Might try setting gpg file permissions and allowing group access or like that.

There ain't none that aren't buggy as hell or are missing key features.
I have 4 different interfaces for gpg installed and and can't get one to do the job.
Best you can hope for is support from your Email client at this point. Kmail works great for handling signatures.

If you could name the attached signature it might help.  Most Windows users would be rightfully weary of "Attachment: 1".  Else, do a plain text signature for easy, unquestionable viewing.
