I am getting the following error when trying to decrypt an old file I found
lying around:
$ gpg -d /o/Work\ Data/Home/Home.tar.bz2.gpg
gpg: WARNING: unsafe permissions on configuration file
gpg: WARNING: unsafe enclosing directory permissions on configuration file
gpg: no secret subkey for public subkey F9202F72 - ignoring

I searched the 'net and found this mailing list with the following text, but
no resolution:
So it seems that someone managed to encrypt a message with your _signing_
key. But as a signing key is not intended to be used for encryption gpg
can't decrypt the message because there is no decrypt() for algorithm 17. Does anyone know how I can get out of this one?
