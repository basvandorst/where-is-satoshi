@_subject: show-photos off by defaulf, causes problem? 
Recently, a friend had a problem with a key in his keyring that appeared
to be valid. However he could not find any link between that key and his
only ultimately trusted key. He removed all signatures from that key,
but it still appeared to be valid. After importing the key into PGP i
noticed that there was a photo uid that had the link between the
keys that he could not find.
Okay, maybe i missed something here, but could the problem be that
show-photos was turned off?
are there any good reasons this is turned off by default?
    Causes   --list-keys,  --list-sigs,  --list-public-
    keys, and --list-secret-keys to display  any  photo
    IDs attached to the key.  Defaults to no.  See also

@_subject: How to verify the file was successfully encrypted... 
This might be a hard one.
When you encrypt to a public key, there is no way gpg
can decrypt it, to verify that it can be decrypted,
unless it can unlock the private key with your password.
The only way i see, is that gpg would have to encrypt 2 times
and compare the results. But then again, the same error might
happen twice.
Does this make any sense?
i don't know, this was just what im thinking.

@_subject: personal-cipher/digest-preferences 
If i understand the gpg.man correctly..
The "--personal-cipher-preferences" does only have an effect when
encrypting to more than one recipient, (besides from symmetrical
encryption algo selection)
the "--personal-digest-preferences" only when encrypting and signing
to more than one recipient. Im i right?
What does it mean to "factor in their own preferred algorithms when
algorithms are chosen via recipient key preferences."
Does it mean that, when i encrypt to a key that has, lets say AES
TWOFISH, and i use --personal-cipher-preferences TWOFISH AES, is the
message TWOFISH encryptet andgb
Is there any place i can read in detail how this works?

Thanks for you guys help.. :)
However, i have a small problem.
I dont want to interfere with any selection process
by having a personal-cipher/digest-preferences in my options
I have a RSA and a DSA key, When im using the RSA key i want to use
SHA256, and RIPEMD160 for my DSA key, when i use clearsign.
Is there anything i can put in my options file that will make
gpg use SHA256 for my RSA and RIPEMD160 for my DSA without
having the personal-digest-preferences thing in my options file?
This is really important to me because i when i clearsign something,
i dont have a recipient as a target and i want to use an algorithm
of my choice. For encrypt and sign, i want and algorithm of the
recipient choice.

sub  4096R/B3DF6DC0  created: 2008-04-06  expires: never       usage: E
So GPG will see the valid period on the second subkey as 2008-04-06 to never.
and not use it before 2008-04-06 ?
uhm.. i dont think im getting this right...
Can this enable me to set created date?s like, in 2010 if i want?
For me, creating a key is a one-time-thing, why not add some sub?s from

Isent theese algo settings stored with each uid? or do i mix things together?

Can i restore my public key with only the card?
Do i need to backup my "secret key" from my local keyring or can i
restore it from my card?
In case im asked to type the admin pin, and i dont type anything, but
just presses enter, will it result in 1 wrong attempt?
(im worried that my broken enter button will send 3 keystrokes, as it
sometimes does)
Suppose i type the admin pin wrong 2 times, and the third time it is
correct, will the "wrong pin" counter reset?

It will have no effect to set the trust value on a key that does not
have a signature from a ultimately trustet key (your key)
You can sign the uid?s on their keys with a local signature, such a
signature will not be uploaded to keyservers or exportet with the key.
Do a local sig, or if i remember correct, there is an "always trust" option.
