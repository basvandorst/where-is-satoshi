That does sound complicated.  The applet I wrote simply takes the
clipboard, acts upon it and then places the result back in the
clipboard used either ctrl-v or middle click.
If you're in a programming mood, it might be interesting to see a QT
implementation of Seahorse's libcryptui.  Our DBus interface can be
used in a desktop agnostic fashion.

If you're using the GNOME Desktop, Seahorse includes a panel applet
that does exactly that.
