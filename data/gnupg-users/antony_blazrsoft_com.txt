I'm no expert on the subject, but it seems the simplest and safest
solution would be to use a subkey of a dedicated key and rotate it
periodically if you're concerned about the key being compromised,
especially since the key will not be password protected. I could be
horribly wrong, but that's my two cents on it.

I don't see any harm in it. I uploaded my public key and they verified that I could decrypt it by a link in an encrypted email. 5 whole seconds out of my day to get encrypted emails from Facebook. They now have information that was publicly available on any sks keyserver already. Good for them for integrating any kind of encryption into their contact preferences. Use it, don't use it, I really don't think it makes much of a difference overall. Just good to see any kind of widespread adoption of encryption from a major influence among some people as Facebook.

Hash: SHA256
This topic brought to mind some interesting proposed RFCs that could
essentially eliminate the need for centralized certificate authorities.
Just wanted to get some opinions on the topics since its related to
certificate issues and the slavery of security to an external authority.
The combination of DNSSEC[1] and DANE[2] authentication can essentially
make a self-signed certificate as legitimate as one signed by an
"official" CA (if I'm not mistaken). There were some security
implications IIRC, but not being a professional on the subject, I'm not
sure what they were. I started implementing them on my own website and I
am very interested in seeing these proposals become official standards.
I'm also interested on anyone else's thoughts who might have more
insight into the downsides or repercussions of relying strictly on such
a system (if external CA's no longer existed, for example).

I know what you mean. They were proposed years ago and still maintain
the "proposed" status.
I use BIND(named) as my DNS server and it is DNSSEC capable as well as
DLV-Lookaside capable. Google's public DNS server are also capable of
both as well since I used them a lot for DNS record timeout testing
among other things.
I have the Firefox extension myself and refuse to use Chrome since, IMO,
its nothing more than a bloated version of the Gecko engine which does a
lot of useless crap I'm not interested in. Your mileage may vary. LOL.
But that is another problem with its adoption as a standard is that most
(if not all) mainstream browsers don't support it natively.
This I think is the main problem. It's adoption has not become
mainstream. I'm of the conspiracy theory opinion that its the CA's who
are making sure it stays in the background because otherwise they could
potentially lose their entire market if everyone realized they didn't
need a CA to properly and securely validate their certificates. (Pure
personal opinion here, no facts to back it up). My domain is secured via
DNSSEC and all my certificates have TLSA records to back them up. I'm no
professional at server administration, so if I can do it, anyone can.
Its disheartening to see something so promising pushed to the side for
so long when it could be a major benefit as far as internet security is
concerned. Thanks for your reply BTW. :)

It is looking for version >= 1.11, which you do not have.
It also appears to be looking in the default directory for self compiled
software (/usr/local/bin). I would recommend compiling the necessary
libraries/binaries of the correct version from source as well since it
looks like the repository does not provide them, which would make sense
since the repository version does not require a newer version. If you're
going to compile software from source, be prepared for headaches like
this. This isn't really a GPG issue, but just the fact that Ubuntu has
not brought the newer versions into their repositories yet.
I've never looked into maintaining a repository myself, but it does seem
like it would be a quite a bit of work (maintaining the server,
compiling and packaging the software, etc.) especially for software that
has a one man development team.

@_subject: One alternative to SMTP for email: Confidant Mail 
From the bit of testing I did with it, it seems the "email address" is
merely used as a user identifier. The domain is irrelevant. You could
use nobody at nonexistent-domain.com and it would still work. The email
address doesn't actually have to exist.
I don't think it does since the email address you use is in no way tied
to the actual address. It is linked to the AUTH code generated by the
server during user setup and that's about all. I used this e-mail
address during the server/client setup test and I never received
anything from the Confidant server I set up. From what I gathered
reading through the docs, the Confidant protocol doesn't use domain
names as identifiers, but each user has a specific identifier. The email
address is just a more human readable way of referring to their
identifier on the server. I could be wrong though and I'm sure Mike can
explain it better.

@_subject: How to get your first key signed 
I agree with this sentiment. I have locally signed Niibe's and Werner's
distribution keys, meaning the signatures are not exportable. I have not
verified their identities, but the fingerprints match those on their
website and listed in the announcement e-mails about the software. I
would not be able to definitively say that those keys belong to a person
named Werner Koch or Niibe Yutaka, but they do belong to the people
claiming to have those names and consistently releasing software under
those names. Since the keys do not change with every release, it is
reasonable to assert that it is the same people/person every time. Point
is, you don't need to have your identity verified for people to trust
your key. All my keys are self-signed. I revoked the original key I
created and created this one. I signed this key with the old one before
revoking it. Therefore, you could roughly assume that I am the person
who controlled the secret material to the previous key with this UID,
since this key is signed by that one as well. My name may or may not
really be "Antony Prince", but the keys created with that UID are
chained together by their signatures. I could go even further and make a
short web page listing the previous and current fingerprints and why I
revoked the previous key (called a "transition statement", IIRC) and
even sign that message. I have not done this because my identity as far
as my gpg key goes is not under that much scrutiny or of that much
importance to anyone that I'd need to go to those lengths.

@_subject: ?: keys.gnupg.net: Host not found 
It is a pool. keys.gnupg.net is just an alias for the SKS server
pool[1], IIRC. I host a server in this pool and it is set to drop all
IPv4 ICMP packets, so will not respond to a ping even though the server
is online. It will respond to ICMPv6 pings however.
Only servers running SKS 1.1.5 or higher are allowed in the pool.
Inclusion in the pool is voluntary, so there aren't any "official"
servers, so to speak, but there are criteria for being included in the
main pool. These include having a reverse proxy in front of the sks
server, the hostname of the server must resolve properly, and the server
cannot be missing more than a certain percentage of keys compared to
other servers in the pool. The pool is checked every hour and only
servers meeting the criteria are included. Using a specific keyserver is
generally frowned upon since the pool was created to help distribute the
load evenly over the servers. As far as uptime, if the server did not
respond during the last check of the pool, it will not be included. So,
in rare cases, there may be one or two servers in the pool that are not
currently responding, but did so during the last check of the pool. If
they do not respond at the next check, they are removed from the main pool.
I am also NOT able to reproduce this error on XUbuntu 14.04 x64:

@_subject: (OT) Blocking ICMP 
I decided to take a look at it since we were on the subject and I didn't
specify anything for ICMPv4. The default chain policy is DROP and I
didn't add any rules to allow ICMPv4, which explains why it does not
respond to ICMPv4 echo requests. Whereas in the ip6tables chains, I
specifically allowed ipv6-icmp, since (from what I understand)
disallowing ipv6-icmp causes a lot of issues as well. Since I only want
to disallow ICMPv4 echo requests (or replies), I'll adjust the
configuration accordingly. Thanks for bringing it up. :) Mainly, I'm
trying to avoid port scanners who ping first before proceeding with the
scan, since the IP is part of a known range of a VPS service provider (I
get a lot of port scans and service breach attempts). The loss of the
ability to use the PING command is trivial since there are multiple
other ways for me to determine its network status. Even when they do
proceed with the scan, psad[1] is pretty good at picking it up and
automatically adding a drop rule to the chain for the offending IP, as
long as you have a LOG rule before the packet is dropped of course.

I think the initial issue was that ant was unable to locate the junit
jar file which is why it was complaining about the classes not existing.
I'd certainly be willing to try and use the updated classes/methods and
replacing the deprecated ones. I built it on Java 7, but I have the Java
8 JDK as well and wouldn't have any problem with building/testing it on
Java 8. I can't help with the OS X builds as I don't have a Mac and am
pretty much clueless on how they operate. Now, for the binaries, I could
probably build and distribute them. I'm not 100% certain on how the
build process for this project actually goes, but *I think* it is
platform/architecture dependent (it appears that the build creates the
necessary libraries and links to them at compile time). The 64 bit
Windows and Linux binaries wouldn't be a problem. I don't have any
32-bit systems set up currently, but it wouldn't be much of a task to
set up 32-bit VM's for building them. I need to make the changes I made
to the code more... universal. As it is now, the path to the junit jar
file in the eclipse project setup has an absolute path in my home
directory. I need to see if variables can be used to get the relative
path instead. I also need to check the junit licensing to see if it is
permitted to distribute the jar files with the source code of the
project (which may be why guardianproject does not distribute them with
theirs). A few things to check up on, but I'll certainly look into it
and then if the changes look good, I'll get in touch with the guys from
guardianproject and see about submitting a pull request if they feel the
changes are a benefit to the project.

Alright. After playing around with it all day, there are a few things I
needed to clarify. First, Windows builds would require a DLL that I
don't have the coding knowledge to create, so that's scratched. Also,
when I initially tried to build the project, I strictly used ant which
failed until I downloaded JUnit and pointed ant to it. If you run it as
a maven build with the original code from Guardian Project, it works
since maven downloads the necessary dependencies and points ant to them
since maven is actually controlling the ant build. My objective
currently is to produce the binaries for Linux since the default maven
build creates the *.jar and *.so files needed to make this process
easier for those who prefer pre-compiled binaries without having to
figure this all out. My only concern is whether the compiled binary and
library file are architecture specific which will require more
investigation on my part. I should be able to get it going on Travis CI
with pretty much the exact source from Guardian Project other than the
additional files required by Travis CI. Once all that is going good, I
can turn my attention to possibly updating deprecated methods of JUnit
that are used.

I've finally configured the Travis CI builds[1] and got them to upload
to my FTP server[2]. The hosted files are compiled by Java 7, but also
compiled with Java 8 first by Travis to make sure they build on both.
The MD5 and SHA1 sums are echoed into the terminal during the Travis
builds so users can verify that the files on the FTP server are actually
the ones built by Travis and are also included in separate files on the
FTP server for verification. The code used is verbatim from Guardian
Project[3] with the additional files I added[4] and messed around with
to get it to build on Travis and upload to my server. I still have not
tested to see if they are architecture specific. The only other issue I
could think of would be version differences since I'm assuming that the
*.so file created links to gpgme on the current system (The build failed
without gpgme installed). I'm not 100% sure how to test the
functionality of the binary and library, so if anyone wants to give it a

As an update on this, I've written a very short program to invoke the
test functions of the library. This is more of a learning exercise for
me, but I figured I'd let anyone interested know that I was still
pursuing it. It doesn't work 100% yet and I'm working towards figuring
it out, but at the very least, I've got the suite() method in

It is failing at the call to genKey(). I'll figure it out eventually I'm

builds that I mentioned earlier. I'll likely perform tests with natively
built files to see if the issue lies there, etc. If I can maintain the
motivation, I may eventually work on my own Java front-end for the

After poking around a bit, I decided to quit messing with the test suite
methods and actually try some of the regular methods of the library.
That functionality seems to work as expected. It was only a short test
where I had it list UIDs and e-mails given the key ID, but it worked.
This was using gnupg 2.1.8 (using libgcrypt 1.7 beta 261 I think), gpgme
1.6.0, the library files generated by Travis and hosted on the ftp
server[1], and run on XUbuntu 14.04 x64. The test method I mentioned
before may have failed since, from what I can tell, gnupg 2.1.8 doesn't
support the ELG-E key type unless I was missing something, which is very
likely. I haven't really made any significant changes to the repo[2]
other than adding the files necessary to execute the Travis builds[3]
and modifying the maven build to generate the source jars to allow
easier debugging and source viewing in Eclipse. I'll keep playing around
with it and keep everyone informed of any significant observations or
I've also signed all the files on the ftp server with the key used to
sign this email. They have their checksums available as well and the
checksums are echoed to the terminal during the Travis build in case
anyone wants to verify that the hosted files are genuinely the ones
created from the source by Travis.

Well, keys on keyservers never provide any assurance that they belong to the owner.

@_subject: AW: Key generation with GPGME and GnuPG hangs at gpgme_op_genkey 
I switched hosting providers a month or two ago and those files may have
slipped through the cracks. If anyone is interested in the pre-compiled
files, I can set it up again. The code was pretty much exactly the same
as that from guardian project except I made a few modifications to the
build process so it could be built by the travis continuous integration
system. If you are familiar with Java and Maven, it would probably be
best to build it natively using Maven on your host system. I tested the
binaries on a few systems (all Ubuntu) and it seemed to work as
expected, but I'm not 100% sure if there are any bindings created and if
there are, that they are system independent. If you need a hand with the
maven build process, I'll be happy to help.

@_subject: GPGME-if gpg is necessary 
As far as I understand it, yes. If you use GPGME, gpg is also necessary
since GPGME is an interface to access the functions of gpg. You can do
this directly with your program and gpg without GPGME, but it would
likely be fairly cumbersome which is why GPGME came about. That's merely
my understanding of it and I could be wrong.

@_subject: Yubikey + GNUPG 2.1.14 + GPG Agent Forwarding + Mutt 1.6.0 (gpgme 
encryption key
My assumption would be that the callback for the prompt is issued to the
local machine rather than passing back through SSH and Mutt doesn't know
what to do with it. I don't have any experience with SSH tunneling
though, so I can't say for sure. In that case, it shouldn't work since
the key can't obtain its passphrase.
Like the previous case, there has to be a call for the pinentry. Even
though it is tunneled through SSH, the call on the remote machine routes
to the remote machine so you get a curses pinentry or some such. To get
it to perform a call to pinentry on your local machine would require the
call to be routed back through the tunnel.
Neither response is much help, I know, but just my thoughts on what the
issue is. Hopefully, one of the gurus on the list can help you through it.

@_subject: (OT) mathematicians-discover-prime-conspiracy 
I've followed the thread for a bit now, but the concept definitely brings some things to light, especially for those less cryptographically or mathematically inclined. By the basics that I know, a 50-50 chance is a 50-50 chance. But as has been pointed out, the chance of getting a specific set of results consecutively is obviously (according to the data), not 50/50 even though the initial probability would imply that. I don't really have much more to add to the discussion other than it made me think a bit more about how probability and the effect that measuring the probability of predetermined sequences within that same set might produce results that are contradictory to the initial expectations. Such is the nature of these things and I merely found it interesting that the results defied the expectation. Which is the essence of discovery and progress.

But to reply directly to the post at hand, inertia would definitely be a factor in a physical coin tossing. Even though the coin only has 2 sides, the amount of initial force used to flip it and all the other external factors affecting it before it landed would play a part, so though the beginning ratio might be 50/50, there are external factors that skew the ratio one way or the other in a true physical coin toss, so on that point, I applaud you for that observation.

May be a reverse lookup issue. Werner mentioned he added a V6 address to the server yesterday. Some MTA's do a reverse lookup on the inbound mail IP and if it does not match, the mail is flagged as spam. I could be wrong, but I'm guessing it is something along those lines.

@_subject: How to convert (ancient) key in "version 2" to more modern 
The best solution I could think of would be to use a version of PGP that
is capable of decrypting the mails and using a newer key with a modern
version of gpg to re-encrypt them to your new key for storage. A script
could be written for the purpose. This still doesn't solve the problem
of the signatures, but at the least you would be able to keep the
archived files encrypted with the newer standards and eliminate the need
for supporting obsolete keys any further than this point for decryption.
Not the most elegant solution or even one you may want, but it is *a*
solution, provided that you can find software to use the V2 keys of course.

It is indeed a directory. The tilde character is a shortcut for your home directory and .gnupg in your home directory is where gnupg stores its information for that particular user. Depending on the versions of your OS and gnupg, you can invoke gnupg by typing either 'gpg' or 'gpg2' into the terminal. Adding the switch '--help' to this command will show you common options and a brief explanation. 'man gpg' or 'man gpg2' should show you the gnupg manual pages which provides a more in depth explanation of various options. There are various guides on the website, but I don't have any links for them at the moment.

My old key is expiring at the beginning of next month, so I've generated

a bit of overkill and have the master key in a single location. That's a
different discussion. Anyway, using my new Authentication key on Linux

When I try to connect to the server with putty using the "Attempt
authentication using Pageant" option, I just get "Disconnected: No
supported authentication methods available. (server sent: publickey)". I
was of the understanding that gpg-agent would act as a replacement for
Pageant in this mode.
I have the public key in the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file and can log in
successfully using ssh and gpg-agent on Linux. Before I added
"disable-scdaemon", gpg-agent would complain that it couldn't find the
key on the card (I've never had one). Since adding that option, that
error has gone away, but it still does not work and gpg-agent doesn't
provide any helpful output. The keygrip named file exists in
private-keys-v1.d, so the key is there. Any help in further
troubleshooting the issue would be greatly appreciated. I'm sorry if
this has been answered before. I looked through the archives and googled
around a bit, but couldn't find anything to point me in the right direction.

@_subject: Paper backup of all keys 
Just off the top of my head, I believe it can be done with:
gpg -a --export-secret-keys [key-id] > secret_key.txt
This creates a text file with the ASCII armored private key file which can then be printed.
You can type the key into a text file, say secret_key.txt, and then do:
gpg --import secret_key.txt
You could name it secret_key.asc as well. Not sure if that matters (I don't think it does).
This is just off the top of my head since I'm not at my computer at the moment to verify, but that's the gist of it.

You could change:

gpg -a --export-secret-keys [key-id] >> secret_key.txt
With this, it will append each successive key to the end of the text
file. Not the cleanest solution though. Daniel mentioned a tool meant
for this purpose called paperkey in his response. I've never used it but
it seems like it's definitely worth looking into if you want paper
backups. As he mentioned, typing in a key manually is a PITA, especially
if it has a lot of signatures and depending on the key length. The
public key is derived from the private key, so the private key(s) is/are
all you need since it contains all information associated with that key.

With paperkey (using base64 output), the output was around 19 pages, so the benefit was minimal.

For your original issue, IIRC, that version of libgcrypt can't handle the elliptic curve algorithms that were added in libgcrypt 1.7 and gnupg 2.1. It just means that there are keys on your keyring that use these algorithms and gnupg doesn't understand them.

I had a similar problem a while back on a different distro. IIRC, you have to specify the library directory to the compiler. Something like '-L/path/to/library/dir -{name of library}'. That's probably not the right syntax, but the issue you're having is that at compile time it is linking the system version so you need to explicitly tell the linker/compiler which one to use via compile time flags.

You need to verify the key that signed it. A valid signature means nothing. A malicious actor could sign any message or days with a valid, verifiable key and send it to you. The heart of the matter is the key that signed it. Gnupg tells you which key signed the data, usually by long key ID IIRC. You have to make sure the key that signed the data is the key that you expect, basically. If you need something more in-depth, there are many more qualified individuals to assist on the list.

It seems it was intended to use ANT in a Linux environment as per the

are old and not particularly geared for Windows environments it
would seem. Make is a utility for compiling programs in Linux/UNIX
environments which is why your system failed to find it unless you
use MinGW or something like it, but that will only further
