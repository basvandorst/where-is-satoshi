Hi Caprian,
I'm not able to answer your main question, but I believe it is you
explained. However, regarding the matter in P.S., I'm glad to inform you
that such a tool exists. It is called pass [1] and it is fully integrated
with GnuPG and Git. So you can backup your password like a Git repository.
There's also Android and iOS implementation of pass.
Hope this helps.

@_subject: GPGME-JSON to bundle with GnuPG (not Gpg4win) installer? (Or 
Hi all,
I've been using GnuPG for a while now, but I'm not able to use GnuPG with
Mailvelope, since Mailvelope requires GPGME-JSON, which is not bundled
with minimal
GnuPG installer
. (I
strictly use GnuPG via command line, so I don't want other software to be
installed.) Is there any chance that I can install GPGME-JSON separately?
