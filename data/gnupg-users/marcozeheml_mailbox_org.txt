Hi everyone!
Perhaps new emerging services like  can help with better key verification if clients like Enigmail and GPGMail (and others) integrate it into their workflows. Keybase works in a way that one creates an account, uploads one?s public key, and adds verification through at least one other means. Those include access to an account on Twitter, Github, Reddit or HackerNews, or a proof of domain ownership either by a DNS TXT entry or a file on the web server that follows a certain format. That way, the owner of a key can stipulate that they are able to access these accounts as well and are probably not fake. Of course, the valid point remains that not only the tweet, gist or other postings that are proof of ownership should be checked, but also other activity on relevant accounts, similar to what Kristian suggested for looking up activity on e-mail addresses.
If you?d like to see an example, my profile can be viewed here:

Hi Kristian,
And here?s the other problem the main article in c?t mentions: Those keys, although faked, were certified. They were certified by equally faked keys which resemble keys that are quite well-known. So unless someone had the *real* certifying keys installed and could see that those weren?t the same certifications as on the forged keys, there was no first and even second glance way of recognising these as being faked.
I agree with Patrick?s point that the problem, indeed, lies in the way keys can be uploaded to key servers without at least some basic verification of key ownership. Something needs to change, and there *must* be put a mechanism into place that allows at least some assurance that the person I think the key belongs to, is actually the owner. It is not always feasible to verify a whole key finger print with the recipient first-hand, except for insecure plain text e-mail. For example, if I wanted to have sent that journalist encrypted e-mail with some important information, according to the current model, I would have had to find out a phone number to reach him, have a business card with his key?s finger print on, or met him in person to verify each other?s keys first. That?s a damn high entry level, and I think it?s time to re-think some aspects of that and integrate some means of ownership verification that avoids at least some of the above mentioned problems.

Hi Chris,
I agree! I actually took them up on their offer to contact them for signing my public key with their C?t PGPCA key they advertise at the end of the actual article (not the editorial) in c?t 6/2015, page 160. But because I had a question, I wrote to them first. Took a couple of days before I got a reply, and I couldn?t help but ask if they?ve already ditched OpenPGP completely. I was sarcastic, and got a very honest reply from another c?t journalist saying that that very topic has been heatedly debated at Heise, and that by far not everyone agrees with Mr. Schmidt. Their crypto campaign is still in full force despite the editorial. So like everywhere, different opinions, and that one journalist?s opinion definitely doesn?t speak for all of the folks at c?t or Heise in General.

Hi Werner et al,
OK, then I have a very practical question: Even though this is my fourth or fifth attempt at establishing OpenPGP in my daily routine since the mid 1990s, I am still confused by what the best way is to make my public key known. So if, as you say, key servers are not trusted by design, if I want to spread word around my available public key, which source should I put in a signature? While reading this list, I have seen quite a number of different approaches. Some put their key ID along with the finger print and the URL of a key server. Others put a link to the key file on a web server, others just quote their key ID and finger print, or only either of those.
I have my key uploaded (and kept current) on key servers as well as on my web site(s), and my Impressum links to the copy on my web site rather than the key server URL.
So: What?s the best practice advice? (and yes, I looked in the FAQ, but that didn?t prove conclusive to me.)

Hi Andreas,
FWIW, that?s how GPGMail, the Apple Mail plug-in on OS X, does it, or *can* do it (the feature can be disabled). It will fetch keys based on the e-mail address and signature. So only if it finds a key on the key server that can verify the signature, will it add it to the local key ring. I believe you can also do that with Enigmail by editing something on the Key Servers page of the *advanced* Enigmail settings dialog. So the Mail plugin doesn?t just add keys based on the e-mail address, but needs additional clues that the sender is OpenPGP-capable. And so far, I think I?ve only seen it do that with signatures.
That?s how things have developed for me over the past year since I started using GnuPG again.
Yes, and Threema itself even offers a few levels of potential trust through verification of the phone number and/or e-mail address, indicating that the other party has established it has access to one or both of these means, without actually giving away the phone number or e-mail address. And if one has that Threema contact in one?s own address book and chose to look them up on the Threema servers, that is also indicated. This is a level of proof of ownership I was also referring to earlier, where one can do a bit more to tell others ?hey, this is really me!?.

Hi Doug,
Yes, I have been known to have that tendency sometimes. :)
Thanks! Will do as you suggest, then.

Hi Patrick,
I like this idea very, very much! This is a confirmation that doesn?t hurt anybody, and it is something that insures on a basic level, that the key isn?t completely bogus.
I have seen part of this in a different context in Mozilla?s Bugzilla, when one uploads one?s public key into the Bugzilla account to be able to receive security-sensitive messages. After submitting the form, Bugzilla sends an encrypted message to the account?s e-mail address, assuming the public key just uploaded belongs to that address. It doesn?t go as far as requiring verification via a link, but it definitely confirms if the key is working for the user.

Hi Kristian,
In theory, yes. And keybase.io goes in that direction, although they don?t do the verification of e-mail addresses themselves, only the e-mail address one signs up with for the account.
But why should key servers not do that? Why add this extra level of complexity?

Hi Kristian,
Do you have any insight to share in that bug that might help my colleagues move fixing it forward? I?m sure it would be highly appreciated! :)

Hi Kristian,
Error in judgement that has since been corrected. These things sometimes happen, but this should definitely not be generalized.
Yes, the public key doesn?t come from a key server in the first place, but needs to be copy and pasted into a standard HTML textarea while filling in the form for that Securemail extension. So it is the key owner?s responsibility to keep it up to date. As far as I know, there is no interaction with any outside source in this matter.
Yes, these instances are all acting independently, there is no exchange between totally unrelated Bugzilla instances.
