@_subject: 1.4.1 won't retrieve key from keyserver? 
Has this issue been fixed?  Here's a recap of what I've observed.  I'm using TB 1.0.2 and gpg 1.4.1 (for windows, obviously) :)

I'd be glad to test it when the 1.4.2RC comes out. Thanks for fixing it so quickly!

@_subject: revoking a UID 
When one revokes a UID to effectivly change addresses, how does that affect the signatures that were on the key?
In other words...
1. Generate a key with uid1.
2. Get this key signed by your friends, etc.
3. Generate a new uid, uid2.
4. revoke the old uid, uid1.
Will your friends that signed your key origionally still see your key as valid?  Will they have to sign the new uid in order to have your key be valid again?  What are the security implications of having your friends still see your key as valid when you've revoked the uid that they signed?
Thoughts are much appreciated.

@_subject: 1.4.0a won't retrieve key from keyserver? 
I've just noticed a problem that I'm having with the windows version (1.4.0a).  I can't seem to import any keys from the keyserver.  I can search the server, see the key, but when I select the key to import, i get gpg: requesting key  from hkp keyserver gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: Total number processed: 0
but if i run the same command through a gpg-1.2.5 installation, the process completes and correctly imports the key i selected from the search.
Did something change in 1.4.0a in the way gpg gets keys from a keyserver?
Thanks in advance.

bugs.gnupg.org wants a loging/pass ????
Again, any idea when 1.4.1 will be available?

@_subject: New Outlook Plugin .99.1 (Beta) - works great! 
Here ya go....
However.....I can't seem to get the plugin to work with outlook.  It crashes every time I try to decrypt or encrypt an email.  Also, there's no toolbar buttons on the main outlook window (for those of us that use the preview-pane).  Are there special usage or install instructions for this plugin in order to get it to work?  It does work with an exchange account in oulook, right?

Sorry to bring this back up when it's supposed to be fixed, but with 1.4.1 I'm still having the same issue as before.  Do you know what bug # it was specifically that was 'fixed'?  Thanks.
(http and hkp server types dont' seem to work, but if i retrieve using ldap, it seems to work.  The end problem is that enigmail can't work through to completion because if I tell enigmail to use ldap, it can't search, and if i tell it to use http, it searches fine, but can't retrieve.)
