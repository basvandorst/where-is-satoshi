@_subject: How to verify the file was successfully encrypted... 
My suggestion:
On your server, calculate a hash for the unencrypted data file.
Encrypt the data file & transfer the encrypted file to a secure box which has your secret key. Decrypt the file on that secure box & compare the hash to the hash created on the server. If the hashes are the same then all is well & you can delete the files on the server.
This can all be scripted & it keeps your private key off the server.
I hope this helps,
{My apologize if this doesn't thread correctly]
