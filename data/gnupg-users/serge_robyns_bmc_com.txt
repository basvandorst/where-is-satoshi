@_subject: Importing gnupgp keys into Outlook and/or Netscape (netscape on L 
I tried to import my private keys into Outlook and netscape.
I read the mails concerning export gnupg but nothing seemed to help.
I would like to be able to sign my mails from Netscape under linux
and also send encrypted mails.
