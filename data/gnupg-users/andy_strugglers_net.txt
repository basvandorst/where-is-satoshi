Hi folks,
I have a gpg key, which can be found at
 or on keyservers; 0xBF15490B.
A while ago I decided to revoke the encryption key and generate a
new encryption key with 2048 bits instead of 1024.  I thought it had
worked so went ahead and revoked the encryption subkey, 0x9EE99022.
The new encryption subkey is 0x604DE5DB.
The problem is that, I still receive things encrypted to 0x9EE99022.
I tell people to make sure they have imported my key and when they
try they tell me that they get "subkey errors".  I also note that
some keyservers contain a version of my key with no reference to the
subkey 0x604DE5DB.  I try to upload a new version but nothing seems
to happen.
Someone said this was something to do with subkeys and that I should
use the keyserver subkeys.pgp.net.  Using that keyserver I can
upload something that does seem to represent my key properly, but
others (who also use gpg) cannot get my key from there.
So my questions are..
- Did I do something stupid?
- Is it recoverable without having revoke my keys entirely and start
  again with new ones?

Hi David,
Thanks for that.  If you now attempt to encrypt something to
"andy do you end up encrypting to the correct key?
I will try to get the exact error messages that others report.

Hi Jason,
How should I go about cleaning that up?
Thanks for that - what would you suggest I do to clean it up a bit
though?  0x788FA859 isn't even in my current key and I have no way
to remove information from key servers, right?
$ gpg --edit-key andy

Unfortunately, I now have multiple correspondents who I would like
to receive encrypted mail from who cannot import my key at all using
gpg so that they can encrypt things to 0x604DE5DB.
I will get the exact error messages from them.
