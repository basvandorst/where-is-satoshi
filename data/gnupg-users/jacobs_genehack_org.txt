Hash: SHA1
Greetings --
I recently got GnuPG, Mailcrypt, Gnus, and XEmacs to all play together, so
I'm now happily signing all my mail and news posts.
The only remaining problem I'm having is that somewhere along the way,
my sig delimiter gets changed from '-- ' to '- -- '. Any other lines
that start with a dash suffer a similar fate. I've been told that PGP
does this because of the '-----PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----' lines. Is there any way to disable this behavior in GnuPG?

I see from your headers that you're using Gnus with XEmacs -- care to
briefly share how you integrated Secret Agent with Mailcrypt? (Or, if
you're not using Mailcrypt, please give details of your set-up.)
Possibly wandering off-topic, so please feel free to mail just to me
if you think appropriate.
