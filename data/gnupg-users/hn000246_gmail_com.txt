@_subject: Setting Up a User with Private Digital Keys (Error Msg) 
Hello Guys,
Greetings from Honduras,
It's my first time using gng from the AS400 (IBMi) but when I'm trying to
setting up a user with private key, I'm getting an error:
Command: gpg --gen-key
Error: gpg: cannot open `/dev/tty': No such device or address
Could you help me to solve this issue?
Best Regards,
