@_subject: Decrypt file from PGP Desktop Professional 
Hi !
I'm a newbie in gnupg.
If a file is encrypted using PGP Desktop Professional, is it possible for me to decrypt that file using gnupg ?
If it's possible , how to do that ?

@_subject: Automating Decryption using gpg --batch --passphrase-file or gpg 
Hi !
I tried to automate decryption of pgp files by running this command line in windows xp gpg --batch --passphrase-fd 0 < passphrase.txt --output "OUTPUT.CSV" --decrypt "OUTPUT.CSV.pgp" or gpg --batch  --passphrase-file passphrase.txt --output "OUTPUT.CSV" --decrypt "OUTPUT.CSV.pgp" but it's always failed.
It always throw an error gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit RSA key, ID , created 2008-05-08
gpg: public key decryption failed: bad passphrase
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
I'm using gnupg 1.4.9.
Can anybody help me please?
Thanks

Hi Hardeep!
Thanks for your reply.
I did try your suggestion and It didn't work.
It still throwing the same error .
Can you tell more about the key setup?
What kind of procedure i need to follow so i can run gpg in SQL Job?

The first method is incorrect. Correct usage of --passphrase-fd is as below:
gpg --batch --decrypt --passphrase-fd 0 --output output.csv
