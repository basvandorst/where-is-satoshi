@_subject: Upgrade query 
We're currently running 1.4.7 and want to install and use gpg on a new
server.  I was hoping to install one of the latest 2.2.1.7 perhaps... Can
someone tell me if that is even possible?  I was hoping to just install the
new one and then move my /.gnupg dir over there rock-n-roll..    Are these
version compatible or do we need to just install that same old version?

I am STILL getting the same errrors with the "configure" (missing libs)
libgpg-error, libgcrypt, libassuan, libksba & npth even AFTER I installed
each of them....   Is this a link issue of some kind?

As far as I can tell they are all there as you see below......
