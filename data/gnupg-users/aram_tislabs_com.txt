@_subject: certificate (X.509, LDAP) client? 
Hi people,
I'm looking for a client or (better) a development library to access
certificate servers, i.e. submit and request certifiactes from them. Does
GPG have that? It seems like it does at least some of that. What are the
functions and how do I use them?
Please cc: me as I'm not on the list.
