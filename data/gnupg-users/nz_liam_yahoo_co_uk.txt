I'm a new user, and am having problems getting gpg 1.0.6 to read
messages sent with pgp 7.0.3 .
I am using the "GNU privacy assistant" plug-in four outlook (gpg 1.0.6),
and am running outlook 2002 and win xp pro on both computers. I can
encrypt and send messages from my gpg machine and decrypt them on my pgp
machine ok, but cannot decrypt messages encrypted by pgp machine on my
gpg machine.
I get the following error from the GNU privacy assistant in a pop up
dialog box "Cannot decrypt message with the paraphrase entered" even
thought the paraphrase is correct.
Any help on this matter would be greatly appreciated. Do You Yahoo!?

I have resolved the problem I was having with gpg 1.0.6 , and now it is
working like a charm.
Sorry for any inconvenience I may have caused you.
