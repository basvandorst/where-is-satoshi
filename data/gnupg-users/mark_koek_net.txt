@_subject: GnuPG & KMail 
Is anyone using GnuPG with KMail? If someone could take me through the
steps needed to set it up I'd be very grateful.
I've read the mini-HOWTO, but it concentrates on command-line stuff and
says nothing about integration with e-mail.

I can do this with PGP ("pgp +batchmode -z$pwd"), but I'd prefer to use
But how?
