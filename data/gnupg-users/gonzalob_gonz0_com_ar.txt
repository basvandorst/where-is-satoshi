@_subject: What does key properties validity and trust 'None' mean??? 
A key is valid in a keyring once it's signed by an ultimately trusted
key for that keyring, or when it gets enough signatures from other fully
or marginally trusted keys in the ring (this requirement depends on your
configuration, by default one fully trusted key or three marginals make
a key valid).
This is why John told you to assign a trust level of full only to people
you fully trust ;-). Otherwise your ring may be filled up valid keys
that you shouldn't really consider as such.
Note that you don't need a key's ownertrust to be full for it to work,
it just has to be valid. These two concepts are different.
p.S: forgive me Bo for sending this to your email, I meant to send it to
the list.

@_subject: Using subkeys to renew an expiring key 
I do not know of a better way, so my answer would be yes, it's the
correct way.
Those who update will start encrypting to the new key, while those who
don't will keep encrypting with the old one until it expires (once it
does expire, they won't be able to encrypt at all until fetching the new
one). In either case, you will still be able to decrypt messages
encrypted to any of those keys, as long as you have the secret
keymaterials, since these do not expire nor get revoked, only public
keys do.

@_subject: Why gpg complains? 
GnuPG is warning you since you seem to have not signed the Key.
IF you trust the key (i.e. you are sure to a reasonable degree that the
key owner is who he claims to be), then you should sign it and the
warning will go away.
To do so from the command line:
gpg --edit-key (1) This step's output depends on some local config, so follow the
onscreen instructions.
This is a mini, nano, really short HOWTO. Before doing any of this you
should read and understand the GnuPG Privacy Handbook
( after which all will be

@_subject: GPG Command Line Question 
What you seem to be trying to execute is
gpg --export-options export-minimal
isn't it? That should work, I used it today, on GnuPG 1.4.9
