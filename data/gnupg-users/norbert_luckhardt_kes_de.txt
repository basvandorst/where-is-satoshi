@_subject: trust problems 
hi there,
[ as the archive is not searchable I could not check if these
problems/questions are new... ]
I encountered some things I consider strange behaviour with GPG 1.0.6
and WinPT 0.2.1
using some test keys I found NO certificate trace to myself in the
edit-key function, though I signed the key directly with my ultimately
trusted key (the same null output shows up when being one step further
away from my own signature):
more over: WinPT seems to have an offset error or something like that
as the following trust values are shown wrong in the GUI:
leads to the following validity output (screenshot av. on request ,-):
test ich      full
test Albert   marginal
test Barbara  marginal
- another strange thing (which should be checked on the original
keys...) is
though there is a correct signature from the valid key B3B2A12C on the
older RSA key and despite the fully trust level on the newer key - the
older RSA key is NOT seen as valid!
[ Norbert Luckhardt (Kommunikationsschluessel)
 is my personal ultimately trusted key ]
[ the signauture from B3B2A12C on BB1D9F6D is a trusted introducer
signature with trust depth 1 ]
Viele Grüße, Shalom dann,
