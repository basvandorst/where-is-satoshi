@_subject: Automate gpg decryption 
Hi everyone
I'm trying to automate file decryption with the following command:
gpg --output file --decrypt file.gpg
This command require interaction, asking me for the passphrase.
I know it is not secure to store passphrase in a script but I have a lot
of files to decrypt.
I must do this in a shell script.
Is there a way to do this with gpg, or do I have to use expect ?
