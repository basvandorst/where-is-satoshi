I cannot understand it ! I was so sure GnuPG
was 100% compliant with RFC2440 !
Thanks for the pgpdump utility, it is nice.

Has this draft for next version of OpenPGP been published ?
Or is there a way to have packets stricly conform to the existing
version of the RFC ? I am not sure this can be done with
the option "--openpgp"...

Thanks a lot, this is very helpful...
However, I don't find in :
any description for tag 18, which according to pgpdump is for :
"Symmetrically Encrypted and MDC Packets"...
This must be the problem with protocols
that are "moving targets"...

Here is a weird thing that I found when comparing
PGP and GnuPG.
You'll find below some conventionally encrypted data
(the passphrase to decrypt is "test").
It is decrypted OK by PGP and GnuPG.
BUT GnuPG generates garbled data.
(I've tried GnuPG v1.0.6 and v1.2.1).
This has something to do with decompression,
because I get no problem with non-compressed data.
Thanks for any suggestion.

To be precise, only the end of the data is garbled...
