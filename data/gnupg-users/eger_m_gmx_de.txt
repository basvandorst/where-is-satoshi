I know, it's a topic which had been discussed on this list - which I followed without success.
I've got a debian woody system kernel 2.4.19 and  gpg (GnuPG) 1.2.1 (binary standard debian installation). Why doesn't  the following work? gpg --keyserver ldap://wwwkeys.de.pgp.net --search-keys ""
gpg: unable to execute program "gpgkeys_ldap": No such file or directory
gpg: no handler for keyserver scheme "ldap"
The file gpgkeys_ldap definitely exists: /usr/lib/gnupg/gpgkeys_ldap
and even copying into the exec-path does not help.
The following ldap-packages are installed:
Thanks for any idea.

Thanks a lot, that was it!
BTW, as an answer to David: extending the $PATH to include /usr/lib/gnupg, i.e.,  export did not help. And:
gpgkeys_ldap -V
