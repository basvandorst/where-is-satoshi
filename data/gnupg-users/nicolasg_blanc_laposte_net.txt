@_subject: Passphrase problem 
recently, I update my KDE to KDE 3.5 and then I got a problem using my keys. Of course, I don't know if there is a link with what I've done, but since then, I can't decrypt any encrypted file. My secret keys are available and when I want to decrypt, it just says that my passphrase is wrong. But, I am SURE about my passphrase !
can't use my keys anymore to decrypt (I can still encrypt with). decrypting the file.
mapping ? Or a problem with charset ?
