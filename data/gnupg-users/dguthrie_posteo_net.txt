@_subject: GPG 2.1.0 Compatibility Metrix(Solaris/Linux/HP Unix) and 
Regarding Illumos derivatives such as the aforementioned OpenIndiana,
Joyent produce pkgsrc binaries for Illumos:
 With this, I was able to
get GnuPG 2.2.4 to work on my box running SmartOS.
I don't know if it would work on Solaris, though. Illumos and modern
Solaris may have diverged quite a bit by now. But at least it might
provide a starting point.
Best wishes,
