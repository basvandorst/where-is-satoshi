Hi all, Does anyone know if GnuPG v1.2.3 on OpenVMS can decrypt files encrypted with
2.6.3i on a PC?  Dave.

Hi, I was under the impression that PGP could use alternate algorithms?    I was hoping to generate a key pair on VMS and pass the public key onto one
of suppliers who uses PGP.  The GnuPG features page mentions that it can
decrypt file encrypted with PGP 5, 6 & 7 so I guess that answers my
question... Hmmm, back to the drawing board. I'm not sure about the POSIX subsystem, is it relevant? -----Original Message-----

It won't be able to do this because PGP uses IDEA which is a patented
algorithm and distribution of gnupg with IDEA support is not allowed.
I presume that GnuPG runs in the POSIX subsytem of VMS, right?

Hello Johan, Thanks for your response.  I'm interested to read that PGP2 can use RSA as
well as IDEA.  The people at the other end of this project are saying
(without too much conviction) that they can ONLY use IDEA. I cannot rebuild GnuPG on VMS as I don't have a C compiler and don't have
the time at present to install Gnu C. -----Original Message-----

pgp 2.6.3i uses only IDEA and RSA. However, there exist pgp 2 versions that
support other algorithms. Such a version is pgp263iamulti-06. Because the
author died in a tragical accident I'm not sure if it can be easily found on
the net, but I can mail it to you if you like.
That said, there exist an IDEA extension module for GnuPG which solves the
problem too. If you can compile that module on your system, or recompile
GnuPG with idea.c copied into the cipher/ directory, it will work with
pgp 2.6.3i encrypted messages and vice versa.

Hi Werner, Thanks for your response.  Reading on the net it seems like PGP has had an
interesting history and this would account for the disparate versions.  I've now taken a slightly different approach.  I've created a new key pair
using PGP 8.1 and then imported both into my GnuPG keyring on VMS - all
works fine.  Just need the supplier to try importing my new 8.1 public key
into their 2.6.3 keyring... -----Original Message-----

PGP >=5 can.  PGG 2 is hardwired to MD5, RSA and IDEA.  There is an
inofficial 2.6 version my disastry which allows for most of the
OpenPGP algorithms.
PGP >= 6.5.8 (or was it 6.5.3?) works fine althought it is not OpenPGP
No.  I was just wondering how it is possible to build GnuPG on plain

Hello all, OpenVMS 7.3-2 GnuPG 1.2.3
Another question :-) Can I make the GnuPG home directory & therefore the pubring & secring the
same for all users? At present my key rings are created in a subdirectory from my root directory
Directory TD1:[GRAYD.GNUPG]
And for another user... Directory TD1:[APP_SUPPORT.GNUPG]
The only documentation I can find on the --homedir command is for when
listing the key rings... Thanks in advance.

Hi Mark, Thanks for the clarification even if it's not good news.  I guess the only
thing I can get them to do is upgrade to a newer version of PGP or use a
modified version.  Dave. -----Original Message-----

Hello David,
Well, RSA is the asymmetrical cipher that PGP2 uses, IDEA is the
symmetrical one. Doing a "normal" encryption, both are used: RSA for
encrypting the symmetrical IDEA-key (which is used to encrypt the
actual message).
So you can't encrypt a message using RSA only. (Theoretically it's
possible of course, but PGP won't do that - IIRC).
They are right, as long as they are not using a (earlier by others
mentioned) modified Version of PGP.

Hello John, Thanks for that.  There's no mention of that logical name in the VMS help
file but I'll give it a try.  The reason for one shared key ring is that the encrypt/decrypt job will
normally be run under the overnight batch account but in the event of a
failure support staff need to re-run jobs under their own accounts.  The key
ring should be the same for all. Yeah I know, there are a lot of VMS Privs to remember.  All the accounts
that use this process are system type accounts.
Hash: SHA1
Well, not sure of the implementation on VMS, but try setting GNUPGHOME
DEFINE/SYS GNUPGHOME TD1:[.GNUPG]
Of course, You'll need sysprv in order to do that
Is there a good reason for wanting ALL users to use the same keyrings?

Can use --homedir for all commands supported by gnupg!

The expert mode of PGP8.1 new key generation lists RSA, RSA-Legacy or
Diffie-Hellman/DSS as key types.  If I create a key using RSA on PGP8.1 and
import into GnuPG then exchange it with a site using PGP8.x this works
fine... am I missing something?   There's quite a lot more to this than first meets the eye :-) PS - Is this a text only list-serv? -----Original Message-----

That won't work. With some work you can import the key if it's an v3 RSA key
not larger than 2048 bits (don't use idea for key encryption then or you
won't be able to import the secret key). I don't know if pgp 8.1 creates v3
RSA keys, pgp 2.x can't import v4 keys. GnuPG can't create them without a
patch (so without a recompile).
However, the messages encrypted with pgp 2.6.3i to such a key will still use
the IDEA symmetric algorithm.
If you want to communicate with users of unpatched pgp 2.x versions, you'll
really need to get IDEA integrated in GnuPG. On win32 a dll is sufficient,
but I don't know if the dynamic loading of algorithms works on VMS. If it
does, compiling the module and adding a line in gpg.conf will suffice.
Otherwise, you'll have to recompile.
