Trying to install gnupg on fedora 25 - downloaded all necessary prerequisites and installed them.
I get an error message when running gpg2 from command line.
gpg: Fatal: libgcrypt is too old (need 1.7.0, have 1.6.6)
I installed libgcrypt 1.7.7 on this machine but it reverts to the distro installation of 1.6.6
How do I enable version 1.7.7 on this machine
Thank you for your time in this matter

Thank you for this - I found libgcrypt version 1.7.7 at /usr/local/bin
which is not in my class path.
I will update my system to include the path or run with it on the
command line or both but at any
rate this solution will work for me.
