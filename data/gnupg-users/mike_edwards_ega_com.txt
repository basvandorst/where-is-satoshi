There was some subscription snafu with this list and I was wondering if it was just very low traffic!  I checked out the archives yesterday and saw that my post had been answered.  Thanks to everyone that helped me out.  I guess I have only scratched the surface using gpg and it was helpful to get a better understanding of what can/should be done--in a way that a man page can't.
atom: Our customers are using PGP because of the HIPPA laws and their customers' privacy concerns in general.  Some make us use laborious methods such as DHL electronic file shipping and the like, but we prefer to get encrypted files over FTP.  Really allows for easier automation.
Thanks again!

Hi!  I have a public key that I share with our customers and the secret is on my keyring.  I have another person in my department that needs to be able to decrypt files sent by our customers that have been encoded with my public key.  IOW, we want a single public key with either a shared secret or separate secret keys for the same public key.  Are either scenarios possible?
