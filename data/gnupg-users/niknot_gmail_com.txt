I used libTomCrypt (cf.:  to implement something
similar. The data viewer executable contains (somewhat concealed)
private key, and data sets are encrypted using the public key of the
pair. (LibTomCrypt is much more flexible and easier to program against
than Libgcrypt when you are building your own applications that have
nthing to do with PGP). Piping data through GPG is not a solution that
our users would appreciate.

Unfortunately, the whole GPG, with WebOfTrust construct, makes the
assumption that there is no need whatsoever to protect the identity of
the secret key holder (and, by extension, that traffic analysis - as
opposed to the secret content analysis - is not something to be
concerned with).

(Its not clear (to me) from the above what was "the bozo" saying: that
the certificates _are_ or _are not_ a privacy violation?)
I find it very interesting that Phil Zimmemann, who invented WOT,
apparently realizes that times are changing, and that WOT has
outlived its usefullness; specifically because - unlike perhaps at
the time of birth of PGP - trafic analysis is a threat that may be
naively ignored only in geek kindergartens, but not in the real life.

If the system was designed for the real world, the encrypted message
would, by default, consist of a binary data set, indistingushable from a
random stream, until and unless decrypted using the recipient's private key.

The attacker performing large-scale traffic uses his own software that
is - so it must be presumed - capable of distilling all (to him)
usefull information from the flow of messages. Consequently, the
question should not be what pgpdump will or will not produce, the
question should be what information is or is not contained in the
message previous to its decryption.

Thanks Werner - we agree on the OpenPGP design. I'm only trying to
point out that this is a serious limitation, more so now than at the
time PGP was born (or OpenPGP was designed).

Isn't this the case where symmetric encryption would be a perfectly
adequate solution?

I am trying to understand your threat model:
If the attacker has access only to the channel but not to the two
communicating devices, a simpler, symmetrical-cipher-only solution
would suffice. If, on the other hand, the attacher has access to
either device, isn't it reasonable to assume he'd be able to pry the
decryption (private) key and decrypt the data (flowing in at least one
