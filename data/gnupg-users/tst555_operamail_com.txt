@_subject: Preferences 
Hello, I have some questions about the preferences list in gpg. Lets say for example, I set preferences in gnupg1.07 through edit-key to S10 h3 h2 z2 z1. i update them using updpref, now i do a pref on the same key but now it has a [mdc] at the end of the list. Is that supposed to happen? Another thing, when I do a showpref on same key, 3DES shows up on the key when I did not specify it in the preferences list. I only specified S10. Any ideas why this is happening?
