@_subject: Problems encrypting binary with GnuPGMe 
Hi everyone,
    I was wondering if anyone has come across problems encrypting binary with GnuPGME?  My app is using GnuPGME to PGP-Inline encrypt MIME; however, my app is having problems with encrypting binary file attachments, after they have been base64 decoded.  My app using the GnuPGME function gpgme_op_encrypt to encrypt; the function mentions that is accepts plaintext (nothing mentioned about binary data), so I maybe out of luck here.  I just wanted to see if anybody has any

Despite the plethora of responses I received, I was able to solve the problem.  FYI, GnuPGME can encrypt binary files just fine.

@_subject: Problems finding keyring with GnuPGME 
Hi everyone,
    I created a Linux application that uses GnuPGME.  The app is started by a server process, and as a result is having troubles accessing PGP keyrings.  This is probably a permissions thing, as I installed GnuPG as the root user; the API (GnuPGME) is probably looking for the keyring at FYI, if I run my app as root on the command line, everything works fine; however, I need to start this process with a server. I am currently looking at three options: 1) update the GnuPGME keyring functions that I use to allow me to specify arbitrary keyrings of my choice, 2) investigate what user process is running my app, and create a home directory for it with keyrings and all, or 3)investigate if there is some undocumented function  in GnuPGME that I can use to help me specify the keyring of my choice.
Any help/advice provided by anyone would be greatly appreciated.

I recommend backing up your public and private keyring files "pubring.gpg" and "secring.gpg" located in your gpg home directory.  If your server crashes, simply obain gpg, install, and place your keyring backup files in the gpg home directory, and everything should be cool.

@_subject: Encrypting for a user who has a IDEA public key 
Hi everyone,
    I created a PGP keypair using a PGPCorp desktop client, where the key used the IDEA cipher.  I then exported the public cert, and successfully imported it into GnuPG.  I then was able to encrypt a message for the PGPCorp user, and the PGPCorp user was able to decrypt the message with their private key.  Is this expected behaviour of GnuPG?  I thought GnuPG does not support the IDEA algorithm in any form.  Could someone please shed some light on this?

One more question...how do you find out what the list of preferred algorithms are for a public key imported into GnuPG?

@_subject: How secure are GnuPG private keys stored? 
Hi everyone,
    I was wondering if anybody knew how securely the GnuPG private keys are stored?  Are they stored as encrypted flat files?
