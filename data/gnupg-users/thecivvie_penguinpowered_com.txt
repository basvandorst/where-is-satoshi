@_subject: New UK crypto law and an idea on how to defeat it 
Hi Rodrigo!
No it makes no mention of who it would be targetted towards. But as has been
said in a previous reply, the police would and do believe that anyone using
any form of encryption have something to hide.
It is a matter of educating the people in power that the average person who
uses any form of encryption has nothing to hide. I personnaly would welcome
any visit from any law enforcement agency to show that I have nothing to
hide. Even my choice of NG's would show.

Hi Lars!
I always use pgp5.ai.mit.edu as my Key server. Never had a connection problem.

Hi Lars!
I could never get a connection to any of the European ones. So I gave up and
moved across the water. I also did a traceroute on the ones that I could
connect to and mit was the closest at the time.
