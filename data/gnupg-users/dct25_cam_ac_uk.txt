Have done.  Thanks to Ingo and yourself for all the help. Once again the
strengths of an OS community become apparent :-)

Hash: SHA1
Apologies for the earlier blank email - a cock up on the signing front.
What I was trying to say was, suppose I am normally in contact with
someone only by email.  We happen to meet, and although I have my key
fingerprint with me, he does not.  Is there a secure way of him sending me
his fingerprint by email once he knows that my key is mine?
For example, if we were to organise a password at the meeting, then he
goes home and sends me an encrypted email containing the password and his
fingerprint, even if an interceptor spotted he had sent a mail entitled
"My Fingerprint" he wouldn't be able to spoof that mail because he
wouldn't know the password.
Or is it just a Bad Thing to accept fingerprints through any digital

The situation was less hypothetical than I had made out.  We met at a jazz
club, where there is a distinct lack of linux boxes (something I'm trying
to change by using one as a spectrum analyser, but that's another
story...)  I had my fingerprint on my palmtop, and can remember enough of
it to know that it hasn't been tampered with, so gave it to him.  Since he
managed to tell me what his first round was, what software he gave me,
what CDs I had with me, how far through Linux From Scratch I was *and*
what his fingerprint was, all correctly, in an encrypted message, I
deduced that the message has not been tampered with.  Similar protocol,
but the random secret was generated in a slightly non-standard way.
It's good to get confirmation from the experts, though :-)

@_subject: getting keys from keyserver whithout knowing the ID 
Hash: SHA1
The two keyservers I use are:
 provides a user-friendly front end on the web -
you can search for names/email addresses and it gives the results as a
list of names, email addresses, certificates etc. However, I have had some
difficulty uploading (and occasionally downloading) keys from here so I
normally rely on copy-and-paste from my browser.
 allows you to search their keyring, but returns the
results as a list of PGP keyblocks which isn't much good if you're not
sure exactly who you're looking for.
There are other keyservers out there, these are just the first two I came
across and bookmarked, and until they let me down I'll not bother finding
any others.
Alternatively, you could email your correspondent and ask them for their
key ID (or their key) before starting to exchange sensitive information.
Ask the experts re: getting GnuPG to search for keys.  IMO it's not really
Ditto about this answer :-)

Whilst there are many better ways to integrate GnuPG into your system than
that, the answer to the question you asked is "Ctrl-D".

[Disclaimer:  This brainwave was brought to you by someone who doesn't
know better :-)]
Scripts exist (for Pine at least) which save your passphrase to a file for
a session so you only have to type it once.  Whilst this is very
convenient, it strikes me as a security problem, although I cannot really
assess how much of a problem since it requires a deeper knowledge of
things than I possess.  Maybe Pine session IDs are not too hard to
predict.  Whatever the hole, something feels wrong about trusting a MUA
for good cryptographic practice.
So, my idea is to provide this idea of a `session' in a better way by
separating it from whatever agent (MUA, shell etc.) you are using, and
placing it in a daemon (gpgd?) which, say, receives the passphrase at the
start of a session, and stores it in secure memory ready to dole out to
whatever needs it until the session ends.
How much less secure is this?  It is already possible to compromise keys
with root priveleges, so the only cases of interest are from non-root
* Could they intercept the passphrase between calling agent and daemon? My
limited knowledge of Linux would say no.
* Could they make it dump core and rip the passphrase from that? If it
dumped core, the passphrase would be readily available.  In a perfect
world, programs don't dump core. In reality, care would be needed to
prevent this.
* Could they trick the daemon into giving them the passphrase? My idea
here is to nominate {Pine, bash, ...} when starting the session, and then
only to allow children of that nominated process access to the passphrase,
and end the session when the process dies or after a timeout.
This is the key - (a) can that be done and (b) can it be fooled?  Is there
a Better Way?  Have I just descibed an existing product?  Or am I talking
the sort of drivel that can only be produced after a whole day of
mind-numbingly hard mathematics?
Answers on a postcard...

Or something similar.  There is even a vulnerability in OpenPGP that if
you can replace a secret key temporarily then intercept a badly-signed
message, you can get the true secret key.  But that involves actually
mucking around with cryptography; my method of choice would be to replace
the gpg binary.
Didn't know this.  How?  (Reply directly if this is too OT for the list)
... unencrypted, in memory!
Anyway, I'm off to practise my paranoia some more :-)
