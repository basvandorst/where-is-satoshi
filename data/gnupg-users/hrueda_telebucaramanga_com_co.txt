@_subject: Encryption takes 20 seconds !! 
I'm trying to encrypt a file with only 1 line (no more than 100 characters) with the following command:
echo mypassphrase | gpg -a -se --passphrase-fd 0 --yes --force-v3-sigs -u 5509C4C5 --always-trust -r 39A83377 --output q.gpg q
and it takes 18-20 seconds to finish.  GPG was installed on a Sun machine with Solaris environment on it.
What could be the reason?
