@_subject: Signing a key (meaning) 
Hi everybody out there,
I put some thoughts on the meaning of signing a key and came to an
unusual definition. Maybe someone likes to discuss it with me, since
I'm not quite sure whether I should recommend others to interpret
signing that way.
Definition: Signing a key means saying: "I confirm the full name in
the key's ID is the keyowner's right name. The email address in the ID
is the one the keyowner put there, but I cannot guarantee it's
Here are the reasons why I think this definition is handy:
1. Assumption: Only the keyowner possesses the private key.
2. Assumption: The person I do the fingerprint-check with wants to
receive a message from me. 1. Assumption and 2. Assumption =>
1. Conclusion: The person I do the fingerprint-check with sends me
her/his own public key.
1. Assumption and 2. Assumption =>
2. Conclusion: The person I do the fingerprint-check put an email
address in the public key's ID to which she/he has access. (we know
that without taking a look at the email address AT ALL.)
3. Conclusion: If signing a key has the meaning as stated above, no
information will be revealed to persons, who were not intented as
"3. Conclusion" is true, because there are only to possible cases:
1. Case: The person I do the fingerprint-check with puts his/her RIGHT email address in the key's ID.
I don't check the email address, but the Name in the ID and sign the key. --> No problems.
2. Case; The person I do the fingerprint-check with (let's call him Peter Hansen) doesn't put his, but Anna's email address (anna at web.com)
in the key's ID, because he managed to get access to it (attack). I don't check the email address, but the Name in the ID and sign the key. The ID is now: "Peter Hansen anna at web.com".
Let's say Marie somehow get's this signed key. There are again two cases:
2.1 Case: Marie wants to send Anna a message. Although she recognizes Anna's email address and my signature, she will not use the key, because there's
"Peter Hansen" written in the ID. --> No problem.
2.2 Case Marie wants to send Peter Hansen an encrypted email. Then she will use the key and send it to anna at web.de and Peter will even receive it, since he has access. --> No real problem. 2.2 Remark: If Peter just made a mistake when typing the email address, he will not be able to access the message.
But that's his own fault, not mine. I'm grateful for answers.
Take care,

@_subject: Signing a key (meaning) 
Thanks everybody for all the answers. The reason I asked this quetion is that I wonder how I can check whether the email address in the ID realy belongs to the keyowner. Let's say I've been knowing Peter Hansen for quite some time, but I don't know his email address. Now he tells me it's funny1982 at hot.com and sends me his public key with the ID "Peter Hansen funny1982 at hot.com". I'd like to sign that key after having made a fingerprint check with him on the phone. How can I make sure it's not someone elses address he illegaly has access to? The only possible answer is to wait a year or something and have email contact with him and see whether nothing suspicious happens. If nothing suspicious happens, I'd believe it's really his address. But I don't want to wait a year with signing and why is it of importance to check whether it's really his address at all? If the address belongs to Anna, and Marie sends an encrypted messages to funny1982 at hot.com intented only for Peter to read, Anna will not be able to read the message. If Marie intends to send a message to Anna, she will not use the key, because it's "Peter Hansen" written in the ID. She will just ignore my signature. In one of the relpies I got, Kevin said there might be a problem: In reality, Marie needs to download Anna's key from a server, if she really wants to send encrypted messages to Anna. Let's say she searches for funny1982 at hot.com. Then the following list appears:
ID: "Anna Hoffman funny1982 at hot.com"
ID: "Peter Hansen funny1982 at hot.com" (signed by me). If she is aware of security issues, she'll only download "Anna Hoffman funny1982 at hot.com", so there will be no problems. I wonder what happens, if she has both keys on her computer. I bet the standard software described above will ask her which key to use. What do you think? Finally I don't see a practial way to really check the email address, so I think it's best if we are honest and say Marie is responsible for checking the name in the users ID before she uses/downloads it and the keyowner is responsible for putting an email address in the ID he has access to. What do you think?
Take care,

I think so, but WHAT benefit (concerning the identity) do you have from knowing that the person who owns the private key *has access* to the email address mentioned in that key ID? Remember that we do the whole fingerprint checking, because we believe it might very well be there's a man in the middle or that an attacker has access to the email address.
I think there's no benefit, because everybody who issueses a key (even an attacker) wants to receive information encrypted with that key, - otherwise he wouldn't issue it. Thus he will place an email address in the ID he has access to. So I think we can take this for granted.
The reason why the email address is in the user ID is for convenience (so everybody knows where to send emails) and makes sure keys can be easily found on the keyserver. Apart from that it enables user to distinguished between keys of persons with the same name.
Thanks for answers,

If someone somehow gets that key, reads your name in the ID and relies on that name he might sent mail intented for you to the attacker's email address, that might even pretty much look like yours email address. Yes, but the fingerprint check already protects against that, so why do we need another check?
What do you mean with critical? "John Smith " is quite global and quite unique, although I don't check the email address before signing. 1. John tells me john at hot.com. 2. I believe him he has access to john at hot.com (see former email).
3. I find keys on the server by looking for john at hot.com.
4. I choose "John Smith ", because I know his name. 5. I make a fingerprint check on the phone (I know his voice). 6. I sign the key. 7. I upload the signed key to the keyserver.
If there is a clever attacker he might issue a key with the very same ID. People then looking for John's key will be presented the following list:
"John Smith " (signed by me)
"John Smith " If they don't know me they can simply do their own fingerprintcheck with John, otherwise they will take the signed key.
Thanks for your answers, I know I'm asking unorthodox questions, but I pretty much feel I'm right and the conventional procedure is partly unnecessary and thus hard to understand and difficult to use. Best regards,

You are right, there's actually no direct connection, sorry. I was thinking about a friend who sends me his key via email. Because I don't want to rely on the fact he is the only one who has access to his email account and there might be a "man in the middle", too, I do the fingerprint check on the phone. But my ponit is as follows:
One reason we use GnuPG for is we think it is significant likeky there's a "man in the middle attack" or someone has access to email accounts he should not have. Given that, what benefit does one take from knowing my communication partner has access to a certain email account?

does a signed key contain the signer's user ID or only his key ID? Do
you need to posses the signer's public key to see where he is the
signer of a signed key? My gpg works that way, but I wonder whether it
simply suppresses the display of the signer's user ID, if I don't

@_subject: Is self-signing necessary? Basic questions. 
I everybody, I tried to understand some of the concepts of GnuPG and would be grateful for you to give me a feedback, whether I understood things right. I'm especially interested in the concept of self-signed keys. My key type is "RSA and RSA (PGP)". Here is what I understood:
My pulic key consists of the following:
public master signing key (pub),
public subordinate keys (sub),
User IDs.
Are the key IDs newly calculated every time GnuPG runs or are they members of the public key like the user IDs, too?
Is the public master signing key ONLY used for signing and the public subordinate key ONLY used for enryption?
Is the fingerprint of my public key ONLY the fingerprint of my public master signing key?
When signing another key, what I do is to ONLY sign the other person's public master signing key with my own private master signing key. I don't sign a certain user ID or something. Is that right? (see the next two points)
A self-singed public key, is a public key, who's following components are singed by the private master signing key, belonging to the same key pair:
public subordinate keys (sub),
User IDs,
(key IDs?).
Because the public key is self-signed, it is OK, to only sign the public master key when signing a key. It is OK, because this key signed the user IDs. But if that's so, don't I sign ALL user IDs (if there are several) of that public key by signing the public master singing key?
Does GnuPG demand, that a public key must be self-signed, otherwise it's "no key" at all? Are keys checked automatically by GnuPG to be self-signed?
Can signatures be removed from a key again? What about removing self-signatures, changing suboridinate encryption keys and user IDs? Is that possible/easy? Thanks for the answers,

@_subject: Fingerprint useless if not self-signed key? 
Hi everybody, and thanks for the answers so far!
I'm goint to write an introduction to GnuPG/PGP and therefor I'm trying to understand some concepts. Especially I wonder what I'll tell people about the meaning of the fingerprint. From my point of view a fingerprint-check is useless, if the key is not self-signed (explanation at the end of the email). Thus I wonder whether I shall advise people to check whether the key is self-signed, too. Checking wether a key is self-signed would not be necessary, if gnuPG didn't accept a key that isn't self-singed in ANY CASE. Especially, if GnuPG didn't accept a key with a missing self-signature on the subordinate public encrytion key in ANY CASE. In my first email (Subject: "Is self-signing necessary? Basic questions.") I asked:
And thankfully David Shaw answerd:
Thus the answer to the question, whether one needs to check whether the key is self-signed is conneced with the word "override". What did he mean with that? Changing the source code of my version of gnuPG on my hard disk and recompiling or changing some sort of configuration file on my hard disk? If that's the case, then I don't need to advise people to check whether a key is self-signed, because an attacker needes access to my hard disk to override the self-sign-check. But if he already has access to my hard disk, he can as well to worse things like installing a keylogger or something. Thus in this case I'm beaten already, isn't that so?
Are there any other GnuPG/PGP versions, that don't check whether a key is self-signed by default?
I tried to test wether GnuPG accepts to encrypt with a public key, where the self-signatre is missing only at the public subordinate encryption key. But I wasn't able to remove it only at that key and leave the user ID self-signed. All I was able to do is the following. Does anybody know how to do it so I can test?
The fingerprint is a hash value of the public master signing key only, NOT of the public subordinate encryption key. Only if that public subordinate encryption key is self-signed, I can be sure the owner of the private key wanted it to belong to his public key. Otherwise it might have been placed there by an attacker. I'm grateful for answers,

Sorry, I don't understand what you mean. Could you please explain it again? Let's say Alice signs Bob's user ID together with Bob's public master signing key. What does "together" mean in this context? Does it mean, that the public signing key and the user ID are both signed with Alice's private key, but seperately? Is a signature on Bob's user ID only accepted, if Bob has the same signature on his public master signing key? Is the last procedure really called "self-signing". Alice cannot self-sign Bob's key, as she doesn't have his private key. I'd be grafeful for answers,

Hi everybody,
I have a question about the meaning of signing, I'd be happy if someone checked whether my understanding is write:
When signing a public key's user ID, the statement I'm making is: "I believe that this key belongs to the person described by the name and the comment in the user ID." It's not necessary to make statements about the validity of the email adress, since if my former statement is true, the person with the name from the usr ID is the only one with the private key. Why should he/she ask someone to send encrypted messages to him/her where he/she can't receive them? And if so, - no harm is caused, since only he/she can decrypt them.

How long would it take to execute a successful brute force attack on a pasphrase consisting of 12 symbols (symbols available on common keyboards)? If the attacker only got the passphrase and not the private key, I can simply change the passphrase to be secure again. Right? So I'd say my key is compromised if I think an attacker got BOTH, the passphrase AND the key.

@_subject: private key protection 
Hi everybody,
what is the best way to protect your private key from getting stolen?
I think:
1. Using gnupg on a windows PC with internet connection is not good, because there are too many trojans out there. 2. Using gnupg on a linux PC with internet connection (like privatix, see  ) is better since there are fewer(?) security holes and trojans out there. How big do you think is the thread? 3. The best way is to have one PC connected to the internet and another, without an internet connection (missing network drivers and a fully encrypted hard disk for instance), which you use to decrypt and encrypt messages. You use an USB stick to carry messages from the internet PC to the one not connected to the net. If you don't have two PCs, you can use another USB stick with privatix without network drivers on it. Which software can I use under point 3 to put my messages in order (date, sender, etc.) on a linux system?
Most people use something like point 2, don't they?
Point 3 is the only satisfying to me, since I find it hard to judge the the thread in point 2. Additionally point 3 makes it easier to see when your key might have been stolen: If you see traces that someone broke into your house and searched everything for the hidden privatix USB stick. Only experts might notice a trojan under point 2. Thanks for answers,

that logs my keystrokes (my password) and can send data (my key)
via  internet  to  an attacker. How is access restricted to the key by

Since  the PC is "isolated" from the net, I don't need to be afraid of

@_subject: Why trust gpg4win? 
Thanks to everyone for the vivid discussion.
 Thanks for your text at
I agree with you and think we won't get rid of this "lazyness". We will not be able to change the fact, that most people use an insecure Windows or Mac OS, neither. GIVEN THAT, can we provide a way of secure communication for the majority of the people? This is what I want, since many of my friends are no computer experts and will never be.
It seems quite easy to advice people to have an offline windows PC with gpg4win on it and all their private stuff and a windows(?) online PC next to it. They could transfer encrypted messages with an USB stick from one PC to the other. I think this is a vector for an attacker, but how serious is this problem? An attacker only seems to have a chance if he has a contract with microsoft and windows secretly copies the private key, password or even any decrypted "word file" on any USB stick. Could such a thing be spotted or There's another problem with the offline/online approach: convenience: Since you would transfer the messages in plain text on the USB stick, you would have to order them on the offline PC. You wouldn't have thunderbird there to do this for you.
Another general problem is that you encrypt YOUR messages with another persons public key and have to rely on this person that he protecs this private key well. I think it is necessary that you know how he keeps his private key (offline PC/online PC). I think everybody should note that in his key ID. Do you agree? So if you communicate with someone who stores his key on an online windows PC, it is not worth the effort to store your key on an offline PC and to refrain from thunderbird doing the ordering for you. A "solution" might be to offer your communication partner two kind of punlic keys: An "offline key" he should use if he has an "offline key", too, and an "online key" he should use if he also uses an "online key". Maybe this is not satisfactory but somehow fair and might encourage people to get offline There's a lot more I have to say, but this has to wait now.

on SHA1 sums of gnupg software are published and it is said:

Which mailing lists are meant? Can't emails be tempered, too? If I've just downloaded gnupg and if I'm not on any mailing list, what can I do? I feel it would be nice to add the following lines to the descrition on the homepage:
"The authors of gnupg keep an offline copy of the SHA1 sums of their programs and try to compare them with the SHA1 sums presented here every week. Thus, if you have been comparing your SHA 1 sum with the one on the homepage for several days and they matched every time, you can be rather sure your version of gnupg has not been tampered."
My question now is: Does such a check realy take place and if so, how often is it preformed?
Further I feel the following lines should be added to the homepage, especialy because it might be useful for windows users:

Thanks for the answers.
I did a google search for the subject of your email, in which you announced the new version, i.e. for "[Announce] GnuPg 2.0.20 released" (without quotation marks)  and got 4 results:
I agree with you, that its unlikely an attacker tampers them all, - still, its just 4 webpages...
I think next to the download link of a gnupg version on gnupg.org you should also note the subject of the email, in which this version was announced, so people can search for it more easily. Such a notice could also be added to

What do you think?
I'm thinking of someone how uses windows and wants to install gnupg for the first time. How can he/she rely on OpenPGP? I would have to check the signature with the (possibly tampered) gnupg version he just downloaded. I'm afraid such a person needs to rely on the SHA1 sum and the only thing he can do is to compare his SHA1 sum with as many sources as possible. Which other sources are there? Does the C't publish SHA1 codes? Is it perhaps a good idea to first download an older version of gnupg for which more sources are I still have to check whether there are enough sources for windows users. Do you know some?

Thanks for pointing out to me, that MS colaborates with secret services. I searched the web and learned that Outlook.com, Skype and Skydrive are not Further, I learned that it is likely that MS had installed a backdoor for the NSA in Windows 95:
Do you know about backdoors in newer versions of windows? Anyway, I agree that free software is more trustworthy than proprietary software, which is not open source. Despite that I agree with Werner Koch who wrote here
that it is impossible for a single person to check the entire code that runs on a PC, even if it is open source. Especially this is not possible for the average user, since he is not a programer. The average user uses Windows, whether I like it or not. My comunication partners are average users and I which they were able to use gnupg in a save way, - at least they should know about the risk they are taking. That's why I want to produce a free youtube video which tells windows users how to use gunpg savely/criticaly.
It seems to me the safest way is to have one online PC for surfing and an offline PC on which gpg4win is installed. This way the operation system doesn't really matter, - do you agree? If a person posses only one PC, he must live with higher risk, but then he should not in his key-ID that his privte key is stored on an online PC. This way people who send him mail will know their risk.
Still I wonder whether there are many sources for SHA1 sums of gpg4win, that could be used by a windows user to test the integrity of his download (C't ?). Are the SHA1 sums of gpg4win presented on the download site checked regularly by their authors?

Imagine an intact offline PC without "auto play" enabled for USB drives. Now an USB drive is plugged in with an encrypted file on it. The file is decrypted with gnupg and turns out to be a jpg file. Let's assume it contains maleware. Even in this case, the offline PC is not infected yet(?). Next we would want to view the jpg picture using a secure small tool which is so simple that it does not evoke the maleware contained in the file. If there is such a tool the offline PC is still intact. No information or private key could secretly be copied on an USB drive which we plug in the offline PC. Thus no such information could be transfered to the online PC, no matter how infected the online PC is. The point is perhaps to only view files of simple formats on the offline PC, like(?) jpg files. Word files seem too dangerous for me for example, since they can contain scripts. Are my thoughts correct?
The simple file formats I'm thinking of are plain text, jpg, RTF, a simple spread sheetformat (which?), pdf, mp3. Are there any secure tools for those types? Jasper den Ouden (22.08.2013 20:22) asked for a "pdf tool for extra security" in a similar context.
It also might be a good idea to have a program which checks whether the considered file is for instance a "normal" jpg file according to the jpg definition. If it is not we could avoid loading it in a jpg tool. Are there such programs under linux?
My problem with smartcards is that they protect the private key but not the sensitive data I'm keeping on my offline PC, since once in a while I need to decrypt it in order to work with it. Nevertheless an attacker would certainly first try to steel the private key out of the offline PC, so smatcards are a good additional defense.

How could I implement a flash device? Do you mean I need to take some existing USB device created by AVR and replace its firmware by LUFA or something like that? Could I use that modified USB device on every PC or operation system?
Kind regards,

Maybe Pete meant such an USB-to-Serial interface
 ?
Nevertheless this seems quite tricky to handel. Is it better to use a CD-RW to transfer data between an offline and an online PC than to use an ordinary USB stick?
Which other medium might be good?
Kind regards,

Hello everybody,
thank you for the many answers. Actually this thread should have been called "Save use of gnuPG for everybody". From what I've learned here so far I come to the following conclusions:
1. It should be to hard for the average user to configure windows such that it is a secure system. Hence a linux/unix distribution which is trustworthy, easy to use and very secure is needed. To me debian seems like a good choice because it seems to be watched by many people and runs on almost any PC.
2.1 Most people have only one PC and windows as operating system, so the linux/unix distribution should be installed on an USB device. This device must not be plugged into the PC if windows is running, in order to avoid a manipulation. Further I would uninstall the network drivers on the USB device, so it is almost an offline PC. If the user receives an encrypted file via email, he saves it to hard disk. Then he turns off the PC, plugs in the USB drive and boots off it. He copies the file from the hard disk to the USB drive (this should cause no trouble). Only if the file is of a simple file format (jpg, RTF, mp3, PDF(?), etc.(?)) he accepts it and opens it with a secure minimalistic tool. He might even first run a program like an anti virus software(?) in order to check whether the structure of the file agrees with the official definition of the sated file format.
2.2 If the user has two PCs, he might install the linux/unix distribution on his offline PC. Files would be transferred between the two PCs by means of CD-RWs(?), not by means of insecure USB devices. Auto-Play for CDs would be Do you see any reasonable attack vectors? What do you think?
Kind regards,

My "security perimeter" should be "equal" to the maximum of the "security perimeters" of my usual communication partners. That is so because with their private key they protect my mail and with my private key I protect their mail. What is "usual" is not always easy to determine. Lets say I'm looking for the maximum of security an average user can achieve with common hardware. This user is willing to do some inconvenient things like reboot, burn CDs or wait.
Generally I distrust certain hardware like smartcards or HSMs because they are main targets for secret services, who have a lot of money. Recently I red about this intersting (English/German) article on FBI backdoors in openBSB and scmartcards:
It should be possible to create a rather secure system using "norml technoligies" (CDs, offline PCs etc.) which are harder to target by secret services. If you manage to have a rather secure file transfer between an online and an offline PC, the only security relevant technology you need to focus on is gnuPG itself. Some people read the source code to check its integrity but are there people who focus on its output? To me this is a very important point. I'm not sure how this could be done in practice, but I was thinking about someone who knows the theory of RSA etc. and who "manually" encrypted a text and would compare that with the output of gnuPG to see whether the two results match. Some other approach might be to compare the output of several versions of gnuPG, PGP etc.. This way you could check whether the information was secretly decrypted with a second "FBI key". This is even possible for someone how is no programer. Do you think checking the output in that way is useful?
Kind regards,
Jan

I'd tell him confidential information, - but I did not intent to protect
me against such a thread by means of gnuPG.
That is a good point. On this list I learned about the existence of some vectors I did not even think of. Thank you for that information. Is there a book on thread models which list widely known attack vectors?
OK, so I'll try to define two thread models.
The setup:
Assume there is a windows PC connected to the internet (online PC) and an USB device with debian on it where the network drives are uninstalled (offline PC). The USB device is only plugged into the machine, if windows is not running. The windows PC has a FAT partition. Encrypted emails/files downloaded with windows are stored there. After reboot the FAT partition is mounted with debian and the emails/files are decrypted. The reverse procedure (answer to the email) runs analogously. Only simple file formats are accepted.
Thread models:
1. There might be a Trojan on the windows machine.
2. There might be a Trojan on the windows machine and someone might steel the USB device from my apartment.
I don't care about hardware key loggers, TEMPEST, cold boot attacks or cameras installed in my apartment. In the second thread model the USB device would have an encrypted root partition. Another scenario is that instead of the USB device there is a real offline PC and file transfer between the two machines happens only via CD-RW or multisession CD-R.
Kind regards,
Jan

There are statistical test with which you can test whether a random number generator produces for instance uniformly distributed numbers. This in connection with the above procedure might make a good output oriented check of gnuPG.
