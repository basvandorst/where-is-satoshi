@_subject: What is the purpose of all files in ~/.gnupg ? 
Hash: SHA1
What is the meaning of the following files:
gpg.conf     : Configuration of the gpg-program (I think)
pubring.gpg  : Stores all public passwords (I think)
pubring.gpg~ : ?
random_seed  : Used to create good random passwords (just a guess)
secring.gpg  : Stores all secret passwords (I think)
trustdb.gpg  : ?
If i would delete gnupg and install it on a other pc then which files do i have to backup ? (i guess i only need secring.gpg)
