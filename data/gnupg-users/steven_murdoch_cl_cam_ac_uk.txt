@_subject: question about zip 
Not as far as I know.
If you encrypted the file using no compression then RAR will not be able to compress it very well (in general encrypted data compresses very poorly).
Also encrypting content that is uncompressed *may* decrease security by a small amount, however there is some discussion as to whether the converse is You would be better encrypting the data with compression turned on then using RAR/Zip etc... to split the file into smaller chunks. This splitting step will not reduce the size significantly but it will split up the data. For the second splitting step you could even turn off compression in the program you are using to save time.
Another option is compressing the file before encrypting it, this may or may not make your file smaller - it depends on the nature of the original file.
Sorry, I don't know.
