@_subject: Compatibility problems between KMail and Mozilla S/MIME signatures 
Hash: SHA1
I've got a inquiry from Nelson Bolyard (now from Sun taking care for
Netscape S/MIME stuff) concerning my bug# 236466
 on Mozilla's bugzilla
(see attached). Apparently, I still cannot authenticate his message (with
gpgsm 1.9.15 on Debian/testing, kleopatra 0.40, dirmngr 0.9.2, and kmail
1.8.1), even though he uses Verisign as his CA and I have imported whole
ca-bundle from OpenSSL and Verising root certs
. See also output of gpgsm
