Hi Frank,
I have not found the -o option to work very well in a Windows environment
(Win2000 and Win98).  Instead I use a redirect at the end of the command
line. For example --export-ownertrust >my_output_file.txt  It works fine
with every GPG command.

Hi Frank,
Only use the redirect sign (>) when you need it to create an output
file.  When you import, the redirect sign (<) is not needed; just
enter the file name(s) after the command.  If you don't give a file
name, it will expect input from the keyboard.

If you don't need to use the redirect sign to force the output, don't
use it.  Some commands work fine without it.
BTW, you don't have to use "worldnet.att.net" as the domain in your
e-mail address, just "att.net" works fine.  That's the address I'm
using for this message.  8^)
