@_subject: Session Key algorithm 
Dear Expert,
I am wondering that which algorithm is used for the session key in GnuPG
I understand the session key is symmetric key and  used for message
encryption, my concern is the compatibility with PGP commercial.
i.e PGP commercial use IDEA but GnuPG does not have it, then message can
not be decrypted with Gnupg??
Have a nice day.

@_subject: Hash algo for Gnupg 
Dear expert,
I understand as below when hash is used at decrypting operation.
passphrase at decrypting operation.
When above my understanding is correct,
could you advice me how to specify the hash algo at generating key pair
and how to change hash algo after generating key pair?

@_subject: not supported algo 
PGP9.6 use SHA256 for selfsign for sub keys but GnuPG1.4.8 does not
support SHA-256 and cause abort.
Could you share any idea how to import such keys which use not supoorted
algo ?
