@_subject: Signing with more than one secret key available 
You do not use, for encryption to each recipient, a different keypair, but
only a public key pertaining to each recipient.
Your secret key that you use to sign messages:
- it can be set by yourself with the option --default-key [name], where
name is the default user ID for signature.
- if this option is not used, the default user ID is the first user ID
found in your secret keyring.
You can find more explanations by typing man gpg in the Terminal, and
perusing the relevant entries.
Hope this helps.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
We (the MacGPG team) are aware of a change in Jaguar that prevents GPG
from running from the command line (in a Terminal session).  This issue
also prevents certain functionality in GPGKeys - functionality that
requires a Terminal session - from working correctly.
Specifically, the path /usr/local/bin is no longer part of the default
environment variables for the system.  Once I have a copy of Jaguar (I'm
going to tonight's release party at the Apple Store in Littleton, CO), I
will hopefully be able to address the issue with a new installer release.
In the meantime, you can still install GPG 1.0.7 using the installer
provided at
  After
installing, however, it will be necessary to add /usr/local/bin to the
$PATH environment variable.  If you are running tcsh (you'll know if you
aren't - it's the default shell), you can add the following line to your
~/.cshrc file using the pico text editor:
set path = ( $path /usr/local/bin );
The more UNIX-savvy out there should be able to add this to a
system-wide configuration file.  From what I've been reading so far,
Jaguar's default location for csh environment files isn't the same.
Happy Hunting!
When I do have an updated installer available, you will be able to run
it and install over the 1.0.7r2 edition without any problems, and it
will fix the problem.
Stay tuned!

 >1. First group of messages returns "BAD signature". What is the best way to find out whose >fault it is (as in famous Russian question)? It is my fault, or it is the fault of my >correspondent?
"Bad signature" means that the hash value of the message that was sent to you,
and that was used by the sender to create the digital signature which he encrypted using his secret key, does not verify when the recipient (you in this case) uses the sender's public key to check that hash value. It means that the message you have received has been altered.
Whose fault is it? It depends of what caused the check of the hash value to fail, and there may be many causes:
- - - a word wrap problem. PGP, for instance wraps message at a certain wrap value, meaning how many columns. If both the e-mail client and PGP use the same value (the same number of columns), the message's format will be altered. Likewise, if the e-mail client is set to wrap at a lesser value than PGP's, carriage returns will be added, and the message will be considered as altered.
So this is the sender's "fault".
- - - text that contains "special characters", like accented letters, etc. ("high ASCII") may cause the signature verification to fail, unless the recipient's e-mail client's character set is utf-8. So, this could be the recipient's "fault". But it could be also the sender's "fault", if his email client's character set is not utf-8. This issue can be very confusing.
- - - there can be other reasons, you should check the documentation, especially considering that I'm not an expert, far from it. What I know about GPG and PGP is totally empirical.
The issue of whether you, the recipient, have signed or not signed the sender's public key in your public keyring does not affect the signature being found BAD or GOOD. This will affect the value of trust you, as owner of the keyring, have assigned to that public key. A signature can verify GOOD, but the key's trust value will be "not valid", or "of unknown validity", if the recipient-owner of the keyring has not assigned a trust value to that key by first signing it with his own secret key, and then defining how he considers the sender of the signed message (the owner of the secret-and-public keys) to be a trusted user.

@_subject: Encrypt a file using a PGP key 
It also should show, under the 'Subkeys' tab, that it has also a subkey. The primary key is used for signing, the subkey is used for encryption.
DH = Diffie Hellman; See: DSS = Digital Signature Standard
DH/DSS keys consist of  a primary key for signing, and a subkey for CAST (Carlisle Adams and Stafford Tavares, of Northern Telecom, Canada) symmetric block cipher with an 8 byte block and a 128-bit key. Other symmetric ciphers used by PGP are
IDEA, Triple-DES and Twofish. As a symmetric block cipher (algorithm), CAST uses the same key for encryption and decryption.
When the owner of that PGP key generated its key pair, he selected CAST as the cipher. He might have selected IDEA, or 3DES, etc.
Not anybody, only the owner of the secret key+passphrase of the key pair that was generated by that owner.
DSS is the standard used for signing with such a key.
CAST, again, is the cipher chosen by the owner when he generated the key.
DH is not a key exchange protocol only, see the information in the above URL (and most probably in many other publications).
Another thing: if PGP were to use the actual key to encrypt a message, it would require too long a time, making the whole process unpractical. PGP generates a one-time random session key, much shorter than the actual key. This session key is used to encrypt the message. Then the session key itself is encrypted with the actual key and the result is embedded in the final encrypted output. At the receiving end, the session key is decrypted, using the secret key+passphrase, and then it is used to decrypt the message As pointed out before, this DH/DSS key is composed of a primary key, and a When you use it to encrypt a message, you are actually using the subkey (with the combination of the random session key, as pointed out above).
DH/DSS keys have been around for many years, and commonly used.
All the information I have supplied above is very sketchy. You would want to peruse the existing documentation (included with any PGP software release, and in many other publications) to have a really accurate overview.
But believe me, DH/DSS keys are perfectly OK. As a matter of fact, when you import into PGP a DSA-Elgamal key generated in gpg, it is identified as DH/DSS by PGP.
Hope this is not too confusing.

Try:  keyserver x-hkp://keyserver.kjsl.com
gpg --recv-keys [key ID]    gpg --search-keys Ingo Kloecker
Probably you hadn't specified any keyserver, because if you really typed:
--keyserver [whatever], the two dashes at the beginning of the line make that entry invalid.
If you didn't type the two dashes, and started correctly the line with:
keyserver   , then  is not, in my opinion, the correct syntax.
It should be, as pointed out before: x-hkp://...etc...
Nothing should happen. I think that after the prompt "Please enter your message", or "gpg: Go ahead and type your message ..." you are supposed to enter the text of a message
I use that method to copy/paste an encrypted message, in order to find out what keys were used to encrypt it.
What happened?
If you had set a keyserver as an option in the gpg.conf file, or typed:
gpg --keyserver [keyserver's name + correct syntax], then the --recv-keys option followed by the argument F661F608 (key ID) you should have obtained a valid output (see further)
I am using Mac OS X, but I believe the platform is not an issue.
To sum up, I think that:
- if you want to set any server as your default server, you should enter its name, using the correct syntax, in a unmarked line in your gpg.conf file, and, for good luck, hit [return] at the end of the server's name, to create an empty line after the line containing the servers's name. e.g.
keyserver x-hkp://keyserver.kjsl.com
- if you want to use, on a one-time basis, a certain server, you should type
gpg --keyserver [keyserver's name/correct syntax] --search-keys [name], or
--recv-keys [key ID].
Actual example:
[---------]% gpg --keyserver x-hkp://keyserver.kjsl.com --search-keys Ingo Kloecker
gpg: searching for "Ingo Kloecker" from HKP server keyserver.kjsl.com

It's best to have a little patience, and wait until the keyserver you uploaded your key to, syncs with other keyservers. Uploading the same key to additional keyservers might be frowned upon, and considered to put an unnecessary load on keyservers in general. I think the best way is to add it in your Options file.
In gpg prior to 1.2.0, it was called ~/.gnupg/options.
In later versions, it is ~/.gpg.conf.
You could open that file, with a text editor, and type one clean line, e.g.:
comment [the text you want to be displayed] then hit return, to create an empty line, save the changes in the text editor, and quit the text editor.
There is a command line that will display, in the Terminal, a list of available keyservers. Unfortunately, I can't remember now what it is, sorry.

The server issue does not depend only, I think, on experienced people that

There can be problems in propagation and sync, but I believe that

I am not a Windows or Mac user.  Could someone please tell me the
way to install and use GPG in these platforms?
If you use GPG in one of those systems, what would you recommend in
to get a "regular user" to start using GPG.  I am
interested in both
installation and daily use.
I know of a group of people who would probably be really interested
GPG.  I want to make it as accessible to them as possible.
Thanks a lot.

@_subject: gpg 1.3.4 doesn't warn that it is an experimental version 
% gpg --version
I get the same results (with the addition of BZIP2 in Compression:).
I have not made any change to the code, except copying idea.c into cipher.
But if you use any other cli, e.g.
gpg  [or]
gpg --list-keys You get, first of all:
gpg: NOTE: THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT VERSION!
gpg: It is only intended for test purposes and should NOT be
gpg: used in a production environment or with production keys!
I can't say wether this is deliberate or an oversight. The Announce e-mail is quite explicit about this version being a development release.

@_subject: Key import - time warp or clock problem 
Have you enabled, at your end, the following two options (quoting from man
 --ignore-time-conflict
The fact that the key shows now subkey might be due to:
- it's a "legacy" key, without subkey.
- because of the possible time problem ("GnuPG normally does not select and
use subkeys created in the future"...).

Re: Key import - time warp or clock
Have you enabled, at your end, the following two options (quoting from
man gpg):
 --ignore-time-conflict
GnuPG  normally  checks  that 
 the   timestamps
associated with keys and signatures have plausi-
         ble 
values.   However,  sometimes 
a signature
seems  to  be  older 
than  the key due to clock
problems.  This option makes these checks just a
warning.    See   also --ignore-valid-from  for
         timestamp
issues on subkeys.
         GnuPG
normally does not select and  use  subkeys
created in  the future.  This option allows the
         use of
such keys and thus exhibits the pre-1.0.7
behaviour.   You  should  not 
use this  option
         unless
you there is  some  clock  problem.   See
         also
--ignore-time-conflict for timestamp issues
         with

Hola Marcelo,
- downloaded your key 796807F2493DB4285FBB8EFE9457553506482714, at first attempt,  from pgp.uni-mainz.de. As expected, it didnt' contain an image - downloaded again from sks.keyserver.penguin.de, this time complete with image file:

Your key was correctly and fully uploaded to the servers.

Please see D. Shaw's draft memo:

I am testing Enigmail with Thunderbird for Mac OS X. There is no
separate setting for keyservers. Enigmail is configured to use GnuPG by
entering in its Preferences GnuPG Executable Path. Therefore the
keyserver must be set in GnuPG's gpg.conf file, and Enigmail will behave
accordingly. BTW, it works great.
