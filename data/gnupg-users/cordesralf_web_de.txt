@_subject: SmartCard doesn't work 
I bought me a SmartCard and the first thing I've done was to change the
PIN and the Admin-PIN. I wrote these PINs down on paper to learn them.
After creating a key everything was fine. But when I tried to use the
card the next day nothing worked. Neither my new PINs nor the PINs which
came with the card. I also wrote a mail to KernelConcepts but got no reply.
Now I have a nice card without function. Is there a possibility to clear
everything on the card? Even the PINs?
Thanks to all

At first I use WinPT 0.9.92. But I had problems with the passphrase. So
I changed to command line. There the PINs which I changed with WinPT
worked. That evening I also could encrypt and sign mails. But the next
day the problems came up.
