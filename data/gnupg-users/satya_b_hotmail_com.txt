@_subject: Character set and File exists 
I am new to GnuPG. If I run any command from gpg, I am getting the following gpg: conversion from `utf-8' to `roman8' not available
I am using HP Unix 11.0. Is there any way to avoid the above message?
Secondly, I am giving -o option in the command line and if the file already exists, I am prompted with the following message:
File `b.txt' exists. Overwrite? (y/N)
Is there any option to avoid the above message?
Thanks  in advance for your help.
