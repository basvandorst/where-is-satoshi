@_subject: Automatic encryption to several recipients 
Hi there,
for automatic encryption to several always repeating recipients,
especially to own keys, you use the --encrypt-to option. I?d like to use
it in gpg.conf.
I wonder, can it be used to encrypt to more than one key? What would be
the correct syntax?
Something like
encrypt-to KEY1
encrypt-to KEY2
encrypt-to KEY3
or "encrypt-to KEY1 KEY2 KEY3"
Thanks in advance!

By the way, why is there no option like "--use-secret"?
I know, GnuPG has some magic to use the correct secret key to decode
data, but if you have some (a lot) secret key, this magic may waste time
or be inconvenient in some way.
A "--use-secret-key" option would give the user full control to use a
chosen secret key without depending on any auto mechanism. Maybe
something to consider.
Best regards

@_subject: private data objects on smartcard 
Hi there,
The opnPGP smartcards seem to have private data objects to store
arbitrary data, right? It seems even the old 1.1 version cards feature
these objects.
How do you write to these objects? Can GnuPG do this? I didn?t found any
way with --card-edit or --card-status. And can GnuPG read these objects?
I read somewhere, the size of these objects is 2048 bytes each. How many
of these objects do exist on a smartcard?

Great, thanks!
By the way, is mcl3 the length of the key currently living on the
smartcard or the maximum key length supported by this card?
I just play with a card version 1.1 and mcl3 is 0 there..... Version 1.1
support 1024 RSA AFAIK.

I hoped these objects may have been (read) protected by the PIN, but
they?re world readable if you have the card, a bit sad...
