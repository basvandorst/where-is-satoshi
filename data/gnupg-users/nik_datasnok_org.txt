It all depends on how big a pool of songs/poems you have, I guess.
Intuitively, I guess it's not that good, but it again depends on who is
out to get you. :)
My $0.02:
I use Diceware for really important passphrases. 7 or 8 Diceware words
is somewhere near 128 bits of entropy (I don't remember exactly, but I
think 9 words is the first level above 128 bits).
I have never had problems remembering even 8-word ones (after a few
tries it just sticks in my muscle memory, I wouldn't be able to
reproduce them without a querty keyboard :) I have hard copies of
course, stored secure enough considering my needs and resources (can't
really hire armed guards ;)
So, presuming the actuall list from which you pick words is valid and you
use a reasonably good set of dices to choose them, I think it is an
optimal way of generating strong passphrases.
