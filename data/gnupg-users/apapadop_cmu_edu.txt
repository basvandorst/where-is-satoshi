You need to at least lsign the key. Assign NO trust if you like, but=20
KMail will not let you encrypt to a key you have not signed.

I agree. Allowing encryption to a key without any user verification=20
whatsoever (fingerprint, at the very least?), is bad and causes=20
brain-dead use of gpg. In no time this reaches the point of users=20
relying on their MUA to verify their keys for them, and bitching when=20
they realize it won't.

That's the only thing KMail asks from the user, making a minimal check=20
(say, a fingerprint), and then signing the key localy. You do not have=20
to place any explicit trust on the key you want to encrypt with. You=20
just sign it and mark it as non-exportable (--lsign), and KMail is fine=20
with that.

Is the aforementioned version completely incompatible with gpg, or are=20
there switches to ensure compatibility? If that is the case, does it=20

No, I've made minimal changes to gpg.conf from the default (just the=20
keyserver and no-greeting flags) . So, if I enable the pgp6 switch in=20
my .conf file, the program will intelligently decide whether to use it=20
or not, depending on the nature of the public key used to encrypt?
Impressive! :-)
Thanks for the tip.

Why not rid yourself of distribution-specific dependencies?
Install Mozilla from mozilla.org, and then install enigmail from=20
enigmail.mozdev.org and you'll be fine.
FYI, enigmail works even with the latest Mozilla (1.2b)

Hash: SHA1
AFAIK, this is not the default behavior. If you don't specify an output=20
filename on the command line prior to encryption, you will end up with=20
test.zip.gpg, which will then decrypt to test.zip.
The command I use on linux is:
gpg --encrypt --recipient xxx test.zip
=2E..that creates an encrypted file test.zip.gpg
