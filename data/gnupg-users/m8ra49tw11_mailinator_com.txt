@_subject: GPG batch Vista command line 
Hi, I am trying to automate symmetric decryption in a batch. I'm a newb both
to pgp and to the command line :)
%pass% has been set earlier
for /r %%g in (*.*) do ( echo %pass%|gpg --batch -q --passphrase-fd 0 -c "%%g" Instead of producing a decrypted file, it just prints the plaintext in the
command line box. If I specify a -o output
for /r %%g in (*.*) do ( echo %pass%|gpg --batch -q -o "%%g"--passphrase-fd 0 -c "%%g" I get the error "handle plaintext failed: General error"
I guess this is because it's trying to decrypt %%g to %%g
I'd appreciate any suggestions on how to make this work, my encryption is
going fine! :)
