@_subject: newbie question #2: how to calculate web of trust 
I'm not finding info in the gpg man page or the online handbook at
 on how to perform a web of trust
validation on a key.
Am I missing this?  Is the answer that you have to traverse the web yourself using something like pathfinder?

Writing out the question helped me answer it for myself, I think.  You
import signed keys using
   --import     (or maybe)    --fast-import ... --merge-only
then do --edit on an individual key to see the computed trust value.

Thanks, Holger.
I'm fiddling around with the web of trust, so will write more about this as time goes on.
