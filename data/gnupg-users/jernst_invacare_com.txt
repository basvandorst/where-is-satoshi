@_subject: Question Regarding Passphrases When Signing 
Hello -
I am trying to sign and encrypt a file using a UNIX script. No matter what I do, the passphrase that is requested appears to be for the first key that is listed via -list-keys. I have tried specifying a recipient but that does not seem to make any difference; it still asks for the same key's passphrase.
Is it possible to specify which key that the passphrase is requested for when signing/encrypting ?

You must define the signing key:
gpg --local-user 0x12345678 --detach-sign file or shorter gpg -u 0x12345678 --detach-sign file
