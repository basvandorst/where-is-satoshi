@_subject: key server security 
Hash: SHA1
Sorry if this is a FAQ, but:  why?
After a thread about a faked key on a key server (which doesn't check
signatures), I started thinking about a key server which DOES check
signatures, and strips those it finds lacking.  How do I attack such a
system?  How do I attack if it if it throws away expired data?  Is there a
good reason NOT to use a DB backend (like Postgres) to do the storage?
What's the impact of a black hat owning a key server?
If all this is answered somewhere else, I'd love a pointer.
