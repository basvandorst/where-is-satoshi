Open PGP is installed and working fine on my Macbook using Apple Mail. So far only have used it with one other person who also uses Open PGP. I am wanting to publicize my public key to others.
Problem is I don't know what my public key is, nor do I know how to find it or make it available to others. I never gave the key to anyone yet I am somehow able to encrypt and decrypt messages with that one person mentioned above. I can't even find any sign of GPG software on my computer anywhere, only a few .pkr and .skr files I found in my Documents folder.
Can anyone Help?
