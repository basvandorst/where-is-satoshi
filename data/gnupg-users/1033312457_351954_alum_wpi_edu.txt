valid, when you know it isn't?
Perhaps I'm missing something here, but the output clearly indicates
when a signature is made by an untrusted key.  For example, earlier in
this thread:
[[PGP Signed Part:Michael Simonsen  Untrusted, Fingerprint: D0F3 47EA 3007 7C83 E3C0 8AB5 AB7E 3CF1 BC1A

would probably obscure the message on most people's screens :)
Okay, but this is pretty low-priority, I would think.
This works fine for me.  Or, did you mean sending?  Verifying
plaintext encrypted/signed messages works fine for me, but I think
there's still a bug when sending cleartext signed messages which have
This is all moot, since it appears we're going with pgg now! :)
