Not only that, but there are often timestamps etc in compiled code
which can cause differences even with the same compiler & machine.

Ah yes.  I just noticed this. (Gnus does notice this, and
automatically verify the message, without any procmail tricks too...I
like that...)
So does Gnus...

You can use MailCrypt, but Gnus comes with it's own gpg.el now (in
oort, the development cvs version :).  It works very well.

It's seems fairly clear that he was suggesting that TwoFish /should/
have been the AES, rather than Rijndael.

I'm not so sure about that...
Of course, at that point, it would be much easier to use social
engineering tactics to get the information than trying to break the
Also, I wonder what would be "faster", brute forcing the symmetric
encryption on the payload, or factoring to get the key?

AFAK subkeys are not signed, you must be thinking of alternate uids?
I believe the uid based signatures are attached to your signing

Generate a revocation cert, import the cert, and upload the resulting

@_subject: short question 
foo
      /foo/ A sample name for absolutely anything,
     especially programs and files (especially {scratch files}).
     First on the standard list of {metasyntactic variables} used
     in {syntax} examples.  See also {bar}, {baz}, {qux}, {quux},
     {corge}, {grault}, {garply}, {waldo}, {fred}, {plugh},
     {xyzzy}, {thud}.
     The etymology of "foo" is obscure.  When used in connection
     with "bar" it is generally traced to the WWII-era Army slang
     acronym {FUBAR}, later bowdlerised to {foobar}.
  FUBAR
          Fouled / Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition / Repair (slang, Usenet, IRC)
  FUBAR
     1. (WWII military slang) Fucked up beyond all
     recognition (or repair).
