Dunno if this is a mutt or gpg problem ...
 When I'm trying to "sign as" with my DSA keys, I get a list of keys
 containing my DSA sub-key, but not the public key. I updated gpg.rc
 to from mutt-cvs, but the problem persists. If I manually enter
 the correct key id, I am thrown back to the "Sign as:" prompt.

@_subject: GPG signing problem 
Definitely a mutt problem. It was introduced between 1.3.11 and 1.3.12.
 Either the documentation is wrong, or my understanding of this option
 is wrong. Or it's a bug :)
 The default setting causes mutt to ignore the "real" key and choose
 the *wrong* key (subkey).
 If I unset pgp_ignore_subkeys, it works as before.
 That comment about "interesting key selection games" seems blatant
 nonsense to me.

 IMHO signing list email is a useless and wasteful exercise, especially
 if the sender hasn't submitted his/her keys to the public keyservers.
 In this situation, those who have configured their encrytion software
 to automatically import keys from these servers are penalised.

@_subject: Test failure on NetBSD 
The conventional-mdc.test fails on NetBSD 1.5 (and I think, it did on
 1.4.2, too).
 What happens is that for the first loop iteration, dd should generate
 a file "z" of size zero (correct?), but it creates no file at all, so
 that gpg exits with a message "z: no such file or directory".
 Whether the problem lies with dd or the assumption that it should
 generate a zero size file if invoked as above, I cannot say. The test
 works fine if I remove 0 from the loop, though.

 add the corresponding configure test.

 However, he didn't say *which* version/variant of Unix.
 gpg must be suid root on most Unices (for mlock). suid is generally not
 a good idea.
 While there might be Unix binaries available, I would rather recommend to
 compile your own, even if it involves installing a compiler.
 There are just too many ways to shoot yourself in the foot, even with apache.
 Remember, their web site got hacked. Because of admin sloppiness.
 So, Scott, if you give us some more details, we might be able to
 give better advice.

To replace pgp (where that is possible) gpg must be run with the correct
 command line options. There's a wrapper to call gpg with pgp 2.6.x compatible
 options at  Furthermore, for full pgp 2.6.x compatibility you need a version of gpg
 that supports the rsa and idea algorithms. Rsa is part of gpg since 1.0.3,
 and an external plugin for idea is available separately. The latter cannot
 be distributed as part of gpg for patent/copyright reasons.

It is not equivalent, because config.status doesn't run configure. It
 only recreates the files in AC_OUTPUT, using cached values from a previous
 configure run.
 The results of some configure tests may differ for different compiler
 options, and this may lead to subtle and hard to detect errors.

Hey, get off your high horse, mister.
 One reason for badly supported platforms is often that the developers
 have no access to them. Worse if such platforms are sufficiently non-
 standard, e.g. crap like zsh in place of The Bourne Shell.

@_date: 2001-08-01 17:43:01
@_author: Lars Hecking

MacOS X apparently uses zsh as The Bourne Shell, /bin/sh. The way it
 appears to be configured, is not compatible with Bourne shell, and as
 such causes all sorts of problems when running configure scripts.

I think that was a bug in 1.0.6, and Werner posted a patch for it right
 after the release. If you take a look at the actual file, you can probably
 fix it yourself, it's quite trivial.
 Unfortunately, I cannot test whether Tru64 5.x really needs libiconv
 (the only 5.1 box sitting here is off the net coz I have no free network
 ports), but I would be surprised if that OS version really needed an
 external libiconv. To test this out, you may want to install libiconv
 off ftp.gnu.org (or mirrors).

 Ok - same here.
 It looks to me like your gcc and your OS version are severly at odds. Why,
 if this is a sparc-sun-solaris2.8 system, is there some RedHat-based gcc
 installed?
 Also, this gcc has private includes for Solaris 2.5, and there will
 very definitely be conflicts with system headers. You're lucky you
 got it compiled somehow.

 IMHO this case is different.
 Operational measuers, such as blocking spammers, viruses, or DoS
 attacks are fine. But blocking encryption is not operational, in
 fact, contrary to their notice it decreases security. It infringes
 on civil rights.
 What's the point of discussing government policies about strong
 crytography and possible restrictions thereof if it is really so
 simple to prevent people from using cryptography (in a convenient way)
 for communication?
 I repeat, this must not be allowed to happen. One would think that
 telecom and network operators knew better, but maybe they are under
 pressure by misguided (or ultra right-wing) politicians.
