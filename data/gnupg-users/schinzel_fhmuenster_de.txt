A backchannel in a technology is not a vulnerability per se. At its
core, the Efail CBC/CFB gadget attack modifies a ciphertext in a way
that it *exfiltrates its own plaintext* when opened. The paper shows
that this is practical for HTML email clients.
The generic concept of the CBC/CFB gadget attack, however, is neither
limited to HTML, nor to emails. It is plausible to transform the attack
to other data formats supporting backchannels. It's up to the creativity
of the attacker to come up with other scenarios. Adam Langley touched
another scenario already in 2014:
The central flaws for CBC/CFB gadgets to work are (a) missing
authenticated encryption in S/MIME and (b) not properly enforced
integrity protection in OpenPGP. We won't fix malleable encryption by
tinkering with HTML, x509 and MIME parsers.

Table 5 shows that CRL and OCSP work as a backchannel in some clients,
see I_1, I_2, I_3 in the PKI column. It is unclear if they can be used
to exfiltrate plaintext in reality because changing them should break
the signature. The caIssuer field (intermediate certificates) seems more
appropriate for plaintext exfiltration. See the discussion in section
6.2. Note that we didn't analyze X.509v3 extensions for further
Again, whether CRL/OCSP/caIssuer can or cannot be used for plaintext
exfiltration doesn't affect the overall security of S/MIME much. The
central flaw remains malleable encryption.

Dear all,
Jens M?ller just gave a talk at DEFCON about Covert Content Attacks
against S/MIME and OpenPGP encryption and digital signatures in the
email context. He just published the PoC emails that he used in the talk
and they might be useful for further testing.
This is the paper describing the attacks from April 2019:

Those are two different papers.
1. The 'Jonny, you are fired' paper solely dealt with signature spoofing
and the repo is here:
2. The paper mentioned in the thread above is 'Re: What's Up Johnny? --
Covert Content Attacks on Email End-to-End Encryption' and it contains
some leftover attack cases that didn't make it into the Efail paper. It
aims at exfiltrating the plaintext of encrypted mails, but with some
degree of user interaction, e.g. replying to a malicious email.
Lots of test cases and I am not aware of any current list of what MUA
fixed which issue (correctly or incorrectly).
