@_subject: corrupt file 
I have a file that I'm unable to decrypt. I use a vim script that calls gpg to encrypt and decrypt files. That has worked fine for years, until today.
I tried to decrypt in on the command line with gpg, but not luck. Search the net I found a command to dump the packets in the file, but its gibberish to me:
gpg --no-batch --verbose --list-packets /tmp/file.gpg
:pubkey enc packet: version 3, algo 16, keyid D155A8A1E1BACB99
gpg: public key is E1BACB99
gpg: using subkey E1BACB99 instead of primary key 7D90BD92
You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: "Me"
gpg: using subkey E1BACB99 instead of primary key 7D90BD92
1024-bit ELG-E key, ID E1BACB99, created 2007-07-18 (main key ID 7D90BD92)
gpg: gpg-agent is not available in this session
gpg: block_filter 0x2baaa848e650: read error (size=5336,a->size=433)
:encrypted data packet:
gpg: block_filter: pending bytes!
An old version of the file gives:
  gpg --no-batch --verbose --list-packets oldfile.gpg
:pubkey enc packet: version 3, algo 16, keyid D155A8A1E1BACB99
gpg: public key is E1BACB99
gpg: using subkey E1BACB99 instead of primary key 7D90BD92

user: "Me"

1024-bit ELG-E key, ID E1BACB99, created 2007-07-18 (main key ID 7D90BD92)
gpg: gpg-agent is not available in this session
:encrypted data packet:
gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit ELG-E key, ID E1BACB99, created 2007-07-18
       "Me"
gpg: AES256 encrypted data
:compressed packet: algo=2
:literal data packet:
Is there anything I can do to recover the file?
