@_subject: Possible values for --compress-level and --bzip2-compress-level 
Hello everyone,
I have a question to the options --compress-level and
--bzip2-compress-level. Which are the supportet (possible)
values of each of the options? -- Numbers from 0 up to 6?
Here is the description of the both options in the GPG Manual:
-z n
--compress-level n
--bzip2-compress-level n
Set compression level to n for the ZIP and ZLIB compression algorithms.
The default is to use the
default compression level of zlib (normally 6). --bzip2-compress-level
sets the compression level
for the BZIP2 compression algorithm (defaulting to 6 as well). This is a
different option from
--compress-level since BZIP2 uses a significant amount of memory for
each additional compression level.
-z sets both. A value of 0 for n disables compression.
Best regards Josef
P.S. Sorry for my perhaps weird english, I'm not a native speaker.

@_subject: Encryption of multiple files into another directory 
Hello everyone,
GnuPG 2.0.29
Linux and Windows
by using the command
gpg2 --recipient 0x12345678 --encrypt-files /media/usb/folder_1/*
I can encrypt with a public key all files in the directory folder_1.
How can I encrypt alle the files in this directory to another directory
This command
gpg2 --output /media/usb/folder_2/ --recipient 0x12345678
--encrypt-files /media/usb/folder_1/*
does not work unfortunately. -- Any hints?
Best regards

Hi Peter,

I've  tried this command, but unfortunately it did't work perfectly. In
folder_1 there are files: foo1.docx, foo2.docx, foo3.docx etc.
After processing there are files in folder_2, but the file have the same
file extenstion like the original files: foo1.docx, foo2.docx, foo3.docx
It looks as if  the files simply were copied to folder_2. But when I try
to open the *.docx files with Libre Office for example I can see that
doesn't work.
So I guess the very problem ist the missing file extension *gpg for the
files in folder_2.
Do you have any idea to modify the command so that the files in folder_2
are: foo1.docx.gpg, foo2.docx.gpg, foo3.docx.gpg etc. (without renaming
the files manually)?
Best regards Josef
