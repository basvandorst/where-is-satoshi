@_subject: Forwarding both gpg and ssh agents 
I use the ssh-agent functionality of gnupg (version 2.2.8) to handle connecting to remote hosts, which works great. I'm also able to forward my gpg-agent to remote machines to e.g. decrypt files using the `RemoteForward` flag in my ~/.ssh/config:
Host myremote
I have a few remotes where I would also like to forward my ssh-agent so that I can make a third connection to a remote machine using my local ssh-agent (through gpg-agent). Specifically, I'm trying to ssh into a FreeBSD remote, and from there connect to a third remote git server using the ssh credentials from my local machine.
Is this functionality available?

Thanks for your reply Peter, the ForwardAgent flag is exactly what I was looking for. Although some sources note the potential security holes of using this method, it works great for my use case

@_subject: Importing existing key as subkey 
I'm trying to consolidate my various master keys into a single master with subkeys. On my 'old' computer with gpg2.0 (openSUSE 42.3) I was able to export the secret key and split it up with `gpgsplit`.  On my new machine (openSUSE Tumbleweed), the `gpgsplit` command is unavailable, and I'm curious if that functionality has been removed or named to something else between the two versions.
Longer version:
I have an existing key generated using gpg2.0 that I would like to import as a subkey to my main master key, which is on a computer with gpg2.2. For the most part I'm following this SO answer:
I've been able to split up the 'old' key (step 1) into its constituent packets using `gpg --export-secret-keys XXXXXXX | gpgsplit -vp XXXXXXX_` and transport them to my main computer. From there I created some dummy slots in my master. I'm stuck at step four where I need to split up my master key into its packets because gpgsplit is missing, and apparently not to be found in a gpg-related tool in the main repositories.
I realize this answer might be out-of-date (2014), but I haven't found anything thus far as thorough about consolidating. If someone can point me to another resource on this topic, I would certainly appreciate it.
Best Regards,

@_subject: gpg-agent forwarding to remote with systemd - status? 
I should add that the remote is OpenSUSE Leap 15.0 running GnuPG
2.2.5, and my current client is OpenSUSE Leap 15.0 running WSL on
Windows 10, also running GnuPG 2.2.5. The WSL client doesn't have
systemd installed on it, so it uses the old ~/.gnupg directory for
holding sockets.
On client:
$ gpgconf --list-dir socketdir
On remote:
$ gpgconf --list-dir socketdir

@_subject: gpg-agent forwarding to remote with systemd - status? 
I'm trying to forward my local gpg-agent over ssh to a remote that
controls the gnupg sockets via systemd. This fails because sshd
attempts to place the socket in a directory that doesn't exist,
because that is handled on the remote by systemd.
This issue was raised back in 2016:
It was suggested in that thread to place `gpgconf --create-socketdir`
in '.bashrc' to create the proper directory, but this doesn't work in
my case because on the remote the directory is created/deleted by
systemd and shell scripts are sourced after ssh attempts to place the
clear in what project the solution should be (openssh, systemd,
Is there an update regarding this issue, or any proposed workarounds
for systemd-based remotes?

What is the key that you in include in the .gnupg/sshcontrol file? On my system, it's the authentication subkey's 'keygrip'. I'm not exactly sure what the difference is between that and a fingerprint, but you can determine what it is using:
$ gpg --list-secret-keys --with-keygrip
Then make sure the keygrip in 'sshcontrol' matches the keygrip of your authentication subkey.

@_subject: wrong gpg-agent version running? 
I've run into this issue when my package manager updates gnupg without
killing running gpg-agent daemons.
I think you have a previous (old version) gpg-agent daemon still running.
You can see if that's the case by looking at the output of 'ps x'. I would
recommend killing that daemon by using 'gpgconf --kill gpg-agent'. Your
next invocation of a gpg command will launch a fresh daemon using the
correct version.

@_subject: binary distribution of GnuPG for SuSE Linux SLES 15 
Hash: SHA256
Hi Matthias,
There appear to be a few different repositoris related to SLES 15, and
to be honest I'm not sure what the difference between them actually is.
- From my initial investigation it that gpg2 is available in either one
of the following two repositories (original SLE 15)
yet is missing from SLE SP1 and SP2
I would try to get it from one of the original SLE repos, or ask on a
SUSE mailing list about why it's missing from SP1.
