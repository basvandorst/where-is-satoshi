You need to use rndcontrol to set an IRQ to help supply entropy for the
random number generator.
On most *nixish systems, type vmstat -i
This returns a list of irqs in use. Find an irq (Not clk or rtc) that's
got a decent rate number.
Then just type:
rndcontrol -s 11
(where irq 11 is getting, say a 35 in the rate column.Fill in the
irq of your choice, just not clk or rtc.) Once this has been
done, try generating a key again. It may take a while, depending on the
size of the key and the rate of entropy generated from the irq you're
using, but it will work (I think).

@_subject: Why not use rtc or clk for randomness? 
Forgive me if this is a stupid question.
One of the most-asked questions is ends up being about how to get the
kernel to generate more entropy for key generation (from a remote
terminal). I asked it myself and have seen it since a few times.
I got my answer, which was to configure /dev/random using rndcontrol -s
-[irq], first finding a good irq by looking at vmstat -i. I was
specifically cautioned against using the irqs associated with clk and
rtc. Why is that? They have such wonderfully high rates. I'm sure using
them would speed up key generation. Are they poor sources of true
randomness, or what?

@_subject: Question 
You need to acquire pgp4pine. There is a port available, but I'm not sure
it's current. As of a few weeks ago, it wasn't. You want version 1.75 or
better and last I looked the port was at 1.74. That may have changed. 1.75
will compile fine if you go to the author's web site and download the
source. The web site also has a very clear tutorial on how to set up your
.pgp4pinerc file and your .pinerc file to use either gnupg or pgp. I've
been quite satisfied with the software.

@_subject: system hangs during key generation 
I've been trying out GNUpg, but am having one problem. When I connect
through ssh, or telnet for that matter, I cannot generate a key. The app
gets as far as key generation, then asks me to continue working so that it
can gather more random data. I can whale away at the keyboard, and
eventually, no further characters get entered onscreen. However, the
system then hangs. If I work at the machine itself, the process is
identical with the exception that, after whacking away at random keys, a
key is actually generated. Any ideas? (The problem being that if I can't
generate keys from a remote terminal, the system is useless to remote
users. PGP 6.5.1 appears not to have this problem.)
Am using FreeBSD 4.0-STABLE, with PII 266 and 64mb RAM; should be
sufficient. Oh, and the network in question is a 10-base-T.

@_subject: Unsupported public key algorithm 
Could this have something to do with RSA or IDEA? I think those guys are
patented/licensed, so probably unsupported by GNUpg. Perhaps you're trying
to import a RSA key?
I'm just winging it here, so feel free to correct me.
