F.e. mutt itself asks for a passphrase and passes it on to gpg. It's
a normal thing for email clients to do, as with frontends for gpg as
In case an attacker replaces the gpg binary with a wrapper... well,
security is compromised the moment when an attacker gains system
access anyway.
Btw, good to see GoldEd still floating around. How's fidonet?

@_subject: OpenPGP smartcard restore 
I'm not a smartcard user (somehow the concept hasn't been able to
convince me ... yet), but what you write really sounds rather
strange. Essentially you're saying: no backup of a private key
generated on/via a smartcard cannot be exported. Because if it could
be exported, importing the key(s) in question just works.
However, and I'm saying this quite frankly, if that is true (gurus
may jump in any time :-), that really should one prevent from using
smartcards at all. There just has to be a backup option in any given
system, or else it's plain Russian roulette for its user(s).

Sorry, that was heat-induced and shall read of course as follows:
Essentially you're saying: a private key generated on/via a smartcard
cannot be exported, so no backup of the private key in question is
possible. Because if the private key(s) could be exported, import of
the key(s) in question just works without problems.
The rest of my message still stands though.
Bottom line, what's the use of importing to smartcards when no export
from smartcards is possible? In other words: Why is the export of
plain smartcard private keys prohibited in the first place?
Additionally, why is importing of off-card generated private keys
allowed then? Where's the difference?

@_subject: Upgrading from 1.2.1 to 1.4.4 
Last time I checked the latest version was 1.4.3
You could uninstall the current gnupg if you use a package system.
Then install the new one. Or just compile and install the latest
version, end users won't notice any difference. Well, I didn't :-)
However, when it comes to signing keys gnupg as of version 1.4.x
needs the config option ask-cert-level to be either present in
~./gnupg/options or on the command line - in case that particular
option is missing, the default level of signature (0) is given to
keys being signed (if no default-cert-level option is passed along to
gnupg of course).
I still fail to see the benefit of this behaviour, but that's the way
it is.

What about the executable(s)? Language files? I use that kind of
approach too, but not with gnupg. One has to know in detail where
stuff is installed etc. Not recommended for ordinary users.

@_subject: zlib inflate problem 
Have you tried redirection? gpg < bigfile.pgp > bigfile
Using redirection is the correct way of handling large files
regarding both de- and encryption.
I haven't seen this error myself in connection with large files
If you can, try decrypting on the same system the data was encrypted.
Looks like you switched to Kubuntu though...
Maybe someone else will come up with some magic that'll help you.
As a last resort, a fresh compile might help using the exact
programme versions you used on the system your data was encrypted on.
I hope you have additional backups. Always test such critical things
extensively on each system affected (I know it's a pain).

this is just a reminder that there's a key signing party at FOSDEM
this year again. I am a bit late to post this note (due to carneval

exchange key fingerprints according to the usual scheme (with me ;-)
FOSDEM takes place in Brussels, 24/25th this month.

Phosgene is not a nerve gas, it is "just" a pulmonary agent. Deadly
doses are higher and death is painful and slow (within 24-48 hours). Not all Freon would be converted into Phosgene and I'd guess the
firefighters wore gas masks thus limiting the exposure (they know
about the Freon?)

@_subject: gpg: key generation failed: Card error 
I cannot create keys on my shiny new v2 smartcard. Personalizing the
card works just fine, as does changing PINs.
But when I want to generate new keys I always get this error message
(after gpg asked about how long the key shall be valid):
gpg: key generation failed: Card error               Key generation failed: Card error       That's on a stock Slackware 13 system, gpg (GnuPG) 2.0.12, libgcrypt
1.4.4 with OMNIKEY CardMan 4040 v1.1.0gm5.
Any hints?

@_subject: gpg: key generation failed: Card error 
Okay, after much cursing omnikey I finally was successful in creating
keys on the smartcard using the SCR3310 smartcard reader. Someone
suggested updating to current gpg2 (2.0.13), that was the key to it
Strangely the crappy omnicard reader has no problems at all reading
keys stored on the card. Still, I cannot recommend omnikey at all.
One question popped up in my mind on several occasions: V2 smartcards
supposedly cannot be bricked. So, how is the reset done exactly?

@_subject: How to check the trust level 
(Just to contribute to the confusion:)
That's according to the spec, but there are quite a few people out
there who do not honour the spec (for whatever reasons - not relevant
here) and have their own definition of sig levels (usually published
in their signing policy).
To sum it up, these days levels 0,2,3 are fine. 1s are a bit strange
and quite rare - I'd inquire about that kinda sig level.
