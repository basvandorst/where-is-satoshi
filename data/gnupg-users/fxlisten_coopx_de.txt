@_subject: I lost my secret key. 
I don't think, it is possible to revoke a key without the secret key.
If you generate a new key pair, issue a revocation certificate at the
same time and store it in a safe place (like on a floppy, or print it
out).  Read the docs on how to do this.  Then you can always revoke the
key even if you lose the secret key (in a disk failure etc).
HTH (er, next time),
