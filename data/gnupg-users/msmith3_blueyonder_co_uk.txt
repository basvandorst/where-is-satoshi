@_subject: Restoring my HTML mails 
Hash: SHA1
Hi Everyone,
I've just installed GnuPG and Enigmail for my Thunderbird client.
During the installation process of Enigmail, the wizard changes some
options including changing composition and reading of emails in plain
text rather than HTML.
I was wondering how I reset Thunderbird to compose/read emails as HTML?
Many thanks
Mark Smith
