@_subject: Pin-pad on SPR332 smartcard reader does not work under OSX 
I'm trying to get my smartcard to work under Mac OS X (OSX 10.9,
Mavricks) with GnuPG 2.1.1. It mostly works out of the box, but there is
one minor issue that I can't get to work: the pinpad on my SmartCard
reader (SPR332). (Pin is asked by the pinentry program, not by the card
reader itself)
I've tried to debug this myself. This is what I found:
I can see scdaemon doing pcsc_vendor_specific_init(), but failing:
How should I proceed to get this to work? Is it even supposed to work
under OSX? What additional info do you need?
Additional info: Card reader & card work fine under Linux; Card is the
ZeitControl card from g10code.com
Thanks in advance,

I have searched my system for reader.h, but didn't find that file. Next,
I grepped through the better part of my filesystem (/usr, /System,
I have found a website [1] which might mean more to you that it does to
me. From what I understand, OSX uses the same constants that GNU/Linux:
How can I debug this further?
