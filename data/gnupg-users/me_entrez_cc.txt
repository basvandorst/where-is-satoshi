Hi everyone,
I like to use unique icons for the items I save in my password manager, so that I can distinguish between them more easily at a glance.  In pursuit of this goal, I sometimes end up putting together my own images for sites or services which don't have an existing logo readily available online.
I had a tough time finding a suitable image for the gnupg-users mailing list that was distinct from the logo for the gnupg project as a whole, so I ended up slapping something together in GIMP for my own use. I'm not going to make any promises about it being a stunning work of art or anything, but I figured I would share it here just in case anyone else might find it useful for some reason or other.
Here it is:

Hey Stefan,
Do you prefer this?
    BTW, I think I capitalized just the first letter because the mailing list archives  and listinfo page  both write it that way... but I also see now that it's written in all lowercase on , so really I have no idea what the ``right'' capitalization is supposed to be!
