@_subject: Installation of 2.2 
I'd like to upgrade to version 2.2.3? Will it be sufficient do download
just the tarball on the downloadpage and build that?
Afterwards I can delete the previous versions? If I do that, will the
conf. file be deleted?
Thank you.

i'm configuring my gnupg using 2.1.11
I'll use my master key offline. Following this guidelines: I also implemented the Appelbaum's config.(Riseup Best Practices) Will it work properly if the Master Key isn't on my machine?
And the following faults are coming:
  gpg: keyserver option 'ca-cert-file' is obsolete; please use 'hkp-cacert' in dirmngr.conf
gpg: keyserver option 'no-try-dns-srv' is unknown
Please see the screenshot from my terminal.
Many thanks
