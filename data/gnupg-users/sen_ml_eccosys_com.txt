@_subject: encrypting problems: same address, but one key is disabled... 
i have a couple of keys on my keyring that share the same mail address.
one is disabled while the other is not -- when i try to encrypt using
the mail address as an identifier, i get:
    skipped: public key is disabled
  in this kind of a situation, isn't it reasonable to expect gpg to
move on to use the enabled key instead?
  also, when i do:
    gpg --edit-key only one key appears as something i can select, while when i do:
    gpg --list-keys both keys are displayed.  it would be nice if both keys were listed as
a result of invoking gpg w/ '--edit-key'.
  thanks for your time.

   challenge/response method to verify that the holder really has the

it is scary (a little less scary if you have some kind of

resides on a user's own system, then this is not nearly as scary.

there have been reports about using gnupg under aix in the past.  my

either my message wasn't clear or i'm not understanding something (or

one of the paragraphs in my original message that you did not quote
mentions the fact that at least one program (i presume there are more)
has been written to process english gnupg messages.  assuming that
there is more than one non-bourne/posix shell user in the world that
uses that program, isn't it problematic to use the approach you
  -having the program forcibly specify /bin/sh seems like a
   waste of starting up an extra process
  -forcing the user to set an environment variable every time they use gpg    doesn't make sense
  -writing a custom script that sets the environment variable first also
   requires an extra process
  -having the program try to detect which shell the user uses seems silly
any other ideas?
i didn't come up w/ any so it seemed like having a command line option
to specify language was a good idea -- at least one to tell gpg to use
english messages so that the program that talks to gpg can specify
it (but if you go that far, why not allow the specification of
arbitrary language?).

@_subject: subject line -- to hide or not to hide 
i've been wondering whether there is a good way to keep the subject
of a message confidential w/o losing the convenience for the recipient
of having a meaningful subject line.
  my first thought was that i could just leave the subject line blank
(or make it bogus) and upon decryption of a message, a recipient could
figure out the subject themselves by reading the message...
  this seemed to work ok for a while, and then later, i wanted to
perform searches by eye as well as by subject.  this doesn't work very
well w/o meaningful subject lines.  it just doesn't mesh well w/
existing mail client interfaces.
  so, my question is, is there a good way to maintain the convenience of
meaningful subject lines and the confidentiality of them too?
  the thought of including a pseudo-subject header in the body of the
message that gets encrypted occurred to me, but w/o some kind of
client support for such a scheme, it doesn't seem very useful.
  is there something that already addresses this issue nicely?  anything
in an ietf draft or rfc somewhere?
  anyone else have this problem?

thanks to all who responded, i really appreciate the feedback.
i think trying to accomplish this (subject line hiding) via the method
that Sotiris Vassilopoulos suggested (or something similar) would be fine.  if some people are satisfied w/ blank or bogus subject lines, there is
no reason for them to use the outlined method; for others, i think the
option would be nice -- and further, i suggest that it is actually
much more than just "nice" for folks who have a large number of
messages where their subject lines are obscured, and also in the case
where a significant period of time has elapsed since the sending or
reception of a message w/ a bogus subject line.
as a number of people have mentioned, support in email clients is
important for this type of mechanism to work well from an
interoperability perspective.  that leads me to the next issue which
is: how can existing mail clients be made to support such a scheme?
(well, email clients that support pgp/mime anyway)  perhaps some will
work already as is, and others may need to be modified.
it seems to me that some sort of standard document would be in order.

@_subject: meaningful and confidential subject lines in messages using pgp 
based on a description from Sotiris Vassilopoulos, i have tested and
found the following method to work fairly well.  (i believe the
explanation below is just a rephrasing of the original description,
but i am not quite sure.)
meaningful and confidential subject lines in messages using pgp
some email clients have the ability to do mime-attachment of existing
messages to newly created messages.  also, certain clients have the
ability to "burst"/"extract" messages that "contain" messages.  using
both of these mechanisms and pgp/mime, it should be fairly easy to
prevent subject information leakage, yet provide the receiver of a
message the convenience of a meaningful subject line.  w/ additional
(hopefully) minor modifications to mail clients, it should be possible
to make this process easier on the user.
  to create a subject-confidential message:
   1) create a message which you wish to keep confidential -- use a
      non-bogus subject line, and don't encrypt this message.
      let's call this message A.
   2) create another message using a subject line that is blank, bogus,       or prespecifed (so a mail client can know what to do w/ the
      message?).  to this new message, mime-attach message A from
      step 1).  using pgp/mime encrypt and optionally sign the result.        let's call this message B.  note that the attached message
      (message A) is also encrypted.
   to read a received message created in the above manner:
   1) decrypt the received message (message B).  there should now be a
      decrypted mime attachment (message A).
   2) "burst"/"extract" the mime attachment (message A) out of the container       message (message B).
   3) the "container" message can be disposed of or kept depending on
      a user's security preference.
i ran a test w/ the mail client (mew) i am using and it worked just fine.
some observations:
  -this worked in a few tests, but it would be nice if creating and
   reading such messagess was a lot more automatic (read "mail client    support").
  -it would be possible to decide to use a fixed subject string for
   message B such as "Encrypted Mail Follows" (cf. urn:ietf:rfc:1421 PEM).
   mail clients could support the functionality of automatically    extracting "message A" (or asking the user for permission to do
   so), upon reception of a message w/ the fixed subject line.
   i'm not a big fan of automatic processing like this due to security
   concerns, but at least at first glance it doesn't seem bad (famous
   last words!).
  -at least one mail client that i know of has the ability to be on the
   look-out for replying in plaintext to a message that was encrypted.
   if the "container" message is discarded and the user were to reply to
   the contained message, then it might be harder to provide this kind
   of functionality w/o tracking the history of origin of messages    separately from the actual messages themselves.  food for thought.
  in an exchange on this subject on another list, i was pointed at
rfcs 1421 (pem), 2633 (s/mime v3), and 2634 (enhanced security
services for s/mime) when i asked about hiding the subject line.    i've started reading those rfcs, but i was under the impression that
they were orthogonal to the use of pgp and pgp/mime.  can anyone
confirm or deny?  (and perhaps suggest where i might find a gentler
intro to those subjects?)

i don't know if you are jesting, but if not, the discussion doesn't
really have a whole lot to do w/ threading -- it has to do w/
maintaining the confidentiality of the subject line during message
transfer and not losing the convenience of a meaningful subject line

here are some of my current thoughts about this idea:

   you'd have to define and parse the field value.  i hope you would agree

 -if you want to sign the contents of the meaningful subject, where does

placing a meaningful subject field value in the headers of a mime

good way to protect the contents as well as make use of the encryption
and signature framework which openpgp defines.  (as to exactly what
field name should be used, this is still something i am wondering

    session key. This format helps reduce traffic analysis of messages.
  is there a version of pgp that can correctly handle this type of
keyid?  the few versions i have tried ignore such keyids, so if all
keyids in a message are of the above type, decryption fails.  i am
guessing that the tested versions fail based on tests i have conducted
w/ messages that contain both "speculative" and normal key ids.
  it's very nice that gpg can handle this.  it would be even nicer if
other rfc 2440 implementations handled it as well (it really shouldn't
be hard to add this support).  until (i can dream, can't i?) support
is added, it would be nice if gpg was able to leave in keyids for
specifically those users of rfc 2440 implementations that don't
support the "speculative" key id.  then even if a message is
intercepted and the keyids extracted, the only keyids that are
available to an attacker are those for people who use software that
doesn't support "speculative" key ids.
  as an example of one place this functionality would be useful,
consider the idea of a mailing list that has a rfc 2440 keypair for
itself and public keys for all subscribers (so posts to the list can
be encrypted using the public key of the list, the list decrypts
incoming messages and re-encrypts w/ subscriber public-keys, etc.)
implemented naively, you might end up w/ each encrypted message from
the list containing keyids for all of the subscribers.  this is
undesirable in certain types of situations.  (yes, you could encrypt
to each subscriber separately and send messages out that way too, but
the keyid would still be visible -- also, let's not get into the
mail address of the subscriber being in the envelope/headers --
that's what anonymous remailers can be used for)
  iirc, werner has said in the past that he doesn't consider this
something that he wants to add to gpg at this point (there are higher
priority items).  he said it would be easy to write a separate tool to
selectively remove certain keyids from a previously prepared rfc 2440
message (it should be easy because all you are doing is locating
certain bytes and zeroing them!).    i agree it would be easy to write -- but it's so much easier to
write it if you can use a library for handling rfc 2440, and that is
not something that is available yet (iirc, i would love to be wrong
about this).
  btw, in the opinions of those of this list, would such a tool be
considered "cryptographic" software?  it doesn't seem like it should
be to me.
  anyway, to return to the original point, i think support for
"speculative" key ids is a nice thing that gpg has and that pgp
doesn't seem to.

i took the text of rfc2440.txt which was 141371 bytes in size and did:

   OpenPGP implementations SHOULD create keys with version 4 format. An

to me, "uses PGP 5.x as a basis" means "PGP 5.x was used as a starting

backward compatible.  i think the wording in the rfc can be misleading
