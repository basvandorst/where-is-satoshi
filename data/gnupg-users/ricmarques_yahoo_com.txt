@_subject: Sending key to keyserver dies silently (Windows 98) 
Hi all,
I am using GNUpg 1.0.2 in Windows 98.
I generated successfully a key (for a different email
address that I am using now) by entering the following
commands in a DOS Prompt.
C:\gnupg> gpg --gen-key
(entered Real Name, comment and email address. Then I
entered the passphrase and confirm it and got the
message that the key pairs were generated
Then, following the instructions in
The GNU Privacy Handbook
I tried to send the public key to a keyserver by
C:\GNUPG> gpg --keyserver certserver.pgp.com
--send-key my_email_address
But, I only get the usual message of insecure memory
that says:
gpg: Please note that you don't have secure memory on
this system
I used PGP to lookup the key in certserver.pgp.com
just  to check if it was uploaded. It was NOT.
I also tried uploading it to keyserver.net in various
ways, always without success:
C:\GNUPG> gpg --keyserver search.keyserver.net
--send-key my_email_address
C:\GNUPG> gpg --keyserver search.keyserver.net:11371
--send-key my_email_address
C:\GNUPG> gpg --keyserver
 --send-key
C:\GNUPG> gpg --keyserver
 --send-key
Can anyone help me here... please?
Thanks in advance.
Best wishes,
Ricardo Marques

Hallo Werner,
to a keyserver in the windows version].  OK, thanks a lot for your response.
Could you add that information - that the windows
version does not yet support sending keys to the
keyserver - in the List of Bugs at
  AND more
importantly in the "Distributing Keys" section of the
GNU Privacy HandBook at
I think this would prevent some frustration from
Windows users - the frustation of _using Windows_
should be enough  ;-)
On a side note, could you also tell when you add this
capability to the Windows version?
Thanks again!  :)
Best wishes,
Ricardo Marques
