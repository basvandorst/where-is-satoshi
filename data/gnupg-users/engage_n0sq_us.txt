@_subject: GnuPG for Outlook Express 
I don't use OE but I have a few friends that do and I have been trying to help them to get GPG working under Windows XP since PGP is not provided free for XP. But I have been having a lot of trouble getting the GPG plug in for OE to work. Even WinPT has been problematic. Since my friends are Windows users they aren't interested in the CLI and most have abandoned e-mail encryption since it isn't as user friendly as it once was. It does appear that  the e-mail program that comes bundled with gpg4win works well with GPG but my friends are unwilling to change e-mail clients. I realize that GPG is freeware that is being developed by volunteers but I would like to see GPG become rock solid  because I want my friends to continue to use e-mail encryption. Since they are unwilling to pay for PGP  it's unlikely that they will donate money for a program that they have a lot of difficulty using. If GPGoe works out maybe they'll be interested in doing e-mail encryption again.

@_subject: unable to find valid key for.... 
I wasn't able to encrypt to someone even though their key is on my keyring. I get a message that no valid and trusted key could be found for the recipient. The key isn't revoked, not expired, and my signature is on his key. Can anyone explain this?
Mandriva 2007, Kmail 1.9.4, gnupg-1.4.5-1.2mdv2007.0,

@_subject: WinPT 
I hope I'm not off-topic but I have a question about WinPT. It seems that I can refresh or add to the public keyring from the CLI with gpg but I can't refresh the keys using the same server from within WinPT. I keep getting an error about WinPT not able to access the server. I tried the other pre-installed servers with the same result. I have tried shutting down firewalls and anti-virus programs also.  I have also tried setting up a dmz on the router and placing one PC in that zone with its firewall and AV program turned off.
Windows XP, SP2. WinPT 0.10.1, GnuPG 1.4.2

@_subject: problems with gnupg-pgp 
It's probably an IDEA issue. IDEA is not included with the standard issue of gnupg. You can get the IDEA from gnupg.org.

Why is someone sending an encrypted message to this list?

No. I keep getting prompted for my passphrase for this message. Kmail.

@_subject: decryption not possible? 
Thanks. That got things working. I guess it's not possible for the package manager to automate the process.
