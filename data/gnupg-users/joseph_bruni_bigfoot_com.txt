Add a "--homedir" option to your call to gpg so that it can find your=20
public key file.

By gpg I'm assuming you mean the gpg executable? If gpg is installed in=20=
command line would look like this:
   /path/to/file/data.gpg -e --default-recipient andreas
The web server will need to have read access to the entire path of=20
Assuming your web server runs as "nobody" you can do this:
sudo su - nobody
if [ -r /usr/home/andreas/.gnupg/pubring.gpg ]; then
   echo "is readable"

You could just use the -z option of gpg to do compression for you. That uses the same library that gzip uses (i.e. zlib).

I'll leave your second question to others who know more about the key trust. I think it has to do with something about setting ultimate trust on your own key, but I'm not sure.
For the solution to your first question, are you ready for the ultimate forehead slapper? (If you're writing from Germany it must be getting late? GMT+2? Or early for Wednesday? :) )
mysqldump database | gzip | gpg --homedir /www/.gnupg -o
   output.gz.pgp -e --default-recipient andreas
