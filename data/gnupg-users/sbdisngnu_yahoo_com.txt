@_subject: Access denied when using gpg4win via command prompt 
Firstly, let me state right away that I'm a complete newbie.
I've had this software installed for a while now with everything working as intended until a few days back. Although I'm able to access most features via the GUI (Kleopatra and GPA), the command prompt functionality seems to be broken all of a sudden. The issue started with me trying to create a revocation certificate for my personal key.
As you can see in the attached screenshot, a dialog pops up saying 'This app can't run on your PC' with an 'access denied' message in the cmd. Not sure why this is the case when I haven't made any changes to the system or the Gpg4win installation. Now none of the other tasks viz. import key, verification commands work either.
As a workaround, I did try setting the 'smart screen filtering' to off in the settings along with enabling the developer mode but it still doesn't work.
I'm posting this here since you don't get any workable solution on the Windows forums.
My OS : Windows 10 (1607 version)Gpg4win version : 2.33
Any help's appreciated.

@_subject: Option to select "Which topic categories would you like to 
Apologies for having to ask this. Didn't find any options in the relevant page.
I would like to receive messages only for topics I'm subscribed to. But, I don't see an option to select topics of my choice either in "Gnupg-users mailing list membership configuration" page or in the concerned mailing lists page "
I would like to know where I can select topics for message filtering. As of now, I receive every mail transacted under the chosen mailing list.

 Fiskerstrand: Yes, I still get the the error no matter what. And, it's not just with revocation certificate. Nothing works now be it import/verify fingerprint/Sha etc.

You seem to try to output the revocation certificate to
c:\windows\system32 , does the error persist if not outputting to a
system directory?

Thanks for the reply.
That's exactly I would like to know as to how to do i.e, either 'opt-in' or 'opt-out'. I still don't see either option in the config page. May be I'm missing something. Also, I have no experience with Thunderbird and I'm transacting through Yahoo-mail.

can ignore and hide topics, so you would have to 'opt-out' of every new

@_subject: Access denied when using gpg4win via command prompt 
Just wanted to update the status of my issue. It turns out there was an issue with my gpg4win installation. Tried a reinstall and everything's back in order. I could create a revocation certificate via cmd, however, this time to a local directory and not the windows dir. The 'access denied' problem began upon me trying to create the certificate to the default dir.? I had assumed the output dir path would be the local user path (C:\Users\AppData\Roaming\gnupg), which wasn't the case.
