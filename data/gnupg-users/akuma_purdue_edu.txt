Anyone know what the value that starts the line for each signature of the
public keys represents?

Someone said the 3 in "sig 3" represented the trust level?  however i
changed the trust level on a few and got the same output.  thanks so much,
can't find descrip. of this output anywhere.  please reply to
akuma as i'm not on this list.
