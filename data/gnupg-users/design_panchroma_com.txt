@_subject: importing mac pubkey into gpg??? 
Hi David,
I regularly swap keys between our local Mac ( PGP 6.5.2) and Unix server (GPG 1.2.0) without trouble.
If your contact wants to generate an ascii-armoured key on the Mac ( as opposed to the binary which you may have), the steps are something like:
- open the PGPkeys application
- select the icon of the key you want to export
- from the top menuu choose KEYS/EXPORT
This will produce a plain text file, which can be safely emailed.
Another posibility is that they can export their keys to a key server, and you could then import them from there.
Good luck - David Taiaroa
