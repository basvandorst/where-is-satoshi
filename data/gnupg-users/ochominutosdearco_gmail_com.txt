Hi all,
I have a doubt to sign one friends key.  I have told it to some friends and they did not had the answer.  Its a sensitive problem and i don't want to make my friend feel bad about my question.
My doubt is that I found a girl in a LUG that i have visited, that wants me to sign her key but, I did not saw her documents. And thats not all. She was he time ago. I guess her is a transsexual .
I knew her, and there is no doubt for me about her identity. In fact, thinking on this mater, i asked some friends of both in that LUG. They  know her with that identity they in their LUG. Maybe her national docs are not updated, but her name is clare determined for me and for the people that i asked.
Now the question is if you have had this situation before or is the first time someone ask about it.
I have not problems to be the first singing this, I can survive the intolerant point of view. But I am a responsible man and I don't want to make problems to the gpg community.
I don't want to make her to feel bad or different. Thats why I did not asked him to add one photo.
Is that forced in this case? is not enogh to be sure about her identity? I am forbide to sign by the gpg rules?
Thank you for your answer and sorry about my bad english

This is one of the keys of this matter.
Pretend to argue on something not knowing the basics just because you have your delightful brilliant common sense is ... very common but not so usefull.  And it represents a open interstelar gate to tolls.  They do not need sight, knowledge or logical arguing, they just need to provoque. Not quality needed The more quality you give in a witting, the more interesting and usefull it Jean-Ren? M?rou
