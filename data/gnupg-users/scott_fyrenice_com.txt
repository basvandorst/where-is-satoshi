@_subject: where to start? 
I run both Win xp and ubuntu 8.10. My wife runs win xp on her laptop. We are
at the point now where we both want to enable encrypted emailing AND we want
to find a nice way of educating those we email to often, or with whom we
exchange sensitive information, in how to use gnupg to encrypt email back
and forth. Where should I start?
