I wonder why the behavior may differ?

I assume the amount of entropy is what really matters. for instance,
if on every next step you are free to choose any of 4 random words
taken from 60000-word dictionary, you may put it in a grammatically
correct form[*], then you must get a certain entropy per step.
* Depending on the language, there may be more than one correct form
(past, future, plural, first or second person, modified with
a preposition...), but this randomness is hard to ensure.

60000/4 is more than 13 bits; 2 bits is not a lot compared to 13,
but the result may be much easier to remember.
I see; it's a different issue.

I wonder why to do the same work multiple times (once for every OS)
rather than to maintain a single translation upstream.

They may have different reasons to use smartcards. for isntance,
I considered using them because it seemed more convenient
to enter a 6 digits long PIN than a 40+ characters long
passphrase --- rather than because I thought it would be
inherently more secure.

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

Indeed, with pinentry-gtk-2, it works both ways.
Curiously, when I --export-secret-keys with --batch, it still requests
the password.
