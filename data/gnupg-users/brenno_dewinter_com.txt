Currently I have two keys one is PGP and one is GnuPG. In my GnuPG I imported the PGP-key under my same name. Now I want to trust myself fully. But when I do gpg --edit-key brenno I always get the GPG-key I cannot edit the PGP-key :(

in desperate need of encryption for windows you even pointed me towards

Then I see two options:
1. Have GnuPG incorporated in PHP (if the licenses allow this do they
Werner)? In that case there would be GnuPG as a routine.
2. Else you could consider writing the content to a file (since you can't
pipe in Windows like you can in UNIX). Encrypt it and then add the content
to the mail. I think it's not the nicest solution, but that might just work.
For decrypting there is no solution then .....

Hi Andrew,
Sounds like an interesting twist. I did some PHP myself. Maybe I can help.
Some questions: 1. Okay what happens? What does it doesn't work mean?
2. Anything in the log files?
3. Does it work if you address gpg manually?
On a different note: since your linking to gpg I was wondering if you GPL your
solutions. I think people could use such code very well....

Have you tried Enigmail? It's a good integrated solution. I personally
welcome the move, because there is one less battle to fight alone:
trying to get people to use mail encryption. With gnupg we wouldn't
convince users. As long as we are interoperable we're okay.

changing now. Thinks like Gnome, KDE, OpenOffice and Mozilla have been a
big step forward. Btw. Enigmail is platform independent (also for

@_subject: Suggestion: Coporate keyrings. 
Hash: SHA1
Dear all,
The last couple of days I had some thoughts that I'd like to share with
you. Currently GnuPG is only focussed around an individual user, which
is logic since that's the OpenPGP spec. If I think about deployment in
businesses another model ought to be considered as well. Address-lists
in general are personal and that makes automatically keyrings also
personal. Within businesses it's common practice to have an e-mail list
for an entire organization. Keyservers will help us somewhat in
obtaining public keys. Those keys are not verified and fingerprints
still have to be exchanged.
My suggestion is following: Let's build a system that supports corporate
keyrings. An administrator can verify the keys and set a trust. The
local GnuPG could access that keylist and rely on it's trust. Such a
thing would be a setting in GnuPG. GnuPG communicates with the
keyserver. The exchange model has to be secure as well, so that spoofing
and other abuse isn't too easy to do (a keyset on the server could play
an important role to sign the transmissions).
If I'm not totally of track I would say that the majority of
functionality is available already so that change may sound shocking,
but might be relatively easy to implement. However the benefits could be
huge. I'm curious on how the community reacts to this suggestion ...

Nope my idea went a little bit further. Also non-corporate users could be
verified (for instance: support Beside that
having a corporate key has some practical problems like passphrases and so.
The thing is that we should sign and work as persons, but might want to share
the infrastructure. I thought of this myself, but found corporate keys to be

So if I get it correct now we would only need some supporting programs
(interfacing) on top of what already exists. That step would make it
even better. I still feel we should explicitly generate the solution.

Hash: SHA1
Dear all,
Recently my key expired and so I created a new one (gpg 1.2.1). Now some
programs like KMail, Evolution refuse to use this new key even though
it's been set as the default key. Also I noticed that the entire keyring
is considered not trusted. Many of my entries have been verified so I
tried signing them. The system asks my passphrase, but doesn't really
sign the key. What am I missing here?

I did and it decrypts just fine. However encrypting doesn't work,
neither does signing the keys (needed to be able to crypt with KMail).
Amazingly Enigmail voor Mozilla/Netscape seems to be more lenient and
let me crypt towards others.

That might be so. But I have indicated several times that this shouldn't
be the default key.
That's what I should have done :-(. Now I can't delete the old one since
I still have old e-mails to store.... The fact of life is that I stopped
short of thinking this properly over.
