@_subject: FTP server is down... 
Hi there,
I?ve been trying to get the win32 port of the sha1sum util from
but it looks like the server, as of this writing, is down. :-(
Just thought the site admins would like to know...

Well, you must have a valid working e-mail address to sign up to any of the
above mentioned.
When they want to reset their passwords, they are sent a verification email
to the registered email address.
So you can't sign up for services without email...

I've said for years that in the ages of dial-up internet, particularly the
DOS+Windows 3.x years, people had a barrier of entry in getting a dial-up
modem, getting the right RS232 card (one with a 16550 FIFO to avoid probs),
configuring it, and setting up Trumpet Winsock plus any necessary log-in
script required by the ISP.
That left a lot of people out, leaving just the persistent who tooks things
seriously, or the techies. :)
While I look back at those years with joy -the "pioneers", not to mention
the real Unix pioneers before the WWW-, today I thank that my mother or my
old man can grab a tablet and send me e-mail.

@_subject: Java library for OpenPGP 
It's a JNI wrapper, in other words, Java code calling native C libraries
It's not the same as a pure-Java library that is cross platform, like
"The Bouncy Castle Crypto package is a Java implementation of cryptographic
algorithms. The package is organised so that it contains a light-weight API
suitable for use in any environment (including the J2ME) "
