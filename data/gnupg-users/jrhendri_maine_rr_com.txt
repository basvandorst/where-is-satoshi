@_subject: GPG problem Urgent please 
Hmmm.. Interesting (and common) thread.
Here's a couple thoughts.
1) If there is any budget, look at MoveIT and MoveIT-DMZ
 They do a pretty good job of allowing legacy clients
to work and have a VB script interface for customization.
2) If you want to use GnuPG, there are a couple things to point out:
  - The scripting works quite well with the Perl module GnuPG::Interface
  - The insecurity of a decryption key on-disk can be somewhat reduced by
using two keys like this:
  Create a "file transfer key" that will be used for the exchange, but give
it an automatic expiration date based on the type of data, etc.   Sign the "file transfer key" with a real admin's key that will never have
it's passphrase stored on disk.
  This way if the transfer key gets corrupted, and you *know* about it, you
can create a new one, etc. etc. If it gets compromised and you *don't* know
about it right away, it will limit the amount of time it will be of any
  If someone tries to insert a "fake" key (including storing the passphrase
*they* know on disk, you will know it because it won't be signed by the
admin's key.
Not a perfect solution, but easily adjusted for various types of data ( you
should use a different "file transfer key" for each different "interface" or
site you exchange files with ).
Good luck!

I am facing a problem with gpg. i want to decrypt a file and i want all the
decryption information to be incorporated in gpg command itself. i have this
requirement because i need to use it in shell script
if i give command
gpg --decrypt a.gpg     It ask me for passpharase on command promt
but i want to use this command in the shell so i need to provide the
passphrase along with the command so i tried this
gpg --decrypt a.pgp  --passphrase-fd 'my passpharase'
but this dont work can anyone please help me out solving this

do you know if it was encrypted with ascii-armor?
I have seen problems with non-ascii systems sending files with wierd

@_subject: can you deny you sent a signed e-mail? 
It is usually more useful to be able to indicate you *did* send an email,
sign a document, etc.
To be useful for non-repudiation, you need to have a policy that states you
are responsible for all actions using your account/key/whatever and you are
expected to use proper care to protect that account/key/whatever.
Similar to if you are issued a physical door key and claim "it wasn't me,
somebody stole my keys". You may introduce reasonable doubt, but you also
reduce your own credibility (in that event and in the future).

@_subject: storing password lists in mails to myself on IMAP? 
What you are doing works. But take a look at password safe (Bruce Schneier &
Counterpane labs). Also Password Gorilla (compatible w/ password safe)
If you are truly paranoid, you could encrypt and email the safe back and
forth w/ gpg, or carry it on a USB stick.

@_subject: IT Department having the secure key. 
Although it is controversial, look into key escrow.
One possibility is to allow (require via policy?) users to encrypt data to a
single central escrow key (that you store offline) in addition to any other
keys they use. Then if recovery is required, the escrow key can be used to
decrypt the data.
The policies and procedures for use of this *must* be well defined up front.
How and under what circumstances this is used, etc. Otherwise you risk
losing the trust of your users.
One possibility is to encrypt the escrow private key, storing the passphrase
separately from the key so that two parties are required to recover data
(e.g. put the key on a CD or USB stick in one safe, put the passphrase in a
sealed envelope in a different safe)
Just thoughts.

i wish to setup GNUpg for my work (i am the IT Administrator) but i have a
few questions.
First: if the user creates a key and then leaves the company. assuming
he/she didnt tell anyone the pass phrase and was the only key used, are
those files locked for ever?
if this is so my idea was the IT department (i.e. me) create the keys for
all my users and use a complete random password for all, then backup those
keys. then issue them to the user and allow them to change the pass phrase
to something they prefer. then if the user leaves we can use the originally
backed up key with the original password to decrypt the files they
will this work? i know it may sound like a security risk and ruin the whole
point of encrypting in the first place but this is the only way i can think
of safe gaurding the companies data (not users data).
Also have another question.
if a users key is compromised i.e. someone knows their pass phrase. should
the user just change the pass phrase or should a new key be generated? and
if a new key is needed will all the files that were encrypted with the old
key be in danger of be decrypted or be totally useless without the old key?
Sorry if this has been answered before or a dumb question. i am new to this

@_subject: cloudy understanding of asymmetric cryptography 
Yup - you got it.
Symmetric encryption is *way* faster (that's a technical term :-) than
Hence the slower version is used to exchange a random key that is then used
to handle the encryption/decryption of the data.
Algorithms are implementation dependent but it is common to use 3DES for the
symmetric. Hash: SHA1
Someone today shook my understanding of asymmetric ciphers.
_Bob performs symmetric encryption on message with_
_key "K" (generated randomly). He then encrypts "K" _
_with Alice's public key, and sends both the symetrically _
_encrypted message and asymmetrically encrypted key to Alice_
Is this what happens during most/some/all of public-key
communications? I had always thought that the message is encrypted
with public key, and decrypted with secret key. I was not aware that
key "K" was encrypted with public key, but message encrypted with
To help my understanding a little futher, if this does not always
occur, or does not usually occur, when does it occur (not occur)?
Using what ciphers (algorithms)?
I was unable to find adequate explanations online.
