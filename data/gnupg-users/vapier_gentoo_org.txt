@_subject: controlling the use of subkeys 
i do signing of Gentoo packages and historically i would just generate a new key and sign that with my normal public one ... when the last one expired, i decided to try and use subkeys
so my main key i get everyone to sign is E837F581 and i use that when signing my e-mails ... i created a new subkey just for signing Gentoo packages and that is 205D3103 ... now when i sign e-mails or files, my main key is no longer used, just my subkey ... how can i control this behavior ?
$ gpg -K
sec   4096R/E837F581 2002-11-17
uid                  Mike Frysinger uid                  Mike Frysinger (GMAIL) ssb   1024D/205D3103 2006-12-16
$ gpg --clearsign foo
You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: "Mike Frysinger "
1024-bit DSA key, ID 205D3103, created 2006-12-16 (main key ID E837F581)
why is it using 205D3103 ? :(

the average Gentoo user isnt going to ever care or even notice ... the signing aspects are all handled by portage
user does `emerge pkg` and emerge goes and validates all of the keys
sorry, yes ... they've been signing my Gentoo uid
and what would you suggest ?  create brand new key sets when the previous one expires ?  i thought one of the points of subkeys is to minimize this sort of

ok, but i think this is a different aspect than what we're talking about here ... sep keys means different uid's whereas a subkey is bound to the same uid ... people sign my uid and i have signing subkeys versus people sign my uid, i create a new key/uid and sign that with my own key
subkeys can have expiration limits placed on them as well, so i dont see how your thoughts here are specific to saying "subkeys are the wrong way of doing things" ... what'd i miss ?

probably, but that doesnt really matter to me much ... all the intricacies of pgp do not interrest me, it's merely a tool to get other things done
i have a personal key/uid i use for signing e-mails and such, E837F581.  when doing gpg signing parties, this is what other people sign.  in Gentoo, rather than using personal keys, we create a new key to keep personal and developer package signing separate.
historically, i would just create a new key/uid (for example, the last one i was using was CC2BD2F2).  then i would sign that with ultimate trust using my personal key.
this time around, i thought i'd be lazy and just create a subkey off of E837F581 since it seemed to be a bit quicker (205D3103).  then i noticed that even though i told some programs to use E837F581 to do signing, they'd turn around and use the subkey 205D3103, thus this e-mail chain ive started.
