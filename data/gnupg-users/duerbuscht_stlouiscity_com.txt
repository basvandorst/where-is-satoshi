@_subject: GPG 2.0.1  No passphrase 
I downloaded and compiled the GPG 2.0.1 release (SLES 9, 64 bit for

o ok this is correct
But then, it doesn't ask me for a passphrase.  It seems to directly go
into calculating the key.  As in it asks me the question, but doesn't
wait for the answer:
Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? o
You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.
gpg-agent[3973]: directory `/home/boat1/.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d'

You don't want a passphrase - this is probably a *bad* idea!
I will do it anyway.  You can change your passphrase at any time,
using this program with the option "--edit-key".
We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.
Is this an error in the code or am I just not seeing the option that
needs to be on the command line?  gpg (1.4) does wait for the
