@_subject: EGD - central entropy pipe possible? 
Is it possible to have one central entropy pipe (say, /usr/local/etc/entropy)
instead of the default of having each person make one?  Don't know if there's an advantage besides making things a little easier for the user by not having to worry about what EGD is.

I was able to, but using /opt/softbench/bin/cc with CFLAGS set to
"-Ae +DA1.1 +DS2.0 -D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE".  Maybe you can turn off strict ANSI mode for gcc (which seems odd since the default is not to use strict

Fine.  Since I know what each option to the compiler does, I know what
can affect configure tests.  And if I screw up, I can back out again.  Besides, I've done this a lot, so I know what exactly I manage to mangle.
My experience has been that none of what I did to config.status resulted in "subtle and hard to detect errors".  I don't assert that this is the way everyone running HPUX should do it.  I only asserted that doing it the way I did results in a good compile, and a binary that passes all the checks.
Modifying the DYNAMIC_CIPHER_MODS in config.status ensures that this variable propagates to the cipher subdirectory.  Running configure, even with --disable-dev-random and without --with-capabilities (which is supposed to be the default, to exclude Linux capabilities) does not get
rid of rndlinux as one of the DYNAMIC_CIPHER_MODS.  So, this was the only way I could remove rndlinux without munging up cipher/Makefile.in (which I ended up having to do, anyway).
As for CC, the -Ae is a superset to the default -Aa flag which configure will set.  +DA1.1 and +DS2.0 do nothing to whether the compiler accepts a piece of code or not: it just modifies output to be able to run on two families of the PA-RISC processor.
With CFLAGS, I agree that I might have trouble with defining - -D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE without having configure run through its checks.  But, I was lazy and didn't want to wait around for the time it would take for configure to re-run from scratch.  I'm impatient, and cavalier with configure.  Sosumi.

Oh, and another thing.  I've found certain things (don't remember exactly what) that dump core if I use ansic but not if I use softbench.

I just reconfigured, and tried to compile with gcc 2.95.2:
 CC=gcc
 CFLAGS=-g -D_HPUX_SOURCE -D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE
and had no problems. Do you have any more info that could be useful?
