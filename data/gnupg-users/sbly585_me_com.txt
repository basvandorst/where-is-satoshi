Hash: SHA1
I have what I think is a fairly simple GPG question, but the answer  seems to be alluding me no matter how much I go over the  documentation. I want to export a public key from the command line but  in minimal format with everything except the self-signatures removed.  In reading the docs it looks as if "gpg --export-minimal ..." should  work, but I keep getting invalid command messages. What is the proper  syntax, please?

Thanks to all. Some of these commands can be wickedly difficult!
