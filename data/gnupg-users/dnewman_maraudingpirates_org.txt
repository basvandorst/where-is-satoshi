Hi there,
I'm still trying to wrap my brain around this web-of-trust
concept.  I verify the validity of another user's public key and I sign it?  So know I am saying that I trust this
person because their key is signed with my secret key.
How do I send the signature back to the user?  I don't
see a way to export the signature.  Do I export the public
key and email it back and my signature gets merged
back into their key ring?  And what about keyservers?
Does re-adding a public key with additional signatures
update the entry in the keyserver?
