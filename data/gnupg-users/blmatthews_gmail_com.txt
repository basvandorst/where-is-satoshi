@_subject: gpg bug 
I'm installing gpg from source and ran into a problem. I'm making gnupg-2.2.20 on an iMac running macos 10.14.6. I've done
$ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/gnu
$ make
successfully. However, on make check I found that it doesn't work if I have a space in PATH. I do because VMWare Fusion adds "/Applications/VMware Fusion.app/Contents/Public" to PATH, but VMWare Fusion isn't required to reproduce the problem, if I just do:
$ PATH="$PATH:a b" make check
I get (after the tests in common, kbx, sm, scd, and tools pass):
Making check in openpgp
LC_ALL=C EXEEXT= PATH=../gpgscm:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.8/bin:/Users/blm/perl5/bin:/Users/blm/bin:/Users/blm/gnu/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:a b abs_top_srcdir=/Users/blm/src/3rdparty/gpg/gnupg-2.2.20 objdir=/Users/blm/src/3rdparty/gpg/gnupg-2.2.20 GPGSCM_PATH=/Users/blm/src/3rdparty/gpg/gnupg-2.2.20/tests/gpgscm make[2]: *** [xcheck] Error 127
make[1]: *** [check-recursive] Error 1
make: *** [check-recursive] Error 1
If I don't add "a b" to PATH, make check completes successfully.
The workaround is obvious so I have everything installed and running, but thought you might want to know.
I'm not on the mailing list and didn't want to create an account on the bug tracking site just for this.
