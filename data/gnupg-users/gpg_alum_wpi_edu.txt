@_subject: re. Moving from PGP to GnuPG and other questions ... 
Before I sign someone's key, I like to verify the email addresses
associated with each UID.  I do this with a small emacs "plugin" which
uses Gnus to generate and send encrypted challenge messages to each
uid, given a keyid.
It's here: For each uid, I generate a random challenge string.  I'll only sign
a uid if I get a matching challenge string back.
Maybe this is overkill, but I like it!

@_subject: BZIP2 algorithm 
Rather than installing from source, the correct thing to do here
would be to install the bzip2 library "dev" package:
# apt-get install libbz2-dev
You can use dpkg to verify that it contains the files you
$ dpkg -L libbz2-dev
In the future, if you're looking for a development package, and
you don't know what to install, I'd recommed using the apt-file
utility. (install with "apt-get install apt-file")
First, make sure the file lists are up-to-date:
# apt-file update
[snip output]
Next, search by filename pattern:
# apt-file search bzlib.h
libbz2-dev: usr/include/bzlib.h
Similarly, you can use "apt-cache" to search package names and
Make sure the package lists are up-to-date:
# apt-get update
[snip output]
Search based on name/description:
$ apt-cache search bz2 development        libbz2-dev - high-quality block-sorting file compressor library - development
Hope that helps in the future,
