@_subject: Bad signature (was: Re: GPG support in Mahogany) 
I have no problems verifying your signature with Evolution 1.2, Ingo.  I
do have problems with Evolution 1.2 and inline signatures,=20
What I don't like about the latest version of Evolution is that it will
not automatically detect encrypted messages unless they were sent with
another PGP/MIME MTU.  Upon receiving encrypted messages, I have to save
the mail as a file and manually decrypt from the command line (I'm using
Linux Redhat 8.0).
The previous version of Evolution did not seem to have this problem.=20
*sigh*... I'm going to have to seriously consider switching to something
else - Evolution just seems to have issues with signatures and
decryption, which is unfortunate.
