gpg, or encryption in general about a month ago, but I installed gpg on
Windows nt, joined this list, and then learned while moving some of our
companies encryption from pgp to gpg and writing a very simple dll wrapper
for it.  confused by it and just went back to the command line.  I haven't opened it
since.  For me, unless it just takes more time I'd rather just do it at the
command prompt then launch a gui.  Perhaps that's one reason I prefer unix
type systems over windows even though I'm forced to work almost exclusively
on nt. Some people are like me some aren't, that's why I suggested look at
the commands in the man page. If it makes sense, run it and if you want a
gui then install the shell.  I don't agree with your help. If your are new (ie. "Newbie") to GPG or PGP
for that matter there is a learning curve which is substantial. I was a new
user a few months ago. IMHO I think installing back-end with front-end and
joining a mailing list whose purposes is to facilitate learning GPG or PGP
is the way to go.

@_subject: How do I supply a password and decrypt on NT 
I'm running gnupg on NT (not by choice).  Anyway, I need to be able to
automate encryption and decryption.  What should I use to do this and is it
I can decrypt using:
gpg --decrypt source.txt > output.txt
But is there a way around being prompted for a password?
I tried the --passphrase-fd option, but cannot find a way to assign a file
descriptor in windows or to feed it someone through the standard input.  Is
there a way to do this in windows?  Can I do something by running in batch mode?  I don't have a good
understanding of running that way and have not found documentation for
decryption in batch mode.
I need something automated so I'm basically hacking my way to a com
component that has api calls to send a dos command and return the output.  I
then parse the output to see if it succeeded.  The problem is I need to get
around the password prompt on decryption.  Any help would be very much
appreciated.  I've tried everything in the man pages and can't see a way to
do this on windows.

@_subject: Suppressing passphrase prompt 
To get around the passphrase prompt on NT:
As someone else pointed out, you can use --passphrase-fd n to pass a file
descriptor.  Unfortunately, file descriptors are more the realm of Unix type
systems than Windows.  I think this does work on Windows if you can get the
proper system file handle which, as I understand it, is not too difficult in
C++ or C.  Unfortunately, all I have available to work with is VB.  I tried
a few APIs to get the correct system file handle to pass and it was never
the correct one.  (If someone knows the correct API, I would love to have
That left me with --passphrase-fd 0 which is the common input.  I tried to
pipe the password a la Unix, but while Dos does support pipes to an extent,
that did not work.  I finally found deep in the mail archives the following:
use --passphrase-fd 0 and redirect the password file on the end using <
passfile.txt.  In other words:
c:\gnupg\gpg -o outputfile.txt --passphrase-fd 0 --decrypt c:\test.txt <
password.txt  Dos will read the password file and use it properly. This is
the only way I have found to do it outside of a C solution.  It is a little ugly, but I implemented it by building a COM component in VB
that first defines tmp files.  1 for the password if necessary, 1 for the
source file to decrypt, 1 for a .bat file, and 1 for the decrypted or
encrypted output.  Then, I build the proper command string and put it in the
bat file.  Next, I run the bat file with the createprocess api and wait for
it to finish.  I then check for an exit code of 0 (In limited testing gpg
almost always produced 0), but to really verify I check the size of the
output file.  Then I delete all temp files immediately whether the process
worked or not.
It is ugly, but it does provide an automated solution which is pretty
invisible to the developer since all they do is use the methods on the dll.
Another solution is to remove the password on your secret key.  This is
probably the best solution since I have some vb code I downloaded that lets
you open a pipe, run a command, and parse the output which would let you
know if it really worked.  Unfortunately, the pipe gets confused with me
redirecting the password so I cannot use that with the above.  I'm not
really sure it is much move unsecure than the above anyway.

My Isn't this popular lately !  I have had the same issue.
I had tried a similar version of what you are doing using pipes and could
not get it to work.
One not so great work around is to write the password to a temporary file,
and then do the following:
c:\gnupg\gpg --passphrase-fd 0 -o outputfile.exe --decrypt c:\decrypted.txt
< passwordfile.txt
That works with a create process api, but will probably give you errors with
pipes.  Try it though and see.  It has trouble with the redirect.
The code above is the best way I know to do it without C code.
I used the above code with the createprocess api and rolled all that into a
com component and I just reference the dll.  It always checks for an output
file to make sure it actually worked.

@_subject: bad passphrase error passing it into GPG on Windows 98 using 
I agree with what you are saying.  However, all I know is that on Windows
NT, this is the only way I could get it to work with --passphrase-fd 0.  I
would have preferred to use a proper file handle, but not having C available
at work and not being a C programmer, I could never find an api that VB
could use to get the proper system level file handle, so I had to resort to
fd 0, and I tried piping and redirecting the password but for some reason
the command line only interpreted redirecting the file correctly.  If
someone has found a way to pipe the actual password to fd 0 on the command
line in Windows, I would love to know how because I would obviously rather
do that than write a temp file just to use for the password and then destroy
There is an example in the archives of "password | gpg --passphrase-fd 0
etc....".  Maybe this works in Dos proper or on other Windows versions but
it does not work on NT.
