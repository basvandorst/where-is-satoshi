@_subject: gpg does not ask for a passphrase anymore 
Hello to all, I use gpg for many years and never got a problem. Usually I encrypt files and directory with public key system. Recently I install duplicity and afterwards I have a strange problem I do not know to solve. The problem is that now if I decrypt an encrypted file, gpg decrypts it without asking the passphrase. I do not know what happened as before it always asked the passphrase but now not anymore.
Is anybody having a suggestion on how to make gpg to ask the passphrase again? Many thanks               Giuliano
