@_subject: Using a smart card with revoked keys 
some time ago I lost my card reader, so I revoked the keys on the smart
card because I wouldn't have been able to use them for quite some time,
until I got a new one.
Now I managed to get a new card reader, and I discovered that gpg
doesn't want to use those subkeys: if I try to decode some old data that
was encoded with the smart card key, I get "secret key not available",
without even being asked the pin.
Is that because they are revoked?  Is there a way to use the smart card
Additional details:
  gpg --list-secret-keys doesn't show the keys that are on the smart
  card, although gpg --edit-key lists them as revoked.
