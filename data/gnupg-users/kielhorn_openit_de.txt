Gnus runs inside of Emacs, so it's available on a gazillion of
platforms including W*nd*ws.
Let me take the opportunity to ask the Gnus
users/maintainers/contributors on this list whether anybody knows
something about the future plans of GnuPG (OpenPGP) integration into
Gnus? (Josh,Florian,Simon?)
Not shure about mutt, maybe it runs on W*nd*ws under the
Cygwin environment?
