Somebody else reported this with an earlier version and I have
observed it with on IRIX 6.5 with both versions I've used.
Following in the previous poster's footsteps I used GNU make and had
no trouble.  I have not had time to look into what the Irix make was
trying to do but this is not the only package where GNU make was
A less satisfactory approach which I had tried earlier was to compile
without the assembly routines.  This presumably slows execution but
works if you cannot get GNU make.
I hope this helps.
