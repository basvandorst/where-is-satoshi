@_subject: keyblock resource: file open error 
I do not understand the following error message:
gpg: keyblock resource `"D:/Program Files/GnuPG"': file open error
gpg: keyblock resource `"D:/Program Files/GnuPG"': file open error
gpg: Go ahead and type your message ...
My system:
gpg 1.0.6-2 from gpg-w32-1.0.6-2.zip
installed in D:/Program Files/GnuPG
My registry has an entry \\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\GNU\GnuPG\HomeDir
pointing to "D:/Program Files/GnuPG"
pubring.gpg and secring.gpg both exist in this directory, although both
have length 0 bytes.
I cannot find any reference to this error message in the FAQ, the User
Guide (manual.pdf) or the mini-HowTo files. thanks for any help
