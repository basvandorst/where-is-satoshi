@_subject: Extract numbers from a key 
I would like to know an easy way to get numbers used in a key.
For example, in a RSA key, N and e (used like this: message^e modulus N)
Here is one RSA 1024 bits public key:
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: GnuPG v1.4.10 (GNU/Linux)
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
What are N and e ?

I know that gpg is an hybrid system.
I want to know these numbers to check with a mathematica-like program that numbers supposed to be primes are actually real prime numbers.

I tried the --with-key-data option which gives the numbers I'm looking for. Unfortunately, this doesn't work with the secret key.
I tried with pgpdump but it doesn't work anymore because numbers in secret keys are encrypted.
Is there any way to decrypt these numbers in the secret key?

I success to catch the numbers with a blank passphrase and pgpdump.
I found something strange with the number d. The operation e*d mod phi is not equal to 1, as expected with the RSA algo. I looked in cipher/rsa.c and I found that d is evaluated to match e*d mod f = 1 , with f = phi/gcd((p-1),(q-1)) .
Why is it coded like that ? Is it safe ?
