@_subject: Older self signature not stripped 
it happened that I have multiple self signatures on some of my uids:
I read that gnupg automatically strips older self signatures when
importing keys, but with
gpg --recv-keys D5CE4FE9
gpg --list-sigs D5CE4FE9
this doesn't seem to apply to my key (gpg 1.2.3). Why?
