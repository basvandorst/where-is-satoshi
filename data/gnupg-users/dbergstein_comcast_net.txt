@_subject: Replacing PGP (Freeware 7.0.3) by gnuPG + gpgSHELL 
Have you tried exporting the PGP 7.0.3 keys as ascii armored files?  If not,
the native pgp binary format may be causing some issues when importing these
keys to GnuPG.

I would like to replace PGP freeware 7.0.3 by gnuPG
and GPGshell. I am using Windows Me with 256MB  RAM.
When I try to import my keys, I get an error message
(number 53) telling me that gpgSHELL does not find
the file I supplied and which has been exported from
PGP Keys. Does anybody knows what is happening?
Thank you in advance

@_subject: Installing GNUPG 1.0.7 to windows 
Johan is correct, the Mingw32/CPD package instructions in the gnupg source
code are intended for cross compiling the win32 binary on linux.  As a
referece, please see my post at
 regarding
patches I used to successfully compile a working win32 gnupg 1.0.7 binary.
If anyone has trouble with the MIME encoding on the HTML list, please advise
and I can send the patches via private email or post them where folks can
download a copy.

I am glad to hear that the patches I posted helped you.  Credit for the HKP
keyserver patch actually belongs to Keith Ray (nullify.org); his original
PGP signatures were retained within that patch file.  The ws2_32 libraries
never worked for me either, that is why I linked the executable to wsock32
Maybe you can enlighten me as to the purpose of the files in the "po"
subdirectory.  One of our fellow users, Brad Tarver, on cc: encountered the
same issue you did with the missing makefile.

Hash: SHA1
To Rich's point, that is why I finally spent some time and got a w32
version of gnupg to cross-compile via mingw32-cpd on one of my linux
boxes.  If you can't trust a 3rd party to supply the binary for your
platform, it makes sense to compile it yourself.  Trouble is, the w32
compile process for gnupg (1.07 or earlier versions) is not as
straightforward as I would like.  The compile session wasn't pretty but
the executable works fine and there are no extra "unsupported" ciphers
The patches I used included the HKP keyserver patch from nullify.org, a
configure patch to use wsock32 instead of ws2_32 (this was not in the
win32api I used and did not work when it was added), and a patch to
eliminate compile conflicts with strgutil.c. If anyone is interested I
can post a binary archive with my signature along with all the patches I
used to get the binary to compile.

This code from g10/keygen.c may help pinpoint the issue:

That is excellent.  I am glad I could help you.  Having the source code is a
very good friend in circumstances like this one.  I have read about the need
for EGD on certain non-linux platforms so it's great to hear that solved the
issue for you.

Maybe someone on this list can correct me but the error you reported may
mean an entropy gathering daemon (EGD) is not installed on your platform or
you need to point gpg to a different keyring using the --homedir option.

It would be nice if one could actually quit receiving information from these
lists if one should choose to.  After repeated attempts to no avail I will
be contacting my server to report what now amounts to spam and ask them to
take action to no longer accept information from any gng lists.  For a list
that is about computing information - albeit encrypting - I am amazed at the
lack of information available to be removed from the list.

@_subject: rpm --checksig problem 
I'm not sure if this might help, but one user was able to import his rpm keys for MDK 9.2 from his CDROM media.  In case the link below gets broken from linewrapping, he mounted his install media and entered:
rpm --import /mnt/cdrom/RPM-GPG-KEYS

@_subject: OT? rpm --checksig problem 
You may need to see if the path for the public keyring that RPM uses in MDK 9.2 is different than 9.0.   On my MDK 9.0 systems, the file that controls this behaviour is /etc/rpm/macros (see below for sample).
# /etc/rpm/macros
%_signature     gpg
%_gpg_path      /etc/rpm-keys
