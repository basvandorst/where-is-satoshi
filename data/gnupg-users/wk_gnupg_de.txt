@_subject: Changing passphrase and associated IDs 
The command is called "passwd" - sounds familiar, right.
The other command is "adduid".  It is not wise to remove a user ID
because all user IDs will be merged by the keyservers anyway.  The
manual explains this in detail (the online draft version).
To enter these commands you use:
$ gpg --edit-key foo
