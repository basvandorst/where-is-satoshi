@_subject: stripping header-information 
is there a simple way to strip header information which identifies a
file as gnupg-encrypted?
There is no gpg-option, but I suppose that it should be possible; at
least for symetric-encryption.
Sometimes it could be useful if an eavesdropper is not able to distinct
beetween random noise and a real message.

The --no-version omits only the version-string in clear text signature.
If I do "gpg -c --no-version secure.txt" with different keys the first
six bytes are almost the same.

The raw output of a good crypto-system should not have a statistical
profile. Of course, if a programm should work over networks with
different systems there has to be a protocol like OpenPGP in which the
raw-output is embedded.
I am looking for a tool to make the OpenPGP-output statistically
equal("white noise").
Unfortunately "PGP stealth" does not work with OpenPGP.

As described in the docs Gnupg itself uses secure, not swapped memory.
So the private key should be rather safe, even if someone steals my
But how can I use an application like vim, having the plaintext only
in memory and not swapped on the disk?
Is there , apart from crypted filesystems, an possible software-solution on GNU/Linux, perhaps something like a wrapper which executes the editor in a "safe" memory area?
