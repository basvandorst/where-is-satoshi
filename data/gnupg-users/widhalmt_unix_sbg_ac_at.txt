@_subject: gnupg in large scale at University 
I already sent this email twice to this mailinglist, but it didn't appear at my mailserver, so I assume it didn't reach any of you.
I just got in charge of managing Linux- and Unix servers at the University of Salzburg (Austria) and one of my first tasks is to implement a secure way of exchanging email and storing data. Having a big affection to Free Software, I try to implement a solution based upon gpg.
My biggest problem is, that our users have many different mailclients, mostly MS Outlook connected to MS exchange.
Maybe some of you could help me with some details:
I need a plugin for Outlook which support gpg/MIME and maybe inline gpg. (Not Gdata, this didn't work out)
I think it would be a good idea to create a CA. How to achieve that? How to keep the key save? Is just one person the CA, or a bunch of people? What if someone leaves us? What if an employee leaves, loses his email address but still has a signature. Should we revoke it?
Is it possible/useful to create an own keyserver which synchronises with the official ones? How to do that?
I have some ideas, but need more input. Maybe some of you could help me out.

I just got in charge of some of the Linux- und Unix- Servers at the

our organizational unit to communicate safely via Email and store data

gnupg. Maybe you can help me with some ideas. I'm searching the web and I'm
writing to others as well, but since this is a big task, I want as many
opinions as I can get:
I need plugins for many different clients. Unfortunately most of the
users have MS Outlook for their primary Mail Client, so I need a plugin

I think, it would be a could idea to create our own CA. Maybe you have
some experiences to share? How many people should have access to the CAs

employee with a signed key leaves, etc.
Maybe it would even be an option to create an own keyserver. Is this
useful or would it be far too overpowered?
Thanks a lot,

Thanks. :-)
Yes, we think the same way... But unfortunately its not up to me to decide on our primary mail client. And as I remember, it was hard enough to switch from Eudora to Outlook, so I'm not too positive on changing again to soon.
Ah! I used both of them, but I lost the link to g10 (and the name, so I couldn't google). Thanks a lot!
I, for myself use Thunderbird on any Windows PC I have to use. But unfortunately many of our users are rather fixated to Outlook.
Ok, we think the same way for many details. I would rather cut off my right ear but to know the passphrase of one of our users. ;-)
I would create a key for our department to sign the users keys. And this would available only to some special administrators. e.g. those who know the root passwords of the domain controllers or mailservers. Well it is. But creating this possibility is a mixture of low priority task for my employer and a hobby to me. So I will take some time for creating this. First I need a simple and easy to use solution for encrypting and signing mails and single files. Bigger tasks like own SSL certificates, etc. will follow but are not on my schedule for now.
I will write howtos and make tutorials and maybe even some short courses for the users. So everyone who wants to join is able to and knows about what he/she is doing. This includes that using this possibilities will be a choice of them and not obligatory. Thanks for your other mail.

Thanks for this is hint. I will tell this link to my co workers who work on windows boxes so they can evaluate it. I found several plugins which can't do what I need, but this one sounds rather nice to me.
Thanks a lot,

@_subject: Reimporting key into gpgsm 
I managed to get my keys from CaCert.org into gpgsm via the openssl tools exporting them from Firefox. Considering it just for transport I used a far too simple passphrase while exporting and importing as I thought the passphrase of CaCert.org was written into the key itself. I tried to delete my key and do same procedure with a more complex key but it still uses the simple one. I deleted my whole keyring.kbx file and imported all anew but the issue stays the same. Could anyone help me changing my passphrase within

@_subject: What policy for signing keys do you use? 
Many people have their keys or key IDs and fingerprints on their websites which should be very hard to fake for an attacker. Website, key, key ID, all at a time just before it gets discovered.
But is this enough for you sign the key? Not locally but epxortable. I know of the policies of some CAs, who need a meeting in the real life, a passport and a signature.
So how do you deal with signatures? Is it irresponsible signing keys just with because of them being on a website with a fingerprint? Is it sufficient if you give "haven't checked anything" or "checked marginally" while signing. Or is this just for the local trustdb?
What about keys without real names but just nicknames?

Hash: SHA1
We established a gpg Key for the Unix- servers of the University of
Salzburg. And we want to offer signatures by our Certification key to
the public.
So if you are interested in signatures to your key, you may contact me
via this email- address. I can guide you how to get one. Please
understand, that you have to visit us in person.
We are looking for cross- signatures with other CAs, too. So please
contact us, if you want to change signatures.

I would really suggest using another Emailclient, but if you are stuck
to Outlook, try  . We try to establish
this as a standard features for all the MS Outlook users within our
Organizational Unit.
Feel free to ask, if you have any further questions.

Thanks for the notice. I saw my messages appearing some days after I
sent them. This looks rather strange to me as I would expect my messages
not appearing to me but not getting delivered with a delay of some days.

As far as I got from the documentation, gpgsm is no replacement but an
extension for gpg (even when it may be run alone) for using S/MIME.

@_subject: Expiry Date of Key used for signatures? 
Hash: SHA1
Just one simple question:
I put a expiry date on my key and I get a signature. If I change the
expiry date to a later date, will the signature expire at the first date
or will it stay valid?
Looking at my keyring I assume that if I sign a key with an expiry date,
my signature expires at the expiry date of the key. Most signatures have
the same expiry date as the key itself.
