@_subject: New to GnuPG and OpenGPG 
Hello everyone,
I am rookie to GPG, so please bare with me when I ask some 'rookie' questions ... :-)
I am trying to import keys into OpenPGP on an AIX box, which were created using GnuPG (version 1.48) on windows. I am getting the following error: -
%:     IBMpgp -verify my-win-key
                 IBMpgp Tool - RFC 2440 implementation on AIX
 Support Information
    Asymmetric algorithms: RSA, DSA
    Symmetric algorithms : Triple-DES, CAST5
    Hash algorithms      : SHA1, MD5
    Compression/Decompression : Not yet supported
                 Key Flags: Not handling at the moment ... skipping.
 Failed to verify the signature
I can import the keys into GnuPG on my windows machine, that were created by OpenPGP on the AIX box.
Is there a compatibility issue? Do I have to work with GnuPG version 2.08 to make this work.
Thanks in advance
Shaz Zeb

Hello all,
I can import IBMpgp generated pubkeys into GnuPG (on my windows machine), but am unable to do so the other way around.
If I try to import the GnuPG created keys into IBMpgp, I get "Failed to verify the signature"
