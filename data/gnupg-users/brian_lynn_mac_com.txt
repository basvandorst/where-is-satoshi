@_subject: Compiling GPG 1.0.7 in MacOS10.2 
I just started using GnuPG on Mac OS10.2 and an having problems. I followed all instructions but think that GPG did not compile properly. When I try to generate the keys using  either GPGKey or manually in the Terminal I get this message:
[Brian-Lynns-Computer:~] ronin1% gpg --gen-key
gpg: Command not found.
[Brian-Lynns-Computer:~] ronin1%
I really want to use GPG, but have no idea what to do now. Any help would be really appreciated. BTW please cc any response to
