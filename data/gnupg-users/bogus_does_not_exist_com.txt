@_subject: Using GPG to create virtual email addresses 
That's wrong. The signature has a fixed size because it's just a hash of fixed size, e.g. an MD5 hash is always 128 bit and a SHA-1 hash is always 160 bit. This means in base64 encoding (which has to be used because email header must only contain 7-bit ascii data) the size of the signature is at least 22 bytes (MD5) or 27 bytes (SHA-1).
See above.
For each key that is used for encryption the session key has to be encrypted with this key. This means that for each encryption key you have to at least add the size of the session key (which is at least another 128 bit, i.e. 22 bytes in base64 encoding).
Check out  for more information.

seems what what happens is that the signature is issued when a key is
requested FROM the server, and not when it is added TO the server.
The signatures are set to expire after 14 days.  If you request a key
from the GD from the 10-13th day onward (unclear where the dividing
line lies), it makes a new signature.
So, if you are relying on the GD signature to make a key valid, or
just do a --refresh-keys every now and then, then you'll end up with a
whole lot of expired signatures from the GD after a while.
I don't know if the 14-day thing is because the GD is still in beta
and the PGP folks don't want longer duration signatures out just yet.
Still, any way you look at it, expired GD signatures will eventually
build up, whether they increase every 2 weeks or every 6 months.
There is no security problem with this, of course, but it does mean
that after a while, your key will start to get big with all those
signatures (and --list-sigs gets really ugly).  Eventually, those sigs
will make it to the keyserver net and then we're stuck with them
I have been toying with various possible things to do about it, and I
welcome anyone's thoughts.
Things I'm wondering about:
* A new switch to not send expired sigs to keyservers and/or a switch
  to not accept expired sigs from keyservers.  This would slow down
  the growth, but not fix it completely as there is still the 2-week
  window before the sig expires.  This might be a good thing for
  general keyserver and keyring cleanliness though.
* A new option to indicate a key from which signatures were not
  exported.  This is a better fix since GD signatures should always
  come directly from the GD, and have no need to be sent anywhere.
  The person who commented that GD sigs should be local was on the
  right track here, though there are other problems with importing a
  local signature.  Unfortunately, this option could not be set by
  default (I do not want to hardcode the GD fingerprint into gpg), so
  if it was not manually set by everyone (and it certainly wouldn't
  be), then we're back in the same boat.
* Have keyservers discard GD signatures?
* Ask the PGP folks to do something (what?)
* Do nothing?

S-boxes would seem to be susceptible to this class of attack. I think
that would include 3DES, Twofish, etc. from what I know of their design.
Not for me ;-).
I do not think this timing attack is a serious issue for GnuPG, since it
does not work as an encrypting server that encrypts and transmits
packets in real time. Obtaining timing data would require a compromise
of the local machine. If an attacker can do that, why wouldn't the
attacker just snag the pass phrase from the keyboard, or the plaintext?
There may be some implications for GPG systems which automatically
receive-encrypt-forward, such as GPGrelay. However, since a different
block cipher key is used with each run in OpenPGP, obtaining enough
accurate timing data might be impossible. In the attack, the same key is
used to encrypt different plaintext repeatedly.
I think the real implications of this attack are for VPNs or other
"encrypting oracle" network services. But most site-to-site VPN devices
use hardware ASICs these days, which would probably mean a constant-time
implementation of AES and 3DES at least. Attacking software-based VPN
clients may be a possibility, but again a local compromise of the
machine is probably an easier attack to mount - even if it is running a
hardened FreeBSD or something similar.

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.
As the MS crypto API is normally distributed with MS Windows, the OS on
which the executable runs, it would be permited to link it in.

GnuPG 1.9 is the future version of GnuPG; it is based on some
  gnupg-1.3 code and the previous newpg package.  It will eventually
  lead to a GnuPG 2.0 release.  Note that GnuPG 1.4 and 1.9 are not
  always in sync and thus features and bug fixes done in 1.4 are not
  necessary available in 1.9.
  You should use this GnuPG version if you want to use the gpg-agent
  or gpgsm (the S/MIME variant of gpg).  Note that the gpg-agent is
  also helpful when using the standard gpg versions (1.4.x as well as
  some of the old 1.2.x).  There are no problems installing 1.4 and
  1.9 alongside; in fact we suggest to do this.

tell you what I do in Enigmail.
For attachments, I'm looking at the content-type (application/pgp-*) and
for the file name extension. If the filename extension is *.asc, *.pgp
or *.gpg I try to decrypt the file. I have so far not tried to verify
signatures of attachments; I plan to implement this in one of the next
Once I'll try to verify signatures of attachments, I'll first look for a
similar file name (e.g. without .asc); if not found I'll try to get the
original file name from the signature.
I don't assume binary or ascii armored files, I simply pipe the whole
file to gpg.
For the mail body, I'm looking for ---- BEGIN PGP (.*)
and if found for ---- END PGP (.*)
If both are found, I decrypt or verify according to (.*), or let the
user know that a key is available.
There are a few pitfalls, like message decoding (base64,
quoted-printable). Furthermore, the character set of an encrypted mail
body is often set to US-ASCII, even if the content is e.g. UTF-8

"As of 2003 RSA Security claims that 1024-bit RSA keys are equivalent
in strength to 80-bit symmetric keys, 2048-bit RSA keys to 112-bit
symmetric keys and 3072-bit RSA keys to 128-bit symmetric keys. RSA
claims that 1024-bit keys are sufficient until 2010 and that 2048-bit
keys are sufficient until 2030. An RSA key length of 3072 bits should
be used if security is required beyond 2030. NIST key management
guidelines further suggest that 15360-bit RSA keys are equivalent in
strength to 256-bit symmetric keys."
That certainly suggests that the increase in difficulty as keylength
increases isn't nearly as steep as for a symmetric cipher.

So how is RSA keylength related to difficulty in breaking?
