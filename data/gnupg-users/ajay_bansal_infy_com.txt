Try  which is a general tool like the one from
Or  which is a plug-in for
Outlook.  I am not sure whether it works with OE.  The web pages and
the instructions are in German.

Hi All
for encryption. We sent the public key to second party. That party sent
us their public key. We imported the public key using "gpg --import
". But then when we listed the available keys using "gpg
--list-keys" our private key was missing. We had created the key with
default option i.e. never expiry.
from the system. Key was made from root login so that any other can not
tamper with the key ring.
