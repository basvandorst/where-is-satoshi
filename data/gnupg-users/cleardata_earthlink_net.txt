@_subject: Newbie where to find script for FTP 
Hi gang --- I subscribed awhile back so I could try and absorb some of the tech stuff on the forum. Q: I have a BlueOnyx box and what to take the next step in finding a script that will use GnuPG (still need to get) to FTP some of my files on this box to an end user. Any suggestions?

I can manually run the php script but cannot run it as a cron.
I am logged in as the owner of the script... Can you point
in the right direction. Thanks
This is the error:
gpg: fatal: can't create directory `//.gnupg': Permission denied
secmem usage: 0/0 bytes in 0/0 blocks of pool 0/32768

Found the problem -- I guess I need to run the cron in /var/spool/
it appears to be working now.
