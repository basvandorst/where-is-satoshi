I'm trying to decrypt a series of PGP files with GPG. When I run the following command:
Gpg2 -batch -passphrase pass -o c:\temp\temp.txt -d c:\temp\file.pgp
I get the error:
gpg: encrypted with RSA key, ID 727A253D
gpg: decryption failed: No secret key
If I use PGP Zip with the same keyring, I am able to decrypt the file.
When I try to re-import the public keyring with command:
Gpg2 -import \pubring.skr
I get:
gpg: Key A328FC0E:  not changed
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg: unchanged: 1
When I try to re-import the secret ring with command: Gpg2 -import \secring.skr
I get:
gpg: key A328FC0E: already in secret keyring
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg: secret keys read: 1
gpg: secret keys unchanged: 1
Hoping someone can point me in the right direction.
Thanks in advance,

Thanks for replying.
C:\Users\me>gpg2 --version

gpg: public key is 727A253D
gpg: encrypted with RSA key, ID 727A253D

I am using the same keyring as PGP Desktop and I am able to decrypt the file
with that program.
Thanks for the help.

I get that there's no secret key for that ID but I don't understand why PGP
can decrypt the file but GPG can't.
Again, thanks for the help.

Please check thenoutput of   gpg2 -v -K 727A253D
If you can't see the reason, you may want to
  gpg2 -v --edit-key 727A253D
to see some more details.

I did a lot of research and digging and was finally able to get the file to
c:\temp>gpg2 --batch --try-all-secrets --passphrase pass -o temp.txt -d
gpg: anonymous recipient; trying secret key A328FC0E ...
gpg: WARNING: cipher algorithm IDEA not found in recipient preferences
gpg: okay, we are the anonymous recipient.
gpg: encrypted with RSA key, ID 727A253D
gpg: old style (PGP 2.x) signature
gpg: Signature made 08/15/13 03:31:01 Eastern Daylight Time using DSA key ID
gpg: Can't check signature: No public key
gpg: WARNING: message was not integrity protected
fwiw, I'd welcome any information on what happened just because I'd like to
know what happened.
Maybe this helps someone in the future.
Thanks for all the help.
