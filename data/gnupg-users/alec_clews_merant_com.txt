@_subject: Compiling 1.0.7 on Cygwin 
has anyone managed to compile 1.0.7 on a Windows system? I am using latest greatest cygwin but get the following error message
gcc -g -O2 -Wall    rndw32.c   -o rndw32
rndw32.c:62: config.h: No such file or directory
rndw32.c:75: types.h: No such file or directory
rndw32.c:76: util.h: No such file or directory
In file included from rndw32.c:77:
dynload.h:23: mpi.h: No such file or directory
rndw32.c:88: i18n.h: No such file or directory
make[3]: *** [rndw32] Error 1
make[3]: Leaving directory `/d/gnupg-1.0.7/cipher'
I have tried hacking the makefile to add ../include but the fix only breaks later on.
In order to get this far I had to run configure like this
"RANLIB=ranlib ./configure --with-included-gettext --enable-static-rnd=egd"
Has anyone got any further (with or without Cygwin)?

I am using Cygwin on W2K
1) Install Cygwin from 2) Open Bash Shell from Cygwin shortcut
3) Goto directory where GnuPG is unpacked
4) Type in "RANLIB=ranlib ./configure --with-included-gettext 5) Type "make".
6) If the build fails on rndw32.c then type the following "(cd cipher ; gcc -g -O2 -Wall -I .. -I ../include -o rndw32.exe rndw32.c);make" -- this  is from my faulty memory so beware!
7) Type :make install"
You should then set up the registry keys. The program should be located in c:\cygwin\usr\local\bin\pgp.exe or similar
There are lots of variations on this so beware. The stuff above assumes you have installed egd as recommended on the web site -- I am not convinced it is working correctly on my system
Hope that helps

@_subject: Entropy Sourse in Win2K (Re: Compile gnuog 1.0.7 in Win2000) 
I'm confused
 From the web site I understood that Windows did not have a good source fo entropy and that egd would be a good choice. However gpg says that it's insecure. What should I be doing? (I build under Cygwin)

G'Day again,
After some advice from Ryan Malayter I have managed to get this to build in a much better fashion NOT using edg
1) Install Cygwin from 2) Open Bash Shell from Cygwin shortcut
3) Goto directory where GnuPG is unpacked
4) Type in "RANLIB=ranlib ./configure --with-included-gettext "
5) Type "make". Ignore problems with buidling po
6) Type "make install"
7) Set up the registry keys. The program should be located in c:\cygwin\usr\local\bin\pgp.exe or similar

@_subject: eof confusiuon on Windows32 
I am using gpg 1.0.7 as shipped with Cygwin and Mozilla and the Enigmail plugin under Win2K
gpg under Cygwin seems to expect ^D as eof and I believe that Enigmail is using ^Z which makes gpg wait and Enigmail fail.
Has anyone else had this problem?
There  may be a few solutions for this:
1) Re-configure Cygwin stdlib to accept ^Z as eof (this should be default behavior but it's not working
2) Recompile gpg under mingw (in theory should be as simple as using --mno-cygwin option)
3) Hack the gpg source code
4) Hack the Enigmail course code.
Does anyone have any insights?
Thanks, regards.
