Sorry to butt in here but in my first post to the list I mentioned that
I was attempting to use FreePascal/Lazarus to interface with GPG via the
command line but whilst I had managed to get it working with OpenSSL
attempting the same methodology on GPG resulted in a 'hang'.
Now I realise I am a novice and whilst Lazarus is supposedly
cross-platform the documentation for Lazarus is hard to interpret
presumably because I am a novice but Lazarus is Pascal and cross
platform and it is Pascal so I would hope more understandable to knuckle
scrapers such as myself.
Someone recently asked about using FreePascal under Windows but made
mention of using a DLL. As far as I am aware FreePascal should give you
a 'direct' command line interface on any platform. I'll be rubbish here
but scratching my head about DLLs reminds me of when I was looking into
'keyloggers' which, under Windows, require a hook into the system if you
wish to capture data across running applications...
Honest I was trying to catch out a 'Microsoft Support Person' who wanted
to fix my computer over the phone.
Anyway, for what it might be worth..
Yes I hate myself already for dropping that one on you with no
explanation but basically it is a GUI that interfaces with OpenSSL via
the command line in order to generate multiple key pairs. As I say
similar does not work on GPG but it would seem that if you can get
access to the command line interface for GPG in a similar manner then,
being naive, it could be a solution
Just floating one

I'm a noob. I'm drunk. I'll try. What do you want?
..ulterior motive is I might learn.
