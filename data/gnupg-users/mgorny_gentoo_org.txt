@_subject: Enforcing password complexity for private keys 
I dare say trying to enforce strong passwords via policy is usually
a bad idea.  If you can't convince user to use and remember a good
password, trying to force it via policy usually results either in:
a. passwords being noted down on paper, phone, etc., or
b. passwords becoming more predictable.
I can't know whether your users would actually do that but it's not
uncommon problem that e.g. if you require password containing one digit
and one special character, you replace trivial passwords with trivial
passwords followed by '1!'.

@_subject: An option to generate revocation cert for subkey(s)? 
I'd like to ask whether it'd be feasible to have an option to generate
revocation certificate that revokes one (or more?) subkeys rather than
the whole key.
Our use case involves signing key kept on a server for the purpose of
automated signatures.  We'd like to keep the secret portion
of the primary key offline and use a dedicated signing subkey
on the server.  At the same time, we'd like to be able to quickly revoke
the subkey if need arises without having to reach for the primary key.
I know that currently with a bit of hacking we can store an export
of the key with subkey revoked, and use that for the purpose.  However,
I think it would be much more convenient if had an option to generate
the revocation signature separately.

I agree.  This is precisely why we've decided it for syncing

I do find it odd how many projects choose exotic languages and then
become defunct because few years later nobody wants to touch them. Presuming you're still able to build them.  It's ironic people still
don't see that even though SKS has just proven an example of that.

@_subject: New keyserver at keys.openpgp.org - what's your take? 
I honestly neither like the idea of requiring the 'first party' to
explicitly confirm all signatures, nor losing compatibility with
existing software in order to implement that.  The latter should be
quite obvious so I'll focus on the former.
In Gentoo we're using a CA-like model with a central service signing
UIDs of all developers.  It is *convenient* for it to be able to inject
those signatures into keys of the developers, and distribute them along
with them.  If we required developers to explicitly import
the signature, certify it and upload the key I'm pretty sure our
coverage would go down because people simply won't care.  The problem is
that this bites not developers who don't care much but users who lose
the ability to verify the key easily.
As an alternative: since keys.openpgp.org makes keys without verified e-
mail addresses practically useless, why not permit only those signatures
that were made using a key that's on keys.o.o and has at least single
verified e-mail address?  If you combine that with accepting only one
signature per certifying key (i.e. pruning old signatures), it should be
'good enough'.  That is, as long as attackers won't decide to create
and verify humongous number of e-mail addresses.
This could work fine alongside 'first-party attested blah blah' model,
or at least work as an interim solution until the latter is widely

@_subject: New keyserver at keys.openpgp.org - what's your take? 
Others have already somewhat pointed this out but I believe it hasn't
been emphasized enough: in my opinion, stripping third-party signatures
entirely is a no-go.  I'd go ever as far as to say this key server is
harmful to OpenPGP users, and defeats the purpose of using OpenPGP.
I agree that WoT is nowhere near perfect, and that it is confusing to
a lot of simple users.  However, it's the best solution for validating
keys that we have right now.  With keys.openpgp.org implicitly stripping
third-party signatures on one hand, and explicitly requiring e-mail
verification on the other, it effectively shifts the security model into
trusting e-mail verification done by the server software.
I'm not saying that people running the server encourage that in any way.
I'm saying that it's going to happen to a larger degree than before
because users will be making the wrong assumptions.  In other words, if
users see that the particular key will be associated with the e-mail
address only once that address is verified, some of them will also
assume that if the e-mail address is present, then it is reliably

Dnia July 3, 2019 6:23:37 AM UTC, Mirimir via Gnupg-users  napisa?(a):
I don't think this is going to work long term. Even if you manage to somehow synchronously control all servers in SKS rotation, there's no way to prevent attackers from poisoning them over and over again.
Then, they may decide to start mass poisoning other keys just to prove this is not the right solution.

I'm afraid you are underestimating those people.  The way I see it,
the number of poisoned OpenPGP keys will grow quick enough to remove all
valid keys from SKS keyservers, and render them practically useless.

To be honest, I've been considering similar problems with SKS lately
and I don't really think a distributed service such as SKS is any better
in this regard.
Given that SKS pool is entirely open, it is rather trivial for a single
malicious entity to set multiple new keyservers up, and gain advantage
over other servers in the pool.  In fact, this is probably easier than
corrupting the single central server.

@_subject: Is replacing a revoked signature valid? 
Gentoo recently started signing UIDs on the keys of our developers.
As part of the system, we revoke signatures of developers who resign. However, some eventually return and if they return with the same key,
we have a problem.
When I try to sign the key (again), I get the following error:
"[redacted] " was already signed by key XXXX
Nothing to sign with key XXX
gpg: Key not changed so no update needed.
However, the original signature was revoked, so it's obviously no longer
valid.  Now, I am able to work around this by deleting the old
signatures from local copy of the key, and signing it afterwards.  After
refreshing to get the old signature back along with its revocation, GPG
seems to still consider the key valid (wrt new signature).
My question: is the end result correct?  That is, is it portable to have
two signatures made using the same key, with one of them revoked
and the other not?  Is GnuPG refusing to make a new signature when
the old one is revoked a bug?

@_subject: FAQ: seeking consensus 
I think right now the FAQ has a bit of redundancy with mentioning SKS
all the time.  My suggestion would be to start by deduplicating that. Try to make most of it keyserver-agnostic.
Then, possibly in 'Is there any particular keyserver I should use?'
discuss both SKS and keys.openpgp.org.  I suppose comparing them would
be good, and mentioning which GnuPG versions are vulnerable
to poisoning.
That said, given that this is a more generic design problem than
specific SKS vulnerability, it would probably use its own answer
in the FAQ.
Well, if it's still meant to say 'Why does GnuPG default...', then
obviously it needs to be updated.  Probably it is worthwhile to
explicitly indicate when the default has changed, and why.
Probably the question below it 'Do other high-security...' would also
need to be updated, maybe make it more generic, like what sizes do other
applications use.
The latter.  Let's wait a bit how things emerge.  It would be silly to
have people redo their keys just to have them redo them for ECC again

This depends on the keyserver implementation.  Generally, the new key
gets merged into the old one.  Sometimes the stale data is cleaned up,
sometimes it remains.  The same happens when you fetch updated key
