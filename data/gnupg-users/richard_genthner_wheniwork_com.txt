@_subject: Single GPG key and multiple yubikeys 
So I have a single gpg key for work with 3 sub keys. I have copied it to a yubikey nano just fine. Removed the yubi and removed my gpg key and then reimported the gpg key and inserted yubikey number two and did keytocard again for the second yubikey. When ever I do
ssh -l git github.com
gpg-agent[99732]: chan_10 -> SETDESC Please remove the current card and insert the one with serial number:%0A%0A  "D2760001240102010006041632600000"
which is the nano. It seems that even killing the gpg-agent and inserting the other yubikey doesn't seem to work. Suggestions?

How do I delete the stubs with out deleting key? and when I do gpg --card-status never updates the application id.

Yeah, what I'm hoping to do is be able to carry my card with me and jump on a terminal while traveling and sign and login to things.
