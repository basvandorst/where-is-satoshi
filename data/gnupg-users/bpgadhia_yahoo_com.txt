I am trying to decrypt a file automatically.I want to use it in a dts
package. I am using following command:
type passphrase | gpg --passphrase-fd 0 --decypt-file "File Name"
in my case it looks like:
type "C:\SampleProjects\GnuPGDotNet\GnuPG\passphrase.txt" | gpg
--passphrase-fd 0 decrypt-files "C:\DocLib\EncryptedFile\Clock1.swf.gpg"
I get one of the following errors:
Reading passphrase from file descriptor 0
usage: gpg [options] [filename]
Reading passphrase from file descriptor 0
gpg: encrypted with ELG-E key, ID ECEB4FC5
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
I am using GPG version of 1.4.5 on windowsXP professional and default
dirctory of secring is C:\Documents and Settings\bgadhia\Application
Data\gnupg. And my public key is at C:\DocLib\PublicKey
I am able to encrypt and decrypt using UI tools provieded by GPG and WinPT.
Can anyone please help me.
Thank you in advance.

I am also dealing with same problem of automating the decryption process. I
have done according help manual as shwon below. I get error and I do not
know how to proceed:
generic command:
type passphrase | gpg --passphrase-fd 0 --decypt-file "File Name"
in my case it looks like:
type "C:\SampleProjects\GnuPGDotNet\GnuPG\passphrase.txt" | gpg
--passphrase-fd 0 decrypt-files "C:\DocLib\EncryptedFile\Clock1.swf.gpg"
I get one of the following errors:
Reading passphrase from file descriptor 0
usage: gpg [options] [filename]
if I use --decrypt-files instead decrypt-files  I get following error:
Reading passphrase from file descriptor 0
gpg: encrypted with ELG-E key, ID ECEB4FC5
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
I am using GPG version of 1.4.5 on windowsXP professional and default
dirctory of secring is C:\Documents and Settings\bgadhia\Application

Hi Johan,
Thank you for the suggestion. I do not have any space in between passpharse
and pipe sign and my passphrase does not contain any newline/return.
Thank you.
