I am a bit of a newbie when it comes to PGP/GnuPG, but having read
pretty much all of the documentation I can find, there is still one
issue which is baffling me.
I have uploaded my key to the wwwkeys.gpg.net keyserver, and have tested
sending and recieving it. After doing so however, I noticed that if I
export my public key using gpg in armor mode, the gpg public key is
about twice the length of the public key listed on the key server. Is
this normal?

Thanks for the detail - you are quite right that it is Evolution's
fault, because manually exporting messages and verifying with "gpg
--veryify" produces a good signature when evolution reports a bad
Perhaps I should consider using a different mail user agent for the time
being. :)

I feel really quite silly now, because I forgot to specify which key to
export so it exported all of the ones on my keyring.
i.e. I did:
$ gpg --export -a > key
...instead of
$ gpg --export -a $keyid > key
