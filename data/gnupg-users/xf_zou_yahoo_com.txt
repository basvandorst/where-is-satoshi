@_subject: no secret key for decryption available 
What does "gpg: no secret key for decryption available" mean?
The file decrypts fine, but I have no idea what the error message means. When I was using gpg --list-secret-key, the secret key was there.
I am using gpg 1.0.4 decrypting a pgp 6.5.8 encrypted file.
Can anyone tell me how to get rid of this? I've tried using --quiet as well as
--default-key ooption, but nothing seems working.
Thanks a lot!
