It's a good result. I hope you keep the sky blue color too. It would go
well on an arm-logo t-shirt. :-)

I'm not a contest judge, but if I were a judge, this contest would be over after seeing the Robbie Tingey submission. Win or not, that's a great one. Good job!

Something to think about when organizing a keysigning too. Avoid putting a
participant list on a webpage. Just a keyring maybe.

@_subject: storing password lists in mails to myself on IMAP? 
As far as I know, once it's encrypted, you can publish it on a webpage, or
put it on a billboard by the highway if you want. Without the secret key,
and the passphrase, the message might as well be buried two miles under a
pyramid by the Nile. It may not always be that way, but it is now.
