@_subject: disgest-algo question 
Hi All,
I have added an RSA subkey to my key so that I can sign messages with the SHA256 Algo.  I have made sure that my version of gpg supports SHA256.  My problem comes when I add digest-algo sha256 to my gpg.conf file, my kgpg doesn't display any keys, and my mailer (kmail) complains that no keys are available for signing.  Once I comment out the digest-algo line, everything works fine as before.  Am I missing something, or maybe my distro (suse 9.2) tossed out support for higher hash algorithms?

@_subject: rpm build troubles with 1.4.1 
I build RPMs from 1.4.0 earlier this afternoon with no troubles, but I get this with 1.4.1 ...
make[2]: Entering directory `/usr/src/packages/BUILD/gnupg-1.4.1/keyserver'
test -z "/var/tmp/rpmbuild_gnupg-1.4.1//usr/libexec/gnupg" || mkdir -p --   /usr/bin/install -c 'gpgkeys_hkp'   /usr/bin/install -c 'gpgkeys_finger'   /usr/bin/install -c 'gpgkeys_http' test -z "/var/tmp/rpmbuild_gnupg-1.4.1//usr/libexec/gnupg" || mkdir -p -- Note the mkdir lines.  This errors out with a standard Bad exit status.  I'm running Suse 9.2 (but that shouldn''t matter since I built 1.4.0 with no errors earlier).
