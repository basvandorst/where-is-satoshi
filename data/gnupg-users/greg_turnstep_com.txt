No, you were not being overly paranoid. If someone made such a major mistake of leaving their fingerprint off at a keysigning, they do not deserve to be in the Wot. At the very least, I would not have helped them get deeper into it by signing their key. If anything, I think most people in general are not paranoid enough. I think the bare minimum should be checking the fingerprint, two picture IDs, and veryfying the email afterwards. In an ideal world, I'd have other people vouch for their identity as well; this is one reason why keysignings held at existing user group meetings (e.g. LUGs) work so well.

The main objection I have to getting any sort of robot or automated gnupg user into the WoT is that the robot is inherently insecure. You have a program that is signing keys on machine connected to the internet, and the passphrase *and* secret key are both stored on the box. I know that not everyone stores their secret key on removable media far from the public internet, but I do think that the great majority of the people in the WoT store their passphrase in memory only.
I would really like to see all robots and automated scripts kept out of the WoT and continue to assume (hope?) that all signatures inside of the web were performed correctly by actual people. Barring that, I'd like to have an option to the various WoT trace programs that allow certain keys to be excluded. This sounds easier than trying to account for signature levels, which are not reliable anyway, as many have pointed Greg Sabino Mullane greg

Sorry - I am not sure which part of my quote is "not necessarily true"?
I do not agree with this: once they are added to the WoT (and they will be, all it takes is one misguided/malicious person) we should minimize the damage by allowing an option to exclude those keys. Or at the least putting a strong warning next to the key if it appears in a path. Bonus points for any program that checks if there is an alternate path that does not involve the robot, and adds the robot keys as a "path of last resort."
As pointed out earlier, we are mixing the concepts of a CA (and in this example without much "authority") and the WoT. Even worse than adding pseudo-CAs to the web of trust is adding automated pseudo-CAs. Worse still is automated pseudo-CAs that are attached 24-7 to the Internet.
Partly, but a robot that has been compromised once is not going to be trusted very much. All things signed by the compromised would be useless, and future subkeys would not be trusted for fear of another compromise. Better to get a new robot at this point!
Doesn't everything seem to at this point? :)

You also could have exchanged secret phrases and built from there by having him encrypt the phrase with the key and mail it to you.
I think you had more than enough (especially if anyone else there could vouch for his key) but the leaving off of the fingerpring from the documentation makes me question the person's diligence and attention to detail, which would be the real reason for me not to sign the key; not because I doubted that the key belonged to them. Remember that you are not only signing to verify their key, but that they are capable of using GnuPG responsibly. Yes, they can be separated, but I prefer to not sign the keys of those who might weaken the WoT.

I am aware of ways to get around the problem in GnuPG, but I was thinking more about the key tracing programs that have a web interface.
Actually, I was thinking more of skulking out in the middle of the night and getting a new domain name, and presenting it as a "new" service ... (see below)
You miss the point - you may trust your system again, but the public's perception of the system may suffer an unrecoverable blow. If a major CA was broken into and compromised, but the company eventually regained control, all the reassurances in the world would not stop people from considering using an alternate CA that has not been compromised.
I think if you want to be a CA (or an automated robot), you have a responsibility to be far more paranoid and secure than a normal user. This probably means a dedicated machine with a very restrictive firewall and strict physical access requirements. CAs make an attractive target and become a single point of failure, which is why the distributed Web of Trust scheme works so much better.

Hash: SHA1
I doubt that gpg is creating a secring.gpg "stub", but it is likely that a pubring.gpg file is being created. This can be changed by adding the command "no-default-keyring" to your options file. The stub is otherwise created because the "keyring" option does not replace your current keyring, but appends to a list of keyrings.
No, the file is probably being cached by your operating system. It's in memory, not on the hard drive (unless you are seriously low on memory), but still probably not what you want. Try mounting the floppy, signing a message, and then signing a message again. If your floppy disk light does *not* come on for the second signing, your secret key has been cached. Look on the Net for a small file called fdflush.c, compile it, and wrap it around gpg with something like this:
alias g='fdflush; /usr/bin/gpg $1 $2 $3 $4 $5; fdflush'
This may not work on your system: another safe (but slow) way is to simply umount the floppy each time, which also forces a flush. All of the above assumes a *nix system, of course.
It's also a good idea to simply remove your floppy from the drive when it's not being used: if someone breaks into your computer, there will be no way to access your key unless the disk is in the drive. :)
There are many other considerations I could go into, but I will refrain at this point. Someday, I will gather all of my notes into a HOWTO. Most people are not as paranoid as I am, but most people are not as paranoid as they should be. :)

I've been wrestling around with the problem of representing external information inside of a signed email message, and would like feedback on a possible solution. The problem is that I can sign the content of this message, but cannot easily sign other information associated with it, such as the fact that I sent it to the gnupg-users list, the email address I sent it from, and the subject line I used. The solution I came up with is to use a standardized checksum and a small code within the signed message that a mail program can use to verify the external information. This message has such a code: if you generate a SHA1 checksum on the "From", "To", and "Subject" line of this email, it should match the code below. Full details:

What is wrong with this approach? Seems to me that this should work fine:
1) gpg --homedir /tmp --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-key 84321DED
2) gpg --homedir /tmp --with-colons --list-keys 84321DED
3) Present the output to the user. If acceptable, import to the "real" directory:
4) gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-key 84321DED
The file in /tmp will end up having multiple keys, but this should not be a problem. If it is, use the --delete-key command after doing the above.
Also check out the --dry-run option, which generates all the normal output, but makes no physical changes. You cannot get the ascii armored key, but you can check the output for the key ID, name, email, and comment like this:
gpg -v --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --dry-run --recv-key 84321DED
This avoids worrying about which files to use. Just read the output and present it to the user.

I am not comfortable with signing a "corporate" ID, but an additional check would be to put something unique on the company's web page, under the assumption that nobody but the company has control over that domain. For example, if I were at the party, I would give you a secret phrase. You would then encrypt the phrase (to me only), sign it with the corporate key, and then post the encrypted (armored) text somewhere on the website, preferably somewhere prominent to prevent some lone employee from creating obscure URLs. I would check the page, decrypt the message, verify the phrase, and check that it was made by the same key as the one at the key signing. Listing the key in the whois record would be a nice touch as well. After all that, I probably would not have signed it :), but I think it constitutes at least some additional assurances.

The memory sticks (specifically, flash USB drives) are very nice and perfect for carrying your key.

Your are mixing your analogies. A "weakest link" refers to a chain, not a web. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link, but a web is as strong as its strongest strand or "link". If I have what I consider a strong link between myself and (for example) Werner Koch, then the number of other paths (or links) between him and myself are irrelevant. If someone has intentionally tried to corrupt the Web of Trust, you can snip that person and all their connections out of the web and still have a coherent whole. The power of the WoT lies in the fact that it is a web, and not a chain, and thus every node has multiple overlapping connections. Remember that the "strength" of the Web of Trust refers to its degree of interconnectedness, and not to the number of people inside of it. That is why keysignings are important: they strengthen the Web of Trust.
Deciding whom to trust is a personal decision, but at some point you have to go beyond meeting people personally and start trusting other people. I've never met most people in the WoT, but if 5 people I knew signed someone's key, and 30 other people I don't know but who have a path back to me have signed it as well, I am pretty confident that nothing funny is going on.

I cannot trace a path from one person to another. For example, I could email or call every person in the path and verify that they actually signed the next person's key, if I so desired. When I get to the robot, the actual dynamics of what has happened changes drastically. Rather than a person making a face-to-face (hopefully) contact and manually signing a key, a computer program automatically creates the signature. How can I verify that it acted correctly?
Another problem is that the robot quickly becomes a "short cut" path through the WoT. Was there another way to reach this user through the WoT? I don't know, but I would like to. While the robot provides a semi-useful piece of information (the email maps back to the key), I would much rather see another person-to-person map from one key to another.
A final problem is that I have no way of knowing what the criteria is for the robot. How secure is it? What if somebody breaks into the server and bypasses the check before having the key signed?

The only real weak point is that fact that your key is on a networked
machine. Your best bet is to keep your signing box off of a network, and
use some other medium to transfer the plaintext to this box. You then sign
the message, and use the medium to return the signed message. Good candidates
for transferral are USB keys, infrared, and the good old floppy disk. It can
be a real pain to go through all that for each message, but a rule of thumb
is that the amount of automation is inversely proportional to the amount
of security.
Since encryption is not important in your case, another option is to do make
sure that only plain text can transfer between the two machines, and no
logging in is possible. This could be done with a simple cgi script on the
signing box, and keeping only port 80 open. It's sniffable, but you don't
care because all you are revealing is the plaintext and the signed plaintext.

Hash: SHA1
I probably would not sign the key of someone who had only signed it with
a pseudonym, as a couple of forms of picture IDs (esp. government-issued)
are usually a minimal requirement for me.
As far as the email, perhaps it should be mentioned stronger in the
documentation, but how else are you going to get the signed key
back to the person? I always do this by email - if they don't control
the email, they don't get my signature on their key*. Some people upload
keys automatically to a keyserver after signing of course, but this
is not only rude (if the recipient does not want their key put there)
but dangerous, as it bypasses the email check.
I think the best you can get is an email validation. There is little
else that can be proved or disproved if the rest of the uid is
just an arbitrary name with no real-world connection. Maybe if
you had an ID with "Adam S. Masher"? :)
* Nor do they get it unless they sign mine as well!

I don't think that would be enough personally for me. I really like to
tie it into some legal form of identification. That's what my signatures
mean to me: I have verified that this person is who they say they are, and
they are in control of the email corresponding to the uid(s) that I
have signed. Other people's signatures may mean something different.
I am hard pressed to come up with circumstances where a person I meet
in person still insists on a pseudonym and has no "real name" uid. If there
were extenuating circumstances however, I would probably sign it at
"level 2" with a unique policy url stating why the person has no real
name and why I signed it anyway. It's really on a case by case basis: I'm
sure if you gave more specific examples, people could tell you what they
would do.
Not if you are using the Biglumber key exchange service! If you are logged
in to Biglumber, just hit the link and upload a signed copy of the other
person's key. When they upload your key signed by them, Biglumber mails
you both a copy of your signed keys.

@_subject: Arguments for inline PGP (was: Leave clearsigned content encoding 
Hash: SHA1
Some reasons I use inline:
* My email has a much better chance of reaching people whose
systems bounce (or discard!) attachments.
* It is easy to transfer my message to another format (such as a
webpage) while keeping the signature. It is also easy for people
to forward the signed message.
* It never messes up in mailing list archives (although some
mailing list programs now handle sig attachments properly).
* It's easy to send my email from anywhere (e.g. a webmail account)
by simply cutting and pasting text.
* I don't keep my key on a internet-connected machine, so cutting
and pasting a clearsigned message also makes life much easier.

Well, of course one uses a PRE tag, that was implied. And I don't see
how the MIME version works equally well - how would you verify a
webpage dump of a MIME stream?
I'm not arguing giving up MIME at all - there are situations where it is
indispensable, and I even use it on some occasions. But I did want to
counter the "inline is evil and should never ever be used by anyone"
argument. :)

Sure, but if you have access to the script and the password, you also
more than likely have access to the unencrypted files you are backing up,
so the additional risk is not really there. A possibly better "best of both
worlds" way is to simply create a private/public keypair just for the
backups, handled with different security requirements than your personal

Yes, that's the route I am going to take: revocations will trump
everything else.  However, the revoked sig will be more difficult to
implement as we'll have to somehow store the revoked sig separate
and then add it in if someone does a "remove-and-replace" update
to their key without it.

I'd trust it to a point. It all depends on the context, and there are
certainly usually other easier means of verification, but I'd be pretty
sure that someone well integrated into the WoT is who they say they are.
People certainly do transactions all the time with even less assurance
that that.
I do use the WoT regularly as far as verifying open-source software (and
closed-source too in theory, although I have not come across any myself).
Having someone with a key in the strong set and a Googleable history of key
usage is a nice verification that the software you downloaded is what you
think it is. Preventing a malware/trojan/virus/backdoor this way probably
falls into the "sensitive information" category.

You can't clearsign a binary directly, but you can clearsign a list

how I signed the 8.0.3 PostgreSQL distribution:

One pseudo-standard in place is to use uppercase for important meta-files
like README and INSTALL. One named "CHECKSUMS" or "CHECKSUMS.sha1"
should stand out enough. A signed version could be "CHECKSUMS.asc"
or even CHECKSUMS.sha1.asc, etc.

Or simply putting a URL to a webpage with their key in the headers

How about, if the key IS public, it should be made publically available.
Right now, the main option for doing so is the keyservers, which unfortunately
have the flaw that anyone can make changes to anyone else's public key.
That's why some people prefer a self-controlled web page.

That's a silly argument. Because they are ways of obtaining your
passphrase by force, you shouldn't bother using one or take other
protective measures? Last I heard, the government of Finland was not
known for torturing its citizens.
A lot of trouble in what way? Do you know of a black hat agency able to
decrypt exiting gpg-encrypted messages?
The original poster may want to check out "Tinfoil Hat Linux"[1] which has
some interesting capabilities, including an anti-keylogger measure. A
laptop or PDA with its own keyboard could be useful as well.

This is not true. I am an active user of PGP for encryption and signing, and hear from technical *and* non-technical people all the time about issues with reading or verifying or decrypting my emails.
I use both plaintext and MIME as the situation dictates, but there are major problems with both, so +1 on trying to think outside the box.
Bad mail client support for PGP is still very common. This only compounds the mental hurdles users need to understand things.
The cynic in me will point out that we already have problems getting email clients to follow the existing standards, but improvement is always welcome. :)

Hash: RIPEMD160
Also ironic, and one of the main reasons I prefer inline, is the inability of many archiving systems to preserve attachments - including lists.gnupg.org!
For example, when one visits the message I quoted above:
This appears at the bottom of the message:
  A non-text attachment was scrubbed...
  Name: signature.asc
  Type: application/pgp-signature
  Size: 948 bytes
  Desc: not available
  URL: (That URL path on lists.gnupg.org is 404, unless I am overlooking some needed munging.)
While some sites manage to keep the attachement intact (e.g. gossamer-threads.com), most do not, e.g.
So far all of inline's flaws, it is far better at maintaining message integrity (see also: forwarding and cut-n-paste).

No, that is not intended. (Please indicate what version of gnupg you are using

from intruding by adding the --no-use-agent option to your call.
You can also use the --debug-all flag to see if it gives any hint
on why the agent is being called.
