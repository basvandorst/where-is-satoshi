@_subject: Minimizing installation 
I am installing GPG on an account with 25 mb storage space so I would
like to keep the installation as small as possible. Can you tell me if
there is a list of folders or files i can delete and still have GPG work
on a bare bones level? Thanks. Please CC me if there is an answer.
