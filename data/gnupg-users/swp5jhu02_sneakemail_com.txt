"There is a small security glitch in the OpenPGP (and therefore GnuPG) system; to avoid this you should always sign and encrypt a message instead of only encrypting it."

I don't think I understand your objection: Only the specially priviledged chmod +s /usr/bin/gpg (or whatever) would be able to access nick's keys. None of the standard cat, copy, scp etc. would be able to access them. Things *have* changed.
On a similar point: W/Should the user nick then be able to execute:
gpg --edit
gpg [-a] --export
or especially:
gpg [-a] --export-secret-keys
I guess these should now request the password, or the whole exercise is meaningless. Are the other similar operations that should change to require a password?
And editing the ~nick_key/.gnupg/gpg.conf should still be possible (only) for nick, right? Some way to do that also needs to be present.

@_subject: Newsserver name 
It sounds to me like there is a slight confusion of terms going on here.
gnupg-users is a mailing list, not a newsgroup.
(Although I personally wish all mailing lists, including this one, *were* newsgroups instead.)
And you really don't use your "browser" for news. News (Usenet) uses a protocol called NNTP, and some email clients can do News or NNTP in addition to handle email. Mozilla, Thunderbird and Outlook Express, spring to mind. Or you can use a dedicated news-reader. And as you correctly have discovered, you'll need a news server to connect to. Mostly that server is offered by our ISP, and the news server I use is probably not accessible to you. Ask/browse your ISP and ask/look for the usenet/news/NNTP server - probably in the same place they list their SMTP/mail outgoing server.
To confuse the matter a little bit, Google offers a web interface to read news, and calls them "groups" instead. See But you will not find gnupg-users there, because gnupg-users is not a newsgroup - it is a mailing list - not the same thing.
Hope that helps a little. If not, feel free to email me directly - but if it is a mailing list / newsgroup in general topic, lets keep it off the list...

@_subject: installation GPG on LINUX webFTP 
This is kind of an openended question, but basically it boils down to:
0) If you have access to another linux box, make sure you can get your script to work on another Linux box, where  gnu-pg has been manully installed/moved to a non-standard location, and where there is no "proper" gpg location on the box. The experience gained here will make it much easier.
1) Figure out exaclty what OS/cpu combination your ISP is using. ?php-info? or something like that may tell you. I forget.
2) Figure out what your pwd working directory is. (Assume "/home/whatever" for this mail)
3) Assuming this is Linux/x86, can you get other executables to work there? If you eg. put a copy of /bin/cat from another machine into your home directory as /home/whatever/cat, can you then call it from a php script properly and get the results you expect?
4) If(when!) you can get a copy of cat to work that is much simpler, then try with gpg. gnupg's --homedir option may be your savior...

@_subject: What is the purpose of all files in ~/.gnupg ? 
Safer: Don't copy any files of those files at all. Use --export and --export-secret-keys / --import instead. That will also help in future when you want to keep your multiple installations in sync, because --export and --import merge and don't overwrite.
Easy: Use tar to tar+copy+untar create a copy of the entire ~/.gnupg directory. That will work if you're using the same gnupg version on both machines and don't mind overwriting any collected keys in the destination directory. If you use cp instead of tar, make sure you get the permissions right.
Recommend safer mode.

@_subject: Newbie: Choosing a user ID questions 
A couple of newbie questions regarding chosing a user ID:
1) Avoiding spam _and_ including the email address in user ID
I get too much spam, so I'd like to use a userID such as:
Peter Valdemar M?rch But obviously that is not my correct  email address. Is this "A Good Thing"? Should I rather omit email address altogether? (Especially if I later will ask others to sign it?)
The email address is optional when generating a key pair, but almost all
the entries on e.g. the MIT PGP Public Key Server have email addresses.
Can I safely omit it? Are there any consequences of that? Don't the
spam email address harvesters come to key servers for some reason?
2) Why is the user ID "hidden"/embedded with --export --armor?
        and
    How to extract the user ID from such an armored key without changing
    my keyring?
I'm just wondering why the ASCII armored output from --export --armor doesn't contain the userID in clear text, so it is human readable.
I did get this to work:
$ gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring ./bogus --import a_foreign_key
$ gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring ./bogus --list-keys
$ rm bogus bogus~
will show the userID, but isn't there an easier way?

@_subject: 1.4.0: Howto verify a signed file quickly - without any --homedir... 
Hi there,
My task: I have a public keyring and a signed file. I need to test whether they verify from a script.
I don't want to use the current user's trust, keyrings or anything. In fact, the user's home directory may not even be writable by the user.
In gnupg 1.2.5, this worked:
# gpg --always-trust --secret-keyring /dev/null --no-default-keyring --keyring /my/key.ring --verify /some/file
gpg: Signature made Mon 19 Apr 2004 13:29:53 CEST using DSA key ID 53776FD8
gpg: Good signature from "Somebody "
gpg: WARNING: Using untrusted key!
However, in 1.4.0, this gives the following error:
gpg: fatal: can't create directory `/home/user/.gnupg': Permission denied
OK, so I can always do e.g.:
# mkdir /tmp/bogus
# gpg --homedir /tmp/bogus ...
# rm -rf /tmp/bogus
But then I'm spending time creating the bogus directory, initializing a trust database, only to just delete it afterward. And now I have to take care not to have two scripts running simultaneously or to use distinct temporary directory names with all the pitfalls *that* has.
Isn't there a simpler way? (--homedir /dev/null doesn't work! :-D)
