Hash: SHA1
I cannot find any "gpg-zip"-program after installing GnuPG
1.4.3 for Windows.
The announce message tells:
"Added "gpg-zip", a program to create encrypted archives that can
       interoperate with PGP Zip."

Hash: SHA1
I just read the latest CRYPTO-GRAM, June 15, 2007, by Bruce Schneier.
"We have a new factoring record:  307 digits (1023 bits).  It's a
special number -- 2^1039 - 1 -- but the techniques can be
generalized.  Expect regular 1024-bit numbers to be factored soon.  I
hope RSA application users would have moved away from 1024-bit
security years ago, but for those who haven't yet: wake up.
 "
I suppose this means that 1024 bit RSA-keys are ridiculous and the
Open PGP Card is a joke. And what about all web sites protected by
SSL with a 1024-bit RSA-certificate?

Interoperability with PGP 8 matters too.
Signatures made with RSA 4096-keys (or shorter) and SHA256 can be
verified by users of PGP 8.
N.B. Not any other new hashes!
Please note the option: --pgp8

is the old problem with files greater than 4 GB solved? How large
files can gpg handle on WindowsXP? On other systems?

Hi again,
I found the old thread: Trouble decrypting AES256 symmetric encrypted file:
This is surpisingly *not* a Windows issue. We have 200+ GB database
files on many of our database servers. All using NTFS.
I think the issue is that GnuPG is using a 32-bit DWORD file pointer
and the older file functions. Werner mentioned using GetFIleSize, but
the platform SDK indicates that you need to use GetFileSizeEx to
enable files greater than 2^32 bytes:
Werner, do you use GetFileSize or GetFileSizeEx? There are also
WriteFileEx and any number of other -Ex file-related functions to
handle files larger than 4 GB.

The good news is that this makes it fairly easy to locate the compromised computer and alert the user.
