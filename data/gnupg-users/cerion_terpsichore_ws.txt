@_subject: Multiple user id's... 
I want to create a key with multiple id's, for my different email address=
and 'roles' - work, personal, web etc.  But, in certain cases, I don't wa=
different people holding my public key to see my different email addresse=
I read this mailing list history, where there was a discussion over when =
use separate keys vs. multiple user id's... but what I want is to export=20
different versions of my public key, each version with only the id's I=20
Is there a way to achieve this?  Is there a reason this is a 'bad' thing =
even want to do?!
