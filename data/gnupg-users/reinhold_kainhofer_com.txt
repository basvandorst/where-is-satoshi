Hi all,
I have a key on an official Austrian banking card (the operating system of the card is ACOS, the company that provides the keys is a-trust). How can I use this card with my Reiner SCT CyberJack card reader to sign mails using gnupg?
The card's OS is proprietary (it also doesn't seem to be a pkcs card), but a PKCS library for mozilla is provided. This works just fine in mozilla, however, I want to sign mails in kmail, which only uses gnupg.
gpg --card-status doesn't seem to detect the card.

Thanks for the answer.

Yes, I saw that in the archives. However, Werner said in several mails that all that smartcard support that was in opensc is now also added to gnupg. He also said that all other cards are supported by custom code, so I wanted to know how I can use this non-OpenPGP card with openpgp.
Probably. However, I still need to sign mails with this smartcard, so is there still a way to use this card with the X.509 certificates with kmail / gnupg? For official documents I'll sooner or later need to sign with this card.
