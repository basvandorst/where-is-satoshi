I read the directions and compiled everything but gnupg, when compiling that
I get a missing library.  What library is that, and what package is it in?
such file or directory

I'm trying to compile the 1.0.6e version.  I am *hoping* that the crash that
occurs in windows 2000 when gpg is fed garbled data would be eliminated in
this version.
