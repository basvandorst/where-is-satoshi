@_subject: Cannot revoke a certificate 
I am trying to revoke a very old certificate that may be compromised.  I
generated a revocation certificate using the following gpg command with
no errors.  I did get a warning about MD5 being deprecated.
C:\Users\David> gpg --output kill7827.asc --gen-revoke 80942C8D
However, I cannot use it.  Here is the output:
C:\Users\David> gpg --import .\kill7827.asc
gpg: Note: signatures using the MD5 algorithm are rejected
gpg: key 80942C8D: invalid revocation certificate: Invalid digest
algorithm - rejected
gpg: error reading `.\\kill7827.asc': Invalid digest algorithm
gpg: import from `.\\kill7827.asc' failed: Invalid digest algorithm
gpg: Total number processed: 0
How do I force gpg to accept the revocation?  Or, how do I revoke the
old key?
GnuPG 2.0.29 (Gpg4Win 2.3.0)

@_subject: Unsupported certificate error 
I just installed GnuPG 2.0.27 on my Ubuntu 14.10 laptop.  I am getting
this error from gpa:
The GPGME library returned an unexpected
error at keytable.c:150. The error was:
    Unsupported certificate
This is either an installation problem or a bug in GPA.
GPA will now try to recover from this error.
I have researched it a bit and it seems to either be due to a MD5
certificate or a conflict between gnome-agent and the gpa-agent.
Has anyone seen this and solved it?
