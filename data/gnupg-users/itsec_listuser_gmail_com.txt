@_subject: verify signature from Windows and Ubuntu does not work 
I use IMAP for my mailbox and I am accessing this from Win/Outlook and
When I get an email and I access it first with Outlook, then I can not
verify the signature anymore in Ubuntu as the whole email got detached
into a separate attachment.
How can I resolve this?
I could not find any options in gpg4win or kleopatra.
Thanks for any hint

@_subject: verify signature from Windows and Ubuntu does not work 
The procedure is as following:
1) I receive an email on the IMAP server (plain text only, no
attachment, but signed with gnupg)
2) In Outlook I see the email, there is no attachment
3) When I click on the email the signature gets verified, verification
4) The verification process makes a new email, the old one is deleted (I
see this on the server) and the new one has the plain text as body and
the whole email (all headers, body and pgp-signature) as attachment
called winmail.dat.
5) This email can still be verified (gpg signature) in Outlook but it
can not be verified on any other client like evolution or thunderbird
(on win or linux)
All this happens on the server as I access it via imap only.
Is this standard behaviour or are there any options in Gpg4win?

@_subject: forwarding a signed email 
Is it possible to forward a digitally signed email without loosing the
signature information of the email?

@_subject: forwarding a signed email 
Hi Olav
I did some tests with different email clients by forwarding it as
Unfortunately the clients add different content-disp, -type.
E.g. Evolution makes a content-disp inline whereas Thunderbird makes a
content-type rfc822.
I need to pares the email with perl in order to extract the original
email so I can verify the signature -
Any idea how to do that in a generic way (I use Mail::GPG).

@_subject: forwarding a signed email 
I did it like this in order to test my program which verifies the
signature; it works fine.
Now I want to parse the email via perl, so I used Mail::GPG which has an
excellent parser. Again, the content-type and -disposition of
attachments is not set consistently by different email clients.
Now I check for content-disp inline and content-type rfc822 - but who
knows which other clients use which disp/type... today I will also check
with Outlook... ;-)
Thanks for any hint.

@_subject: courier re-writing of mime boundaries, verification fails 
Hi all
If courier receives an email with plain/text and HTML parts there
happens a re-writing of the MIME boundaries.
If the email is digitally signed with gnupg first, the verification
fails due to this re-writing.
I have no access to the server where courier runs on but I can
filter/process the email before it gets signed and sent to courier and I
can filter/process before it gets verified and sent to the mail client.
a) Is there a possibility to prevent the re-writing of the MIME boundaries?
b) If not, which are the rules of the re-writing. If I know them I can
reverse that before the verification happens.
Thanks for any hint.
