@_subject: Installation problems... 
Just subscribed to the listserve though not sure how soon it becomes active.
My issue is with the installation of GnuPG.  Not familiar with PGP nor
GnuPG.  Copied down the zip file, unzipped it, un-tar the file and tried to
run the ./configure step.  The following is my log which I seem to be
getting various errors though I'm not sure why (in bold and red).  The
environment is HPUX-11.11 and I'm running the configure step using the Unix
id that the directory is created with as well as the tar file was opened
with.  Could that be the problem?  Here is the log:
This file contains any messages produced by compilers whilerunning
configure, to aid debugging if configure makes a mistake.
It was created by gnupg configure 1.0.7, which wasgenerated by GNU Autoconf
2.52.  Invocation command line was
  $ ./configure

If anyone could provide any information on what the issue(s) may be I would
greatly appreciate it.  Please CC my email address as again, I'm not sure
how long the listserver subscribe takes to become active.  Thanks in
