Yes, words to change their meanings or have new meanings added to
them. However, you have to be pretty damned out of sync with today's
common English to imply that people or things that enjoy freedom are
not 'free'. In the open source and free software communities, to which
this project is strongly connected, 'free' without further explanation
normally means 'libre' and 'gratis'. This is our language... "get over
it, grow up, live".

Actually, $OMNISCIENT_DIETY is inferiour to $OMNIPOTENT_DIETY, as the
latter has as many privileges as the former, and can speed up
performance infinitely, so basically what $OMNIPOTENT_DIETY doesn't
know, it can easily find out in infinitely short time. The languages
connected to the environment variables have very different expressive
powers, since the former is merely a query language, whereas the
latter is closely tied to Emacs: it can do everthing, among other

Isn't the quite limited amount of spam an acceptable price for an open
list? Sure, it's annoying, but when it's no more of a problem, then
I think that most people should be able to live with it. Certainly
rather than than making the list closed, or, ghasp, moderating it.

@_subject: IDs, signatures and all that stuff 
Hash: SHA1
I've been trying to make sense of signatures and multiple IDs. If
someone signs my public key and I subsequently create a new ID for
that key, then it is not the case that the new ID by transitivity is
signed by the signer. This makes perfect sense: if the signer can
verify my identity as Dr. Jekyll and signs that ID, that does not mean
that he will vouch for any Mr. Hyde IDs used for eating small children
But then people say that creating new IDs for an old key is better
than creating an entirely new key, since creating a new key means that
I have to start collecting signatures all over again. But by doing so,
will I be that much better helped? Sure, people can see that my
_other_ IDs have been signed, but that will require more than a quick
glance, which is more than many people will give to most keys.
Am I missing something here?

Wouldn't that mean that I could create ad hoc bogus IDs for causing

I'm starting to feel rather stupid now, like a fairly intelligent
bloke such as myself _should_ grok this model without even blinking. I
wonder, then, how Joe Luser then is expected to understand a word of
it, especially given an assumed very low interest in technical matters
by default.
Anyway, I digress.
I am failing to see a couple of things here. Signatures are the glue
of the web of trust model, and trust is calculated on a per-key basis,
not on a per-ID basis. Then what is the point in signing IDs? But on
the other hand, if there's no signing on a per-ID basis, then, after
getting a number of signatures, someone might create bogus IDs.
I don't think that I'm mixing up trust and signatures here... but who
knows? Signatures should be all about verifying people's identities,
but in creating a new ID, how do I avoid having to have that
particular signed all over again[1]? Needless to say, pulling keys out
of the web of trust is a Bad Thing(tm), but that doesn't seem to be
the argument that most people make when they tell you to make a new ID
rather than a new key. The current system makes relatively good sense,
but to me it doesn't seem to make _perfect_ sense. ARGH!
[1] I guess that once someone has signed your key once, and therefore
should trust that you are who you say you are, then, because they
trust your key, they'll not be reluctant to sign a reasonable new ID.

If it were to become widespread, then it would be useless. If everyone
encrypts their stuff but leave their unprotected private key floating
around much like they do their address books, then all they have is a
false sense of security. It would take two weeks for the first virus
to come by to collect secret keys. Even relatively simple passphrases
(relatively being defined as being able to withstand, say, John the
Ripper for at least a couple of hours) to protect the private keys
would make it infeasible to try to reap keys en masse.

"Support" is not just one single thing. Being able to verify and
decrypt messages in a particular format is one kind of support, and
signing and encrypting another.
David> BTW, the table won't be added to the FAQ...
Why not? I think it provides a nice overview.
