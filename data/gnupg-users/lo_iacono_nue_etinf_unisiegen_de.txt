I am using gpg 1.2.3 under xp. It works fine. I use it through Enigmail and WinPT. Now I have install GPGshell. This tool runs a dos box to perform the gpg operations. My problem is now that the dos box does not accept my passphrase. Does the dos prompt include any unwanted charachters or does the usage of german characters (e.g. "?") disturb?
Does anyone knows how to solve this?
Thx, Luigi.

Hi John!
I have made some tests with a newly generated dummy-key. Everything works fine with this key. Even my passphrase that does nocht work for my real life key, works with the dummy-key. Is this an interop problem? My real life key was generated with PGP freeware 7.0.2.
Thx again, Luigi.
