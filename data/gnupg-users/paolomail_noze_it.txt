@_subject: gpg --gen-key using /dev/urandom is possible? 
Thanks for all replies,
my system is standard linux distribution(gentoo).
There's not a rndcontrol command on my linux box but the directory
random, on /proc/sys/kernel, contains various parameters controlling
the operation of the file /dev/random,
i'll try to work with this to increase /dev/random.
Modify the code is not a solution for me, the key generation
script have to run on any linux box without patch.
thanks, Paolo.

@_subject: gpg --gen-key using /dev/urandom is possible? 
Hello all,
there is a way to specify /dev/urandom as random number generator for
--gen-key? I generate keys using a python script calling gpg trought a python
product, the script stop responding because there's not enought entropy.
A solution for this should be use /dev/urandom instead of /dev/random
but i'm not able to find a way to use it.
I know that using urandom is lack of security but for my use this is not
a problem.
Any help most appreciated.
