@_subject: doubt in clear text signing 
Dear All,
I have a question related to clear signing. As per the standard(rfc
2440), a signature of type 'Canonical text document' should be generated
after removing any trailing spaces and making the line endings as '\r
\n'. Is this the case with clear text signatures generated by gpg?
Also, when i generate a signature(actually, i am signing and encrypting)
for some data that doesn't contain a newline at the end, gpg inserts one
at the end.
Will this last new line considered a part of the signed data?
