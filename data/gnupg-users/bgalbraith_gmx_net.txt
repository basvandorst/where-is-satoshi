Hi Folks
Thought I would take a look at the latest development version...1.0.4f.
When I decrypt a message I receive the following message...usually
repeated 4 times.
gpg. no corresponding secret subkey for public subkey - removing.
Would someone explain to me why I get this message?
I have never seen this in any earlier version.

Nick I think you have probably hit the nail on the head.
Many of the Unix mail clients uses ...or have the ability to use
external editors.....so by the time the signing takes place, all the
word wrapping has  already been performed. In addition....most of the
PGP? GnuPG compliant ones have the facility *built in* rather than using
a plug in.

was OK.
