I've uploaded a rpm package for gnupg 1.0.5, built on a mandrake 7.2 box; it's not signed because I'm moving and my home machine is still unavailable :-).Please report to me any problem.
Soon I'll upload signed packages.

I've read an interesting headline on slashdot, that maybe can have some impact in cryptography:

It presents an algorithm that determines whether a number is prime or not in polynomial time.  While I haven't gone through the presentation in detail, it looks like a promising, albeit non-optimized, solution for the famous PRIMES in P problem."

@_subject: [Announce]RPMs 
I'm currently uploading RPMs packages for gnupg 1.2.1.
At this moment I've uploaded src and mdk 9.0 packages.
The latter is built with gcc 2.96.
There is no support for ldap helper, to avoid dependencies issues. I'm planning to upload ldap enabled packages in a short time. I've seen some patches for spec files posted on mailing list; if someone has patches for the actual spec file and want to see it applied, I'll be more than happy to update the spec file itself, with full credito to contributors, of course :)); just send the diff file to my address.
The packages are signed with my GPG key

You can do a safe upgrade by simply copying the contents of ~/.gnupg directory to some other place, then rename .gnupg/options to gpg.conf and, once the new gpg is installed, launch gpg --rebuild-keydb-caches
If something goes wrong, uninistall gnupg-1.2.0, install back 1.0.6 and copy the old .gnupg dir back into your home dir.

Hash: SHA1
I've uploaded to ftp://crypto.ferrara.linux.it/pub/gpg new releases of gnupg rpm packages. Thanks to Sylvain Holtzer  for the upgraded spec file, now the fr and ca translations are included and rpm can be built again by non root users.
The packages are signed with my gpg key, so they can be easily verified, but the md5 sums are the following:
0bf8f6f5cd3875320e0f9fef03b05a7b  gnupg-1.2.0-2mdk82.i586.rpm
0a92d3b01dacbe0391dae81d91bee4b8  gnupg-1.2.0-2mdk90.i586.rpm
1e11135d06faeeb853c49eead9c6b05e  gnupg-1.2.0-2rh72.i386.rpm
57015fa20724451a7f3c2923d3342795  gnupg-1.2.0-2.src.rpm
Please let me know if you have any problem with the packages or the download.
