Sorry for reviving this old thread. But since you guys still don't accept bug reports (why?!)?
I'm not sure whether this is better or worse than the old situation, but now you include an unsigned binary in your tree that is executed as part of the build process. Nowhere can be found what this binary does or from which sources it has been built. This is at least as bad as executing remove code. Can you please explain why you do this, or why you thought this would be a good idea after that long discussion on how important security is for a security product?

@_subject: Please remove MacGPG from gnupg.org due to serious security concerns 
I hereby request that MacGPG gets removed from gnupg.org due to serious security concerns. Basically, the first thing the Makefile in all their repos / tarballs does is this:
         -c "$$(curl -fsSL So you type make not expecting anything bad (you verified the checksum and everything), but you just executed remote code. Great. And they even hide it from you by prefixing it with  which is downright evil. So you never notice unless you look at the Makefile. Currently, that script clones another common repo using the unverified git:// protocol (because, why use submodules if you can do it in an insecure way?), but obviously, that can change any minute and could change just for certain IPs etc.
The developer(s) don't allow any issues on GitHub, so I tried contacting them by other means (e.g. Twitter), only to get ignored. They clearly don't care about security.
In any case, somebody who does something like this clearly doesn't care about security the least. The potential for backdoors is extremely high and I think nobody should be using any software written by this developer / these developer(s), as they clearly demonstrated that they couldn't care less about your security.
I don't feel comfortable that the majority of Mac users are using this software which doesn't care for security at all, but is used for extremely security sensitive tasks. I guess this is because gnupg.org recommends it and therefore people think it's safe. I think gnupg.org should do the contrary instead and strongly discourage using it.

On the one hand, you think it's an exaggeration, on the other, you can list even more examples. I mean, they don't even do the most basic security practices which are common in basically all projects these days, even non-security related projects. And we're talking about a security related project here! If someone clearly demonstrates even lack of the most basic security measures, why should that someone be trusted with way more complex stuff? You listing they had problems in the past basically only strengthens the argument that they are not to be trusted and should not be endorsed.
Really? Somebody caring about security executing remote code? Rather than using git submodules (which exist for how many years?), they prefer executing remote code that then downloads more code using an unverified channel. This can't be just laziness (using git submodules is less work), but looks like somebody even put a lot of effort into failing at security. How can you call that "caring about security"? If you'd argue they care a lot about being insecure, I'd agree though, because they actually seem to put a lot of effort into that?
If you are a security project, you should be thankful for people reporting bugs, not trying to make it as hard as possible to report a serious bug. This looks like more of a "users help users" forum kind of thing, nothing where you would want to report a bug.

Well, this is only checking out the code. While I agree that this is dangerous, the curl | sh paradigm is even more dangerous.
I'm guessing because you need an SSH key at GitHub in order to pull via SSH. Yet another problem solved by git modules.
Still, they could have at least changed it to https. Well, I think there's enough evidence that they do not know how to do things securely. It has even been pointed out in this thread that this is not the first time there are serious security problems. It feels like they are actively trying to make it insecure, because they do things that normally nobody working on a security product would even consider.
Please consider this: GnuPG is a security product. People's lives might depend on it. They might have heard that GnuPG is secure and think they are safe since even Snowden uses it. They go to gnupg.org and then download MacGPG. That's dangerous and there's no way for them to know unless they go check the source.
As a matter of fact, I compromised one of my machines by checking out one of the MacGPG tools, checking the checksum of the downloaded tarball and then typing make. I did not realize it executed remote code (twice even, the curl and the git checkout, on which make is also run later on). They even actively hide the fact, which makes it even worse. Should gnupg.org really endorse that?

Well, for SSH, you need a key, but for HTTPS, you don't, so they could have used that. However, git submodules solve the problem completely, as you can use relative paths. So it uses whatever you used to check out the initial repo.
I disagree. The developers are not capable of writing secure software, as demonstrated (several times even, it seems). It would be best to advise to never use that at all and then write new software, if there's demand for it. It's sometimes better to not use something than to use something untrustworthy. For security products, this is especially true.

Well, I guess you have to take into account that a lot of downloads are from packaging software like pkgsrc, FreeBSD ports, Gentoo portage, ArchLinux's makepkg, etc. Usually, these do download the signature and tarball once, verify it and then write a checksum to the Makefile / PKGBUILD / however it is called that is then verified. So I guess you can't easily map that to "Only x% of users check the downloaded tarball". I guess it's a lot more, it's just not all check it using the .sig.
git commit -S You can just create an alias for that, I for example use git ci.

This is not the correct mindset to develop security software!
Also, the new way they solve it ignores the proposal to use git submodules entirely, not even stating why they don't want to use git submodules. But that at least is not a security problem, so I don't have strong feeling about this :).

I really can not confirm this. I am running vanilla GnuPG 2.1.2 (built from source) on Yosemite (10.10.2 to be exact) with a Gnuk without any problems.
In any case, I agree about the part that such fixes should be developed in the GnuPG repo and not in basically a fork that receives less reviewing.
I suppose it might be a good idea to have a Qt GUI. That looks native enough on Mac so that most users won't complain, works good on X11 or Wayland based systems and also works well on Windows. Ideally, this would be a project under the GnuPG umbrella, but ideally not taking away time from core developers and thus be done by others. It also is not that security critical if it's just a GUI using the command line tool.

The solution I chose is an ugly, but more secure one: I use pinentry-gtk with XDarwin. Sure it's ugly, even more so since it is upscaled on a retina display. But it's only for entering the PIN / passphrase, so I'd rather use that then pinentry-mac. I did not choose pinentry-curses because that didn't work well with signing Git commits.
I totally agree. There should at least be a big fat warning, saying to not use if it you really depend on security.
I'd say yes. I'm using GnuPG 2.1.2 vanilla with a Gnuk token and don't see why it should be any less reliable than on Linux.

It's not so much about age, but about what thought process came to the conclusion that this might be a good idea. This is a security project, so every change done should be done with thoroughly thinking about the security implications that change might have. This was clearly not done here, and IMHO downloading and executing remote code without any verification is unforgivable for a security project.
This entirely depends on the certification store curl has and the configuration. Granted, the defaults on OS X are sane. But still, this relies completely on GitHub not being compromised. And it was only quite recently that someone managed to get write access to repos due to a bug in GitHub. How can someone blindly trust and rely on a service they can neither control nor audit for the security of their users in a security project? This is just extremely irresponsible.
And even worse: Why did you decide to hide what is going on by prefixing it with a  This really feels like you are trying to deceit users, hiding from them that they execute remote code that you could change at any moment. Worse yet, you could later on switch it back and nobody would notice. This feels a lot like a hidden backdoor to me.
Actually, I'm all for you charging a fee. That will create enough pressure for a fork that will then hopefully have better security practices.

I don't really see how that is cumbersome if you have an alias for tag and for commit that each specify the key you want?
As an aside, what's the reason for not signing the commits with the key on the card? I sign all my commits with the key stored on my Gnuk. What is kinda annoying though is if you set commit.gpgsign = true, as it will then even sign git stash etc. and ask you to enter the PIN all the time. Which is why I have an alias git ci for git commit -S, as I only want to sign commits, not temporary state.

+1 for choosing Ed25519! (I did the same because I didn't want commits to be huge).
As most keyservers still don't support Ed25519 keys, I guess it's worth pointing out that you can get the key with --keyserver keyserver.mattrude.com.
Btw, does this mean that basically Ed25519 keys are stable enough now and won't change anymore?

That would be a pretty useful thing, but require you to trust the card reader. This, however, would really make sense on the Gnuk and I guess you could even do that without changing the spec.

Great to see that you are planning on trying to bring things into shape so they can get upstreamed.
Might I suggest that you start with pinentry? Currently, you import an old pinentry release and then build a lot of things around it. It would be really helpful if you could instead create a new subdirectory cocoa and do it like the other pinentries. That would allow to review it more easily (only the new directory needs to be reviewed) and would allow upstreaming it. I think that would be a lot more helpful than having a pinentry-mac fork.

I've seen a lot of projects where the Mac-specific part is nicely integrated into automake. The huge disadvantage of Xcode project files is that they are huge, can't make much use of the results from configure which often results in basically needing a different .xcproj file per combination of OS version and architecture (or at least different targets) and do not support cross-compiling at all. automake OTOH has none of these problems and is hardly any more work. Plus it's possible to edit build rules with an editor instead of a GUI that is only available for OS X. Oh, and then of course there's the problem that it's not possible to do reproducible builds with .xcproj files!
I think Walter mentioned that he never touched OS X, so I'm guessing he'd prefer something that he can read and modify ;).
Hm, this sounds good at first, but after some thought, there are several issues. This could be used to trick the user into thinking he's doing the right thing when in fact he's not. What if you just don't use %KEYID, but write another key ID there that the user expects, when in fact you sign for something else? I think it would be better to have a dialog that shows all these information and then maybe a free form text for the justification, where no replacing takes place?
I can't think of any problem with that and this sounds indeed like a good addition.

According to the paper, the goal is to take 4 minutes on an average PC and that it shall be adjusted according to hardware improvements.
Abusing mail accounts only works if they are mail accounts with crappy hosts. Sane providers will block your account if you start sending 100 mails in 1 minute ;).
The question is if that would still be profitable for spammers. Currently, they just send their spam to millions of addresses hoping that one of them is stupid enough to fall for it. They can do that because it's cheap. But if sending isn't cheap, sending to millions to just get one idiot who falls for it isn't an option anymore.
It would just need to be extended to groups. The protocol is not set in stone.
In any case, I'm not suggesting we all switch to BitMessage. I'm just saying this is going in the right direction.
