@_subject: How to decrypt message digest with multiple encrypted messages ? 
Hi List
I'm a Win XP user I have a file which is a digest of some 10 or more PGP
encrypted messages. (10 independent messages in 1 single *.asc
file )
When I try to decrypt this file using GPG, GPG decrypts the
first message - but does *not* decrypt the later ones
Here's what I've tried and failed :
- When I use GPG shell -> current window - decrypt (right click
on the GPG shell "lock Icon" on tray) , the first message alone
displays on the GPG Tray - Editor. Rest are *not* displayed
- Same results when I use GPG shell -> clipboard - decrypt
the first message alone displays on the GPG Tray - Editor
- Same results when I try command line GPG
the first message alone is copied into the decrypted file
any solutions ? ... other than decrypting one message at a time !!!
