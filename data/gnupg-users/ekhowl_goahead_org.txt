Hash: SHA1
I've been using wwwkeys.pgp.net for a quite a while now, and so far
haven't ran into trouble. Maybe couple of missing keys, but can't even
remember when these things happened. So, IMHO: works well. I guess
they all do, but I can't say anything about anything else than
wwwkeys.pgp.net. :-)

I don't seem to have this; I just upgraded from 1.0.6 -> 1.0.7 (Debian
packaged, "but still"). Here's what I get:
$ gpg --list-keys ekhowl
gpg: WARNING: --honor-http-proxy is a deprecated option.
gpg: please use "--keyserver-options honor-http-proxy" instead
pub  1024D/1410081E 2002-03-24 Jussi Ekholm sub  1024g/CD803E7E 2002-03-24
Nothing similar to David Shaw's. Any insight on this? For first, I'd
really like to get rid of that WARNING message and then I'd really like
to know, why my GnuPG is acting completely differently than yours. :-)

Hash: SHA1
I tried to read every bit of information I was able to get my hands on,
but for some reason I tend to miss stuff... Thanks a lot, this sure did the job.
No, it's as clear as it can get. And I apologize for being such an
asswipe and asking about this here. The situation just was this: I
upgraded from 1.0.6 to 1.0.7 and after that I got the message. Ah well,
I thought, let's configure it away. Then I tried to search any ~/.gp*
stuff in my home directory, for no avail of course. Only after I sent
the email I remembered, that it was .gnupg, and options under that
directory. :-/
I really want to apologize for the whole list here. I shouldn't have
mailed this kind of message here, that's for sure; it's just easier to
go where the fence is lowest... but I'm getting rid of that habit. Now
I'm reading every bit of information I can lay my hands on, whatever the
issue is.
Yeah; as I mention above, I've had a *serious* case of
"don't-remember-to-or-too-hard-to-read-documentation" syndrome for a
long time now. And thus I apologize again. I will read GNU FAQ, The GNU
Privacy Handbook and various other documentations I can find. Jeffo and
David T-G have guided me to the right direction, definitely. Jeffo by
saying, that GnuPG is absolutely useless if you don't know how it works
and David by that *incredible* amount of information he has been so
kindly sharing with me.
Once more, I'm really sorry for bothering this list with such a stupid
questions as mine. Thanks a lot for the answers, though - I really
appreciate it. You are again one more person kicking me in the ass to
RTFM before asking questions as silly as these. My intention wasn't to
upset anyone, that's for sure - the thing, that I asked questions which
can be found from TFM is most likely very annoying, I acknowledge that.
And from now on, I will read manuals, FAQs and every piece of
information before I ask in a public mailing list.

This doesn't fix the problem - at least no there. And I do have 'keyserver x-hkp://wwwkeys.eu.pgp.net'. It used to be without prefixed
with 'x-hkp://' and neither way, doesn't work...
