released v7) that is verifiably GAK-secure for FREE!).
GPG already won't encrypt to ADK keys so it's a good alternative and I have
every confidence that Werner Koche is currently working on a version of GPG
that is at anti-ADK as possible. This won't help existing NAI/PGP users
Maybe the release of DSS-2 / the new SHA, AES and the lapse of the RSA
patent in the next month or two will give an ideal opportunity to revisit
the implementations of OpenPGP and RFC2440 and get rid of the
security-sapping "baggage" called ADK?

producing a v5 specification that forces implementers to jump through more

Excuse me if these questions have been posed (and answered!) previously.  I
have looked at the Mini-FAQ and other documentation etc.
I am very new to GnuPG but have used NAI PGP extensively.  I think GnuPG is
FAR better than PGP because of its versatility, but have a couple of
technical queries:
  a) Will GnuPG support "as standard" RSA (with or without IDEA) from Sept
  b) I think a strong argument can be made for allowing a user to "get at"
(e.g. print on the screen) the decrypted session key in case of a court
order rather than having to give up the asymmetric key.  A corresponding
feature could then be added to decrypt a message with a given session key.
Are there any problems with this approach and if not why hasn't it been
implemented?  I've seen the November discussion on the development list RE
this and Werner seems to not like this approach - but I can't think why.
Surely it is empowering users?  I appreciate that I could implement this
myself trivially, but IMHO this is such a potentially useful feature that it
should be a part of the standard distribution.
  c) Are there any downsides to using ElGamal encrypt + sign keys (apart
from the lack of interoperability w/PGP users and the size of signatures...)
  d) Can I create an RSA key with GnuPG?????  I've got the IDEA/RSA modules
compiled and installed but can't find a way of creating an RSA key?
  e) Question on key prefs(gpg --edit-key x| pref)....NAI/PGP created keys
report "S2 S3 S1" whilst GnuPG keys (of either type) report "S10 S3 H3 H2 Z2
Z1".  I guess Sx refers to symmetric cipher whilst Hx is Hash and Zx is
compression....My questions on this are: Is the first item in the list the
"prefered" option?  Why isn't S3+S4 included in the GnuPG list?  Why does

Q: What is the recommended key size?
 A: 1024 bit for DSA signatures; even for plain ElGamal
    signatures this is sufficient as the size of the hash
    is probably the weakest link if the keysize is larger
    than 1024 bits.  Encryption keys may have greater sizes,
    but you should than check the fingerprint of this key:

forged whereas a break of ElGamal allows any number of messages to be forged
significantly stronger than the hash function.
I've started looking at the documentation that comes with GnuPG
(\gnupg-1.0.1\doc), the "--list-keys --with-colons" option is cool - this
could option could do with being listed on gpg --help though?  How many
other functions have command line options that aren't documented in --help

All the Biham / Shamir results on SkipJack are available at:
I think everyone expected SkipJack to be broken after the initial

strong...NSA have a habit of (look at DES, DSA etc) producing
algorithms that are VERY good at doing the job they were designed
for, but can't be extended easily.
SkipJack was meant to protect data with 80-bit keys and it does
this job well - if you change the algorithm at all then you
dramatically weaken it.
AFAIK, there are no attacks better than brute-force on

My understanding is that GPG relies on the OS provided RNG whereas PGP

details of how RNGs are employed in GPG.
GPG doesn't include "canned primes" for ElGamal / DSA keys.  This is good

Pass.  I've still only given GPG source code a cursory glance :(

to be included as a standard function (C2 criteria talks about wiping before

Doesn't it just?
ok.  Can you clarify: will you be signing the messages or not????
 I'd expect so (to prevent spoofing of transactions!) and if you
are then this (very...) slightly evens things up - ElGamal
signatures are quicker to produce than RSA signatures.
Use a small key that still offers sufficient security for this
kind of work - 1,024-bits will do nicely I'd suggest.
Actually try this out (with the co-operation of the ISP/hosting
service) and see if the performance is poor / unacceptable to the
hosting service.
On a P166, GPG takes 10 seconds to encrypt to a (excessively
large...) 3,072-bit key but only .58 seconds to encrypt to a more
reasonable 1,024-bit key.
On the same machine, encrypting to a 2048-bit RSA key takes just
.08 seconds.  Hhhmmmm.
It's true - ElGamal is intrinsically far slower than RSA for
encryption.  Decryption is slower under RSA than with ElGamal,
but this will not be done in such a constrained environment and
will thus not matter as much.

S3 is CAST & S4 is Blowfish - these two are supported by GnuPG

@_subject: More comments on GnuPG from a new user! 
Q: What is the recommended key size?
 A: 1024 bit for DSA signatures; even for plain ElGamal
    signatures this is sufficient as the size of the hash
    is probably the weakest link if the keysize is larger
    than 1024 bits.  Encryption keys may have greater sizes,
    but you should than check the fingerprint of this key:
    "gpg --fingerprint --fingerprint ".
key.  Also don't forget that breaking the hash allows one message to be
forged whereas a break of ElGamal allows any number of messages to be forged
significantly stronger than the hash function.
I've started looking at the documentation that comes with GnuPG
(\gnupg-1.0.1\doc), the "--list-keys --with-colons" option is cool - this
could option could do with being listed on gpg --help though?  How many
other functions have command line options that aren't documented in --help
is there a list somewhere (apart from the source code ;).

Hash: SHA1
All the Biham / Shamir results on SkipJack are available at:
I think everyone expected SkipJack to be broken after the initial
success, but it would appear that it's actually quite
strong...NSA have a habit of (look at DES, DSA etc) producing
algorithms that are VERY good at doing the job they were designed
for, but can't be extended easily.
SkipJack was meant to protect data with 80-bit keys and it does
this job well - if you change the algorithm at all then you
dramatically weaken it.
AFAIK, there are no attacks better than brute-force on
OpenPGP.  You
case... :)
My main reservation is that the 80-bit key length is considered
marginal at best.  I can see no reason to recommend SkipJack over
3DES for example....

Am I missing something - why don't you just create a key without a
passphrase?  In either case the security is based on keeping one file
(either the secret key ring or the passphrase file) "secure".

@_subject: comparison gpg:pgp6.5.1 
An interesting e-mail....I'm also looking at comparing the security of GPG
and PGP...
My understanding is that GPG relies on the OS provided RNG whereas PGP
offers it's own primitives.  This is ok if you trust the construction of the
could throw (Winxxxx) then the PGP solution is probably preferable.
Have a look at  for
details of how RNGs are employed in GPG.
GPG doesn't include "canned primes" for ElGamal / DSA keys.  This is good
IMHO (though I can imagine situations where v.fast keygen would be a
I guess the best solution is to offer the option of employing canned primes
but by default turn this off.
Pass.  I've still only given GPG source code a cursory glance :(
Afaik no wipe is present.  For half-secure OSs I would expect this function
to be included as a standard function (C2 criteria talks about wiping before
reuse etc...).  Not sure if Linux wipes before re-use....

@_subject: Using GnuPG on shared virtual hosts - 
Hash: SHA1
Doesn't it just?
ok.  Can you clarify: will you be signing the messages or not????
 I'd expect so (to prevent spoofing of transactions!) and if you
are then this (very...) slightly evens things up - ElGamal
signatures are quicker to produce than RSA signatures.
Use a small key that still offers sufficient security for this
kind of work - 1,024-bits will do nicely I'd suggest.
Actually try this out (with the co-operation of the ISP/hosting
service) and see if the performance is poor / unacceptable to the
hosting service.
On a P166, GPG takes 10 seconds to encrypt to a (excessively
large...) 3,072-bit key but only .58 seconds to encrypt to a more
reasonable 1,024-bit key.
On the same machine, encrypting to a 2048-bit RSA key takes just
.08 seconds.  Hhhmmmm.
It's true - ElGamal is intrinsically far slower than RSA for
encryption.  Decryption is slower under RSA than with ElGamal,
but this will not be done in such a constrained environment and
will thus not matter as much.

@_subject: getting rid of blowfishes 
Fortunately the GnuPG crowd appear to be more technically competent
(probably because it runs on Linux and users are already technically aware I
guess) so there is less of an issue with GnuPG users creating non-compatible
keys inappropriately.
Don't tell me that finally, 3 or 4 months before AES is finally selected,
PGP will start implementing Twofish which most likely will not be selected
as the final algorithm?
I personally disagreed with the implementation of Twofish anyway (block
cipher strength is certainly not the weakest part of OpenPGP...), but I
think it's *extremely* poor timing to introduce it this late in the day
prior to the selection of AES.
You will then no doubt have the newbies asking "which is best, Twofish or
AES?" where the answer should be damn obvious.
To quote Schneier (Oct '99) "Twofish is really too new to be used." - and
you guys are fielding it in a production system? ;)
Agree 100%!

.  Yes, I noted that.
ok, well why do OpenPGP members think it's a good idea to implement (or
include as an algorithm identifier...) Twofish?  I had quite a debate on the
mailing list and nobody had a good explanation why it has been included
above other (seemingly more secure...) algorithms.
I'm certainly not.  I've expressed my opinions on GnuPG implementing the
algorithm too (for example: S.Simpson, "[PGP]: PGP / AES / Twofish (Long)",
