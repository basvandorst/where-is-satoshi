Hello everyone,
something wrecked my keyring, there was a pubring.gpg~ in my home
folder, a few days old, that still worked. Is there a smart way to find
out what caused the problem?
I run GnuPG 1.4.14 (Ubuntu), with thunderbird/enigmail. In Enigmail I
couldn't manage keys or encrypt messages anymore. In the terminal I got
the following error (together with the keys) when I ran
$ gpg --list-keys [1]
I guess that there was a problem with a key I tried to fetch from a
keyserver, but I am not sure about it.

Dear Bernhard,
hello everyone,
Do you know if there are translations of the fsf-guide planned?
