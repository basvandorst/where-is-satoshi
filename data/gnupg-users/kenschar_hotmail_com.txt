@_subject: Signature fails 
Hi there,
I am using pine with gpg4pine to encrypt/decrypt and I am using GPG 1.02
Encryptiong & decryption are working fine however, when I send out and
encrypted/signed message the signature is always invalid on the receivers
Any ideas what to check??  Everything encrypts fine just no signature.
Thanks for any suggestions/help!
  Ken
