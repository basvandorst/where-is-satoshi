@_subject: GPG Encrypt without Install 
Hello There,
I am building an application which is using gpg to encrypt files using a Server Side public key.  I was wondering if I distribute this app to clients, will each client need to install gpg in order for the encryption to work Client Side?  Or is it possible to have a standalone exe that I can utilize to do my client side encryption?
