Hash: SHA1
So, I think this must be new in the last couple of versions of
GnuPG. It used to be that the first UID in the list of uids for a key
was the one that showed up for e.g. signatures. Now, it seems like
it's been changed to the most recent instead.
This uid is "dotted" when you try to --edit-key, but I can't seem to
figure out a mechanism to change which UID has the dot. Any

You know, there are a number of mechanisms for signing HTML with
OpenPGP signatures, but each one has niggling little problems. I haven't seen anyone do this yet, but I think it'd be possible to use
a combination of XML-DSIG:
        ...and XHTML:
        ...to make a signature that is "built in" to the HTML framework.

I can verify that the article does NOT say that GNUPG is affected by
the sploit. It says that GNUPG uses the OpenPGP format, which is true.
If you read the article, the sploit appears to be this: alter Alice's
secret keyring file. Then, capture a signature made by Alice's secret
key. The fudged signature can be used to determine her key.
It sounds to me like a failure of the secret keyring file format and
not of OpenPGP per se.

You are absolutely and completely correct, and I bow down in awe. I
was wrong, wrong, wrong.
If the sploit uses the fields in section 3.6.2.1. of RFC 2440, -and-
if GPG uses that format for storing secret keys, then I guess GPG
would also be vulnerable.
Completely shutting up now,

Thanks. Sorry, but I get a little nit-picky about that kind of
thing. When you take help requests off-list you...
        a) Take the discussion out of the public eye, so that others
           can't correct me if I say something stupid. This is to your
           disadvantage.
        b) Make me solely responsible for answering your questions. No
           one person on a mailing list is a private technical support
           tech. I may have had time to answer your first question,
           but not any others.
        c) Make it so that other people reading (either on mail or in
           Web archives) don't get the benefit of seeing my answer,
           too. Someone else may have the same problem you have.
This isn't a big deal, just a gentle reminder. I could have redirected
my response to your private email back to the list, but that's kind of

If you're going to sign -and- encrypt, try:
"gpg -se -r $their_user_id -u $your_user_id $filename"
Lastly... I suggest you read the Gnu Privacy Manual, since it has a
lot of info on how to make GnuPG work:

Ctrl-Z usually does the same thing in the DOS/Windows world.
I'm not sure if that provides an EOF to gnupg, though, and without a
readily available Windows machine at my disposal*, I can't be certain
about that.

One use for group-signed stuff is, say, for a technical support
team. If a number of people answer the email for support
it'd be a good policy to have the same address on all their outgoing
One way to do this is to have each tech support person have their own
key. Like, Alice and Bob both have keys, like this:
        Alice             Your Company Support Technician         Bob             Your Company Support Technician Each key also has an extra ID for the support email. Note that
although the IDs are the same, the keys are still different.
Finally, there could be a master root key used to identify the
organization. It'd be used to sign each of the technician IDs:
        Alice             Your Company Support Technician             SIG: Your Company Tech Support Team         Bob             Your Company Support Technician             SIG: Your Company Tech Support Team This is a way of saying, "Our company certifies Bob as a technical
support rep. If you get email from support and it's
signed with Bob's key, well, that's a real support email."
It's EXTREMELY important to protect this master root key, and keep it
in the hands of a very responsible person. [As a side note, while
there are a lot of docs on the Web on how to manage a personal key, I
haven't seen a lot on how to deal with a root key, especially for
sensitive stuff. Links, anyone?]
If Alice leaves the company, the company could revoke the signature on
her support ID:
        Alice             Your Company Support Technician             REV: Your Company Tech Support Team Revoked signatures mean, "Our company no longer certifies Alice as a
support rep. If you get mail from her, with that as her signature,
don't come running to us." The revokation would need to be published
to a number of key servers to be useful.
All that said, this is a pretty sophisticated set up. Unless you're
doing support for, say, PGP B-) or some other product with a fairly
fanatical cryptophreak clientele, I can't see it being much use.  Most
people don't check email signatures, keep keyrings up to date, or,
frankly, even know that From: lines can be spoofed.
One more thing: this setup would preclude having customers SEND
encrypted email to the support address, since it would
be encrypted to any of a number of public keys with the same email
address. But if outbound signing is the important part, and not
inbound encryption, I think the above scheme would work.

    MA> address isn't part of many key signing party verification
    MA> procedures, especially less formal ones.
This is extremely true. One way to ameliorate this is to use a
challenge-response pair for each e-mail address on the key.
For example, when I meet Matt Armstrong at a key-signing party, after
checking his identification papers of whatever sort, I give him a slip
of paper with a unique challenge bitstream to take home. A good
password generator will make a decent bitstream creator, giving
semi-readable streams like "underw3ar%beaujolais".
When I get home to my computer, I send matt _another_
challenge bitstream, such as "spock8free-dmitry". Matt then sends back
_both_ bitstreams, e.g.,
        ---BEGIN EXAMPLE FAKE PGP SIGNED DATA---
        underw3ar%beaujolais
        spock8free-dmitry
        ---END EXAMPLE FAKE PGP SIGNED DATA---
Now I know with reasonable certainty that the person I met at the
party is the same person who receives mail at matt and
that both people are the same as the person who uses key X. I can sign
the key with some margin of certainty.
Note that the challenge doesn't have to be spectacularly long or
unique. A brute-force dictionary attack isn't going to work in this
situation -- if I get back 500 billion messages, starting with
"aardvark1aardwolf" and ending with "zymurgy)zither", chances are I'll
be just a teensy bit suspicious of the situation.
There are, of course, some attacks on this. For example, Matt
Armstrong (the person who's ID and key signature I verified at the key
party) could be intercepting mail for matt and falsifying
headers to send mail from the same address. Or, Matt Armstrong could
have been mugged on the way home from the keyparty, his secret key as
well as my slip of paper with the challenge stream stolen by the
(entirely different) guy who gets mail at matt and said
mugger could then be sending out signatures.
But it's a pretty reasonable mechanism.

If you've checked around and you think there's not a nearby key party,
the easiest thing to do is start one yourself. It's not that hard!
Simply pick a restaurant, cafe, or bar to do it at, a date and time,
and then make an announcement on local LUG, cypherpunk, and other
mailing lists.
