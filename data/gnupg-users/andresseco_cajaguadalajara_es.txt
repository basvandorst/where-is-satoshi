@_subject: gnupg for windows nt 
I have been testing gnupg to substitute my old pgp553i in windows nt, but
the program always hangs after displaying the message "gpg: NOTE: you should
run 'diskperf -y' to enable the disk statistics". The program hangs when i
want to encrypt or generate a key.
I can import keys from pgp using .asc files, and the list-signs and
list-keys options runs well.
I have included the registry entries noted in the README.w32 file.
The version i have tested is 1.0.2.
Please, cc me. I am not subscribed to this list.
Thanks a lot.
