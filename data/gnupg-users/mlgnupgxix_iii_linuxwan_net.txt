@_subject: Hostname of key server pool disappeared? hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net 
If there is a more appropriate place to post this please do let me know.
Methods of contact and persons responsible for the sks-keyservers
infrastructure is not obvious. Onto the problem;
The hostname hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net appears to have been pulled,
and now returns NXDOMAIN. It's even return NSEC records to prove it's
keys.gnupg.net is just a CNAME for hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net. This
host appears to be the default for GNUpg configs.
Other hostnames (pools) in the pool.sks-keyservers.net domain are still
The status page for sks-keyservers.net shows no hosts are currently
available via hkps but other ports are available.
Is there some kind of maintenance happening, or has something broken? Is
there a news post somewhere that the service will be pulled?
