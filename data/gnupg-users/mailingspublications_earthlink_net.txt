@_subject: Customizing GPG Tools Keychain 
Dear All,
I am a new member to this list, so first of all thank you so much for your time and consideration in helping me out, I hope I can return the favour in the near future.
My system runs MAC OS 10.7.5, I have the GPG Tools Package installed and I am able to sign & encrypt e-mails.
My question is about how to customize this package. I read somewhere else that you can remove your Private Master Key altogether from your system and use only the subkeys. Moreover, you can specialize each subkey for a particular use, such as for example: only encrypt an e-mail, only validate a code, etc...
Could you please point me to a resource or article that explains in detail how to do that?
Again, thanks so much for your time and consideration.
Best regards,
