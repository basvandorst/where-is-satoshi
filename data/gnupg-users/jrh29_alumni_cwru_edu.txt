@_subject: Duplicate personal key in keyring 
Through some unknown series of events, I now have two copies of my
personal gpg key in my keyring.  I double-checked to see if GPG is
seeing the same key in two keyrings (maybe reading a backup), but both
keys are being read from the same keyring.
This leads me to two questions:
1) How could this happen in the first place?
2) How can I fix this, short of generating a new key and revoking the
existing key?
I've tried backing up the keyring and deleting one copy, but it
deleted both copies.  I searched online for anyone else who had a
similar issue, and came up empty, except for one person who was seeing
the same key from two files.
Any help is appreciated.  As a last resort I could revoke the key and
generate a new one, but I would like to avoid that if possible.

Hi DIrk,

My backup was simply a full copy of my .gnupg directory, so that I
could easily just destroy the new one and restore if anything failed.
I'll try your suggestion, thanks!
