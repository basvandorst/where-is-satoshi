@_subject: Compile of Gnupg 2.0.1 failed - no libintl 
Hi folks
I tried compiling Gnupg 2.0.1 on a 733 MHz PowerPC G4 running Mac OSX  10.4.8 and the make failed with the following error:
In file included from sysutils.c:41:
i18n.h:27:23: error: libintl.h: No such file or directory
sysutils.c: In function 'disable_core_dumps':
sysutils.c:88: warning: implicit declaration of function 'gettext'
sysutils.c:88: warning: incompatible implicit declaration of built-in  function 'gettext'
make[2]: *** [libcommon_a-sysutils.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make: *** [all] Error 2
I looked libintl up and it involves native language support.  Is this  really necessary to ild Gnupg 2.x?  If so, is there source code  somewhere I can download?
