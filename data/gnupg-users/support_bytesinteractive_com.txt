@_subject: Decrypting HTML Pages as e-mails 
I have a couple of clients who have some web forms submitted and sent as encrypted e-mails using gpg.
I would like to have the forms when decrypted program formatted as an HTML document. (I'm using pgp to do the decryption on a Win32 machine.)
I've tried with both eudora and outlook express but after decryption the e-mails are displayed with all the HTML code rather than resolving the HTML as an HTML page.
Has anyone successfully carried this out with Eudora or outlook express using pgp or gpg frontends to decrypt an e-mail so that it resolves into an html page.
Perhaps a browser that has an e-mail client might work.

@_subject: How to send encrypted data in an xml file 
I would like to encrypt a value to a field which is part of data record
which I'm storing as an xml record.
Its seems that the ascii armour representation has line feeds. Is it
possible to represent the data in ascii format without the line feeds.
Thanks in advance for any help.

@_subject: Need Help decrypt HTML E-mail using OutlookPrivacyPlugin 
I've installed dejavusecurity/OutlookPrivacyPlugin to decrypt e-mails from
It works well with encrypted text email but under features its says it can
decrypt HTML e-mail.
I'm collecting data from an online form and I want to send the email as a
form with the data filled in.
I encrypt the HTML form using gpg then send as an e-mail.
When the email arrives in Outlook it decrypts but displays at the top:
** Message decrypted. Message was unsigned.
then the HTML code.
Is there any specific way I need to prepare the HTML email then upon
decryption it appears as an HTML email ready for printing.
Any clue as to how I get this to work is welcome.
Thank-you in advance!
