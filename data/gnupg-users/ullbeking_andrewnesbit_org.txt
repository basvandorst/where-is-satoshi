I don't understand how this is irony.  I must have missed something.
Are you suggesting that because the entire community have known about this for a long time and did nothing, then the problem has effectively been disclosed already?  Therefore something should have been done long ago and because it wasn't exploiting the defect like this should not be something to complain about?

I still contend that a large subset of the most harmful factors in all of this are those awful GnuPG beginners tutorials that encourage the inexperienced new user to upload their new keys to keyservers.
I would love to fix this problem from this perspective.  Before too long I would like to determine if I can schedule time to work on it.  It's an important thing for an important project that I just happen to be particularly interested in.
The things I missed are:
- how to check and clean a user's local keyring
- how to update the user's local configuration in ~/.gnupg

I love pastebins.  I think they are an excellent "first serious web app" type of application.
In fact, I've been collecting a list of all (mostly open source) paste bins that I can find, and their implementations.
If anybody knows any pastebins of the tops of their heads, please could you send them to me, off-list if you prefer.  When the list goes online I will credit anybody who contributed (unless they don't want me to).

I must have missed the memo describing the exact nature of the problem.
 Could you please provide a link to something (email message, web page)
that explains what is going on?  Thanks!
Kind regards,

@_subject: Native OpenPGP integration with Alpine 
I am gradually getting back into using Alpine for the times I need to
work with email on an interactive TTY.  I have written to the
Alpine-info list before, asking for recommendations for using OpenPGP
implementations, particularly GnuPG [1].
I received many useful responses.  However I would like to explore
options for native integration rather than using external filters.
Does anybody know of any efforts to integrate OpenPGP _natively_ into
Alpine?  Has anybody looked into this /at all/, or done anything like a
code review to see if this is even feasible?
I've been thinking about looking into this myself, although I have to
admit it's not very high on my list of priorities.  If there is existing
information that can give me a head start, or somebody with whom I can
compare notes then it's more likely I will be able to push through the
first hurdles.
Kind regards,

[I am resending from my list-subscribed email address.]
In which countries is this allowed?  In other words, is there a list
oublished online?
In Australia, where I am originally from, you can't do this.  But this
is hardly surprising because Australia is not a privacy-respecting nation.
