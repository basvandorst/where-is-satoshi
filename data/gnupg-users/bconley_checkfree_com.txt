My point has nothing to do with my personal opinion on the Iraq war or any
other war...I'm just trying to serve our clients without offending them.
As quoted from the gnupg.org website itself, " ``Free software'' does not
mean ``non-commercial''. A free program must be available for commercial
use, commercial development, and commercial distribution."   I'm not
disputing anyone's right to say what they want to say, but the point is,
GnuPG is being described as a commercial software,  it's purported as being
a "full replacement for PGP",  that is compared to PGP in many ways on this
site.  That being said, in my opinion claiming the  "hey this is free, it's
open source, we can say whatever we want" argument seems a bit

If I had loved ones involved in this dirty mess I would be praying
that this war is stopped, not finding it distasteful that others feel
the same.
And a second point: "No War" - this one or any other - is not
a political statement; it's an ethical statement.

Let's not forget, GnuPG is used commercially as well as privately.  I work
for a company that does business with a large number of other large
companies and we recently began recommending GnuPG as an alternative to
commercial PGP products.  In our eyes as well as theirs,  GnuPG is very
much a product, just as PGP is a  product, and I find it distasteful at
best to direct clients of ours to gnupg.org to be confronted with an
anti-war political statement.  These clients are people, some of whom may
have loved ones involved in the conflict in Iraq, and because we referred
them to the site, it is a direct reflection on us.  We should not have to
provide a disclaimer to our clients that they may be exposed to political
statements that may be offensive to them.  Like it or not, the commercial
use of this product does place a burden of professionalism on the
developers of gnupg.  Frankly, if I had known that this type of
politicization would come with GnuPG, I never would have implemented it in
our organization.
