@_subject: Sign key with externalized master key 
May I ask how one would sign public keys when a "master key" is
stored onto an USB stick ?
I followed instructions from [1]. Now I am in the process of
announcing my key transition to all old signers *but*, as a last
test, I just tested public signature with my "master key" and this is
where troubles occur:
LANG=C gpg --home /Volumes/FSF/.gnupg --recv-keys gpg: WARNING: unsafe permissions on homedir `/Volumes/FSF/.gnupg'
gpg: external program calls are disabled due to unsafe options file permissions
gpg: keyserver communications error: General error
gpg: keyserver receive failed: General error
So what ? My USB stick is formated using extFat so permissions are
something unknown.
Do you have any way to workaround that ? Or better, USB stick storage
best practice ? My environment is very hetereogenous but I may only
sign from my OS X machine so there can be a better choice than extFat
I presume.
I did something odd as a very short temporary workaround:
umask 077; mkdir /tmp/_gpg-to-sign
gpg --home /tmp/_gnupg-to-sign --import
then did my keysigning.
Thank you very much.

Thank you for this precision. Are you aware of some "portable" and
well supported by the 3-major OSes filesystem type ?

Good catch. I did something close: refurbished and updated my old slackware
GNU/linux system with FUSE exfat support. That does the job !
Thank you for your help.

@_subject: MIME or inline signature ? 
Hash: SHA512
in my quest of the perfect setup, I am asking myself what is the
prefered way to sign a message: inline (like this one) or using a MIME header ?
Is there a big thumb rule to respect ?

I agree. So I'll go for PGP/mime.

THank you for this pointer. I effectively remember this point in the
old days. I am glad the situation is getting better.

This is getting over complicated just to the purpose it
deserves. Sadly.

Yes sorry. I should add a smaller key for that purpose ...

I quite agree with this statement but to do asame here, I should/must
use a smaller key than my 8192R. I will probably generate a smaller
subkey (2048R ?) and see how it works here.
One more argument in favor of the inline: it questions my fellows;
what are these cabalistic caracters and then you can what's the
purpose of all of this.

@_subject: Double sign a document 
in order to announce my new GPG key< I have written a key transition
I am at the step where I should/must sign it with both keys (old and
new one).
I can sign (inline) my document using this:
gpg --output keytransition.signed --clearsign keytransition.txt
This works for one GPG key but how can I make it work twice ?
If I do the same command but using my old key:
gpg --default-key 0xold-key --output keytransition.signed2
--clearsign keytransition.txt
then I should "merge" the signed files but when verifying, it just
gpg: Attention?: conflit de hachage de signature dans le message
gpg: Impossible de v?rifier la signature?: General error
How am I supposed to achieve this ? How do you double (triple or even
more) gpg-sign a file ?

Hi Jesper,
Thnaks for that Jesper.
Just a quick question: do I need to have both keypairs in my keyring
? I mean both my old secret key and my new secret key.

Hi Ville,
Thanks for that ! I thought I had to install it. So, I can drop it
and install GPG via brew ?

Hi Mark,
Do you have any testcase I could try by my side ? I mean, how you
"put this in a batch file" ? I also put an
exclamation mark in my passphrase.

Hello Helmut
try without the -- stuff:
gpg2 --verbose --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --send-keys 72ABFF0923A87CF22D0ED7C4FDEE765D017077F1
and see how it goes.

@_subject: [cygwin] gpg-agent with ssh support ? 
Hi all,
On my workstation, I have installed cygwin and GPG4win which is
bundled with a version of gpg-agent (cygwin comes whith oldies and
no gpg-agent AFAICS).
I enabled ssh support in the gpg-agent.conf file as usual and I
clearly see the socket files for both GNUpg and SSH.
When starting a cygwin terminal and trying to decrypt one file using
gpg --decrypt file.gpg, pinentry comes in and asks for my passphrase
(and then cache it into gpg-agent).
On the other hand, trying to add an identify file into the agent
It tells it can't connect to the agent.
In fact, after hours of trial and errors, I gave up launching
ssh-agent manually.
Do you know a way to fix that and only use gpg-agent as my sole agent
entry point for both gpg and ssh ?

Still, one has to install a new piece of software but, in my case, it
can be ok.
So, just to be sure I understand:
1. install putty
2. put enable-putty-support into gpg-agent.conf
3. gpg-connect-agent reloadagent /bye
4. enjoy ?

Exact but I plan to get one in a quite short time ;) I am just
studying the smartcard market to choose a good one (any suggestion ?
