@_subject: Scdaemon log 
I am trying to use my smart card with GnuPG 2.1.7 on Ubuntu. I hope it is
p15 card but gpa 0.9.7 discard it.
As far as I understood the Scdaemon log could help me to locate the
problem. But I am a beginner in Linux and probably miss something.
I tried to set:
log-file /var/log/scd.log
debug-level guru
in the ~/.gnupg/scdaemon.conf but the expected log file was not updated by
the scdaemon.
Please advise where could I find scdaemon log  or what shall I do to
activate it.
