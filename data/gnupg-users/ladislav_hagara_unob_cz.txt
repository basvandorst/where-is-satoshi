What are your permissions? Do you have rwx for .gnupg?
drwx------ 164 hgr hgr 12288 Oct 12 23:45 /home/hgr
drwx------   3 hgr hgr  4096 Oct 12 15:26 /home/hgr/.gnupg/

Just trying:
$ mkdir .gnupg
$ chmod 555 .gnupg/
$ gpg --gen-key
*gpg: no writable public keyring found: eof*
Key generation failed: eof
gpg: can't create `/home/user01/.gnupg/random_seed': Permission denied
Seems something with permissions.
What operating systems (Unix like, Windows)?

If you chose the default option ((1) DSA and Elgamal (default)) you
would have both sign and decrypt keys now.
You chose ((5) RSA (sign only)) so you have sign key only.
You must run "gpg --edit-key" and then "addkey" command and choose key
for encryption ((6) RSA (encrypt only)).

Nobody can encrypts files for you if your public key doesn't contain
encrypt subkey.
The subkey will be used automatically. You just have to export your
public key again and your partners have to import it (only this subkey
will be really imported).
Without encrypting subkey the Thunderbird (Enigmail) will abe able only
check your signature but nobody will be able to encrypt email for you.

What versions of these libs do you have? Older than required. See dates For example libksba:
My libksba 1.0.2. provides libksba.so.8.9.2, your libksba provides Just update your libraries/distro.
