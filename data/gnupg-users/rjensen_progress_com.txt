@_subject: [gpgol] A few questions... 
Hash: RIPEMD160
I have the gpgol-0.9.3 plug-in installed in Outlook 2003 running on
Windows XP Pro.
It resolved the 'crash on signing' issues I was having with the older
plug-in, thanks!
Now I have a couple of questions:
  Is there a way to set the default key to use for signing?
    In Enigmail it uses the email address to choose the key, but
    in gpgol I always get a dialog and need to select the key from
    a list.
  For some reason it is not finding the key for encrypting a message
  in my keyring based on the email address. It brings up a window
  that lets me select the key, and that works fine. But, why isn't
  it finding the key automatically?
  It appears I cannot verify a PGP/MIME message, any plans for that
  or is Outlook just not a good PGP/MIME platform?
  What should I use for the 'Key Manager' executable? I tried pointing
  it to the WinPT executable, but that didn't seem to work.
     This isn't a big issue for me because I can use either the WinPT
     Key Manager or the Key Management from Enigmail.
  Again, comparing to Enigmail.
  When I choose to encrypt a message that has attachments, Enigmail
  me three options:
     Just encrypt/sign the message text, but not the attachments
     Encrypt each attachment separately and send the message using
inline PGP
     Encrypt/sing the message as a whole and send it using PGP/MIME.
  It seems that with gpgol, encrypting the message causes the
  to also be encrypted. Is there an option to NOT encrypt attachments if
  you are encrypting the message?
