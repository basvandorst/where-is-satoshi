Hi all,
My understanding is that when you encrypt a file using GPG a random session key gets generated, that gets encrypted using public key crypto, and then that session key is used to encrypt the file using a regular block cipher.
Why then does GPG only encrypt at about 12 MB/s when OpenSSL can encrypt using the same block cipher at over 260 MB/s on the same machine?
Is it just a faster implementation of the block cipher, or is GPG doing something else that slows it down?
I'm using fairly modern Intel CPUs that do have AES instructions, so I was wondering if that was it.

Hi Kosuke,
We're using 1.4.11 on Ubuntu 12.04, on x86-64.  The libgcrypt11 package is 1.5.0.
Ah, thanks - that sounds good, I look forward to it.
I was wondering how much difference the AES-NI instructions make so today I went back to an older server running the same OS, architecture, and GnuPG version.  On this server GnuPG encrypts at around 11 MB/s but OpenSSL encrypts at well over 100 MB/s (which surprised me).
So the difference seems to be mostly due to other factors.
I think Werner's email explains much of the remaining differences though.
Thanks both,
