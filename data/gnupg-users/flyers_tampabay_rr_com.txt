@_subject: Insecure Memory Warning! ???. 
I recently installed RH7.0 and am trying in essence to set the PHP/Apache module to send encrypted e-mail too a user account on the same box.
The command I type is
$ gpg --encrypt -ao encrypted_file_name -r '' This works flawlessly if I am logged in as ROOT, but if I try it as any other account, I get the following:
# gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
# Could not find a valid trust path to the key. Let's see whether we can assign some missing owner trust values.
# No path leading to one of the keys found.
# < Lists key data >
# It is NOT certain that the key belongs to its owner.
# If you *really* know what you are doing, you may answer the next question with yes
# Use this key anyway?
I have checked and the public key is listed on my keyring.
Any ideas, I am at my wits end here.
Thanks in advance for the help.  I am a new GnuPG user, so this may be a basic question, but I have had a hard time finding useful tutorials on this.  Also, if I have left out any important details necessary to piece the puzzle together, please reply asking for those facts.  Your patience is

How would I go about setting my uid as root in RH 7.0?  That seems easier than setting no-secmem-warning in all of my .gnupg/options files.
Thanks again for your help!
