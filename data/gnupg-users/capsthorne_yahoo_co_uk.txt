I am trying to update, extend (and actually begin to use),
the gpg on this rather old Slackware box (9.1).
gnupg-2.0.1 needs some libraries. That is fine, but one of
them is libpthread.  (I have /lib/libpthread-0.10.so, but no
pth-config and I can't persuade .configure to find / use
my 0.10.)  As I understand it, libpthread is part of libc,
and I do not feel competent to disturb my installed libc by
upgrading libpthread.
So, I fall back on gnupg-1.4.6, which compiles and installs
Then I try to install gpgme-1.0.3.  It wants GpgSM version
min. 1.9.6.  As I understand it (I have googled and searched
the archive of this list), GpgSM is now part of
gnupg-2.0.1, which I can't have for the reason given above.
I have tried to find sources for GpgSM by following the
links in old posts on this list to Project ?gypten - but if
the sources for GpgSM were ever available there, I can't
find them now.
Is there somewhere I can find GpgSM sources for my
gnupg-1.4.6 / gpgme-1.0.3 please?
Any other advice?

Hi Luis,
Thank-you for your quick and helpful response.
After I wrote to the list I experimented by compiling
libpthread and installing  into  a safe place in my home
directory.  I put pth-config temporarily into /bin and I
was able to compile gnupg-2.0.  I have not installed it yet
though.  I will do that later this evening.
I thought that it would probably be safe to run gnupg-2.0.1
against that "safe" libpthread, but it is obviously better
and simpler if I can install it system-wide as you seem to
have done.
Thank-you very much for that.  As I have said, I have built
everything now anyway, and so I probably won't need the
builds you have helpfully contributed, but if my own builds
don't work, I will certainly try them.
I will let you know how I get on.

Thank-you Werner.
I was, of course, confused - not for the first time:).  I
had assumed that anything involving "pth" and threads must
be libpthread.  I did not appreciate that there was a
difference until I looked at the sonames of the gnu-pth
libraries I had compiled and realised that they differed
from the libpthread ones.
Everything appears to be working.  The only problem I have
had is that I installed Florian Sievers' gnu-crypt, whose
configure script identified my gpgme as unthreaded, even
though gpgme had found pth and seemed to produce all the
necessary libraries.  He tells me that he is going to use
the unthreaded gpgme by default in future.
Whilst I am talking to a developer :
(a) The link to gpgme at (en)/download/index.html appears to be outdated.  It points
to version 1.0.3
(b) it would also be nice if there was a link to pinentry
on the download page. It is not listed on freshmeat and I
had to hunt around to find it.
I thought GpgSm might be in there, but I was worried about
the security advisory on the gpupg homepage and decided
that I would only install packages from 1.4.6 or 2.0.1.
Thanks again for responding .. I live and learn.
