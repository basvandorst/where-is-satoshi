It?s not so much that nothing better has come along, it?s that no single one of those things does all the things PGP sets out to do.  For secure communications there are much better options than PGP - some of them in very heavy use by actual normal, non tech people.  For symmetric encryption of files there much better options out there.  For signing files there are other options (though perhaps not better).  Does anyone know what PGP?s peak adoption rate was?  I always loved it in concept but very very rarely saw people actually trying to use it in the wild, outside of the types of people who read this list.  -Ryan McGinnis

Null modem transfer of your messages?  Yikes.  To me that?s the issue with PGP in general as it relates to secure communications - the nerds and the criminals and the spies know how to work it, but your average end user doesn?t need their step one to be ?go to a Goodwill in a city you don?t live in wearing a disguise and buy a laptop with cash?, they need PGP to almost be automatic.  Think of how easy it is to bootstrap Signal and how hard you?d have to try to accidentally send something cleartext over that application.  Linking your key to a new device is as easy as scanning QR code. Perfect forward secrecy, rich media, voice and video synchronous communications upgrades, you name it.  And my grandma could probably set it up without help.  I guarantee most big data scooping intelligence services are a lot more worried about OpenWhisper protocol than PGP because *people actually use it*.  Just being caught with WhatApp in China can get you sent to a camp, depending on your ethnicity.    -Ryan McGinnis

Right, I probably wasn?t being very clear with what I meant.  What I?m saying is that people who use PGP at the moment are rather tech savvy, lady over from the legacy of the fact that for most of PGP?s existence a user *had* to be tech savvy to even get PGP backed out of the metaphorical garage.  Because of this, applications that use PGP all seem designed to make that crowd happy.  But making that crowd happy necessarily excludes the much larger crowd that would never need, consider, or even understand aid-gapping.
Signal went the other way.  Build a verifiably secure communications platform so easy that literally anyone can figure it out.  Make it hard to impossible to screw up.  Most of the people who implemented secure whisper adopted this philosophy.  No, it?s not federated, but in terms of real-world impact it actually has one because people actually use it to communicate.

That is true that I am probably being unfair - my focus on GPG for email is more a nostalgic sadness that secure (beyond TLS transport) email never really became ubiquitous.  In the end the protocol of email itself couldn?t keep up with way people needed to communicate, so email is now a bit of a niche thing -  used for business and as a repository for ?unimportant and lacking urgency, but still desired? types of communications.  As a run of the mill IT fire putter outer it seems nuts that I run across institutions still using fax machines (just regular old unencrypted data turned to audio over POTS lines) because they are somehow still compliant with data protection laws, and they see encrypted email as less viable as it much more expensive to set up with much more overhead.
But I also agree - it certainly does make sense to focus development on what the users primarily use it for.

Not sure why the phone number thing bothers people -- having a phone at all in the first place means you are easily tracked.  What Signal (and any encryption system, really) does is try to prevent in-transit interception and surveillance of the actual data content.  It can't hide the metadata associated with a layer well above the application layer.  Openwhisper can be picked up at the firewall level, but then so can Tor and VPN spinups, and all of these things are metadata that make you score more interesting to the mass-data-scoop algorithms.  If you don't want to be easily geo-locationally tracked, don't use a device with a cellular modem, full stop.  What Signal (or any other E2E encrypted messaging system) does is give people the ability to communicate with each other privately.  People can still see that they are talking and are trying to hide what they are saying.  Yeah, that makes those people targets in some countries, but it also greatly increases the cost in manpower and resources needed to peek into those communications.  Now you're looking at burning 0days to install APTs and sending human resources to deal with individuals when this could previously be handled on a global level en masse with some fiber splitters and a big ol' datacenter.  If enough people use it can have a disruptive effect on mass surveillance and state control.  -Ryan McGinnis

I think what the author is saying is stop trying to ever think of email as a secure form of communications, no matter what you layer on top of it, full stop.  Which given how email encrpytion options have performed over the past couple decades, makes sense to me.  You might say that PGP over email is better than nothing over email, but is it?  If you expect a non-secure channel and don't disclose secure information, that's one thing -- but if you expect a secure channel and send private information and through user error or clunky software implementation you end up sending cleartext, you're worse off than if you'd just assumed a non-secure channel.  Email has a habit of having this happen.  It's actually quite easy to mess up and send cleartext. IF there were no other options, then maybe it'd be worth rolling the dice.  But there are quite a few extremely capable free solutions out there that will establish a secure channel of communications with relative ease.  Frankly, the only way you'll ever get secure comms over email is if the big boys (Microsoft, the Goog, and to a lesser extent Yahoo and grandpa^H^H^H^H^H^H^H AOL decice to shake hands and come up with a standard and force it down all other provider's throat.  Either that or roll their own secure (though not E2E since it relies on TLS) modes like Outlook 365 and Google/GSuite do and give users an option to send messages that force TLS by making the recepient go to a https email viewing page if you access the message from any outside provider.  -Ryan McGinnis

It seems kinda cheeky to find one (fixed) bug in the least secure implementation of the program and act like that disqualifies it.? All programs have bugs.? Most implementations of GPG have had some pretty bad bugs over the years.? No programs are going to be free of security flows - the question is whether the app or platform was built with security as a priority and what happens when those flaws are discovered.? I'd argue Signal was built with security it mind and that they're pretty swift at fixing issues as they arise.?
Also, not that it makes the bug any less impactful, but I know very few people who make regular use of the desktop implementation of Signal; it's mostly meant for mobile devices.?

In my personal opinion, Facebook has earned their reputation.? Their stance towards privacy has always publicly been "Uhh, what?? Privacy?? Uhhhhh, yeah... we love privacy!" while they fill their platform with dark patterns and extract every last bit of usable data you give them into something they can monetize.? They were selling the 2FA phone numbers people would supply for increased login security to advertisers for Pete's sake.? Sometimes that giant space station that looks like a moon with that thing that looks suspiciously like a janky planet-busting laser slapped to the side of it really is something to worry about.
I do agree you can say this about any platform, but I don't agree that they're all equally suspicious.? Apple *could* be secretly building a data empire out of their users, but they way they've structured their business plans, the way they market, the way they continually design their devices with security and privacy not just in mind but as a top priority... it's doubtful that they're secretly the bad guys.? Possible, sure, but if you're going to pick a closed source hardware/software platform, you could do waaay worse. ?

I guess that?s one way to look at it, but if your end users are dissidents and journalists communicating in happy fun places or developers signing critical software, then surely you?d want the product to be resilient against 10 year old trivial attacks from your users? adversaries.  I do understand the ?with what resources? argument; I imagine there is no way of getting around that.  But if that is the end response to stuff like this then it seems more an argument that people should not be using this software system for important, serious applications.  For the secure communications functionality I suspect this has been the target end users? perception for quite some time, and a whole slew of arguably better secure communications systems have risen to fill that need - but GPG is still used heavily in signing important files.

I might be missing something really obvious here but... what is this
trying to protect against?? It's not protecting against interception in
transit, since the message already transits the internet either in
cleartext or encrypted via TLS that your email service provider can
definitely read.? So if your goal is to protect the privacy of your
email in transit, then this doesn't seem to do anything; if your goal is
to protect the privacy of your email from your service provider snooping
it, then this doesn't seem to do anything.? Your service provider can
certainly (and probably does certainly) retain archive or backup copies
of all emails that enter into and exit your account, so encrypting them
after reception only means that the copy you are accessing is encrypted
and non-accessible to the provider, but the copy that they archived or
backed up is just as plaintext as always (or is, more likely, encrypted
with a key that only they know).?
The only time encrypting your email storage with a key only you have
makes sense is if your provider pinkie promises to not store or archive
anything on their servers other than what you see live in your email
inbox.? Or, for example, if it's something like Protonmail does, which
is never store anything on their servers that isn't encrypted with the
user's private key that they don't have, so even their backups are
something they can't access the plaintext from.? And even then you are
relying on their pinke-promise that they are doing this, it is not E2E
unless you are sending messages to and from Protonmail users or you are
PGP encrypting messages before they leave or arrive at the service.??
And E2E is really the only solution that keeps your email provably
private from all parties concerned other than the recipients.?

Went to a security seminar where I asked a random FBI agent after a presentation about passwords; he said just to get into their personal terminals it was something like 17 characters minimum and that the passwords were randomly generated letters and numbers and symbols and that they were changed fairly often.  If you're trying to protect something from offline brute forcing and the password is the weak point, you're probably best off coming up with a really long randomly generated diceware phrase (7 words ought to be safe) I always figure that if you upset a nation-state enough that they're willing to throw their supercomputers at you to get at your goodies, they'll likely just tie you up and brute force your body until they get what they need.

The thing is, if you can't remember a string of random words, are you likely to remember a string 20 random letters, numbers, and characters?  Generally, if your non-randomly-generated password is easy for you to remember, it's also easy for a computer to guess.  Diceware is the attempt to make something easy as possible to remember while still being truly high-entropy.  If you're really paranoid you don't use the javascript program to generator your random phrases, you buy an EFF book and roll some casino dice.  The entropy comes from the dice and so is verifiable.  Probably the best PGP key passphrase would be to have some sort of high security locally stored password manager like KeepassXC, encrypt that password database with a good long diceware passphrase that you train yourself to remember, and then have that program generate some random 30 or 40 character gibberish passwords to copypasta into PGP when it asks.  While you're at it, use that to create different random passwords for every site and service you use.

Perhaps just use QR codes?? Easily scanned and imported by a digital
device.? Message size is limited, but probably enough.? If not, you can
maybe use multiple QR codes.? This reply, encrypted to you, is contained
in the linked QR below:

Yeah, though if you wanted to be sneaky-do you could encrypt a message,
put it on a QR sticker, slap the sticker on some traffic pole as a dead
drop, and let it hide in plain sight until your intended recipient came
by and snapped a shot of it.? My guess is that if the world ever gets to
the crazy point where people feel they need to send GPG messages through
non-electronic means, you're just as likely to get the rubber hose and
time-out-in-the-little-box treatment for sending paper mail to someone
with GPG'd QR codes or RFID tags as you are for sending GPG'd emails.
Some of this stuff is just silly, of course, we're nerds not spies, but
if you're going to dial the paranoia to 11 you may as well be consistent
about it.?

Probably a bit outside the scope of the list, but in my experience most
users underestimate the risks involved in running their own servers.?
Probably not anyone reading a GPG mailing list, but I only mention it
because of the discussion of no-ip and DDNS stuff -- usually only tools
used by non-commercial, non professional entities.? I run into this a
lot with people who buy cheap camera systems for their homes, put it on
the same LAN as everything else in the house,? open up port 80 right
into their NVR, give the default NVR user an easy password, and then
proceed to run that thing for years without ever patching the NVR server.
There are so many IP6 addresses available that everyone in the world
could be given a trillion of them to use and it wouldn't make an
appreciable dent in the total left available.? I suspect in the future
your NAT gateway will live in the cloud and every device will have it's
own static IP.?

A.  Yes, you can still anonymously register for almost anything.  It's not straightforward and requires a bit of forethought and jumping through hoops.  No, it probably won't defeat the NSA, but if they're your adversary what in blue blazes are you doing using any kind of electronic device let alone posting here.  B. The Shadowgate documentary isn?t.  This is Coo-Coo for CocoaPuffs territory.  If you want to believe that stuff that's cool, just thought I'd make sure to stick the tinfoil tag on this one since you speak of it like it's a legit thing.  C.  Replying to person you were replying to -- how pants on head stupid does one have to be to use Tor browser (or any type of security critical software) on XP?  If you think that's a good idea then you shouldn't be using Tor.  Either you don't need Tor and using Tor is silly for you, or you do need Tor and you're going to hurt yourself bad by having not the slightest clue how to use Tor safely.   D: If you really need secure anonymous email, fire up TAILS on a bootable DVD, sign up for a free Protonmail account over Tor, use a burner prepaid phone number to authenticate to Protonmail (Protonmail correctly gets worried about Tor signups), access Protonmail only over Tor (they have a hidden service).  If that's not good enough to circumvent your adversaries, again, you should probably just move up into the remote Alaskan wilderness and live off wild animals and shrubbery for the rest of your life and hope the bad men never find you.  -----Original Message-----

So yes, I'm using Becky! as a MUA + an outdated GnuPG plugin on Windows XP, but functionality is somewhat crippled for anything other than GnuPG v1.4.
Nope, they dropped support for XP (specifically the browser part) a while ago, which thing never really affected me since I use a third party browser which I interface with the "expert bundle" exe that they continue to distribute. Of course, that's an gross oversimplification of what's actually going on this computer, but you catch my drift.
As far as secmail.pro is concerned, it's not possible to use it with Becky! because there's no server-side support for SMTP, POP3 or IMAP, so I'm writing directly from semail's web interface.
Unfortunately since practically every single internet service in existence (be it mail, fora or otherwise) has been in bed with the worldwide private data collection operation going on right now (lookup PRISM and the ShadowGate documentary) it's no longer possible (and so it's been for nearly a decade now) to anonymously register any type of account anywhere, meaning I'm technically shunned from the Internet and it's nothing short of a miracle that I'm able to post here at all. I'm actually shocked this place hasn't been hijacked by vpn-hating cloudflare and the google captcha nazis because that's true everywhere else.
Currently I use another free, anonymous e-mail service called TorBox which does have SMTP/POP3 support for everyday communications, though that's only viable for people operating within the TOR network as it's got no clearweb support unlike secmail itself, which at the end of the day is kind of a useless thing anyways given it's blacklisted status (and that completely without justification) among most every big and small e-mail provider out there.

Unless you live in North Korea or something there are always ways around SIM registration laws, though they get expensive depending on where you live.  If you have a trusted US contact you can just have them grab you a bunch of Mint Mobile SIMs and have them cooperate with sending you the OTP codes during signups, for example.  Or if you are a man of many quatloos, you can fly to the U.S. and do the trick here yourself and then fly back home and use the accounts.  Once you sign up you change the OTP recovery phone number to a VOIP number you control (you'd need to purchase this VOIP number anonymously too, there are plenty of ways to do that like MySudo, Twillio, etc).   But unless you're doing some really hinky-dinky stuff like investigating organized criminals or sending the Guardian classified videos of drone strikes on baby kittens, this is mega overkill.  Using XP is madness, IMO.  If you're that into rolling your own system why in the heck wouldn't you be petting the penguin?  I mean, why would you use a fully configurable open source OS or a fully audited secure distro based on said open source OS when you could instead use an obsolete proprietary OS that's had no security patches in over half a decade?  I wouldn't even trust XP for airgapping.  If the baddies were really after you I'm sure they'd find whatever you've done to harden your XP boxen super amusing.   They might even send each other screenshots of your setup over Signal while making funny comments.  -----Original Message-----

Not even close. Only a prepaid phone will do, which are not available where I live, and even if they were, I'd still be required to show some form of ID in order to get it, which defeats the whole purpose of getting one in the first place.
In the world we live in right now, a comment someone pretends to be offended by will get you jail time. It's that bad. I'm not being singled out by the NSA or anything, and that in part due to the fact that there's absolutely not a trace of anything on the internet that can be linked back to my real identity. I arduously cultivated my anonymity from the get go so to be able to operate freely in the shadows, and it's now paying off in the form of relative tranquility as I stand untouched in the midst of this cruel, worldwide socialist takeover.
There's nothing in that article that even begins to disprove anything the ShadowGate documentary addressed; literally not one thing. Just a bunch of NPC's running their mouths spewing the same old tired lies and slander, which's standard practice for fake news socialist outlets anyways.
Just don't let others do the thinking for you.
The TOR Browser is an accident waiting to happen irrespective of the system it's running on. XP is secure to the extent that you know how to make it secure, and that goes for any operating system flexible enough for the task.
There's no value in doing that since there's nothing I need to perform securely that XP will not cooperate with, and besides all this, you do NOT want to blindly capitulate your security to any AIO "solution" like Tails, specially in light of it's flaws. You're much better off acquiring an adequate understanding of whatever OS you're running and make the necessary changes as you go.
Of course there's a limit to that, and certain OS' are plainly and simply way too compromised and stiff for any privacy-related work, but XP is far from being one of them.
Not possible as explained above, and quite frankly Protonmail is one of the worst offenders because they shun people who are concerned with privacy...in the name of privacy, of all things. What a dishonest bunch.
I'll be going up in the rapture before it gets that crazy, so that's something for the leftbehinders to figure out ;)
