Two Request
Can some one give me the correct entry I should place in my config
file for the best key-server
Can I have an option that practically helps me to search thru several
key servers .. i.e. search the second (specified keyserver) if the
first (specified keyserver) did not have the key, use the third
(keyserver ..) if the second did not have the key  and so on

I'm sorry if I am repeating this question
I use Win XPP, Mozilla 1.7.8 , Enigmail, GPG 1.4.1
My Mozilla word Wrap is set to 72 characters
How do I set word wrap in GPG , Enigmail ?

Thanks for the reply
Many a time I get bad signatures when I have long lines sticking out
in the quoted text. This may just a coincidence, but I presently think
otherwise. So I wish to be clear about the wrapping issue
The way I look at it is
Step 1 - The message is signed as is (without wrapping), by enigmail
+ GPG
Step 2 - then My Mozilla mailer wraps it - at 72 chars (or whatever
..) which means some spaces may be added / words may be broken etc
- - and if steps 1 and 2 are sequential there is a chance that I'll get
bad sigs on my posts

I have a key where the sub key has expired
Is there a way to extend the validity of the *sub key* using GPG command
line interface
p.s. - As of now I am little hesitant to set up GPG shell etc - learn
these and then do the sub key edit - so would prefer a straight sub -
key editing
Thanks in adv

I visited the Win PT link from gnupg.org site. This link
 has the following 1.   - Windows
2.  - graphicall installer which
seems to have additional stuff + WinPt, but an older version of WinPT
3. and other links ...
Now my question - which is the most stable release of WinPT (pl. note I am a newbie) ?
- Is it preferable I have the latest release (i.e.) with all loophole
plugged  or
have the latest stable version which might be something else

- click the pen IKON (with a ?)
- I get a Enigmail pop up saying "Unverified signature" etc..
- I click yes button to import signature
- I choose keyserver.kjsl.com (I've also tried

- I get same results with *some* other keyservers as well
Where am I wrong

Hi David
Thanks for replying to my message
As of now I'e progressed a little bit and Enigmail is working fine
I've got the following on my gpg.onf file which greatly improve
enigmail's ability to search for keys (my copy at least !)
keyserver random.sks.keyserver.penguin.de
keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve include-revoked include-subkeys
keyserver-options honor-http-proxy
Thanks for replying

Sorry to butt in what is a "stub" secret key  ?
I thought that If I keep my keyring on a USB drive, there would be *no
trace of it* on the Hard Disk
Somehow your answer seems to imply that the Hard Disk has some info
about keys on other drives

Hash: SHA1
I wish to create a second keyring on my machine to avoid
crowding and to manage yagoo groups keys on independent keyrings
Problems when trying to create a second keyring
~ I'm trying to create a second keyring - for PGPNET members' keys
~ My pubring.gpg is in the directory c:\Documents and
Settings\user\Application Data\gnupg\
~ My gpg.conf is located in the same directory c:\Documents and
Settings\user\Application Data\gnupg
~ I have added the following to my gpg.conf
secret-keyring c:\documents and settings\user\application
keyring c:\documents and settings\user\application
keyring c:\documents and settings\user\application data\gnupg\pgpnet.gpg
~ I have administrator rights on my machine - So rights / permissions
to create files are NOT a problem.
~ I had installed GnuPG using the same login etc. on this machine,
again user rights is not the issue
~ Neither winPT nor Enigmail are running now
~ Other normal gpg commands like --Decrypt etc are working from
command prompt
~ Now when I try to import PGPNET_Keys.asc into the second keyring
"pgpnet.gpg" with the command "gpg --import PGPNET_Keys.asc" I get the
following errors
=============== start of command line output =================
C:\gpg --import PGPNET_Keys.asc

Where am I going wrong ?
Any help is appreciated
