File Shredder works perfectly great for this purpose.

To check the effectiveness, according to DoD anything that is not wiped with algorithm DoD 5220.22M has potential to be recovered.
File shredder works well with DoD algorithm and higher. Also it is free.
If you are looking to wipe a disk,you can use DiskNuke. Both are sourceforge.net projects.

I wouldn't argue about methods discussed here to destroy the disk.
However one consideration is, what data we are talking about. In my
CISSP course, I was not taught to *destroy* data or protect it. I was
just taught to make it so difficult for hacker to access it so that
compare to the amount of time spent on recovery and resource it is
All the methods discuss here, *putting it on blast furnace*, what data
would *you* (not talking about matter of national security) be having on
a disk that a hacker will get access to the millions of pieces of your
hard drive, try to join them and get data out of it :-)

How about dropping HD in Lava from some exploding mountain?
