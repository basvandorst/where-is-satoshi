when you type:
gpg --list-keys
look in the input after the type of the key (pub|sup) is the length of the key folowed by a single letter (for example '1024g') this letter tells you what is the what kind exactly is the key.

As far as I can remember in man pages there's no such thinkg like encrypting RSA keys. And generating of keys of that type is "certain potentially incompatible" ( So in general it is not needed to distinguish RSA keytypes.

I'm not telling that gpg can not handle RSA keys I'm telling that using
a RSA encrypting keys is deprecated.

Now I get the situation.
If you give me some links to fresh docs I'll appreciate that.

Is this caused by my mistake or just have to wait the system to do it by
its own? I'm really confused, bacause the publishing keys it really
straightforward process or I'm missing the big point?
