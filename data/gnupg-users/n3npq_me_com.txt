FWIW, the reasoning is/was similar in RPM choosing the sks-keyservers pool

There's no need to reinvent a better infrastructure.
So I'll chime in and piggy-back a +1 to Kristian Fiskerstrand here: Nice job!
The previous default of "keys.rpm5.org" might yet have to be resurrected
if it is not possible to also use SKS key servers as a notary registrar for
automatically generated key pairs generated by every invocation of
The number of invocations of rpmbuild daily is likely larger than all other
pubkey uploads to SKS key servers combined.
Which makes me a bit more sensitive to issues of bloat! with CA57AD7C robo-signatures
in SKS key servers than most.

A couple of nitpicks, peripheral to BDB, specific to SKS, related to pagesize:
The sampleConfig/sksconf.typical file includes these lines:
    1) The naming of ?pagesize? (likely BDB hysterical naming) does not
    follow the other table(s) naming: one would expect ?key_pagesize?.
    2) There is no ?keyid_pagesize?. In fact, if you set that variable,
    then sks fails to run with an obscure error. (there?s likely a different
    config variable name in the sources, haven?t looked).
The second failure is seen iff sksconf is in the current directory when running sks_build.sh.
Which brings up another another nitpick: if trying to set per-table pagesize using
sksconf, then a warning message might be useful if the current directory does *NOT*
contain a valid sksconf.
(aside: note-to-self)
There is likely a way to change pagesize without having to reload from a dump. I?ll
see if I can dig out the details. todo++.
