hi ingo, excuse me, your right! i just answered to the mail and did not take care of the address (another mailist i am on works correctly this way).
i think i got the point: the conspiracy is not about the information itself but the consistence between id and the person who is behind it (thats why an id is an id is an id, i should have guessed that on my own ;-) thats true, and lcd displays are less harmfull to your eyes (but still too expensive at the moment)

or can they? is it possible to write a script that automatically encrypts to all the keys on ones keyring and sends itself to the corresponding addresses? even if, it never will be able to sign.

nice hack, so we have to take a close look at the key if an executable is attached and not run executables until we asked the "original" sender to confirm "his" action. seems to be easy to avoid this kind of attack (because hardly anybody will run executables that they do not expect in advance) - too easy....?

usually i would not expect someone to run an executable that came with encrypted but not signed mail ;-)
you are perfectly right (anyway, everybody should try to find something better than ANY as passphrase ;).
i guess tony was closer to the point i was thinking of:
if you behave like the cryptosoftware you use wants you to behave, is it still possible to create a worm that uses encryption to hide itsself and spread? as far as i understood until now - any passphrase + offline-check of a key of a strange mail + be carefull running executables - we do not have to expect this too soon?

hi David,
there are keyservers that do not mangle this kind of keys (keyserver.kjsl.com i.e.). the problem is that the different servers are synchronizing your key and then some of them ´destroy´ your key. the only solution for this is to tell everybody where they can get a valid copy.
have a look at the mail archive (Subject: using various subkeys [HOWTO] From: Adrian 'Dagurashibanipal' von Bidder )

thats true, but you can easily download the current version of gnupg (should be v1.1.9o) from  and copy this into the place of v1.0.6 in the gnupp-paket. this will work, because gnupg is the cryptografic software on which gnupp is based; the other things arround it are just there to use it in a (computers are like air conditioners, they work better with windows closed)

good point, thats true. for i was this private person i should say something:
1. in this case i have no probs with that
2. i had no probs because i did not think about it; something that should not happen especially on a list that is about privacy
3. it happened due to the behavior of my e-mail-software: if i just "answer" a mail from a list, sometimes the software takes the private e-mail address, sometimes the list-address (depending on the list). i did not take care about this when i answered to martin.
don´t be affraid, there will not be any sudden influx of clueless proprietary software users because "we" normally do not know enough about computers and/or computing to invade suddenly the wide terrain of free software. even if, what would be the harm?
so you have to be a farmer to have something nice to eat? (well, at least a good cook ;-)
thats a good hint. and thanx to the developers.
this way even windows users (for whatever reason) can help opensource projects if these are available for that platform (that does not mean, that the developers are obliged to make it available)
no doubt, M$ is a pain in the as, but its a dinosaur (nothing against dinosaurs), so relax and give all users the time to make up their minds even if its not easy to be patient.
i am happy that there exists a way to use gnupg on my windows-box. i am not happy with windows. at the moment i am to busy to change to linux (its said that to learn chinese medicine you need 800 years, so sometimes i prefer to read a classical book than a computerrelated manual) but as time goes by...

i would have liked to be told what you are talking about, its just easier this way (don t worry, i informed myself meanwhile).
good idea! but unfortunately there are no NO WAR PROFESSIONALS (even not gandhi)
but to be serious: some of the statements that refer to a NO WAR banner and a quotation of mr. gandhi (both of it timeless) reflect on anti-u.s.-feelings abroad and political correctness in the web very emotionally. we should take this seriously. this effect not only is due to its cause (the banner and the quote). if we engage in this discussion more emotionally than in a fundamental opposition to war then something very strange is happening.

the problem seems to be what the u.s. are doing at the moment. hardly anybody in the entire world believes it is freedom they are fighting for.
i do not doubt your sincerety (does this word exist?) but what makes the discussion being confrontative sometimes and people feeling helpless is that we all know for sure that your wish will not come true (except for the end of the war). that makes me angry as hell (not about you).

hi list,
i have been thinking about whether modern war is related to this lists theme or not. if gpg is software to ensure that the information you get is reliable (in many aspects and besides other functionality)
and we assume that the information we get about modern wars through our mass media is NOT reliable
then discussions about modern war are not off topic.

"> Also, what will be the result if I set preferences to "none"?
You'll have no preferences, which means the cipher 3DES, the hash
SHA1, and the compressions ZIP or uncompressed."
or another:
"If you're wanting to change the prefered hashes and cipher algos
in your key, this can be done with 'gpg --edit-key '
This will bring up the interactive key editing menu (type 'help'
to get a full list of interactive menu options). Typing
'showpref' will display the current preferences for the key,
listing the cipher algos, hashes and compression libs. You can
change the preferences in the list by typing 'pref' to compare
the preference values with those shown with 'showpref' (which is
more verbose), and then using 'setpref ' to set your
key's preferences to the values given in the , and then
update the preferences with 'updpref'.
For example, S7 is AES, S10 is TWOFISH, etc. for a couple of the
cipher algos, H3 is RIPEMD160, and H2 is SHA1 for hashes, and Z2
is ZLIB and Z1 is ZIP for compression. Let's say that you want
to change your preferences to use only TWOFISH for the cipher
algo, RIPEMD160 for the hash and ZLIB for compression...
$ gpg --edit-key 0x91EC5F05
Command> showpref
pub  1024D/18E19CAB  created: 2002-03-02 expires: never     trust: u/u
(1). Ima GnuPGuser      Cipher: AES, TWOFISH, CAST5, BLOWFISH, 3DES
     Hash: RIPEMD160, SHA1
     Compression: ZLIB, ZIP
Command> pref
pub  1024D/18E19CAB  created: 2002-03-02 expires: never     trust: u/u
(1). Ima GnuPGuser      S7 S10 S3 S4 H3 H2 Z2 Z1
Command> setpref S10 H3 Z2
Command> updpref
Command> quit
This will change your key's preferences for the chosen cipher
algos, hash and compression to be used to those you specified in
the .
You can also include in your ~/.gnupg/options (soon to be
~/.gnupg/gpg.conf with the release of 1.2) the option
'--cipher-algo ' where  is one of the supported
cipher algos (can be found with 'gpg --version'), or you could
also also indicate in your options file the line
'--preference-list ' (where  is a list of
preferences as would be used with 'setpref' in the --edit-key's
interactive menu.
I hope this is what you were looking for. More information on
setting your preferences using both the interactive menu in
'--edit-key' and the options file can be found in the man pages
if needed."

what about an error-message like this:

no need to change the code, not too big error msg, bigger manual :-/
thats the point: the experienced user doesn t want too detailed

show up on a day to day use), and for the unexperienced user this
information is hardly helpfull, because you have to look up the details
anyway (probably in the manual).
