Anyone going to be at RSA in San Francisco next week?  How about
a keysigning meetup there?

This is a question aimed at researching opinion - it does *not*
imply that I think key expiration is a bad idea.  I'm relatively
neutral, tending to the conservative.
Why expire keypairs?  They can, afterall, be revoked.
One reason I immediately come up with is that the longer they
exist, the more likely they are to be compromised.  Are there
other reasons?
Your thoughts appreciated.

Also, it's because the Web of Trust is a protocol for "Web" which
never defines "Trust."  This isn't particular to the WoT btw,
it's endemic to information security.

Just so no-one thinks this is representative of everyone on this
alias, for the record, I feel entirely comfortable with the
message on the gnupg.org website.  This is a Free Software
project.  Free Software is political, like it or not (as are many
other aspects of life that people would rather not "politicize").
If "professionalism" means keeping morality out of daily
discourse, I hope I never achieve it.  Our lives are already
sanitized enough.

I expressed no opinion at all about the morality of the war.  I
was speaking of moral discourse, not any particular position.
So you aren't being argumentative, at least not with me.

I agree.  I was recently in a "sexual harassment" class where the
teacher, a lawyer, virtually rolled his eyes and laughed at the
"I didn't send that email" defense.  I suggested that it was
trivial to spoof the origin of an email; he said that it doesn't
matter what you can do, it only matters what a jury of your peers
think you can do.  He clearly thought that the claim held no
credibility in any sensible person's mind.
