@_subject: Are .ems attachments necessary? 
Hi people,
I just joined this group a few days ago, and am finding
that some of the email messages are contained in .ems
attachments.  I don't understand why this is necessary.
Can't the text be put in the body of email?
To me these .ems attachments add a whole level of
unnecessary complication to the situation.
Also, I've found that emails from "Alfred M. Szmidt" crash
Eudora 5.1, so I've had to set up a filter to trash
those emails rather than having to reboot each time Eudora
brings Windows down.  (Yes, I know Windows is crappy.  I
have several other computers running FreeBSD, & Linux)
Can anyone explain why these .ems attachments are required?
