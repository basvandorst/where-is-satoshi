Hash: SHA256
Dear GnuPG staff,
I have Virtualbox-4.0.6 installed ok on my Linux machine, but on
updating to the newest one . . . .
I got the following messages using(KDE) kpackage kit:
1 -> The GPG keys listed for the "Fedora 14 - x86_64 - VirtualBox"
repository are already installed but they are not correct for this
2 -> Check that the correct key URLs are configured for this repository.
Sorry for this question but:
How to install the correct GPG keys for this package?
where are the correct key URLs, and where to configure it? Please.
Ps. Besides Virtualbox I have installed Firefox & Thunderbird.
