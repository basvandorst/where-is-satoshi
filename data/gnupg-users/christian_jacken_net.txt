how do I prevent someone else to create a key in my name and to send it to a
key server to mislead third parties?
And is anyone aware of a Trust Center (Certification Authority) which would
sign a GnuPG key created by me?
I visited signtrust.deutschepost.de for example, however they only sign keys
that they have created, and deliver the keys on chipcards which work with a
PIN code.

Hello folks,
* What do you think about a Java implementation of GNUPG (like
hushmail.com - sources available at   I think there is a demand for easy and mobile encryption, especially from
less computer-literate users.
* To what extent is GNUPG based on the GPL sources of PGP 2.6.x?
* Is there a free version of PGP for business use (considering that the RSA
patent expired)?
* How can I contact Werner Koch? werner.koch unfortunately failed.
* By chance, is someone aware of a software that converts Outlook 2000 .pst
files for use with a good Linux X-Window mail client (unfortunately Netscape
4 and 6 crashes because my over-300MB-pst file seems to be to large)?
Thank you very much,

first I want to thank the many list participants who helpfully replied to my
initial posting.
I read at pgpi.com that "The source code for PGP 2.3a and earlier is
distributed under GPL - the General Public License - so it can be used
freely in your own programs."
Someone knows where to download it?
Which versions exist between 2.6x and 5.x?
Again, do you know a download site?
BTW, how can I subscribe to this list, please?
Sorry but I couldn't find any info about this on gnupg.org.
And I also couldn't reach Werner at wk due to a permanent fatal
