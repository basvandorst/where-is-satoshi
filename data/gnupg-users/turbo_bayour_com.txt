I needed to move lots of data from one site to another across
europe. I got a huge disk and archived all data onto that using
something like (simplified):
To extract the data again, it's just as simple:
This have worked perfectly for a number of these data moves
I've done over the last few months...
But this last one gave me a problem when trying to unpack
There's 1498 4GB files, and I managed to extract 792GB before
this failure. But since the archive files is in ASCII armor,
there's no telling in which file the problem lies!
I'm currently looking for '^-|.*:|^$' in the files, but
so far nothing...
1. What character is D0, 00, AD and DE? What can I look for
    (to try to diagnose the problem/file)
2. Is there ANYTHING I can do to get my data, exept making a
    new archive (which, for various reasons, take about
    two-three weeks)?
I've googled this problem, but most (if not all) get this
when/if receiving an ASCII armor via mail which messes
things up. I doubt very much that's the problem here, since
I'm using the exact, identical file I started with, not a
copy (which is the result of mailing it)...

Doh! I assumed that these where some code characters (meaning it's
something else in the actuall file).
Looking for these (egrep 'D0|00|AD|DE') basically gives me every single
line! They are everywhere, even in the very first file (which extracted
without any problems).
Any (other) idea how I do that?
They are ASCII armored, but I can't find a reason why they should
be messed up.
The commandline(s) are simple enough and doesn't ... rewrite anything
(other the 'transference' of clear text data to encrypted data by  gpg), there
is no compression involved in any of the pipes and they are on a RAID5
with XFS,
I usually hate it myself when people say 'it used to work' and/or 'it  before', but this setup have been thoroughly tested and verified and I'm
not a noob, not even with PGP/GnuPG...
To be honnest, I've heard about that before, but in my 20 years with  I never, ever encountered it :). Data is always the same as the one  you put there.

I now managed to find the problematic line(s).
5470206000 d0 00 ad de d0 00 ad de d0 00 ad de d0 00 ad de
5470207000 d1 00 ad de d1 00 ad de d1 00 ad de d1 00 ad de
These are the only lines I've found so far...
Now, what does this mean?! :)

I managed to find the offending part in the original file (see  Now, I tried to just remove the binary chars, but that ended up with a  which is shorter than the others which I doubt will work (it would  take me
almost a day to find out - slow USB1 disks), so any idea on how to  would be much appreciated.

That was a lot more difficult than it sounded!! :)
I tried vi, emacs, sed, tr and finaly perl (!!). Perl finaly managed  to find and replace the
faulty characters...
Something in the TERM I guess...
But the last part didn't end up at the 64 char limit the other lines  have. Instead, the last
char on that line is at position 15. Would that be a problem?
Are you thinking about the '--ignore-crc-error' option?
