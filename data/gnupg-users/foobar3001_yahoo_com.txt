@_subject: Can I create domain keys? 
I would like to create a domain key, which can be used for all emails in a particular domain. For example, if the key is for "* then sending to both "foo at example.com" and "bar at example.com" would use this key.
Is this possible with GPG?
Thank you very much...

Thank you for your response. Some comments inline...

I have tried to enter a "wildcard email" when gpg asked me for the email address during key generation. I tried "example.com", " and "* but all of them were rejected with 'Not a valid email address'. Is there a special syntax I should use?
I think the point you just made is the relevant one: Even if I would be able to create a key with a "wildcard email" associated with it, would the email client plugins, such as Enigmail, be able to deal with it? I guess that's a question for the Enigmail developers, once I figure out how to generate a key with a wildcard email via gpg.
Thank you!

Hello Doug,
Thank you for the answer!

Strangely, though, I still don't know how. I tried it with the gpg command line tool, but that didn't seem to accept any sort of wildcard syntax. Is there one that I am not aware of?
Yes, that is possibly the bigger issue.

Sorry, I had not read this response yet when I wrote my previous email.
Obviously, here is the answer on how to create a free-form UID for the key.
Thank you!
