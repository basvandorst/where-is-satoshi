@_subject: Enforcing password complexity for private keys 
We?re considering rolling out GnuPG at work for developers to sign git commits.
How can we prevent developers from choosing a trivial password?
Is there a way for GnuPG to enforce some password complexity on the private keys?
Is that something that a Yubikey could do? Many thanks!

Yes, we?re considering using smart cards or usb devices like Yubikey.
Do those enforce password complexity?
To answer suggestions in other replies, our developers are savvy enough, and we do have recurring training in place to stress the importance of good passwords. But we know also that some developers will choose the weakest password the system allows, making them the weakest link.

Believe me we have long and passionate discussions about passwords length and complexity.
The question in my post is purely technical.

Indeed it?s specified in the OpenPGP card specs. I have my answers Thanks
