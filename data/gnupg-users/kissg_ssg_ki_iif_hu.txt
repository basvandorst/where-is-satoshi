The password is not random therefore every time you
encrypt the same plaintext you got the same cryptfile.
(The opposite would cause big problems in a disk encryption system. :-)
Then this password is encrypted and stored transparently in a .gpg file.
Why don't you try it?

Don't consider please. :-)
Original question was what are proper tools to encrypt
files before remote backup over low bandwith connection.
I suggested a good one a few days ago. No one disclaimed yet.
Of course I also could mention dozens of less perfect solutions.
E.g. "Copy all files to /dev/null that can be well compressed
before transmission" :-)

Eeerrr... sorry to say but I think you missed something.
Loop-aes works like this:
1. disk content is encrypted/decrypted on the fly with symmetric
cipher algorithm AES.
2. Disk keys are stored in a gpg encrypted file. Multiple users
may be access to the disk keys, each with own passphrase. That is
based on the well known method: "encrypt content with a random
session key and symmetric cipher then encrypt session key multiple
times for each addressee".
(Actually this does not increase the security because any of
authorized users can extract plain disk keys from the gpg file
so ability to use personal passphrases is just a convenient feature.)
3. Disk keys do not change(!). I can restore a lost key file from an USB
stick a year after generating the encrypted block device then I can mount
it again.
4. Key file and various keys are handled automatically by losetup and
mount commands. 5. Command 'aespipe' do the same thing as 'loop' kernel module and
losetup/mount do. (Compatibility level is 100%.) Its primary use to
encrypt an existing filesystem _in_place_. (No need to copy the content
from one block device to other. If you are not afraid of power outage. ;-)
I suggest to make your own _test_ then tell us what is the result. :)
Moreover in case of any doubt you can contact Jari Ruusu.

This key is to sign control messages of the hun.* newsgroups.
It is quite unlikely that someone wants to spend any time with
breaking of it. :-)
It is no worth to do it.
However administering and distribute a new key may be problematic.
I don't know yet how much.
If this cannot be done by my self in one hour then I figure out
what is the cost of changing the key.
Thanks for your advices.

Now I started to debug gpg-agent.
I don't know why but now there is a minor difference in the log output:
gpg-agent[21153.7] DBG: <- PRESET_PASSPHRASE xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx -1 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

2008-08-22 15:27:21 gpg-agent[21153] starting a new PIN Entry
I.e. "miss" is changed to "hit". However a new pinentry popup window
appears yet.
Putting some additional log_debug() statements in the code I found that
the critical part is function findkey.c:unprotect().
It retrieves cached passphrase successfully but a few lines below
it calls agent_askpin() unconditionally.
Why does this happen? Could somebody explain me?
And how should I use gpg-preset-passphrase?

Just for the archive:
I found a bug in gpg-agent. Since July 2006 gpg-preset-passphrases sends
passphrase as a hexstring but gpg-agent does not convert it back to
Now gpgme + gpg-agent + gpg-preset-passphrase works very well for me.
Details and patch are posted to gnupg-devel list.

@_subject: gpg-agent ignores preset passphrase 
Dear folks,
I tried to use "preset passphrase" feature but it does not work.
Log shows that gpg-agent seemingly receives passphrase but later
when agent should use the cached passphrase it ask for it again
from pinentry.
Is the problem mentioned by Andreas Hartmann fixed?
( at gnupg.org/msg01518.html)
I have gpg-agent version 2.0.0 from Debian package gnupg-agent

@_subject: [GnuPG-users] identical files -> non-identical encrypted files 
Jari Ruusu's loop-aes uses the following method:
- it encrypts disk/file with AES - it has 1-65 pieces of 128-256 bit keys for this symmetric cipher
- disk keys are stored in a file that is encrypted by GPG
- Several users may have access to this file (each with his own secret key)
So I suggest to use some similar way.
Loop-aes utility 'aespipe' does the above key handling automagically.
