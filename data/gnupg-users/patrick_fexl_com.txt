@_subject: Problem with Open BSD build 
I'm having a very difficult time doing the 'make' for gnupg-1.2.3 on Open BSD platforms.
Today I downloaded gnupg-1.2.3.tar.gz onto a machine running Open BSD 3.2 (GENERIC)   I ran the ./configure script and then ran 'make', which complained:
Making all in tools
gcc  -g -O2 -Wall   -o mpicalc  mpicalc.o ../cipher/libcipher.a ../mpi/libmpi.a ../util/libutil.a /usr/local/lib/libintl.a -L/usr/ports/devel/gettext/w-gettext-0.10.40/gettext-0.10.40/intl/.libs -L/usr/local/lib /usr/local/lib/libiconv.a
mpi-inline.h:119: Undefined symbol `_mpihelp_sub_n' referenced from text segment
mpi-add.c:136: Undefined symbol `_mpihelp_sub_n' referenced from text mpi-add.c:143: Undefined symbol `_mpihelp_sub_n' referenced from text ... etc. etc. yadda yadda
I don't know why those symbols are undefined -- I ran 'nm' on libmpi.a and they appear to be in there.  The assembler files (*.S) are there, and did not seem to cause gcc any problems during the make process.  I do see that mpih-sub1.S is a symbolic link to i386-openbsd/miph-sub1.S, by the way, which says:
    .globl C_SYMBOL_NAME(mpihelp_sub_n)
Just as a test, I installed gnupg-1.2.3 onto a Linux machine and a Mac OSX machine and everything worked great.
Then I tried to install gnupg-1.2.3 onto a different Open BSD machine (3.0 generic  and I got the same problem described above with those undefined "mpihelp" symbols.
Does anyone have any idea why I am getting this same error on two different Open BSD machines?

Holy mackerel!  That actually worked -- on both OpenBSD machines.  Of course, I had to do a "make clean" first to flush the toxins from the first build attempt:
make clean
./configure ac_cv_sys_symbol_underscore=yes
Worked like a charm.  Thanks!!

Yep, that worked too.  So now we have two solutions on OpenBSD:
# solution 1:
./configure ac_cv_sys_symbol_underscore=yes
# solution 2:
./configure --disable-asm
By the way, one sysadmin I'm working with just skirted the whole issue by installing gnupg-1.0.7.tgz from the OpenBSD Ports system.
Anybody see any problems with that?

@_subject: Retrieving signature from message that was encrypted and signed in 
I have a message that was encrypted and signed in one step.  When I decrypt it, I can read the message and see that the signature is valid.   So far so good.
I would now like to relay this message to a third party so he can verify the signature too.  But as far as I know, GPG has no way to do Can GPG do this?  If not, why not?  Is this lack of ability actually a feature?  I suppose it could be a feature, because this gives the sender a way to prove to ME that he signed something, without giving me a way to prove that to anyone else.
Is that the reason why what I want to do is not possible with GPG?

How neat, thanks for the pointer.  Fortunately I do not intend to use this feature routinely, it would only be for rare cases where a dispute might arise.
But yes, the feature does work as you describe.
For example:
% gpg --show-session-key "
Sure, I would have the option of disclosing the session key to anyone or everyone.
Thanks again!
Best Regards,

I'm pretty sure you'd just use the 32-bit key id as follows:
gpg --delete-key A5F59887
