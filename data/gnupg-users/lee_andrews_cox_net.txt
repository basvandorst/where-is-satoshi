@_subject: Gnupg, Windows 9X and stderr/stdout 
I have written a batch file that will encrypt and ftp a file. I also have one that will ftp down the file and decrypt. Only on the Windows 9x platforms do I have a problem getting detailed logs on the gpg. Sending output to stderr works fine on NT/2000/XP, but not on 95.  Basically I am looking for any way to capture a log on gpg so that we have a history of the encryption process....
Any suggestion is appreciated.
