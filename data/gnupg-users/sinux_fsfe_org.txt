@_subject: How know who is a file encrypted for ? 
I can't find how list who's a file encrypted for ? I've encrypt several
files with different recipients, but I don't remember which.
In general how can I make difference between file encrypted for one
user, several user ? symmetric encrypted, asymmetric ?
Thank you.

You just have to toggle to secret keyring, select key (> key 4) and run
delkey. You'd be asked if you realy want delete a secret subkey.
That's what you did in public keyring but there is two keyring one
public and one secret. You could have run "gpg --delete-keys" and "gpg
--delete-secret-keys" too.

OK, I misunderstood your question.
Have you try to recreate and re-import your full public keyring and
delete your secret subkey first? It's just an idea to solve your problem but I can't help you find out an

I thought it wasn't any command for security reason, but I agree it
seems a basic functionality is missing.
Maybe a command giving complete information on a file would be useful
too. I mean a signed file and an encrypted file have both .gpg extension
and are hard to distinguish, aren't they ?
Or the --verify command could be more verbose and list recipient's
keys ?
$ gpg --verify encrypted_file.gpg
gpg: verify signatures failed: unexpected data
$ gpg --verify signed_file.gpg
gpg: Signature made ...
gpg: Good signature from ...

I agree, normal users may want user friendly output and developers want
full debugging  output. There is two need and now only full (heavy)
output is available. Obviously users can make it with sed and awk but if there do so they are
developers and like verbose output ;)

@_subject: adding a new email to a key 
I had same confusion at beginning. I wanted have one private key and two
separate identities (one personal and one for work.) There is no sens
with that. The private key is your identity. You can have several email
but you're always "you" ;)  Having more that one email address mean
somebody know,trust and sign uid+email and someone else know,trust and
sign uid+email but not necessary uid+email
One uid can have several "web of trust" (identified by email address)
and they're all listed in public key.
You can generate two key-pair (I don't now if it's a good idea?).One
uid and one uid that's two identities, two public
key,... much work, much problems, no sens(!?)...

have you tried posting directly the muscle's mailing list ?
Ludovic Rousseau helped me fixing a SCR335 with a patch. He knows pretty
good how debug pcscd. You'll maybe get better result ?
Hope it help...;)
