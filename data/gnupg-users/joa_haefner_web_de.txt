@_subject: error while importing own certificate 
I have got an email-account at freemail.web.de. They offer a s/mime certificate that I want to use with kmail. It works with mozilla and netscape just fine. But if I try to import it into gnupg with "gpgsm --import joa_haefner.at.web.de.p12" I get the errormessage:
gpgsm: no issuer found in certificate
gpgsm: basic certificate checks failed - not imported
Any idea what is wrong?
