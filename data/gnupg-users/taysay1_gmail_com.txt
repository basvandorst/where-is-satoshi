Good days wonderful people,
   I am having a challenge running gpg on windows 2003 server , I am working
with it from java, when I run my code on my vista , Mac os x box it works
pretty fine ,
   everything work fine when I run it for the command line on windows 2003
server, however when I run it for my code on windwos 2003 server decryption
fails though with no
  error rather that return false. Pls is there a special configuration for
gpg on windows 2003 server?
 thank you,
 taysay
