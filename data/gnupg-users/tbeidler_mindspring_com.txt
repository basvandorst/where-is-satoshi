@_subject: newbie question "Public key not found" with PHP 
Please CC me. I'm not sure if I'm subscribed yet.
I'm having problems using GNUPG for the first time. I'm using it with PHP
and I'll show you my code;
 // Set directory for "www"'s key ring
 putenv("GNUPGHOME=/var/www/.gnupg");
 // Dump email message into indata file
 $fp = fopen("/usr/home/dogma/temp/indata", "w+");
 fputs($fp, $msg);
 fclose($fp);
 // encrypt
 system("/usr/local/bin/gpg --encrypt -ao /usr/home/dogma/temp/outdata -r
 'Joe Schmoe ' /usr/home/dogma/temp/indata ");
 unlink("/usr/home/dogma/temp/indata");
 $crypted = "/usr/home/dogma/temp/outdata";
 $fd = fopen($crypted, "r");
 $mail_cont = fread($fd, filesize($crypted));
 fclose($fd);
 unlink("$crypted");
I keep getting "Public key not found". The key lines are the "putenv" which
is the directory of the PHP users key ring and "system" which is the actual
command line. I've tried several variations of the public key, ie. 'Joe',
'Joe Schmoe', 'jschmoe
I've tried telneting in as myself and encrypting something and I get the
samething. When I --check-ring it shows that I have both my private and
public key.
Any help would be appreciated.

I'm working with an ISP and trying to help him trouble shoot some issues.
He's running GNUPG 1.04 and he's trying to import a PGP 6. something public
key. He's telling me he's getting a "gpg - invalid armor header" error. I
was able to add the key successfully to my PGP key ring. Can you import PGP
keys? I didn't see anything in the FAQ or the "How to."
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
