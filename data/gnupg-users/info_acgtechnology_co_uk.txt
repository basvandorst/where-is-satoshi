@_subject: School Communication with Parents 
Please forward this email to the Headteacher and the Deputy Head(s). Thank you.
In this weeks TES, dated Friday 28th September, there is an article on page 4 which outlines how
a school is using text messaging to mobile phones to increase communications with parents.
As a communications provider we have been contacted by several schools wishing to send bulk
text messages to parents and have therefore produced a website called  to facilitate this.
 is a pay as you go solution with no set-up or registration fees and which can
be accessed from anywhere there is internet access.
Please register at  and use the free credits available to send some free text
messages to see how effective  is.
Here are a few ideas for using  in education:
-the school is closing as the result of flooding and through text messaging you can get that
message to every parent that has their mobile phone turned on simultaneously in an average of
8 seconds.
-with regard to the recent events in America all parents that have mobile numbers could be informed of
crisis situations and the actions to be taken.
-inform parents of the arrival time back at school of sports/ski/overseas trips etc.
-send merits and sanction information to parents daily.
-send a note to parents to say that there offspring are bringing home a newsletter/form for their attention
that needs a reply.
-communicate sports results to interested parents.
-as a fundraiser, sponsorship channel, mobile raffle. (for more info please contact infor
-sending absence information to parents quickly and cost effectively.
-prompting parents to attend events such as parents evenings.
-confirmation route that there offspring have completed a task.
-ask the parent to call the school so reducing the expenditure by the school on external phone calls.
-prompt parents to seek out news articles in papers.
-promote upcoming events and ticket information.
-prompting staff to meetings.
I am sure that there are many more ways by which  could help you to communicate.
