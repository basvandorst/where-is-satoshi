@_subject: gpg/keyboard issue 
I just imported my gpg keys from my previous install. However, when trying to use them to sign/encrypt/decrypt, my passphrase fails, even though I'm one hundred percent certain it's correct. Possible cause: my passphrase contains a character that I added to my keyboard manually through xmodmap - the scandinavian "?" character. Even though the character works, and I can type my passphrase apparently correctly, it fails. People suggested that it might be related to my keyboard mapping; I can't remember offhand what it was set to before so I tried possible settings, but so far no luck. Is there a procedure to get this working?
