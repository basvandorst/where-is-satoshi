@_subject: working with bare gpg - how to close the text-block 
Since I like to know how things work, I also tried working with gpg from the
command line. Much is discribed on the Net and that works.
But what I can not find is this:
In a commandline box in Windows XP I call the gpg by just typing "gpg" and
nothing extra
This replies by "gpg: Go ahead and type your message ...  "
And there it stops. I can keep on typing .. but can't close the
text-entering and make the gpg continue.
Guess that should work .. but not here.
Anyone know which key combination is needed to go further?

Ctrl-Z  followed by Enter results in
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: processing message failed: eof

gpg -e results in a lot of unreadable signs - like a cloud
no option.
Maybe it's not meant to be used this way.
