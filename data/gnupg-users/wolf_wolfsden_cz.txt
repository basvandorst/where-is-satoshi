Do you honestly believe that this is really possible? That government
backdoor will stay available only to government and will not be
As an example I would raise issue of TSA accepted luggage locks. You
know, those locks that only TSA is supposed to have master key to
inspect for threats? The master key you can download from internet and
print on your 3d printed and open any TSA accepted lock with

So in my eyes, when it comes to your question, we have only two
options, no privacy or absolute privacy. Or do you know of any way to
guarantee that government backdoor will not be made public and/or

Then I'm sorry, I've probably got you wrong. But I would be really
interested to know what is you proposed solution to this issue.

@_subject: Change agent-socket path 
I'm in need of changing the path to the agent socket, but I cannot find
a way to do so. My problem:
gpg-agent normally runs in /run/user/1000/gnupg/S.gnu-agent , which is
completely fine. However, when building packages (archlinux, makepkg),
the building/signing is done in fakeroot environment. Therefore the
socket path default to ~/.gnupg/S.gnu-agent. Because (at least it seems
to me) in fakeroot I am root (0) and therefore don't own /run/user/1000
What would be a good way to solve this issue?
Thanks for any help,

I did some thinking about this and I must admit that I don't see why the
check is needing at all. In what situation relaxing the check would case
security issues?
So basically the "correct" solution are these two lines:
? Since there is no way to provide the socket manually? That seems..

I know nothing about the extension but would like to react to this:
You can always combine virtual box, openvpn and stunnel to achieve
traffic indistinguishable from https (as long as your stunnel endpoint
listens on 443). No one blocks https these days.
