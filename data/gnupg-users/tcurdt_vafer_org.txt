@_subject: mpi larger than indicated length 
Is there any chance this might have been fixed with the 1.4.3 release?
At the moment I don't really know how to otherwise fix my keyring.
Any thoughts?

@_subject: upgrading from 1.x to 2.x 
I have just "migrated" from 1.x to 2. (just installed 2.x instead of  1.x) and while I can still sign files with
$ gpg2 --armor --output test.asc --detach-sig test
refreshing the keys fails.
$ gpg2 --refresh-keys
an mpi of size 0 is not allowed
gpg: keyring_get_keyblock: read error: Invalid packet
gpg: error reading keyblock: Invalid keyring
gpg: keyserver refresh failed: Invalid keyring
And even importing a file that (at least) looks perfectly OK gives me
$ gpg2 --import msg.asc
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: Total number processed: 0
This is GnuPG 2.0.8 on OSX 10.5.2 installed via MacPorts
Any hints?

Hey Werner,
Thanks for the response!
uh! ....but then using hkp should work for the update, right?
But actually I don't think this is download related.
$ gpg2 --list-keys

list some more keys - but not all
an mpi of size 0 is not allowed
gpg: keyring_get_keyblock: read error: Invalid packet
gpg: keydb_get_keyblock failed: Invalid keyring
Seems like also other people run into it
Fankly speaking - it awfully reminds me on a problem I run into with  1.x before ...that was fixed in later releases of 1.x
...looks quite OK to me :-/

I've just reverted back to 1.x. Version 2.x does not seem to be worth  the hassle. 1.x works like charm.
But couldn't import the msg.asc here either ...so it really seems to  be broken.
Anyway. Not a particular good error message though.
