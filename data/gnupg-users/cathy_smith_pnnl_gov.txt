@_subject: question about public keys 
A couple of years ago I created a gpg key for an account that is use to transfer documents with vendors.  It's worked fine.  We now have a new vendor that won't accept the public key because of the expiration date.  I don't see a way to create another public key for this account with the shorter expiration date.  Replacing the current public key will disrupt business with existing customers.  Is there a solution other than creating another account with its own gpg key?

@_subject: question about public key usage 
Is it possible to have 2 public keys with different expiration dates for the same user?  I created a public key a couple of years ago to be used to exchange documents with vendors for a batch processing account.  That is working just fine.  A new vendor wants our public key but requires the key to have a shorter expiration date.  I don't want to distribute a new public key to existing customers.
Thank you.

Someone else already answered this question for you, but the answer effectively is "yes," however you don't need to do that.
Edit the expiration date on the existing key to match the requirement for the new vendor, and then give them that version of the key. There is no reason to have multiple keys in this situation.
hope this helps,

I would like to abuse this list for something IMHO important though slightly off-topic...
I think we (and "we" is "the Internet users" not just "those who write on gnupg-users"...) are missing a culture of secured communication (which can mean encrypted, signed or anonymous or a combination of that) and that an accpeted (by "those who write on gnupg-users" ;-) ) code of conduct (my German term: "Crypto-Knigge") would be quite useful to get there (or at least nearer).
I am not talking about technical recommendations but about "organizational" (behaviour / attitude) recommendations. It's not the reason for the selection but I assume that it's easier to get a concensus in that area... :-)
I have written a draft for that. And now it's getting even more off-
topic: It's in German; thus this mainly addresses the Gerrman speaking (i.e. understanding) people on this list who might be interested in
The idea is not OpenPGP- / GnuPG-specific but for obvious reasons my view is...
But if there is enough interest from people who don't understand German then I would try to make a good translation.
I wrote it in German because (a) most of my crypto-related articles are an German and (b) something big (compared to former crypto stuff affecting the general public) is going to happen in Germany later this year which could help a lot to make this more common.

@_subject: question about gpg2 and passphrase 
I need to be able to decrypt a file using gpg2 in batch.  I have a customer who requires us to provide a public  key that is  RSA 2048 bit.  I have RHEL6 available which provides gpg 2.0.14 to create the key pair.  However,  I?ve not been able to use gpg2 in batch to provide the passphrase to decrypt a file.  It wants an interactive prompt for the passphrase.  I?ve tried some things that I?ve read on-line without any success.    Is there a way to configure gpg2 to accept a passphrase in batch?
Thanks for your help.

@_subject: how to disable pinentry 
Can someone tell the how to disable pinentry?  I'd like to be able to run gpg --edit-key, or to open a password encrypted file without a GUI.  I was able to do that in RHEL5, but so far, not in RHEL6 or CentOS 6.
I have gpg 2.0.14 on CentOS 6.6 and RHEL6U6.
I've tried to disable pinentry, without success, with the following
I've had less success on RHEL6 box as there is not a default line, use-agent, in the gpg.conf file.  On the CentOS box, when I try to run the passwd command in gpg --edit-key, I get the message:
I did not see a gpg-agent daemon running on either box.  I ran a ps command while the gpg-edit-key was running.
Thank you.

I grew up in a small town of under 5,000, where the nearest city of more than 20,000 was an hour's drive away.  Forget "a hundred years ago":
having been back there recently for a funeral, I can tell you small towns are still that same way today.
In a sense, I think this validates my thesis.  In a small town the cost of sharing information about people within the town, to people within the town, is just about nil: you wind up having these conversations while you're at the service station filling up your tank, when you're in line at the grocery store, when you're ... etc.  But having these same conversations with people outside the town involves effort, which in turn means that you can travel 100 miles and be reasonably confident nobody there has heard of you.
I agree that the small-town phenomenon argues against the idea of an idyllic privacy past.  I just think modern communications means the entire world is turning into a small-town phenomena.

You could use a console-only pinentry, such as pinentry-curses or pinentry-tty. Add the following line in your ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf:
   pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry-tty
You cannot avoid using GnuPG Agent with gpg 2. As stated in the man page, gpg 2 always requires the agent, and the use-agent option has no effect.

Hi Cathy,
We use /usr/libexec/gpg-preset-passphrase to set our passphrase.  /usr/libexec/gpg-preset-passphrase  -cP "$passphrase" $keygrip
  You would need to add this to your .gpg-agent.conf:
you will need to get the KEYGRIP. The easiest way I found is:
gpg2 --fingerprint --fingerprint --list-secret-keys | grep "fingerprint" | cut -d= -f2 | tr -d ' '
make sure you get the correct one for the correct key( note the above command shows double the number of keygrips for what you need.. ).
and you may want to adjust your max-cache-ttl gpg-agent.conf too.  If you want to forget a passphrase before the ttl is up, you can use gpg-preset-passphrase to forget it.

Hey Cathy,
You need gpg-agent running with this setup.
Per the error message, it can not connect to a running gpg-agent to enter the passphrase.
Your gpg-agent.conf also needs to be with your other gpg configs under .gnupg.

My experience is that gpg 2.2 seems to be more suited for the desktop environment than for a server environment or a remotely administered site.  We've been using gpg 1.4 (yes I know it is old) in batch mode for many years in a Red Hat environment.  Our server environment has grown increasingly restricted.  The gpg 2.2 windows pop up prompt is a real pain.  Another group that I used to do work for, just quit using gpg because they could not find a way around the pop up prompt in remote, batch installations.

The simplest way to avoid the popup is to remove the passphrase from the private key.
The private key is stored on your hard disk. If there is no passphrase on the private key, anybody with access to your hard disk can decrypt files. They can also do anything else with your key.
So you need to make sure that only you have access to the hard disk.
Is this acceptable?
I use the GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG) in combination with Enigmail.
You can send me encrypted mail if you want some privacy.
