@_subject: Compiling GPGME COMPlus 
This message is in MIME format. Since your mail reader does not understand

I'm looking to integrate GnuPG into one of our sites and a COM interface
would be perfect. I noticed the ComPlus subdirectory of GPGME and the
information in the ReadMe makes it sound like a perfect match.
I'm looking for information in how to compile the source code into a working
COM server. I've not had much experience with C compilers, so I'm looking to
determine which compiler I need and the steps to compile the source code. Thanks for the help,
Brent McLean
