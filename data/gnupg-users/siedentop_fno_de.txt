@_subject: GEAM problems 
Hello Group,
just installed GnuPG, PTH, and GEAM on my linux mailserver
GnuPG works fine, but i have problems with GEAM:
     incoming mail passes geam without decryption -> at the
moment OK
     outgoing mail passes geam without encryption -> not OK
I got the following log message:
... ready
... connect from 192.168.9.101:1520 (fd=4)
... => 'siedentop  - encrypt
... filter_feeder: abended
... pid911 exit status 127
... encryption failed: status=32512
... failed to proxy message: -1
... fd4: read error
... processing failed
... ready
What should I do?
