@_subject: List of GnuPG errors? 
This message is in MIME format. Since your mail reader does not understand

Is there a complete list anywhere of error messages for GnuPG, hopefully
with some brief explanation of their cause?  I can't find anything specific
in the GnuPG docs.  Specifically, I got the following error when trying to
decrypt a message that a customer sent to us:
A search of the docs didn't come up with anything that would help me figure
out what went wrong.  I had the customer resend it and it worked the second
time, but I'd really like to have an error message list that would help me
figure these things out in the future.  Any suggestions?  TIA

Hi.  We're running NT 4 and GPG 1.0.6.  We have an automated process that
receives email with attachments from customers and processes the decrypted
attachments.  We added the GPG capability to the existing Secret Agent
encryption last April and everything has been working nearly flawlessly.
The encryption/decryption is handled by a shelled process to the command
prompt.  In the past two weeks, however, we've gotten two errors that seem to be
internal to GPG and which cause a Dr. Watson error.  The specific error is:
"Access violation (0xc0000005), Address: 0x004787d3".  Because the errors
occur in the shell process, it is difficult to get specific error
information back so we could take appropriate action.  (Yeah, I know, we
should try Crypto_TW and we'd be able to monitor errors, but that won't
happen until we have some resources available to code the change.)
Anyway, here's the captured command line statement and GPG's response.  No
output file is created, and it generates a Dr. Watson (the painful details
are available for anyone who wants them).  Other files from the same
recipient decrypt without problem most of the time.  Has anyone encountered
this before?  What is its likely cause?
