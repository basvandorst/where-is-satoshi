@_subject: CRC error supressed...still getting unspecific read error 
I am using a php program to interface with our remotely hosted server's pgp program.  It emails the encrypted results to me.  Everything was working just fine and we were receiving and decrypting messages.  Today we got two emails that cannot be decrypted by Thunderbird/Enigmail.  I have received encrypted mail since and it has worked.  I cannot figure out why these two messages don't work.  I jumped on gpg command line and saw that I was getting the following:
CRC error; 7a00e7 - 82cded
I supressed the CRC error and got this:
gpg: block_filter 00908810: read error (size=8872,a->size=1408)
gpg: WARNING: message was not integrity protected
gpg: block_filter: pending bytes!
Here is the message:
Any ideas?
