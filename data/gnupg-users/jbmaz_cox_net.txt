@_subject: Problem with Windows binaries 
I am a new GPG user.  I have looked everywhere (manuals, bug site, mailing
lists, Google search, etc.) for information on this error, but have been
unsuccessful.  My guess is that there is a simple solution to such a basic
error right out of the chute, but I need some help finding that answer.
Could someone please help me learn how to navigate through this?
I downloaded the GPG4Win binaries (gpg4win-1.1.3.exe).  I have installed
everything in the package including GnuPG2 and Claws-Mail on three of my
computers and have not encountered any issues.  Unfortunately, however, I am
having a show stopper on the one computer that needs to have this up and
running the most.  After installation I get an error when I try to create the first key pair
using WinPT, GPA or the gpg command line.  It does not seem to matter what
options I use during the gpg -gen-key process.  They all error out in the
same fashion:
"Unhandled exception at 0x0210342a in gpg.exe: 0xC0000005: Access violation
reading location 0x0210342a."
When using GPA it follows with the following error:
"The GPGME library returned an unexpected error.  The error was:  General error  This is probably a bug in GPA.  GPA will now try to recover from this
Here is some basic system configuration information on the machine that is
not working:
