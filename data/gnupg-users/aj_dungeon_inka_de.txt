@_subject: key management 
a long time ago i had the email address aj
later i had aj and even later i had aj
i started my pgp key with the first email, added new email addresses to the key, and remove them later, when i no longer had that address.
but old versions of my key are floating around, and most of them still have
the old email addresses included. no i want to migrate to gnupg. my preferences are :
 - there must be a way to get rid of old email addresses. realy.
 - this could be done with one key per email address. but i don´t want
   to have everyone subscribe several keys. one signature on one key
   sh ould be enough. maybe some master/slave key or so ?
i saw the adduid and addkey commands in gnupg, but i´m not sure if they
will do what i want. most important: can i revoke one subkey, but leave the
whole key intact ? more exactly, i don´t want to revoke a subkey, but a userid.
and the key with all other user id´s intact. any example how people manage their keys would be nice. for example the use of separete keys for signing and encryption, or master/slave, or
yearly expired key and master key, or whatevery you have ...
regards, andreas
