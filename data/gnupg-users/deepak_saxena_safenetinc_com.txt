@_subject: GPG4Win 2.2.3 Smart card support 
I am Deepak Saxena from Gemalto (formerly SafeNet Inc) and I am curious if smart cards are supported for storing the keys which will be used to encrypt files or email using gpg4win.
I have installed gpg4win 2.2.3 and want to test SafeNet smart cards.
I am getting following error:

Can  you please update me if third party tokens/smartcard cards are supported in your product.
Is MSCAPI/PKCS11 supported?

Hi Yutaka,
I am trying to test file encryption with SafeNet smart cards. (CardOs/ Java and other tokens).
I am getting error message: The card application is not yet supported.
I have dll libraries for my tokens but I am new to GPG4Win.
Can you please guide me the way to import the library or steps by how can I configure GPG4win to support these tokens/ smartcards.
I can see the list of supported tokens as:
It it anyhow possible to support other tokens??

This is second time for me to receive the message like:
I can't answer to a message saying like this.  Perhaps, so can't everyone (and that would be the reason why you didn't get reply).
Thus, this is not the reply, but a monologue of mine.
In January, I wrote a message to this list:
    It may help somehow, but it should be just a coincidence.

@_subject: [cygwin] gpg-agent with ssh support ? 
I am curious on how/if gpg4win integrates with Windows credential providers. We at SafeNet have smart cards and middleware for our smartcard, SAC, registers itself as a credential provider any Windows application that leverages MS crypto libraries can integrate with it.
Can anyone help me with that?
