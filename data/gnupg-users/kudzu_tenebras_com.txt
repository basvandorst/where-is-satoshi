This reveals key bits to the holders, however.  Using
a K-of-N threshold scheme, or even a simple XOR,  prevents
the holders from having any knowledge of the key bits.

Encrypt the public key?  Does not compute.
Encryption is also not the same as splitting -- splitting is one
way to ensure that more than N principals must act in concert to
sign something -- and that signature might be an authorization
to perform some action with security consequences.
Of course "PKI" is not adequate as a trust management system -- it's
concerned with authentication, but leaves authorization as an exercise
for the reader. ;-)  The right way to do this is have an authorization
mechanism that requires K-of-N parties to sign a request for action.
apache-ssl has a module that permits the use of KeyNote policies
in access control.

Right, that's one possible solution.  Another is to use an algebraic
threshold scheme.  For example, you can support M-of-N threshold schemes
with 2 <= M <= N with N up to 15 if you compute over GF(2^4) modulo
the irreducible polynomial x^4 + x + 1 using nibble arithmetic.  In any
case,  the quality of random numbers is crucial to the security of
the data.
