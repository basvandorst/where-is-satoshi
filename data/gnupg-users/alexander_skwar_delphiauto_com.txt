The signature is larger, it is hard to create such a key useful for
signatures which can withstand some real world attacks,  you don't
get any extra security compared to DSA, it has only be introduced by
me because at that time it was not clear whether there is a patent
on DSA.

@_subject: PGP: Invalid key ? 
I've just installed the GnuPG 1.0.6 binaries from gnupg.org for Win32
on Windows NT SP4.  I also use WinPT 0.3.3.  Futher, I'm using PGP
Corporate Desktop 7.0.3.
In GnuPG I created a 1024 bit key.  I then exported this key and
imported it in PGP.  Encrypting/decrypting messages works both ways,
ie. PGP can decrypt texts encrypted with GnuPG and vice versa.  However,
when I want to change the trust of the GnuPG key in PGP, it tells me:
     This is an invalid key. Modifying the trust on this
     key is not allowed since trust settings on invalid
     keys have no effect.
Anyone know what I'm doing wrong?
Thanks a lot,
Alexander Skwar
