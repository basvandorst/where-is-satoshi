Hi David,
here is, how I had thunderbird + enigmail running for several years with two keys and without problems (I have switched away from thunderbird since one year ago, because it got too heavy and slow for my taste):
For each sending address, I have an identity
"Edit" -> "Account Settings" -> "Manage Identities ..."
and for each I set up the correct pgp key to use
"Edit ..." (in the Identities-window) -> "OpenPGP Security" -> "Use email address of this identity to identify OpenPGP key" (where the address matches) and "Use specific OpenPGP key ID" (where the address does not Sry, If this does not help and you mentioned it already, but the previous mails contained too much emotion to completely be read by me.
Anyways, since you originally asked for an alternative: I am currently using alpine + topal - which get's the multiple-keys part well, too, but has deficits regarding MIME/multipart encryption.

maybe I don't get the original idea - but I thought, it was to block *uploads/updates* which would poisson a certificate - not to blackhole them after they got poissoned?

While this would work for signing, it will not work for decryption.

Hi Matthias,
I assumed so, too, for a long time. But I was wrong:

Hi Nicolas,

Sry to not answer your question(s), but: I believe, the common way is to use *one* smart card and backup the keys on paper (or any other offline storage, like a usb thumb drive lying in some shoe box).
