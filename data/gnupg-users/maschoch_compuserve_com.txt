@_subject: WinPT problem - secret keys 
Hello list
 I started with GnuPG 1.0.6 and WinPT - nice work. I am not sure if I
 can ask a question here about WinPT 0.5.13
 I imported all me public keys from PGP - no problem!
 But then I wanted to import my secret keys from the old PGP secret
 file - this "worked" (the little window said) - but in the list of
 WinPT they are not displayed. And if I want to sign a message they
 are not displayed in the window to choose a key.
 If I go directly to GPG with --list-secret-keys they are displayed.
 Where is the problem?

@_subject: Question GnuPG screen output 
Hallo gnupg-users,
  A short and silly question:
  Is it possible to setup GnuPG which character code it is using
  for the output on the screen.
  It seems that "--charset code" doesn't have an influence...

Hello list,
  As far as I can see on  there is no compiled version
  gnupg 1.0.7 for Windows 98 or 2000. Why this?
  Is there an other link to such a version?

You are right - I was quite astonished to get this "answer" to my
question about a compiled version for Windows: "You are using the
wrong OS".
I am running here (under Windows) a lot of non-MS-software (free- and
shareware) and hope that such excellent software will have a good
future. But to blame others because they are using Windows sounds a
little bit "esoteric"... I really hope that free- and shareware and
"open source" will have a good future also with Windows...

Hmm - but the "download page" of    Precompiled binaries for MS-Windows are not yet available for this
   versions, but the old 1.0.6 version is still available

Thanks for your great and excellent work! With the binary under

searches the plugin idea.dll under "hardcoded" directory...
I have in the options file the line:
   load-extension idea
But gpg --versions says:

  As said some days ago - I wanted to include the idea.dll as

  But I get an error message (ec=487) with gpg --version
  Pubkey: RSA, RSA-E, RSA-S, ELG-E, DSA, ELG

  Do I have a wrong idea.dll version? It's marked here as
  idea.dll   13.09.2002  10:02   7680
  But I have downloaded it from:
  ftp://ftp.gnupg.dk/pub/contrib-dk/ideadll.zip
  Thanks for help.

I found one thing which could be interesting to find the problem:
The idea.dll which I have downloaded from the ftp above works
with Win98SE - but not with Win2k SP2.

Did you have the _whole_ path in the config file, like:

Hallo list,
  Sometimes I got a signed message - but the signature is shown
  as attachment - and in this way my EMail client isn't able to
  check the signature...
  It this standard or is my client not smart enough?

To send on every message in a mailinglist an out of office
message is quite odd - I think...

Hmm if I understand alright - that's for Linux - but for Windows

Oh boy - when he is _absent_ until 16/10/2002 - he is probably also
"out of office"... - and forgot to turn off this mailing list...
