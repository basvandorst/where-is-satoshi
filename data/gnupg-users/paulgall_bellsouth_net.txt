@_subject: Importing a signature in Netscape? 
Sorry if this question has been asked before, but I'm new to this list. I wondered if there's a way to import a digital signature made with GnuPG into Netscape Messenger.
Although I prefer to use a different mailer, I know others who use Messenger, and it seems a waste to ask a user to retrieve a signature from VeriSign when a perfectly good one exists through GPG.
Any ideas?
Thank you!

I may not have the *best* answer, but here goes:
Currently, I use Exmh, which will let the user check the keyserver for an unknown signature (nice feature!).
I have seen signatures which incorporate the "Public key at...," showing a URL to a keyserver.

I asked this question once before, and it went unanswered. I'm hoping it was an oversight :-).
I'm wondering if anyone has found a way to use GnuPG when using Netscape Messenger. Any ideas?
