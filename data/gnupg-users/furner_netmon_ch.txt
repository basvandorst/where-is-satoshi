@_subject: Importing SMIME and PGP7 into GPG 
I've just looked at the FAQ and documentation for GPG but can't find how to import a public key from a S/MIME certificate that was attached to a mail I received (smime.p7s) or from a PGP signed email. I saved this signature as a text file, and extracted the smime certificate but the format was not recognised. (I use Sylpheed as a mailer but was working from the GPG command line in Debian Linux.
Does GPG support either of these formats?
Thanks for your help
