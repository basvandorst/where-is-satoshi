Following the instructions for creating a subkey seem straightforward., but I run into a problem after moving secring.auto and the "public keyring" to a test directory.  First, I'm unsure which file(s) is the "public keyring."
At the end, the instructions say to use the "passwd" command to remove the passphrase.  Did I not copy the right file?

I tried it again.  The problem is the response to "passwd" doesn't appear to be a prompt.  It's only a complaint, and the "passwd" command doesn't seem to take an argument.
