@_subject: GnuPG crashes when attempting to create a key. 
Hash: SHA1
Hi ,
I just tried creating a DSA key and during the key creation GnuPG
crashed. This is reproducible.
I'm running Win2k SP2.

Hey Marck,
While perusing my mail at 2:43 PM (18/7/01), I saw your message sent on

I wish this would be fixed as well.
I have been thinking of making a suggestion and think now would be a good
time. I've noticed that once you choose to import a key there's no way of
inspecting the key prior to importing such as the UID's and exportable
signatures associated. Also, there's no way of verifying a clearsigned
message without importing the public key of the sender. There are many
times I wish to verify a message from someone whom I don't frequently
receive messages. It may be the only message that I receive from the
particular sender. To verify the signature I have to first import the key
and then verify the signature. This is recipe for a very cluttered local
public keyring. What makes matters worse is the problem/bug with GnuPG
connecting to keyservers when running in win2k.

Hi Lionel,
This doesn't work. The error persists.

Hi Janusz,
I didn't say anything about not having the public key. What I'm proposing
can be done using PGP. The process would seem to be, from my uninformed
POV, that the key is downloaded, though not actually imported to the local
keyring. You are able to inspect the signatures associated with the key
and these are cross-referenced with keys that may already be on your local
keyring. You can then check the signature without actually adding the key
to your keyring.
So, one should collect as many keys as possible so that trusts can be
calculated? I'm assuming here that trusts are calculated by examining the
signatures associated with the keys. If the person who signed the key's
public key isn't on your keyring then the signature would be just listed as
an unknown signature. So it would be wise to collect public keys for this
purpose. Am I reading you right here or am I totally off the mark and
exhibiting more incredible stupidity? :-)

Hi Lee,
I assume that you're using a PGP version earlier than v7.xx.
It would appear that you have GnuPG configured to use v4 signatures
which the earlier PGP versions don't support.
In the GnuPG 'options' file, be sure that you have the line:
        force-v3-sigs
This will force GnuPG to use v3 signatures which PGP should have no
problems verifying.

Hi Fabian,
C:\GNUPG>>gpg --send-keys I take it that you're using Win2k?
This is a known problem that GOK's when will be fixed since this is a
Windows and not UNIX/Linux issue.
