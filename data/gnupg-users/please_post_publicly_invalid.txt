I wonder if there is a utility that, when fed a gpg-encrypted-message,
will tell me which key is needed, which compression/cipher/hash was used.

Thanks for the reply.

I see. Looks like this basic "handling info" is also encrypted with the
unsymmetric key. In fact it needs gpg -vvv to elicit this information:
gpg: TWOFISH encrypted data
:compressed packet: algo=3
Reason for asking was because I played around a bit with the
compression/cipher preferences in my public key and wanted to see if it
actually uses say TWOFISH if I put it to the top of the queue of
acceptable ciphers. It does.
Thanks, regards

Well, uhm, if it's really important to you:
The concept of hashes/fingerprints/etc. is that it is (next to) impossible
to find an entity-to-be-hashed (here a key) if you specify the hash. In
fact a hash function that allows you to do this would be cryptographically
frowned upon.
However, there is nothing that stops you from generation a gazillon of
keys, until you - by chance - get one with a hash you like. This brute force approach is what is behind bitcoin mining or hashcashing
email messages - the latter, sadly, an idea ignored by the general public.
