@_subject: Encryption failed in one command but succeeded in another... 
Hi there,
I am trying to encrypt and I am using two different calls. One is successful
and the other one fails. I need to perform the encryption via c# code and
therefore I need the one that fails to work:
This attempt to encrypt failed:
C:\Program Files\GNU\GnuPG>gpg --homedir "C:\Program Files\GNU\GnuPG" --yes
--batch --encrypt --armo
r --recipient MyUserId --no-verbose
gpg: tailgate: skipped: public key not found
gpg: [stdin]: encryption failed: public key not found
HOWEVER The following call succeeded:
C:\Program Files\GNU\GnuPG>gpg -e -r MyUserId Enc\ToEnc.txt
In addition I can see the key of MyUserId when I list the keys (using
--list-keys) and I did sign the key so I am not really sure why the first
attempt fails..
Thanks :)
