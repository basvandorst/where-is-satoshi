@_subject: Parsing SKS key dumps 
Hey folks :)
For the fun of it, I tried to parse a few weekly dumps (i.e. from here:
 and very often,
not even GnuPG can successfully parse the packets, i.e. gpg
--list-packets fails. Usually with "gpg: mpi too large for this
implementation (56104 bits)" but there is a myriad of errors, i.e.
gpg: subpacket of type 16 too short
gpg: mpi larger than indicated length (517 bytes)
gpg: mpi larger than indicated length (0 bytes)
gpg: signature packet: unhashed data too long
gpg: signature packet: hashed data too long
gpg: mpi larger than indicated length (514 bytes)
gpg: packet(14) too short
I usually can parse 30 to 40 out of the 206 or 207 dumps (probably
containing 15k keys each).
I wonder why that is.
Is that just malicious data which landed in the pool?
Or is SKS better on parsing OpenPGP packets than GnuPG?
Because one offending key seems to be 0x5df5c3733a6ced98 which,
according to
is successfully parsed by SKS. Same thing for 0xb51b4b095356aac8 or
These appear to be keys that carry signature from 0x9710B89BCA57AD7C,
the "PGP Global Directory Verification Key".

Heya :)
FWIW: If you start your applications with "LC_ALL=C" in the environment variables, you should get genuine messages, i.e. type "export LC_ALL=C" before then typing "kgpg".
Seems as if gpg can't find ~/.gnupg/options...

@_subject: Sign key and export for each UID 
I'm digging up this thread because it asked the same question I have,
but it hasn't really been answered:
What are the best practises for signing another person's key (i.e. all the UIDs on a key)?
And how do you follow those using gnupg?  And is there a batch mode to automate that process?

@_subject: Non-interactively signing UIDs on a key 
While investigating the state of the art of Python bindings
I came across the problem of signing other people's keys.
For example, in is a complaint about the behaviour of --sign-key:
    By default, --sign-key drops you into an interactive prompt asking     Really sign all user IDs? (y/N) and afterwards, regardless of your     answer, drops you off in the gpg> interactive prompt (where you have     to type save and quit and so forth). By default (because it's meant     to be automateable) python-gnupg uses --no-tty to disable all     interactivity, and trying to use --sign-key with --no-tty will     produce an error message saying gpg: Sorry, no terminal at all     requested - can't get input. Further, gpg won't listen to you if you     try to use anything like --no-tty --passphrase-fd 0 --sign-key or     any of the other passphrase input options. Not to deter anyone,     because I'll take all the help I can get, but this is not going to     be a fun set of patches, I'm afraid. :/
In the author of that library states:
    Signing a key is not supported, as it involves back-and-forth     interacting with the gpg executable (signing a key is part of the     options for editing a key). If there were a way of doing it using a     one-off command (e.g. providing the id of the public key to sign,     the trust level, and the private key to sign with) then this could     be implemented.
With pygpgme, it seems at least possible to sign a key, but it doesn't look very convenient:
My question is: Is there indeed no (simple) way to sign a UID on a
key non-interactively with GnuPG?
If there is a way, how could it be used by the libraries mentioned above?

hm.  I understood that best practises include signing each UID
separately rather than signing all UIDs on the key.  I don't see your
script signing every UID separately.
I was also hoping for less shell script and more of something I could
dictate to my mom over the phone.
