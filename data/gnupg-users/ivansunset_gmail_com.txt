I'm using OpenPGP card to store my secret keys on it. Now I'm adding a
new UID to my key by running gpg2 --edit-key. What I've got is this
strange error:
gpg (GnuPG) 2.0.25; Copyright (C) 2013 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

gpg> adduid
Real name: GPG User
Email address: user at gnupg.org

    "GPG user "
Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? o
gpg: secret key parts are not available
gpg: signing failed: Unusable secret key
How to solve this?
Thank you,
Ivan Markin

Thank you for the reply, Werner.
Yes, card works perfectly. I've tried gpg2 --card-status. Nothing.
It forced me to find my backup key and add a UID with it (works as it
As you may notice, GPG tells that "Secret key is available." because
my card is present.
