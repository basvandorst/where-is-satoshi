Hi Marcus,
Thanks for your reply. The setting of -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 fixes this problem. I do use autoconf and also call 'gpgme-config' to find out which CFLAGS I need. Shouldn't this be returned by 'gpgme-config --cflags'?
One more question which I couldn't find any answer for so far - is there a way to get the keys a file is encrypted for? gpg shows this information right before it shows the decrypted data and also with '--list-only'. Maybe you can help me find an answer for this issue as well?
Thanks alot for your help!!
