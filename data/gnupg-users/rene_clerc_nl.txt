@_subject: accented characters in real name in generating key 
Hi everyone,
first of all: I'm a relatively newbie to GnuPG, but since I was unable
to find the answer to my question on the net. I apologize if it _is_
somwhere out there
second: I'm not subscribed to this list, so please carbon copy me ;)
My question:
as you can see by my .signature, my name contains an e-accent-aigu.
When I generate my key, with this character in it, everything's fine,
but when I publish my key to the keyserver, it ends up like:
RenÃ© Clerc
I used the both iso-8859-1 and iso-8859-2 for the --charset option,
but this doesn't help. Does anybody know how to handle this problem?
Is there another way of escaping this character in the gpg prompts?
Or should I change some TERM setting or so? (mine is 'screen' right
Or should I just change my name? (sigh...)
All the help is appreciated!

My problem is not the displaying on my own box (that's ok), but the
displaying in the directory of the keyserver. Let's put it in another
way: I'm "afraid" people won't find my key, because of the
RenÃ© Clerc
thingie. Or should I assume that all other persons software download
my key automatically according to my fingerprint? I don't if the
keyservers are used "manually" as well.
To be short, I can assume that my name is correctly encoded in my key,
but the problems lies only with the keyservers?

Yeah, mutt can.  See the option $pgp_create_traditional.  And upgrade
your mutt.
