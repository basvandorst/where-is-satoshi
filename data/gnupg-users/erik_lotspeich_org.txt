@_subject: 2 local user-ids, 2 distinct key pairs but only 1 user-id can 
Hash: SHA1
I have two key pairs: one for my personal e-mail and one for work, so I
am in a similar situation as you are.
I switch between the two with the "--default-key" option to GPG and give
it my key ID as an argument (you can set this in your gpg.conf too).
Even after looking at the man page, I'm not entirely clear what "name"
the "--local-user" option is after (e.g. is it a name of a local user on
the system, or is it the uid name on the key).

@_subject: Confused about signing inline vs siging with attached signature. 
Hash: SHA1
Hi Steven,
I use the OpenPGP method (inline signatures) instead of PGP/MIME
(detached signatures) for exactly this reason.  It seems to be a common
problem that Outlook Express has trouble processing PGP/MIME e-mails.
I only use PGP/MIME when I need to send the message encrypted and I need
to send encrypted file attachments that I haven't previously encrypted
independently of e-mail.
Basically, nobody should be using Outlook Express -- it is a horrible
e-mail program with dozens of design flaws.
I would recommend to your friend that he consider Office Outlook.
Office Outlook shares nothing with Outlook Express (except for the
"Outlook" name) and is tremendous improvement.  Maybe your friend would
consider Thunderbird with Enigmail?

Hash: SHA1
Hi John:
I would just do this:
gpg --decrypt input.pgp > output.txt
Let gpg prompt for your passphrase.  That way, your passphrase is not
part of bash history.
If that doesn't work, let us know what error messages are you getting
from GnuPG.

Hi John,
What you are talking about sounds like a non-standard PGP feature.  I
would definitely not recommend using this type of "mis-feature" as it
breaks standards and limits compatibility.
I would suggest creating zip archives normally (in the standard way
using pkzip or its equivalent) and then encrypting them separately
(again, in the standard way).  This way, you can decrypt the archive
with GnuPG and then unzip the file with the 'unzip' command afterwards.
As it is now, you may want to use a hex editor like "bvi" (binary vi) or
 even dd (with an offset) to remove the "garbage" and "fix" the file so
you can use GnuPG to decrypt it normally.

@_subject: Question About Accumulated Bad Signatures in Public Key 
Hash: SHA1
The public key that I use for work has accumulated various "bad
signatures".  To be honest, I don't know how these signatures got there.
 Anyway, I can use GPG to "clean" the public key and remove them.
Public key servers do not seem to scrub or clean public keys.  Is it a
reasonable thing to delete the public key and re-add it?  This doesn't
seem to be something that most public keyservers allow or recommend.  Or
is it normal for bad signatures to accumulate over the years and it is
to be expected.
Note that in my case the bad signatures are redundant since there are
good, valid, signatures in addition to the valid bad ones by those
I hope that I've explained this clearly.  I've searched on the Internet
and I haven't seen a definitive answer.

@_subject: How do I use gpg to decrypt encrypted files???? 
Hash: SHA1
You'll likely want to redirect the decrypted output to a file.  I'm no
expert on the DOS/Windows command-line, so I don't know if this would
work there.  On Linux/Unix, I'd do this:
gpg -d  > Note the ">" redirection operator.

@_subject: GPG4Win Advice 
Hi Ian,
Are you using a batch file script to automate the process? Can't the
script delete the files after running the gpg command?
