I'm pretty new to the Linux-World, but as far i know i have NOT included

That is correct, that a signature is valid if there is added a timestamp

There is a contract to be signd by mor than 2 persons or parties. So i
make a document of it - for example a pdf file (which is recommended) -

send it to another person for signing ... and so on.
As long the document is not edited all signatures stay intact and valid.
This is necessary, as otherwise there never could be signed a contract
between 2 parties.

@_subject: GPG on Android 
Hello Masha,
as you are new to this whole topic, I guess the easiest way to use
encrypted mail (either GPG and/or S/MIME) on a Android device would be
the app "MailDroid".
It comes in a free version[1] (with advertisings) and in a "pro"
version[2] (without advertisings) and supports both GPG and S/MIME.
MailDroid also supports POP and IMAP, and works fine with Googlemail.
You need to install the additional Flipdog CryptoPlugin[3] on your
device, where you import and manage the keys.
You have to create the keys for example on a desktop computer and import
it to your android device and into the CryptoPlugin.
I use MailDroid since several years without any problems, and can fully
recommend it for beginners.
There is also a app named "K-9 Mail"[4], which supports GPG (but not
S/MIME). As far I know you also need several additional software for K-9
In my eyes its not really recommendable for beginners. I tried it years
ago and found it a bit complicated to use for myself. But thats a
personal opinion.
The best would be to try both, MailDroid and K-9 Mail and then make your
personal choice.
If you need help with MailDroid you can contact me. For K-9 Mail I am
sure that here are also some people who can help you with it.
best regards

Yes, MailDroid does support several different mail accounts.
You can mix the crypto functions with each account, means you can use
GPG for account A and C, S/MIME for B and combine GPG and S/MIME for D.
I personally recommend the paid version of MailDroid, named "MailDroid
pro" as it has a bit more functions than the free app.
The costs are around 8-10 EUR.
Be aware that you need also the Flipdog CryptoPlugin, in which you
manage keys and certs. It has its own certificate store and acess the
device store as well.
Yes this problem is well known

Hello All,
in this topic I forgot to mention another android-mail-app.
Thanks to Chris for the hint!
This app is from an austria developer (rundquadarat OG) and called
"R2Mail 2" [1]. It has fully GPG and X.509 (aka S/MIME) support.
This app comes in a test version with limited functions and has a
licence key [2] to buy for full functions. With a price around 5 EUR it
is not that expensive.
The developer was in a parental leave - which i knewed - and should be
back to office now.

Hi Werner
I know its not the perfect setup, but it is practicable for me, and as i
usually just work with subkeys i feel on a more safe side with this.
Tokens are always a good idea, and if anyone can use them its
recommended to do it that way.
There are good reasons why GPG supports Tokens/Cards by default ;)

If I want an "independent" ID verification on my GPG key, I can also use

This question is very easy to answer.
S/MIME has some advantages over (Open)PGP.
One of them - the most important for the usual S/MIME users - is, that
S/MIME allows the uniquely identification of a communication partner,
which is only limitedly possible with PGP.
In addition, educational institutions, such as universities, schools,
research networks etc., have their own internal CA, which keeps the
costs very manageable.

Hi Stefan,
well... what is a trusted and a untrusted CA?
Is a CA really trusted just about the fact it is "build in" in a browser
or mail client?
Is a not included CA really untrusted?
I think it is more a personal decision than anything else.
The past few years showed us very good examples why "trusted" CA are not
much better that so called untrusted ones.
And for personally .. i think i can for example trust the CA CAcert much
more than a CA which is located in China or Turkey.
So isf someone is iporting a root certificate of any CA he shows that he
is trusting this CA - not more not less

Thats not the approach PGP pursues.
PGP was, is and should continue to be decentralized in the future. It
was never really intended to validate identities in a wide circle, but
to secure communication, and - im parts - to ensure the integrity of
The so-called WOT has proven to me in the field of PGP and does not

Sadly i know many CA's who don't give the user any choice about this.
They say as a 'user friendly service' they generate also the key for the
user and send him a .p12-file.

Hello to all,
well it's a good thing, that openPGP shall be included to TB directly.
But ... as the Mozilla wiki [1] states in the FAQ-Section the following:
Q: Will OpenPGP cards be supported for private key storage ?
A: Probably not, because we don't use the GnuPG software that's usually
   required to access OpenPGP smartcards.
This will not be usefull for me or my company, as we only use PGP Keys
stored on smartcards.
So I guess we will have to take TB down and find other solutions.

Hello Patrick,
I'm sorry but I have to contradict you in that topic.
I found out that more 'standard users' than I thought are using
Smartcards or Tokens like Nitrokey or Yubikey (or anything similiar).
It is requested in security/gpg workshops more and more, and in the last
3 or 4 workshops I've held, each of the 15 participiants already had a
Smartcard or Token and wanted to know how to use them.
So I think this is not just a topic for 'professional or power users'
but also for so called standard users.
