@_subject: RSA - IDEA - Patents 
Two questions:
1. Need to find out if the patent on RSA has expired, meaning the algorithm
can be used generally without a license in the USA?
2. IDEA patent has not expired in the USA until 2007?

@_subject: Compatibility with PGP 6.x 
I've seen the Compatibility issues with other version of PGP vs. GNUPG.
However, has there been any testing don with PGP 6.x?
I'll be doing some common operations testing ..

This crash might be related to adding keys to your key ring with keys that
have long file
names. I have experienced this with PGP just recently. GnuPG might have the
same "bug."
Names like : "Time Warner Distribution Cooperative Inc (TTTS).pfx"
Shortening the name to TWDC.pfx fixes the problem.

Please give me some more details.  I can't reproduce this.
BTW, the same error should occur under GNU too.

The ability to import keys to the key ring, key admin, key creation seems to
restricted to the c:\gnupg directory. If I move the keyring to another
directory and keep C:\gnupg in my path, will it add to keyring?
I'll run some tests. Any information on this would be appreciated.
