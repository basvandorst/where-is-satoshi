Why is it that when I try create a "sig" file gpg tells me that there
is no default secret key secret key not available?
The very first line of the conf file reads: default-key 0x7AE47C2F279E785B
Every related to gpg is either in the register or in the path..

Sorry folks I just realized that this list doesn't have a proper reply
to header, so when I click on reply it's sent to the _originator_ of
the message.
If theres a way to change that in Thunderbird 1.0 please let me know.

Actually from everything I can see using key managers 7AE47C2F279E785B
is supposed to be the default, thats the way everything else is set,
where and what the 5E11D9137F4D989D is I have no idea, everything else
is correct.
Or is GPG showing a different format of the same key then GPGshell and

Well since my other question didn't get answered maybe someone can
answer why gpg is giving me this error?
Assertion failed: Keyblock->pkt->pkttype == PKT_PUBLIC_KEY, file
keyring.c, line 1388
abnormal program termination
Thats the exact msg I receve when I try to update the trust.db

Some things do other things don't, Depends on what I want to do, So if
a secret key got switched to public is there anything I can do to fix it??

Hash: SHA1
Recently I tried signing a file using winpt-0.9.90rc1 and right after
words I get a "box" popping up saying what? with 2 5-6 digit numbers
separated by a slash and what appears to be a progress bar below that,
and winpt just sits there like it wants an input or something. I have
waited for about 10 mins but the program just sits there and finally I
have to "kill" the process.

No. From what I gather from the GPG manual thats basically for PGP2
compatibility, or am I misreading it?

I am trying to get gnupg to "live" on a USB key and would like to know
the prober usage of the homedir command, can it be put in the cfg
file, and if so does it need to be "escaped"  IE "--homedir x/yz" or what.

How does a person request a key from a ldap server? and or tell Gnupg
to use the gpgkeys_ldap.exe program? Tried to request a key via Winpt
using a ldap server and Gnupg told me off say it couldn't find
gpgkeys_ldap.exe. even though it's in the Gnu/Gpg "home" dir and the
path is set.
Running win me, and Gnupg 1.4.????

Hash: SHA256
Can someone please explain why I am getting a yellow bar on  a LOT of
signed msgs saying that the key type is unknown??
the exact msg is "Part of the message signed with unknown key; the key
type is not supported by your version of GnuPG"
I am running GnuPG 2.0.30 (Gpg4Win 2.3.3) on a win 7 box.
