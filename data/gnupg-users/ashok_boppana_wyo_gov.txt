@_subject: GnuPG 2.0.21 install - AIX 
Hello Team,
     My name is Ashok Boppana and I'm trying to install GnuPG 2.0.21
software on my AIX P520 machine which is running on AIX 7.1 operating
system. I'm following the install steps as per the document but getting an
error which I don't understand. Could you pl take a look at the install
steps I followed from the attached document and help me with the install?
This is my first time using this software and I'm not sure if there are any
other packages I need to install before following this process, pl let me
know, Also, pl let me know if this software is compatible with AIX or not
and any alternative if not compatible. Thank you so much for your time.
Have a great day!!
