@_subject: Error in encryption 
============================== START ==============================
Wanted some pointers on an error that we see once in a while.
We use GnuPG version 1.4.7.
Once in a while when we get concurrent encryption requests for the same public key, it fails. The we see is  - "gpg: error in creating temporary file $GNUPGHOME\. : File Exist
Is there some sort of locking that happens during the encryption process? If yes is there a way to overcome this, other than to retry after a while Thanks and Regards,
