Uh, some more info please?  I still don't quite understand the nature of
the problem.  Both keyids pull up (different) keys belonging to one
jeremy  And one of them looks very much like the other with its
primary key packet replaced.  But they are both there, at least on
sks.dnsalias.net.  So I don't quite understand in what way SKS is supposed
to have malfunctioned.

Hmmm.  I am confused.  When I query 0x3A546EC2, I get the right key. Again, this is from sks.dnsalias.net.  Here's the URL I tried:
Any examples of keyserver weirdness would be more useful if they were
accompanied by the actual URLs that elicited the odd behavior.

Ah, that explains why I couldn't find it.  Does this problem come up with
PKS, or is it SKS specific?  Is one possibility here that the lead packet
is malformed, and as a result some difference in implementation of rfc2440
results in differently evaluated keyids?  i.e., maybe SKS things that this
key really does have keyid 3A546EC2, and GPG thinks it has a different
one, basically because the key packet is malformed.
Anyway, I'm away from my home computer so I can't really look into this
right this second, so if this doesn't resolve itself, I'll track it down
in a few days.
