@_subject: Problem with gpg instalation 
I need very urgent help relate to gnupg installation.
First, I've installed gnupg 0.07 version on my Sun server (OS ver 5.6)
and after that I've installed GnuPG.pm module.
You mustn't beleive me, but these two stuffs work quite OK for one week
and after that I've started to receive messages like:
I've repeated the new and clean installation of gnupg (which passed OK)
and tried the same with GnuPG.pm (but unsuccesfully).
When I invoke make (relate to GnuPG.pm module instalation), I've recived
the following:
Manifying blib/man3/GnuPG.3
Manifying blib/man1/gpgmailtunl.1
Manifying blib/man3/GnuPG::Tie.3
cp gpgmailtunl blib/script/gpgmailtunl
As well as when I ran make test, I receivied the following:
PERL_DL_NONLAZY=1 /opt1/stadium/STADIUM/perl5/bin/perl -Iblib/arch
-Iblib/lib -I//opt1/stadium/STADIUM/perl5/lib/5.005/sun4-s

I first contacted fellows form GnuPG and Francis Lacoste reply the
GnuPG.pm uses the shared memory coprocess interface of gnupg.
When gnupg was compiled was the use of SysV shared memory enabled ? gpg commands invoked by command line (gpg --export, gpg --import, etc.)
work absolutely fine.
You can CC me on my e-mail address.

Sorry, I've made a mistake in typing:
I've installed gnupg ver. 1.0.2 and tried to reinstall ver. 0.07 of
GnuPG.pm module
So, I have the most recent versions ;-)
What now?
[Monday, 11/09/2000] Sasa Danicic:
Version 0.07 is really old. Download and install the most recent version
(1.0.2) from  and see if it makes any difference.
Good luck.

@_subject: Overwrite the existing key 
I would like to know, because I couldn't find in documentation something
presume that user AAA has got BBB's public key in his keyring. In case
that BBB decide to change its public key from some reason, what's
happend when AAA want to import BBB's new/changed public key?
Does existed BBB's key will be overwritten in AAA's keyring or not?
