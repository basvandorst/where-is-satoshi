@_subject: lock while verifying? 
I've installed RedHat 6.2 at home, which includes gpg 1.0.1.  When I
try verifying a signature, it prints out the signature message, and
then sits spewing out:
    gpg: waiting for lock (hold by 1091 - probably dead) ...
    gpg: waiting for lock (hold by 1091 - probably dead) ...
and doesn't exit.
What causes this, and how do I go about preventing it?
