@_subject: encrypting data to put into a database 
Hiya there all,
I am new to the list and I was hoping that someone might be able to help me Can anyone point me in the right direction for putting encrypted credit card information into a database.
I think that I have the encryption script right, but I think that the GnuPG public key has to be setup for the user that the webserver is running under (uid: nobody; gid: nobody), I have tried to setup a public for the nobody user as root and as nobody, but it doesnt seem to have worked...
I would imagine that there is a simple method of doing it that I have completely overlooked. so any suggestions are quite welcome.
