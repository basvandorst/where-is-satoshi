@_subject: syntax for encrypting only the string passed in an argument 
I want to be able to call a shell from within a development environment
and pass a string of data to it to be de/en/crypted.  The idea would look
read from file "data.txt" line z and put it into variableY
variablex = call shell(gpg -e -r Joe variableY)
print variablex
rem:  variableY is the plaintext, variablex is the returned cyphertext
