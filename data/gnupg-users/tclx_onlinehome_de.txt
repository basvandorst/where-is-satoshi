As long as it is a simple number or small text you want to sign or
check there are some USB-smart-card-readers with their own small
number keyboard and LCD for this purpose. Being hardcoded on a prom
they should be pretty secure. AFAIK they aren't so expensive
any more, 100 EUR or something like that. But they won't handle an
email of course.
