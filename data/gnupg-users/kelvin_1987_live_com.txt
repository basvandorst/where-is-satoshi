@_subject: Cannot Verify Signature 
Hi Users,
I've received the recent GnuPG 2.2.17 release along with the attached
_*Issue:*_**Signature cannot be verified despite having downloaded the
public key that created the signature
(0x80615870F5BAD690333686D0F2AD85AC1E42B367) - see screenshot attached.
Would anyone have an idea as to why this is the case (other than the
possibility that the signed message could've been tampered with)?
Thank you!
