Hash: SHA512
That's a known bug in 2.1.10
Workaround till 2.1.11: use the short key-Id.

The next major version of Enigmail will show long keyIds everywhere.

Hi Stefan,
It's working as expected. To get a green bar in Enigmails header
display, the key signing the message has to be at least fully valid. A
key gets valid if you either:
- sign it (whether local or exportable is not relevant)
- it is signed by
  - at least one key you have signed and you have put "full" ownertrust
    on these
  - at least three other keys you have signed and you have put
    "marginal" ownertrust on these
This is the behaviour of the "classic" or "PGP" trust model which is
the default in GnuPG. Enigmail only displays the result.
You may read more about this here:
There's a lot more information about the web of trust out in the web.
Disclaimer: Configuring GnuPG to use the TOFU trust model may change
this behaviour.
BTW: Could you please stop forwarding your replies to the list? Now
there are 6 threads titled "Question for app developers, like Enigmail
etc. - Identicons" on the list. Just click on "Reply to list" when

Well, ultimate ownertrust is the wrong way. This setting is reserved
for your own keys. No wonder you get a green header bar.
What are you trying to achieve? I'm getting tons of "UNTRUSTED Good
signature" when reading my mailing lists, e.g. from Peter Lebbing and
a lot of others. That's the way it is, I have to accept this, my
web-of-trust is not so good. I've got a couple of good signatures, though.
One way to improve this situation is to get out, meet people, view
their Ids and receive their fingerprints, verify them and if all is
good, sign their keys.
The other would be to enable TOFU. Can't tell anything about this, I
still have to test.
Best regards

I'd not sign this statement. A lot of users caring for privacy and
safety won't go for Windows. Thunderbird is not the most popular mail
client on non-windows computers, there quite some other mail clients.
As Robert said: If an attacker gains control over your computer,
you're busted, game over.
This would also be the case if the attacker gained access to your
What you can do: Learn, learn by playing, learn by trying to
understand what others write and by asking questions and become a
reasonable critical user. That's the hard way, but you learn best.
Second possibility would be to have a good experienced friend which
guides you along the way. Third way would be to engage an expert which
maintains your computer.
