@_subject: help with signing prob 
Hi all,
I've compiled gpg and created a primary secret key. Then imported a couple of my other public keys, signed them with the new secret key and make sure the trust level was on level 4...and I still get this message when trying to Could not find a valid trust path to the key.  Let's see whether we
can assign some missing owner trust values.
No certificates with undefined trust found.

             Fingerprint: F94D 9036 AAFA D2E2 B20F  2FDF CC0A 5EA8 E01A It is NOT certain that the key belongs to its owner.
If you *really* know what you are doing, you may answer
the next question with yes
Use this key anyway? Does anyone have any ideas on how to get around this? I've tried --always-
trust and it doesn't seem to have any effect.
Any help appreciated.
