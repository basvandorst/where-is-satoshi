@_subject: Encrypting a file to multiple recipients 
============================== START ==============================
I'm trying to encrypt a file using a list of recipients.
For instance, I have a file called test.txt and I want to encrypt this file to send to multiple recipients (recipient_01 and recipient_02).
I'm using the following command line (I have tested and it works):
gpg --yes -r "recipient_01" -r "recipient_02" -e test.txt -o test_encrypted.txt.gpg.
This command works fine. However, I'd like to know if I really have to repeat the "-r" before each recipient or if there is a way of executing this command typing something like gpg --yes -r--list-recipients "recipient_01" "recipient_02" -e test.txt
