@_subject: using gnupg with kmail... 
i try to use gnupg0.9.7 with kmail (from kde1.1.1) on a debian2.1-system.
i have a pgp2.6.3ia user-id which is "holgi " and a
gnupg-id which is "Holger ".
if i put the pgp2.6.3-id in preferences/pgp/identy i can attach my public key.
this does not work with the gnupg-id !?
any ideas, help ? how do i tell kmail, which pgp/gpg-version to use ?
thanx in advance,

well, thank you for that hint, but that isn´t the problem. the problem is more
kmail-related: how do i tell kmail to use gpg instead pgp ? do i have to use a wrapper like geheimsnis or pgpgpg ? or do i have to make
links from /usr/bin/pgp to /usr/bin/gpg ?
i know that there are kde-mailing-lists, but i also think that someone here
must be using kmail with gpg... if that isn´t true, i´ll ask the

@_subject: Still problems with kmail 1.0.x and gpg 
1st of all, to whom it may concern ;-)
thank you VERY much for your fine work with both kde1 and kde2, last not least
gnupg !
but now for the bad news... i successfully applied and compiled your patch for
gpg-support with kmail 1.0.x. encrypting works well. encrypting and signing
works well. only signing a message doesn't work.
kmail-Bug marked as done (GPG: Sending a mail with a bad password do not
encrypt) is not included in the patch, right ? (and my knowledge to c is to
limited for me to merge it...)
but, in my opinion, "worst of all" is the fact that kmail doesn't decrypt
encrypted mails nor does it check signed ones :-( is this hard to implement /
merge from 1.1x ? can anyone confirm this ?
i am using debian-slink, gnu-pg1.0.1, kde1.1.2-19990906.
or do all _stable_ kmail-users have to wait for kde2 to get intregated
cryptography in kde/kmail ?
p.s.: 	you can get the kmail-gpg-patch at
p.p.s.:	i am not aware if i am allowed to post to kde-kmail

si - but i am not able to do this :-(
so that's why i started this thread here. maybe someone who reads this has the
ability to do it and actually has the resources to do it ;-)
really, that's great. i thought it was not...
since it's only one application this isn't to bad. kmail-files (.index) didn't
change ?
yes, but you can't communicate  with someone who only has new
pgp5/gpg-style keys... :-(
