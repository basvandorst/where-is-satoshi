@_subject: unable to encrypt to one specific user 
Content-Disposition: inline
I'm unable to encrypt my messages when sending email to one specific
user (I can encrypt to others). My email client is mutt. I've cross
posted, as I'm not sure is this is a gpg or mutt issue.  I've looked in
my .gpgrc file for mutt, and noticed this command for listing available
set pgp_list_pubring_command="gpg --no-verbose --batch --with-colons
--list-keys %r"
Running "gpg --with-colons --list-keys" at the command line, I've
noticed the key that is giving me problems is different:
pub:i:1024:17:5017641E9656AF8D:2001-07-30::::Rev Simon Rumble
for a key that works.
The difference is in the second field - a 'q' for keys that work,
nothing or 'i' for the key that doesn't.
Any ideas? I've searched the doco for info on the --list-keys option -
found nothing.

Thanks David,
Unfortunately I've received the key via email directly from the owner,
so that probably isn't the error. I'll email him to check if it's been
self-signed; I presume it has as the owner is a Linux 'old-fart' ;-)
Anyway, I'm stumped, and am going to put it back in the too hard bin
for the moment.

@_subject: best way to stucture a new personal key? 
I'm about to create a new personal key (in my realname) - just wondering
about the best way to do this... My question is not about how to do it,
but what to do.
I was thinking of creating a key under gpg with keylength 2048, no expiry, then
subkeys with 2 years (say) expiry for my different email addresses. Is
this the best way?
Also, which public key do I get signed at keysigning parties - my main
one, or a subkey?
