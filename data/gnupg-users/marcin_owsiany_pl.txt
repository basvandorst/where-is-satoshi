@_subject: Expiry dates - which is right? 
I want to change the expiration date of my keypair, since it will expire in a
few months. I changed it using the 'exprire' command, and the '--edit-key'
command shows only updated expiry dates:
porridge LANG=C gpg --edit-key porridge
Secret key is available.

There are some three parts, of which first and last look identical, but the
middle one only has 2 uids, and the old expiry date. Why?
What are the three parts?
Should I care about what --list-keys shows, if --edit-key seems OK?
