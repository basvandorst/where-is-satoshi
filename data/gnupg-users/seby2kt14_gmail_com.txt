@_subject: Cannot control GnuPG from shell (IPC parameter error) 
I have a script that interacts with GnuPG in an automated / unattended
way, but it cannot control the keyring. I keep getting this:
gpg: key generation failed: IPC parameter error
I am running 2.3.0-beta82. I tried to search for this error and I
could only find clues that lead to gpg-agent, but # gpg-agent --help
doesn't allow me to disable it. What is the good approach here?
Thanks in advance.

Please update your installation.
IIUC, you are talking about (old version of) gpg4win, which is based on
GnuPG 2.0.x, and you are trying to use new feature(s) of GnuPG 2.2, like
I am running on linux (Debian) and i am on git master (2.3.0-beta82) and it
WARNING: server 'gpg-agent' is older than us (2.1.8 < 2.3.0-beta82)
And then:
IPC parameter error.
When trying to pass a batch from shell.
I don't know if the warning causes the second fatal error but probably.

Fixed the problem by killing the PID of gpg-agent and also by
correcting a typo in my syntax that was having a permission problem. I
am now 100% confident that the version mismatch warning between
gpg-agent and gpg is just a warning, it was not the cause of the
problem, the typo in the syntax bares the fault.
Thank you.

@_subject: New smart card / token alternative 
We have been working on a project to build a direct interface for PGP/GPG
usage using U2F for web apps and browser extensions. This is similar to
existing smart cards and tokens but no software install is required.
We set out to solve this problem -"Man, I really wish I could read this PGP
message, or send this message, or open this file, or sign this file, but I
don't have my laptop with me"
With this solution you can keep the key offline, carry it with you and it
works even on a computer where you can't install software -
We are interested to hear feedback on this approach from the community.

Your product provides a false sense of security. Educating users that is is
somehow safe is a terrible mistake. Telling users it is safe to plug in any
computer and encrypt decrypt stuff is a terrible idea.
How was your budget distributed? What hardware and firmware do you use what
security audit have you done?

@_subject: question about determining the key length 
Hello Cathy,
Is there a way to determine the key length and the type of key (RSA or
other) used when generating  the keyring?  I have a RHEL 5 box using gpg
1.4.5 where I need to determine how a key ring was generated.    Even on an
Ubuntu box using gpg2, the ?list-secret-keys option does not print out that
Thank you.

@_subject: Encrypt to a key without importing it to keyring 
Is there any possibility i could encrypt some text to a public key but
without importing it to my keyring? Passing it to gnupg via command line or
something (i do know and accept that if i want to encrypt multiple messages
or files to the same key i will have to provide it every time) .

I need to pass it via batch or something... Like this:
$pgp_public_key = 'pgp public key text armored'
 gpg -e -r $pgp_public_key --always_trust
Basically use gnupg without a keyring or trustdb. And the pass the armored
pgp public key with each command and operation.
Thank you in advance.

Thanks a lot for the reply.
The use case is that a script encrypts stuff for different public
keys. I don't want to save those public keys to files, then import
them in the keyring, do the operation and then delete from the keyring
because this is a lot of operations plus using files might be
problematic on edge cases.
Am I correct that a way around changing the GNUPGHOME variable is
using the --no-default-keyring argument?
So no way for me to do an operation just by having the public key in
clipboard for example (no saving to file, no import, etc.)?

(No, that is not correct. --homedir is what overrides $GNUPGHOME)
Back to the subject, saving to at least a temporary keyring is my only
solution? Nothing else I can use in batch mode to serve the armored
key from clipboard somehow and do the operation?
If this is the only solution, what are the safety recommendations for
a use case where many many parallel requests will be sent to do
operations (possibly even using the same public key) so things don't
break? Does it help if I randomize --homedir and make it different
with every request / command?

A possible solution for many parallel requests (you need to verify its
viability) could be some kind of containerization (e.g. Docker or something
more low-level). If every request is handled by a new container then all
operations are nicely isolated and nothing can break.
Thanks for the answer. If i run the command every time in a different shell
or with a different user, will this help? I am not familiar with docker.
