You possibly mean you see the same user-id?
The primary key is a public key with a corresponding private key. Each
subkey is a public key with a corresponding private key. Each subkey
is bound to the primary key by a key binding signature
GnuPG usually encrypts to the newest available encryption-capable
subkey. Or to the primary key if it is encryption-capable and there
are no encryption-capable subkeys. If you wish to specify the primary
key or a specific subkey you can list as a recipient the (sub)key-id
followed by an exclamation mark.
Something like gpg -ear 0x1CAC08E8DEFAFDFE! -r  0xEAC88A2823F99DEC!

On Wednesday 3 January 2018 at 7:02:08 AM, in
It is already the case that an organisation does not need to depend on
third-party CAs to certify its staff's OpenPGP keys.
For example, my ISP [0] says "All staff keys are signed using the
company signing key. This is very much like a traditional company
seal. Only the director has access to this key and it is only used for
signing other keys. If/when a member of staff leaves a revocation is
issued of that signature and loaded on to keyservers."
Are you talking about something like a shared keyring? Or just
managing trust relationships by issuing key certifications and
Would the business unit achieve this by using their own certifying
key in addition to the enterprise-wide certifying key?
So each user would still generate their own key pair.
Isn't it up to the two business partners to decide whether or not to
trust each others' keys?
Whether or not the business partners choose
to consider the presence of the certification from the company's
RK/CKs when making their respective decisions, isn't it ultimately not
really any of the company's business?

PGP and GnuPG traditionally store private keys in a secret keyring and
public keys in a public keyring. Each user's secret keyring has just
their own secret keys. Each user's public keyring contains their own
public keys, plus other people's public keys for encrypting messages
or checking signatures. Multiple users' OpenPGP installations could
theoretically all be configured to point to the same shared keyring
files instead of each user having their own local keyring files (or
all their local keyring files could be kept in sync with a central
If the user's OpenPGP software accesses that database each time it
needs to use the private key, the database is providing the same
function as the old secret keyring.
If my keyring and your keyring happened to be stored on the same
server but they were separate and there was no sharing or syncing
between them, it would not be a shared keyring.

It is up to the enterprise how simple or complicated they choose to
make it. Their internal web of trust could be a simple hierarchy.
How complicated is user-side trust management within an enterprise
environment? If their internal web of trust is a simple hierarchy,
each user's software automatically trusts all other employees.
For business partners, the enterprise's certification key would have
to be able to sign the business partner's key as a trusted introducer
but only for staff at their own domain. Perhaps the use of Web Key
Directory [0] is already a simple enough solution.
The organisation's particular threat model may not require the keys of
business partners' staff to be signed at all as long as each contact
consistently uses the same key. In that case, Trust On First Use
(TOFU) [1] may be sufficient.

My opinion is that should be the case. However, most MUAs I've used
include the BCC recipients' keys in the encryption along with the To
and CC recipients' keys, so any email addresses in the user-IDs of
these keys are visible to all recipients.
As an exception, one MAU I used with an OpenPGP add-on would instead
send an individual copy of the message to each BCC recipient,
encrypted only to their key.
With hidden-recipient or hidden-encrypt-to or throw-keyids, it is
clear how many keys were encrypted to, but the key IDs and user-IDs
are not present.

I'm no expert but their Certificate Policy reads to me that the
private key is compromised right from the start. I think usually the
keys are generated on the subscriber's device and only the public key
goes to the CA to be certified.
    3.2.2 Proving possession of private key
    The private cryptographic key corresponding to the public key
    within the certificate is generated by the CA (with a suitable
    algorithm, size, etc.) and subsequently sent to the subscriberin
    PKCS for-mat[PFX], via email, thereby insuring that the
    subscriber does possess the private key.The password needed to
    import the PKCS file isprovided to the subscriber out-of-band
    (via web), therefore protecting it from unwanted disclosure to
    third parties. The CA does not retain such pass-word, so that the
    legitimate subscriber ?assuming that he/she keeps such password
    confidential ?remains the only person able to import the PKCS
    4.1Certificate Application, Processing and Issuance
    To apply for a certificate pursuant to this CP, after accepting the
    quote, the requestor shall fill in and submit aweb-basedrequest
    formto be found on the CA web site.Before the requestor can
    actually submit the certificate request form to the CA, he/she
    must read and accept this Certificate Policy and the Terms &
    Conditions; both documents are made available for download in the
    same web form. The requestor?s acceptance is expressed by ?point &
    click?, as allowed by Italian and European legislation on distance
    contracts. Furthermore, before the certificate request is
    accepted, the CA shall perform I&A according to ?3.2.Upon
    submission of the certificate request form, the CA shall issue the
    certificateand send this latter to the Subscriber via email.The
    certificate is sent to the Subscriber requestor together with the
    corresponding private key, both bundled into a PKCS file[PFX].
    The password needed to decipher the PKCS file is shown to the
    requestor in the browser, at the end of the certificate request
    procedure. It is up to the Subscriber to keep that password
    confidential and protect it from unwanted loss

I forgot I had added that to my gpg.conf file.
If the recipient has --auto-key-import set, they auto-import my key
after signature verification. But my choice to not include my email
address in my UID means they would not easily locate my key to send me
an encrypted reply.
Does (or will) --include-key-block have an argument that can be set to
tell it to only include ECC keyblocks, or to set a maximum keyblock

The RSA signature is for the benefit of recipients who can't handle
ECC keys/signatures. Probably not needed anymore.

The GnuPG manual's description [0] of the Dirmngr option "--keyserver name" still ends with "If no keyserver is explicitly configured, dirmngr will use the built-in default of hkps://hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net." Is this still true, or was the default changed?

I asked a different but related question that occurred to me when I read in your post that hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net "is now returning zero results". I had noticed the GnuPG manual says the default keyserver is hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net. I was under the impression the default had been changed to the Hagrid keyserver at keys.openpgp.org after the SKS attacks, so I asked the question to this list. So we have a default keyserver that is returning zero results?

Thanks, Mark.
hkp://keys.gnupg.net is an alias for hkps://hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net, which Phil said a couple of days ago was returning zero results. That issue is either intermittent or fixed, because I retrieved some keys from hkps://hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net a few hours ago and again a few minutes ago. At least, a line of the output said "gpg: data source:  ".
