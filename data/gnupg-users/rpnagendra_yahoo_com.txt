@_subject: public key already present 
Hello All,
Am getting below message while decrypting the file and its aborting without decrypting the file.
gpg: : skipped: public key already present.
This has happened due to deletion of a earlier public key with same name and importing new public key with same name. How can i make this work with new public key?
Thanks for your help!
