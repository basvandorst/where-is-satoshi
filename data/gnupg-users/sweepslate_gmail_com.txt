The end goal is to encrypt a volume of around 100GB of personal files that I'll be carrying arround with me in a portable drive.
It's around 14000 files, so I can't possibly encrypt them one-by-one interactively! Doing a tarball is going to be time-consuming, space consuming [1], and cumbersome. Also the process can't be stoped (and it's going to be a big process), and the only thing I'm gaining is hidding the original filenames, which I do not care in this scenario. So I'd like to avoid the tarball. If possible.
So I concluced that I need a non-interactive, 'scriptable' if you'd like, way to perform the action.
I wanted to use symmetric so as not to add unnecessary complexity to the solution. I'm only encrypting to myself.
I wanted to use something larger than a passphrase so I wondered if I can use a key. But on a second thought, I could use a SHA512SUM as a passphrase, which is 128 bytes in length. That makes it 1024 bits; correct? It's like a small key. I could use 4 of them combined for the strength of a key of 4096 bits.
If it's not possible to use a key or a 128-512 bytes passphrase, I could go for the classic way of public-private key. But I want to keep public key encryption as a last resort (I have reasons additional to complexity).
The key point is doing the encryption of 14000 files in a non-interactive way.
[1] While encrypting single files can be done progressively, in the same drive, without requiring exta space.

I don't want to do disk encryption, I want to do file encryption.
GPG is more easily available than TrueCrypt and I care for a simple scenario where I will be able to decrypt one or more files with minimal setup. I can carry the Win32 GPG binaries inside the hard drive.
TrueCrypt would provide a more transparent and automated solution but the cost would be simplicity.
