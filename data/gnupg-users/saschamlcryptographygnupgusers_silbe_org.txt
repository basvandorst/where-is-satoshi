@_subject: importing large keyring 
Recently (somewhere around the update from gnupg 1.2.x to 1.4.x) my keyring got corrupted:
sascha gpg --export > /dev/null
gpg: buffer shorter than subpacket
gpg: signature packet without timestamp
gpg: buffer shorter than subpacket
gpg: signature packet without keyid
gpg: buffer shorter than subpacket
However, most of the keys are still OK, so I'd like to use the output of "gpg --export" to re-create the keyring.
The keyring is rather large (70MB) and after importing several thousand keys gpg uses more memory than is available as physical RAM, so it's continously swapping. After 2 days without significant progress I've aborted the import.
Is there a way to split up the keydump into chunks of some thousand keys, so I can process those one after another?

@_subject: gpg-agent forwarding / create stub keys from full key 
I'm trying to use gpg-agent to sign/decrypt data on a remote host without storing a copy of the secret anywhere except on the local host. In general this should be possible since it's more or less how the smartcard support works.
Unfortunately gpg refuses to operate without a copy of the secret key in the keyring. From some mailing list posts I gather that gpg creates "stub keys" for keys on smartcards. Is there a way to generate and export such stub keys for "regular" secret keys in the keyring?
