@_subject: GnuPG Upgrade Problems 
Werner might want read about Debian-specific questions which are of no
relation to anything but the Debian packagaing system?
You should use the Debian bug tracker instead so that the maintainer of
the package gets notified (the package name is in this case `gnupg2').
You try to force an install which the packaging system refused. You will
get into trouble if you don't know exactly what the consequences might be.
You screwed up here. Anything already installed `/usr/bin/kbxutil'. It
is not in the *official* `gnupg' package available on the Debian
mirrors. It is only provided by `gnupg2'.
I advise you to do the following:
 * Check if you have installed the file by yourself into `/usr/bin'.
   If so, remove it.
 * Check if the packaging system knows the package it is assigned to.
   It claimed it to be `gnupg', you could check it with
   `dpkg -S /usr/bin/kbxutil'.
 * Force uninstall the packet owning the file.
 * Install `gnupg' and `gnupg2' together via apt-get in non-force mode.
   Both could be installed on the same machine normally without any
   trouble.

@_subject: using passphrase with special chars on Windows 
You certainly encounter charset problems. On Linux you use either
ISO-8859-1 or UTF-8 on your terminal. On Windows... Well I don't know
but I recall something Windows specific. You should change the
passphrase on Linux to remove the umlauts, because they *will* cause
If you somehow manage to get an UTF-8 environment on both Linux and
Windows you're fine. But as I dropped Windows some time ago, I can't
help on this one, I don't even know if it's possible.
Kind regards,

@_subject: USB tokens instead of smartcards 
Hi there,
do you recommend any USB token for use with GnuPG? I currently  consider to buy an OpenPGP smartcard but the thought to have a tiny  USB token instead of a big smartcard reader is appealing to me,  especially because they might share the same protocol. But I think  the question is more if there are supported ones because I found most  supporting PKCS thus requiring OpenSC et al.
I want to use it for secure GnuPG encryption, signing and SSH  authentication. RSA-1024 is still sufficiently secure, I guess?
Thanks in advance for any answer,
Philipp Kern

Yeah, I got that fact. So to clarify: A USB token with a supported  smartcard in it.
Kind regards,

@_subject: BZIP2 algorithm isn't supported after compiling gnupg from 
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
Taking this question self-contained:
# apt-get install libbz2-dev
Then gnupg's configure should find it just fine, without specifying a path.
