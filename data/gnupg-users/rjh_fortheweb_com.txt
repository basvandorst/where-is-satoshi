@_subject: gpg: cannot open /dev/tty: Permission denied 
I'm trying GnuPG, and I'm having some problems.  This is on a Debian
Linux 2.0.37 box.  It verifies signatures OK, but spits out the
message "cannot open /dev/tty: Permission denied".
It will not encrypt, producing the same error message:
    echo hi | gpg -e -r my-email-address
I do not see any answer - or question - for this in the archives,
after searching thoroughly.
Any thoughts welcomed.

I want to use it in both contexts.  Thanks to everyone for the responses.  What exactly is it trying to write to the tty, anyway?

Unix senders who don't specify textmode for text email will cause this problem when you open it on the Windows box. ----- Original Message ----- Sent: Wednesday, April 04, 2001 5:59 PM

keyserver.pgp.com changed IP addresses, but keys.nai.com wasn't updated
properly to that new address.  They've been notified; I'll let you know when
I hear a response from them.
