@_subject: New UK crypto law and an idea on how to defeat it 
I understand that it will (or might) soon be necessary in the UK to hand
over crypto keys to the police if they so demand them. The penalty for
not doing so is a term in prison.
So here's an idea on how to defeat it.
Imagine Bob is having an affair with the police chief's wife and has all
their encrypted love letters in his possession. The police chief
suspects the affair and is prepared to abuse his powers to obtain the
letters for a divorce proceeding in his favour. He knows he can force
Bob to give him the decryption key by threatening him with prison term
for not doing so. Bob doesn't want to go to prison so he "reluctantly"
hands over the key. The chief gleefully decrypts the message hoping at
last for evidence of his wife's infidelity but all he sees is a cooking
recipe! Curse that Bob!
How is this done?
Simple. Write a tool that encrypts two or more plaintexts each with a
separate key and concatenates them into a single ciphertext.
But there's a problem. The police chief finds out that there are
multiple plaintexts in the ciphertext. He goes back to Bob and demands
the proper key or he'll definitely go to prison. How can Bob claim that
he has "truthfully" given up the correct key the first time and has no
idea what the other key is?
Again simple. Make the tool capable of encrypting one or more plaintexts
and zero or more *random* plaintexts (with random keys) into a single
Bob can't be sent to jail because he can validly claim that the other
plaintexts in the cipher were randomly generated and so he couldn't
possibly know what the other key was let alone hand it over. The police
chief might *suspect* Bob was lying, but there's no way he could prove
it short of Bob's admission. Effectively, Bob has defeated the
requirement to hand over his key, but has still kept his secrets secret.
Does this sound like a feasible idea?

Fine, the police chief concocts a phoney charge against Bob and uses that as
a pretense to get to the files.
This is the point. Bob may or may not know both sets of keys. The encryption
tool may have used a random plaintext and a random key or it may not. The
only person who knows for sure is Bob. The cops can't prove it either way
assuming that the encryption technique is suitably robust against any
analysis they might bring against it.
Yes but Bob can *lie*. The onus is on the police to prove he is lying. How
do they do that given that they don't know whether the second plaintext is
random or not?

@_subject: GnuPG code in Mozilla: GPL issues? 
A couple of random thoughts:
James Clark distributes expat under the MPL by default, but he allows distribution
under the GPL in special circumstances (e.g. to let expat ship with GPL software).
Couldn't GnuPG do the reverse?
Also, what are the chances that core GPG functionality will become a runtime
library? If that happened, then presumably the LGPL (which most libraries use)
would mean that Mozilla could link to it with no problems.

@_subject: GnuPG code in Mozilla: GPL issues? 
I'm not sure I understand the security reasons for not having GPG in a library.
Presumably someone dastardly enough to swap out the library (assuming it's dynamic
shared) for one of their own could easily do the same with the GPG executable. In
which case, where's the increased harm of having a library?
Besides, if this were an issue, then the library could be built and linked
statically. I've seen quite a few libs that can build dynamic or statically via a
configuration switch.
I understand that PGP is available as an SDK. Surely they couldn't do this either if
they were faced with the same issues concerning libraries as GPG is?
