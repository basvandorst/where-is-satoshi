@_subject: Build for Windows with Visual C++? 
Did anyone try to build GPG for Windows using Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0? I am looking for ROM (rough order of magnitude) estimates of the amount of work that would be required. Of course if somebody has already done it, it would be nice to have it! A version running in a console without MFC would be sufficient.
