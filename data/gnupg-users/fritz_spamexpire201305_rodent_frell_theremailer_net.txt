@_subject: [OT] Why are you using the GPG / PGP keys? 
No.  keys can be and are stolen.
Your anonymity, through whichever tool you are using, depends on
cryptographic signatures.  For instance, you seem to be posting from
riseup.net to protect your identity.  *Seem to be.*  But you only know
you are even
connecting to their server via their RSA sigs via their SSL certificate.
And how to verify that?  and so on...
So on some level PGP/GPG or some variation becomes important also for
"anonymity."  Tor, for instance, depends completely on crypto signatures
to function.
