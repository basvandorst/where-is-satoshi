I will find a free software (with possibility to compile on Solaris)
provided for keyserver. I will make my own keyserver with keys
to authenticate of mails written from physicians in Poland participating
in telemedical programs

Thanks Werner - the path to gcc in Makefile has been not
specyfied - if I had add fullpath as /usr/local/bin/gcc
compilation has gone correct
Many Thanks

Yes, with signatures this is made allready and all is OK (options
--force-v3-sigs I have included in pgppine as default). But my problem is
with decrytption
by PGP 7.0.3 (the more free versions too) encrypted prior by GnuPG
mails. This problem I can't solve
If anybody knows how-to, it were nice

@_subject: Still problems with compatibility 
I have still problems with compatibility between GnuPG and PGP
with encryption+signature. Compatibility is ok with making and verifing
signatures, but at encryption not. I have made encryption+signature
with GnuPG 1.0.6 and applied decrypt and verfify it und the error
has been reported. Ia have created typical key-pairs with GnuPG 1.0.4
DSA/1024 - public key can be retrieved from key server
Please help me if posiible. I have presentation about Internet security
system on Internet Session 5th Kongress of Polish Cardiac Society und
solving this problem can help me to refer it here

I'll ask, how do I achieve full compatibility between GnuPG 1.0.6
and PGP 7.x.x. I known, to take it with signatures --force-v3-sigs
should be used. But my friends using PGP can not read my email,
while they are by me encrypted using GnuPG.

Some softwares compiling good on Linux have problems on
Solaris. It seems to be, we (Solaris users) must wait
to fix it. So I'll not aplly to compile it but will
wait for further information about it

@_subject: GnuPG 1.0.7 not compiling on Solrais 2.7 
Today I have compiled on Solrais 7 (Sun IPX) with gcc 2.95.3 and gnumake
and on Solaris 2.6 on ultra machine without problems. All is good, as
seen. Generally, all GNU software on Solaris should be compiled with gcc
rather with other (native) compilers usign gnumake instead native make.
This same relates to using program 'patch' for patching GNU-software.
If you'll to patch Solaris, the native Solaris program 'patch' should be
if you'll to patch GNU-software on Solaris, 'GNU-patch' program to it
is prefered. I have used on Solaris only gcc in version 2.95.3, because
versions 3.x works on Solaris not excellnet yet, but I use not other
compilers as from gcc "family"
