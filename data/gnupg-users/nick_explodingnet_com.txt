Hi all
I've been looking for a way to change the 'comment' on a signiture. I
can't work it out so a little nudge in the right direction would be
Also, is it possible to do without the comment entirely?
Many thanks

So do you mean like:
$ gpg --comment "new comment"
Will that change the comment permanently?
Thanks very much....

This is a good question for the mutt list. In brief it may be that Sylpheed cannot handle pgp mime types, you'l
find Outhouse can't either and this can be fixed with some patches for
mott. Mail me privately or post to mutt-users for details.

Hash: SHA1
Hi all
I'm trying to get a list of keyservers as the one I've been using no
longer seems to be working (wwwkeys.dk.pgp.net)
I'm using this $ host -l pgp.net
and getting this
Host pgp.net. not found: 5(REFUSED)
; Transfer failed.
Any ideas or alternatives very much appreciated.

Hash: SHA1
Hi all, host -l pgp.net does not work for me. I believe it has something to do
with zone transfers in the Scandanavian neck of the woods. Can anyone
help me find a good keyserver near me? (Denmark)
Many thanks

Hash: SHA1
Hello list people.
I've been talking to a guy who saw my signiture and was intrigued. He
would like to set up pgp on his Win98 machine which is great. As I know
nothing about pgp on win I thought I'd ask 2 Q's here.....
1.  What is a good 'for dummies' mail client that will handle pgp on
2.  What will he need to install and are there any good resources he
might use to get started.
Many thanks
