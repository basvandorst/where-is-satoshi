Dear Friends of John W. Moore III
You may recall that John's mother unexpectedly died on 6 Jul 2010 and
that along with the unexpected complexities of probating her estate and
some other things resulted in his having to reluctantly terminate his
extensive involvement in crypto and other Internet-related activities.
The required surgery on John's right foot went well although they
determined they had to remove his little toe and the portion of his
foot from there to the back of his heel. As a result John tells me he
can now only count up to 9 versus 10. John has a strong interest in once again becoming active in both his
crypto and other Internet interests but currently isn't sure how soon
he will be able to begin doing so in 2012.
In the meantime John (UTC -0500) would be very interested in hearing
from you and asks you do so via either his:
Finally, John asked that I convey to each of you his very best wishes
that you and those you love have a wonderful Dec holiday season and a
healthy and prosperous New Year.
I join John in extending the same thoughts and wishes to you and yours.

Using a decent password generator and specifying a mix of upper and
lower case letters, digits, and special characters, how many total
characters -- as a minimum -- would you recommend such a password be?
Any particular password generator program you would recommend?

I believe you'll find that CAcert ( is an exception *if*
you are relying on one of their x.509 certificates that includes the
individual's name since all CAcert certificates are free *and*
If the CAcert certificate includes the owner's name -- and if you're
willing to accept that CAcert assurance policies have been followed,
you can be confident that

Only then -- again assuming all other GSWoT policy requirements have been
met and that it's been validated that they control the email addresses
