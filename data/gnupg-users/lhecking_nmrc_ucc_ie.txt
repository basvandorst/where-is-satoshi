You *trust* a government that installs public spy cameras, participates

 Sad.
 The only way to defeat such a bill, should it happen, would be to
 propagate widespread public use of crypto. Now, let them try to
 lock up one millon. Or five million.

I installed GPG a few months ago and created a test key, mainly to
 play around with.
 To my big surprise, I discovered today that this key is now on the
 key servers! How did it get there?
 Does the keyserver directive in ~/.gnupg/options go both ways, or should
 I assume that one of the individuals I made my key available to under
 the condition not to publicise it did just that? Maybe accidentally?
 There is no harm in my key being there, I'm just wondering how it
 got there.

 Exactly. This is a p_r_o_b_l_e_m_.
 I think the latter form is more readable, so there you go. The former
 obscures the code, and makes it harder to find and separate preprocessor
 statements.
 If portability comes at such a low cost, I'd recommend the change.
 There is absolutely no point installing gcc on a platform which comes
 with a full ANSI C compiler. The cc compiler on Alpha creates better
 code than gcc, and has less bugs. It also has very nice diagnostics,
 which often surpass gcc's (can't really say one or the other is better,
 in general, because both compilers issue a different set of warnings for
 the same code :-|)
 To put the Alpha C compiler into ANSI mode (with extensions), use
  cc -std. This sets __STDC__=0.
 To put the Alpha C compiler into strict ANSI mode, use
  cc -std1. This sets __STDC__=1.
 The compiler can be set at configure time:
 $ CC='cc -std' ./configure

 There are none. The closest you can get is AM_PROG_CC_STDC (through
 AM_C_PROTOTYPES), but it's of no use in this case. If you run it on
 OSF/DecUnix/Tru64, the result is that no extra options are needed
 because the decision is based on whether or not the compiler accepts
 prototypes (which Dec Unix cc without options does).
 The need for more fine grained detection of compiler capabilites/features,
 was discussed on the autoconf list, but I don't think any great efforts
 went into adding this to the upcoming 2.15 release. Need to check the
 CVS, though ...

 I am suprised that this was missing. Linux on m68k requires at

 used instead of the machine specific ones.

 I am suprised that this was missing. Linux on m68k requires at
 least an 68020. Without this change, the generic mpi modules are
 used instead of the machine specific ones.
 On the good side, gpg is now very close to building without GNU make.
 NetBSD's make works almost everywhere now, except for the asm modules.
 I haven't yet figured out how to make this work.

I guess not.

  FreeBSD
  The latter describes GNU ld, which is also standard on Linux systems.
 The Solaris case could probably be left empty, as -dy is the default
 (but the Solaris man page says nothing about how this affects exporting
  of symbols).

 signed mails on this list to pgp/mime. The significant difference
 between this mail of yours (as received by list members) and other
 signed mails is that your message was multipart/mixed, and maybe
 the list software has problems with that. Or there was some broken

 Here is one way to compile with DU cc:

 don't need the corresponding LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib for libz.so. cc finds
 it anyway).
 CFLAGS are a matter of personal preference.
 DU has no /dev/random, so I'm using egd.
 --disable-asm: If you try to use asm modules, the compiler driver invokes
 a program calles ugen. It's not on my system, I don't know what it does
