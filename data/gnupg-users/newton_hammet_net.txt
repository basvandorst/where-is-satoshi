@_subject: technical question about the public key 
Hello Gnupg-users,
   I have just downloaded, successfully compiled and test gpg
   I have noticed that it does not generate RSA keys, but
public keys.
   My question is: is the information about which algorithm to use
stored with the
public key?  I suspect the answer is yes.  I am a newbie to this amazing
and am studying the formats of the files used, but am not clear enough
on the
details yet to say for certain.
   My system is solaris-8 on a PC(intel86-compatible).

@_subject: trying to learn by dumping packets 
Hello Fellow gnupg'rs,
I am attempting to learn the details of this wonderful product
and I am in the process of developing an rfc2440-based packet dump
program to parse OpenGPG messages and show packet type, length, and
other details.
what I did was public-key encrypt a small text file named "xxxxx"
with the contents "xxxxx\n". (i am on a solaris8 pc and I used
gpg v1.0.6 to do the encryption)
It created an output file:
and my rfc2440 dump program (just barely scaffolded) produced the
following output:
amount read = 339

far.  I found the first packet header "0x85", a 2-byte
length code with the decimal value "270".  The problem is
I don't know how to decode the next header tag which is
'd2' at hex offset 111 in the file.  my understanding
of rfc2440 is that it should be a "new format packet
header of tag value 18" and I don't know what that is
(the tag specs only go up to 16 in the rfc2440).
Below is some partial output from my rfc2440-dump program.
Offset PktHdr Fmt HdrLen BodyLen
00000   0x85  Old     3    270   ==PUBLIC-KEY-ENCRYPTED-SESSION-KEY==
   VER=3  KEY-ID=549eb3c9a1b0265f  Algorithm  next pkthdr=d2 at offset: 0111
It is probably a case where I have misunderstood something
in the rfc description (i.e. is the total packet length
273? (3 bytes header plus 270 bytes data) or 270? (the length
value standing for the total data).
Don't know if any gnu guru wants to wade through the above
but it sure would be appreciated.
No problems with gpg so far (I am just learning). I compiled it successfully on my pc, and have created public keys, imported
and exported them with and without "armor" and have encrypted
(public key) and decrypted (with corres private key) successfully.
So it is not really a problem with using gpg but wanting to understand it in greater technical detail.

Hello All,
   I have the possibility of "work-for-hire" situation coming up and my potential
wants secure email traffic between the 2 of us getting the work done.
   I have proposed that we do the following ::
1. Both install gnupg-1.0.7.
2. Both generate a key-pair, each key-pair containing 1 RSA-2048bit signing key, and
1 RSA 2048bit
  encryption key.
3. Exchange public keys, sign em and all that.
4. A message consists of 2 parts:  1 message encrypted with public key of recipient.
                                   1 message which is the md5sum of the unencrypted
message (+ date/time,
                                    and sender's name), signed with private key of
It would seem that the above is maybe a reasonable protocol.  And 1 question is, is
the above, or something
as safe, already available say, with the 'gpg -se' for signing and encrypting the
same message, (I assume
gpg get's it right as to whose key to sign with and whose key to encrypt with).
And is md5sum still considered to be safe?  I hear everyone talking about SHA1 these
days. I get the
feeling that some of this is already done automagically by gnupg but not totally
sure.  I have written
scripts to accomplish step 4 in reasonably automatic fashion, with the exception of
passphrase prompting,
which I have eliminated for testing purposes by editting the keys and changing to a
null passphrase.
Right now we have not done any of the steps.  I have done 1-4 already with 2 user ids
in order to
test my scripts.

Hello Folks,
  I have for years emersed my self in the theory of cryptography, but feel what
I need is some practical experience using it (gnupg).  I have recently installed
gnupg-1.0.7.  I have also created an RSA 2048-bit signing key that contains an

  I am looking for someone who also needs some practical experience with this tool.
  We could send each other our public keys, and/or swap encrypted emails ... I am not
looking for anything fancy or subterfuge.. Kind of a public-key pen-pal thing.
  I have not published my newly generated key to a key server yet.  But I can do that
if nesc.  To start with, I can simply send my public key to any interested party, (the key i generated with 'gpg --export -a') as part of a reply email.

Hello All,
   I am still struggling with the paper co-authored by Bruce Schneier,
others, of "Implementation of Chosen-Ciphertext Attacks against PGP and
   I have concluded that a key part of the vulnerability lies in the
being snookered into sending back to "Mallory" the garbled decrypted
text as
a quote.  If one never sends back the decrypted text but a secure-hash
of the
decrypted text instead wouldn't this defeat this type of attack?
   I propose the following rules to increase security when using GnuPG:
1. Never send back a decryption of anything to anybody, esp. if it is
  back to a specific ciphertext.
2. Always have 2 different public keys one for signing and one for
  (and never swap their roles)
3. Never sign messages, only secure hashes of messages. (I think GnuPG
does this
by default).

not my

and save changes before quiting should update you the above
algorithm choices.
This is true 'showpref' does not show the asymmetric ciphers.
If you look at the choices for your primary key, RSA is for sign only.
However after generating an RSA signing key you can add an RSA encrypting key as a sub-key again using ::
gpg --edit-key ==================== sample I ran on my workstation
Command> addkey
Key is protected.
You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: "yakoff smirnoff (i am an rsa key) "
1024-bit RSA key, ID DDAC44C2, created 2002-10-17
Please select what kind of key you want:
   (2) DSA (sign only)
   (3) ElGamal (encrypt only)
   (4) ElGamal (sign and encrypt)
   (5) RSA (sign only)
   (6) RSA (encrypt only)
Your selection? 6
==================== end of sample
you will then get a choice for an RSA signing key, and also an RSA
encrypting key.  pick option '6'...
The software doesnt allow RSA keys to be used for both signing
and encryption because there are too many ways that a message can
be recovered, due to the fact that 'signing' means multiplying
the message by the private key, and encrypting means multiplying
the message by the public key.  note that decrypting is equiv
to signing.
I hope this short answer helps answer your question. Let me
know if you need more information.

1. Use gpg --gen-key/edit-key to generate a 2048-bit RSA signing only key, with a 2048-bit RSA
encryption only key as a secondary key.
2. Used a passphrase that is probably long and obscure enough make cracking difficult.   (Downside is carpal tunnel typing the damn thing in.)
3. Generated in advance my revoking certificate, and then encrypted it with symmetric-key encryption
and destroyed the unencryped version of the revoke cert.
   (I don't want keys rotting out there in keyserverdom because i failed to make a revoke, or forgot
    my passphrase, or both... forgetting passphrase is distinct possibility (see (2) above).
Haven't uploaded anything yet.  I am prepared to, but notice a lot of people with 1024-bit keys.
Wondering if whether or not I will be drawing lots of attention to myself with a 2048-bit key. (What is
he trying to hide?)  I didn't see any others out there with 2048-bit keys, so I wonder.
(William Jefferson Clinton has a 1024-bit key, but Al Gore, (inventor of the internet) does not,
apparently... lol)
Comments are welcome.  I probably won't change from RSA though, cause I like that algorithm. Don't
know if DSA or ELGamal are more secure for same key length though. I think ElGamal may be secure
if there is a breakthrough in factoring but only if that does not also mean a breakthrough in
descrete logarithms.... Don't know.

@_subject: ...1.0.7 gonna publish my key / RSA ? 
Hello All,
I am now researching this thing about RSA keys and compatability
with PGP, particularly later versions where it says RSA can be
added for "backward compatability" with older versions of PGP.
Why is PGP discontinuing support for RSA keys?  I can't image there are patent
issues.  I thought the patent expired on Sept 20, 2000 (source: Applied Cryptography).
Does it have to do with patent not expiring overseas?  Is it an ITAR issue?
I am curious, because I like the algorithm, but don't want to use it if it
will cause interoperability problems.

I have a key ready to publish, revoke cert (just in case) is backed up
to other HDD and floppy and hard copy printed out.
Public key is ready to upload to keyserver:
I assume that updating the key with additional material (like someone
signing my key), is done by the same processs under which the key was
added as a new key.
(that is deleting which is the problem, and that is what my various
copies of a revoke cert are, and the cert itself can be uploaded to the
keyserver, or do you have to revoke your public keylocally first and
then upload the whole shootin match to the server?
I guess this is question 1.
Question 2:  how exactly do people sign my key so i can put the
signatures on the keyserver, or, do other people do that? (sign the
copy I have on the key server).  The thing is, I know how to sign keys i put on my keyring.  I guess
what i do if i want someone to sign my key I send it to them they add
their signature, and send it back to me and then I send the whole
shooting match up to the server (as an update to my key).  (i.e. i first re-import my public key with signatures back to my local
keyring, check it out to make sure it hasn't been corrupted, and then
re-export and send on up to server, all assuming of course that the
public keyring is backed up prior to this.)
So what I have above is questions pretty much in the form of
Just all about putting the key out there being ready to revoke just in
case, and, getting the key signed by others, and so on.  Hopefully some volunteers will further illuminate me. and I set the
outgoing wrap at 72 characters this time ... hope that helps.

Do it this way:
1. Edit your key
gpg --edit-key 2. Use either showpref or pref to look at current preferences...
   is verbose, pref is the actual codes that you have to enter via    setpref. Use both in the order implicit in below:
Command> showpref
pub  2048R/05BD84B4  created: 2002-09-26 expires: 2003-09-26 trust: u/u
(1). Newton Hammet (TreeFlyer Global Resources)      Cipher: AES, CAST5, 3DES
     Hash: SHA1, RIPEMD160

Command> pref

(1). Newton Hammet (TreeFlyer Global Resources)      S7 S3 S2 H2 H3 Z2 Z1 [mdc]
3. Set the new preferences: (you need to use actual code for preference    being added)
Command> setpref S10 S7 S3 S2 H2 H3 Z2 Z1
Command> updpref
you will be prompted: "Really update the prefrences?" answer 'yes'.
you will be prompted for your  passphrase (hopefully you still remember
it!, I had to re-type mine)
3. Then enter 'pref' or showpref' to insure the changes have been made. In this example
  I added the symmetric cipher "TWOFISH" to my preference list. (It's
code is S10)
Command> showpref
pub  2048R/05BD84B4  created: 2002-09-26 expires: 2003-09-26 trust: u/u
(1). Newton Hammet (TreeFlyer Global Resources)      Cipher: TWOFISH, AES, CAST5, 3DES
     Hash: SHA1, RIPEMD160
     Compression: ZLIB, ZIP
And then you can exit edit-key or perform other edits.

@_subject: question about cipher/primegen.c 
Hello Everyone, and any gnupg developers out there.
I am studying primegen.c and other source modules of gnupg, primarly for
my own edification. And I have a question about primegen.c where a
random number is selected before testing it for primality. The code
comment says that the high order bit is set to "1" to insure that key
is a certain size, and the next to high order bit is set to "0" for
a similiar reason.  But why in the world would the lo-order bit be
set to zero?  Isn't the number supposed to be odd to start with prior
to checking for primality?  Or are mpi numbers represented as one
less or more than the actual number?  Or is there some other explanation
lurking the source code that I have not yet discovered?
Hopefully someone has an answer for me that will solve this particular puzzle before I eventually solve it myself.
Here is the lines of code in question :::
   /* generate a random number */
    {   char *p = get_random_bits( nbits, randomlevel, secret );
        mpi_set_buffer( prime, p, (nbits+7)/8, 0 );
        m_free(p);
    }
    /* Set high order bit to 1, set low order bit to 0.
           If we are generating a secret prime we are most probably
           doing that for RSA, to make sure that the modulus does have
           the requested keysize we set the 2 high order bits */
    mpi_set_highbit( prime, nbits-1 );
        if (secret)
          mpi_set_bit (prime, nbits-2);
    mpi_set_bit( prime, 0 );   /*** code in question ?????? ***/

Hello again everyone,
I may have answered my own question.  The documentation has
a bug. It should say "set high order and low order bits to 1".
That is what the code actually does (both mpi_set_bit and
mpi_set_highbit both set target bits to 1, while mpi_set_highbit
clears bits above the set bit).

for windows, you can map a remote exported nfs filesystem to a
local drive letter via the following Windbloz command line:

that assumes the remote directory is a unix nfs server.
Maybe it works also for a Windows nfs server I do not know.

Hello Everyone,
I have just uploaded a public key to the keyservers listed below in
my signature, and the finger print in the signature is what is reported
from gnupg_1.2.4 installed on my linux machine
785F DFF3 7029 3FBD 45CE  747C 93CA E808 136F C036
But  reports the following finger print:
BAC5 85A2 3322 71A9 E817 D2B4 CF2E B411 7E07
My key consists of : a 4096-bit master RSA signing key, and a 4096-bit RSA encryption key.
My guess is that the fingerprint constructed by the keyserver uses
a different algorithm than the one used by gnupg-1.2.4, or it
takes its fingerprint from something different than does gnupg-1.2.4
Can anybody shed some light on this for me?

@_subject: Question about fingerprints and keys uploaded to keyservers 
Hello everyone again and thanks to gabriel, David and others who
responded.  I think for me the mystery might be solved.
keyserver.net appears "broken", at least with respect to fingerprint.
subkeys.pgp.net appears to be OK, with respect to fingerprint in that
the fingerprint it reports for my new key is identical to the finger
print that gpg-1.2.4 reports. (actually I have compiled gpg-1.2.4 from
source and have made a single change, allowing for a maximum RSA key
size of up to 8192 bits... a very simple coding change).
But it appears you can download my public key from keyserver.net and
that key works just fine too, since someone used my key downloaded from
that keyserver to send me an encrypted email.

@_subject: revoke key with forgotten passphrase from keyservers 
Hello Fellow unfortunate owner of a nice public key that is sitting
out there silently rotting in key-server purguratory.
I too, have a nicely signed, well-formed public key out there. Along with
a hard copy revoke certificate and a floppy disk and hard copy base64
copy of the key itself in a nice folder I created an overly long pass
phrase which was probably cryptographically secure but horrible to keep
of when typing into gpg.  Eventually I forgot the pass phrase.
So now I created a new public key , this time with a 16-character
passphrase composed of basically nonsense stuff.  (I will probably change
it by
creating a new one using /dev/random).
But I also did this.  I changed the password to my box to be the same
as the gpg passphrase.  Since I log in at least once a day but do not
send signed email or receive email encrypted with the new public key
as often as once a day, at least I have a better chance of remembering
the passphrase.
So I have created a balance between having a totally cryptographically
secure pass phrase and one I am not likely to forget or be frustrated
in making a single key stroke error in the middle of typing a 50+
character passphrase.
So ... I say live with your dirty laundry sitting out there in public key
feafdom and create another key with a process in place to keep you from
forgetting it.
Hope this helps

@_subject: RSA 1024 ridiculous / RSA 8192 sublime, and, possible with gnupg. 
To coax bigger RSA keys out of gnupg-1.4.7 you have to download
and recompile the source, but with one change in the following file:
Here is diff -r output, 2 source trees, one source tree containing
the single difference:
nhammet at linux:~/gpg_test_8192> diff -r * 2>&1|grep -v 'Only in'
diff -r gnupg-1.4.7/g10/keygen.c gnupg_1.4.7x/g10/keygen.c
In more detail it's the following case stanza:
    case PUBKEY_ALGO_RSA:
      min=1024;
      max=8192;  /* Line of code to allow 8192 key generation.*/
      break;
It is the case stanza in the first switch statement in the function:
ask_keysize(int algo)
in the file g10/keygen.c
I can successfully generate an 8192-key (in under 10 minutes). If I
get around 2it, I will test this key for signing, maybe generate
a 8192-bit RSA sub-key and test that, too. I did this before in gnupg-1.2.1 (Check the mailing list archives)
but it was a different change... I think, to a header file. (I don't
have or can no longer find the detritus from that excursion) I was
much more energetic then testing, signing, encrypting, and decrypting
with a 8192-bit RSA key.
The real rub will be to see if it behaves well with unaltered (for
8192 key generation) gnupg-1.4.7) for encrypting, signing, decrypting,
etc., but I suspect it will be copacetic with unaltered official
gnupg-1.4.7. (Werner Koch and the gang are pretty thorough with this
code, it is high quality stuff)
