You haven't specified your threat model precisely enough, for the
vague one you presented the answer is both yes and no. SSL webmail and
GPG protect against different things.
Yes - because SSL webmail access is good enough to prevent the
operators of great chinese firewall of snooping into what do you do on
your mailbox.
No - because SSL protects only against eavesdropping of mailbox
access. It doesn't protect your email in transit from server to server
(unless all the servers in the way support SMTP/TLS and you trust the
operators of the servers). For example, if you write from your SSL
webmail to someone in .cn, the contentrs of the mail can be observed
by the operatros of said firewall.

No, it is not. You only need to get a intercept warrant against the
uplink provider.
There are commercial products to do so. It costs money, but most of
the telcos have deployed them to comply with law regulations.
Against what? Put the recipient in the Guantanamo or equivalent and
s/he will divulge all his passwords. And it is all legal. We have a
war going, after all.
95% of the web commerce doesn't agree with that statement (the other
5% doesnt use crypto at all).
Again, you haven't defined the attacker, the threat model, or
anything, you just put some out of context statements to support your
four legs good two legs bad slogan.
It is impossible to answer the question asked in the subject of the

attacker you want to protect against. This was not done even in the

"will my email be secure agains my brother's snooping?", so the

There is no need for them, from the cryptography point of view. Using

them encrypted stuff and the second party can decrypt what they are
sent without knowing the sender's secret key - thats what pubkey
crypto is for. If they want to be sure that they can decrypt
everything, the encrypted data should be encrypted to both recipients'

This is because they are a governement and gov't usually wants to have
super secure comm network for gov't super secret communication.
It can be eavesdropped, but it is impossible to intercept information
that way and the eavesdropping is detectable. Or rather should be:
eavesdropping on QC link is detectable if by rule single photons are
used as transmission units. This is because there's no way to
intercept a photon and reinject it without destroying its quantum
state. However, in commercial installations pulses (batches of
photons) are used, so its perfectly possible to intercept a piece of
the pulse. My quantum-fu is too weak to really know if this makes the
eavesdropping undetectable, but the intuition says that yes.
EU is know for sinking money in very bizarre projects.
But the point is that the ciphers live in the real world and in the
real world it is much easier to do HUMINT (like "ale and whores"
mentioned before, or rubberhose cryptanalysis) instead of trying to
break the mathematically unbreakable. Be it provably unbreakable or
OpenPGP and GPG is about making the idea-based mathematic apparatus
suited to survive in the real world. If you want to see what it takes,
find a movie called "In ascolto" or "The Listening" (it was shot in

All those things that you describe involve lot of effort on your and
your correspondent's side, and are weak - if someone who has your
address gets a trojan, your address leaks out. If someone accidentally
puts server log files on the net, your address leaks out, when someone
writes to your wrong address (like sending private reply to email
address) the communication won't work.
What are you tring to do, is like full time wearing full biosafety
hazmat suit with closed air circulation just to avoid getting common cold. It won't work this way or another, the air will run out at some point
or the suit will wear and tear where and when you are not looking. And
you are a big inconvenience to your peers.
What I'm saying is that this approach is stupid, and wasteful of time
and resources. It seems secure, gives this warm and fuzzy feeling, but
it isn't. It is like taking your shoes in the airport, but what if

* people keys have designated-revoker set to org key

That's why we are here.
S/MIME is a PKI (as in X.509 standard) counterpart of some subset of
OpenPGP standard (as defined in RFC 4880). OpenPGP defines a way to sign, encrypt and then format data for
transmission or storage. Another standard, PGP/MIME, defines a way to
ue OpenPGP capabilities within e-mail. OpenPGP uses its own format of
keys with its own way how to decide to trust them.
S/MIME is based on X.509 certificates (with its hierarchy of trust),
and specifies only a way to sign and/or encrypt data within e-mail
based MIME structure. A counterpart just to encrypt random data is
called CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax). S/MIME was based on PKCS
now is based on CMS (which was developed after first version of
S/MIME), which now positions CMS as PKI counterpart to OpenPGP.
To muddy waters further, there are other PKI based-standards, like
XML-DSIG which aren't compatible with CMS or OpenPGP.
GNU Privacy Guard 1.x talks only OpenPGP. GNU Privacy Guard 2.x talks
OpenPGP and S/MIME, I'm not sure if it talks plain CMS.

Sit back, define your threat: spooks? trojans? identity thieves? snoopy
spouse? laptop thieves? You can't be secure against all possible threat.
Decide which one you choose and concentrate on defending against this
particular thread.

both yes and no
spooks don't need to break your ciphers to get your encrypted stuff, the
simplest technical measure is to inject a trojan into your system that will
siphon off what's needed, then there is traffic analysis, TEMPEST, etc etc
BTW: I really doubt that if there is a classified shortcut to solve RSA, a
random guy from a random security firm would a) know it (COMSEC/INFOSEC is
usually classified TOP SECRET as it is conidered of vital importance to
state security), and b) he would blabber about it to anyone who would care
to listen
if a), then b) would land him in jail, quickly

Blabbering about classified stuff is a breach of security procedures and
NDA-s, that leads to administrative action, prosecution and usually jail
sentence (or a hefty fine).
The approach you mention would be probably used on someone who would like to
play the game (as in sell the info to another country), not for some random
