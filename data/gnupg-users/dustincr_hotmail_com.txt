@_subject: command 'LEARN' failed: No inquire callback in IPC 
Hi Mr. Yutaka:
Thank you for your input and all the dev work you have done.
This is a cloud environment so I dont have the luxury of physical access to a usb port. I do not leverage libusb because this is using network attached Safenet Luna SA HSM (gemalto brand) PKCS11 smart card provider.
I just gave the native scdaemon a try. It doesnt seem to recognize this card provider at all.
ERR 100663404 Card error In fact the native support for smart cards does not seem to support network attached HSM "virtual tokens" devices at all. It could be possible that I need to specify the local port the installed HSM agent is running on, but I dont think I will be that lucky.
Perhaps I could help build the support into the native scdaemon, but you are an expert at this, so I dont want to come off rude.  I know the work isnt simple.
I have this  other scdaemon (gnupg-pkcs11-scd) working fine with gnupg 2.0, but with manual pinentry for each operation. I cant get it working with gnupg 2.1. (again, I am looking for the unattended pinentry support the later version seems to have) Thus, I really dont think this is an issue with the scdaemon I am using. Moreover, I can see the INQUIRE PIN callback is there, the pinentry is just not appearing. Really I would like to understand why the gpg-connect-agent is allowing the pin call back through, and the gpg-agent itself is not?
Thank you,

What's the configure option?  Did you enable smart card support with
This is not the scdaemon from GnuPG.
Please install scdaemon of GnuPG and try again with that.

Hi gnupg users:
Which gnupg2-smime should I use here with this amazn linux?
Error: Package: gnupg2-smime-2.0.14-8.el6.x86_64 (/gnupg2-smime-2.0.14-8.el6.x86_64)
           Requires: gnupg2 = 2.0.14-8.el6
           Installed: gnupg2-2.0.28-1.30.amzn1.x86_64 (installed)
               gnupg2 = 2.0.28-1.30.amzn1
You could try using --skip-broken to work around the problem
You could try running: rpm -Va --nofiles --nodigest
I found a 2.0.28 version for fedora core? Should I try that?
Thank you,

Hi All:
Outside of the RPM package that I was using, for some reason I was trying
yum install gpgsm.
I used
yum install gnupg2-smime
and it found the correct pkg.
I just needed to use the correct command.
Thank you,
