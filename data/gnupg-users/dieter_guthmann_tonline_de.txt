@_subject: geam-install failed (implicit declaration of 'strlen') 
I've tried to install Geam on a LFS (Linux from Scratch) 5.1, but I've
- after "./configure" and "make" two (IMHO) very strange errors
- I tried to include  in xmalloc.c which allowed me to build
the Package without error-messages, but "make check" failed here:
Where is my fault?
Thanks in advance.
