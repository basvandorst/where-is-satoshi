Do you have a source for that? I'd love to see some video or so :)

Jose Simoes:
You (and others) might be interested in the Tails OpenPGP Applet:
Tails is The Amnesic Incognito Live System, a hardened Live System with Tor.
I'm not sure, but I think that there are plans to include that into Debian.

p.h.delgado at xoxy.net:
If the addressees aren't bored with that, you could add the
`--throw-keyids' option. For enigmail this would be the
`extensions.enigmail.agentAdditionalParam' key.
This would remove the key IDs from the message. On the other hand, the
receivers will be asked for a passphrase until a matching key (one that
can decrypt the message) is found, for every key they have.

@_subject: keysigning: lsign and offline master key 
I have an offline master key with C/S capabilities and two subkeys (E, S).
When (publicly) signing keys, usually I load my air gapped system with
the master key, sign each individual UID of the key to sign, and export
the signatures. Then send the signatures encrypted to the UID.
How would the procedure look like for an lsign?
- load system with master key
- lsign the key/UIDs
- ...here I'm stuck, because (as I understand the lsign) I cannot export
the signature...
Is this right?
How can I lsign a key and transfer the local signature from my air
gapped system?
Maybe by copying the keyring files between the systems?
Thanks in advance,

Thanks! That's exactly what I was looking for.

Hi Uwe,
Johannes Zarl:
and in addition: if you fear (or know) that your secret key was copied
from your system, revoke it!
To me, this is a very important feature of OpenPGP: _you_ can actually
do something to reduce (not more, but also not less!) harm for yourself
and others.
And, you can be prepared for such an event (i.e. having created the
revocation certificates in advance, stored them in a save but accessible
place, printed out on paper,...).

@_subject: MUA "automatically signs keys"? 
Gregor Zattler:
maybe you already discussed that, but what about sending someone an
encrypted email (with the challenge) and wait for an encrypted reply
with the signed challenge? (as you seem to talk only about sending a
clear text challenge)
Personally, I don't want such behaviour. When I'm making a
certification, then it's me doing it manually as I have the
responsibility. I don't want some program to be able to make automatized
certifications with my key.
Here's a quote from an email on a very similar topic:
Two replies later in the thread there was Stan Tobias
 who clarified:
I like the term "vouch" here, because it highlights the responsibility
in the Web of Trust of the person doing the certification.

Peter Lebbing:
hmm.. what about just using cryptsetup/LUKS with passphrase and key file
(on a real file, not a block device)?
of course that's then without GnuPG..
