I FIGURED IT OUT!!! Thanks to everyone who helped!!! If you check out my
site (using the link below) please keep in mind that I have not uploaded
yet and the finished results won't be displayed for some time yet...I
need to get my act together and complete my website first.
And nope, don't mind if you check it out at all. Keep in mind that the
material is copyrighted, trademarked, all that lovely stuff, by either
myself or the "Amazon Herb Company", despite the fact that I haven't
gotten to actually making the correct "TM" and "C" signs.
Oh, and PLEASE keep in mind that it is a VERY rough representation of
what the actual site is supposed to look like. Banners are the wrong
size/out of place, etc., but I am happy with any feedback anyone wants to
give. Hopefully within a month the site will actually be completed- the
website is  Hope you enjoy what's there!

@_subject: Newbie here- how do I use this thing? 
Hi- my name is Sean and I have no technical expertise whatsoever.
I have built computers and taken networking classes and I have basic
computer skills, but I don't know anything about internet security.
Basically I have a website with a form on it, and that form is going to
send personal information to me via e-mail (ie. credit cards).
Unfortunately I cannot use a third party processor to deal with the
credit careds because I am working as part of a larger company and must
run orders through them. I have been told that I can use GnuPG to encrypt
the results of this form when they are sent as an e-mail to me and that
then I can de-encrypt it myself...but after downloading the program I
have no idea how to use it.
        Can anyone tell me what I need to do to get this to work? My
website is for a good cause...proceeds go to help buy back the Amazon
Rainforest to prevent deforestation! Thanks for any help you can give in
        ~Sean

What's SSH, what's telnet, and how can I find out whether or not I have
that kind of access to the server? =)
