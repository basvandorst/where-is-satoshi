As far as I can tell from reading docs and FAQs[1] DSA (as it appears in
GnuPG) is the same as DSS under PGP (as it appears in PGP 5/6), yes? IOW, in all the reading I've done it's implicit/tacit that GnuPG will
inter-operate with PGP, with the exception of RSA! So, I take that to
mean that GnuPG's -- Pubkey: ELG-E, DSA, ELG -- DSA and ElGamal default
key pair option is therefore synonymous with PGP's DSS. Straighten me out, please.    $ gpg --version

-snip GnuPG/PGP can exchange DSA/DSS messages?-
(Thanks to Werner and yourself I have a better understanding of things
now. Much gratitude! I need to explicitly clarify, though.)
So, if PGP does DSA-SHA1 (but, calls it DSS - fine), and GnuPG does the
same (it's the default --gen-key option afterall), therefore both can fully
inter-operate in this pubkey format? Ditto ELG-E/DH?
   		GnuPG		PGP
   		-----		---
(DSA/DSS)SHA1	  Y		 Y
ELG-E/DH	  Y		 Y
ELG		  Y		 N
RSA		  N*		 Y
IDEA		  N*		 Y
* It is Y(es) if the module/patch available is applied. I am already aware that GnuPG can do RSA (although can it also generate
RSA keys after patching?), but rather I was more wondering how firm was the
inter-operation of the newer pubkey/signkey formats between the two
applications? Thus, it appears to me at this point that if I use the default GnuPG
--gen-key option (DSA + ELG-E w/SHA1) I will be just fine communicating
with PGP 5/6 users.    John

You know a GnuPG FAQ should follow the PGP way of highlighting their
cipher/pubkeys like so:
   DSS/DH : DSA/ELG-E *hehehe*
[But seriously]
If this exact kind of information is in a FAQ, either GnuPG or PGP (pgpi.org
was a place I also looked for this kind of information), I plum missed
it. In another reply I'm sending now there is a little diagram that
should also be listed in a FAQ somewhere, or something like it. Assuming
that my understanding is correct.    John

It was just common usage; no need to elaborate. =)
This is news to me; I wasn't aware that there were different versions of
RSA keys. What version was used in the PGP 2.x series, out of curiosity?
What's new in RSA v.4?
Ah! Thanks again, I would've had to debug that otherwise. Enjoy the weekend out west, Len.    John

-snip 'gpg -?' does not show --no-secmem-warning-
Under a RHL gpg 1.0.1 install I see the same thing as you, Subba.
Note, the docs are works in progress as the gnupg.org sites clearly and
repeatedly mentions. Follow either option and clear the insecure memory I just took advantage of Peter's advice (thanks, Peter!) and cured that
symptom on my system, which I'd been procrastinating on. One question
though, from the man page:
  BUGS
       On many  systems  this  program  should  be  installed  as
       setuid(root).  This  is  necessary  to  lock memory pages.
       Locking memory pages prevents the  operating  system  from
       writing  memory  pages to disk. If you get no warning mes­
       sage about insecure memory your operating system  supports
       locking  without being root. The program drops root privi­
       leges as soon as locked memory is allocated.
Does the last sentence mean, 'setting SUID root' security concerns are
ameliorated as "... locked memory is allocated"?

Yes, thank you, now I got them. You're cooler than the average ML about
such forethought. One nit, Mailman is set with an overly aggressive
headers-trim setting at the moment. Every MIME-GnuPG signed posting on
the archive is mangled as a consequence of the MIME information's
absence. Including your postings, Werner. They look like this:

   Hello again!
   Some folks asked me to sign important announcements like a move of a
   mailing list.  To stop any complaints, here is it again:
   The GnuPG mailing lists have moved to a new server and are now
   handeld by Mailman.  You will find instructions on how to access the
   Web based interface at the bottom of each mail and the DNS should
   have catched up by today.
   The new server is the same as the one which runs  so
   if you are interesed you can compare the IP addresses.  By looking
   at the 'Received:' lines you will notice that you are posting to a
   box called porta.u64.de (named after Giovanni Battista Porta
   (1535-1615) and a typedef used in gpg) which does some spam checking
   and then forwarding it to the ML server.
   So, when I don't forget to hit the sign key, we can check whether
   Mailman handles rfc2015 signatures correct.
