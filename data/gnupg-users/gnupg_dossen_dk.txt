@_subject: How do I check a copy of my public key? 
You could use the webinterface that most keyservers have. If the
webinterface of the keyserver returns your key with the right
signatures, uids, and so on, then it would seem to have been uploaded
correctly. This extends trivially to other keyservers (just check that
they are supposed to know your key, I'm never really sure which server
synchronise).

His key is available, he's just using a subkey to sign with. The key
has ID 0xF53BA904

Well, first of all, the point of the UID is that other people sign it.
They can only sign stuff that does not change (or rather changing it
makes the signature invalid), and second if I read RFC 2440/5.11
correctly there is no comment field, only a variable length string
(that GPG constructs from three standard components).

@_subject: Output file to specific directory? 
I might be wrong, but how about doing something like:
  Find the current directory.
  Find absolute path of file.
  Cd to output directory.
  Invoke gpg command on file with absolute path.
  Cd to previous directory.
Would that work?

Just adding a data-point: This is also in use for government<->citizen
communication in Denmark (e.g. I used it to file my tax 'papers'), and
it works pretty good.

gpg --keyring /path/to/your/key --trust-model always -ear somekey
I find that, when using cron, it pays to be explicit.

@_subject: incrementel asymetric encryption? 
How about writing a small script to do it. Just have the script prompt
for the password and feed it to each gpg-instance via the
--passphrase-fd option. Not as safe as letting gpg prompt for it, but
it should be doable without resorting to having the password in a file.

Is this only for signatures, or will there also be a method to put
this notation in a key, or would that be useless?
