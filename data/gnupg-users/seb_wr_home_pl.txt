@_subject: tar, gzip etc. in Windows [was: Re: Encrypt a whole directory in a single pass] 
Hi All,
I installed Cygwin from Red Hat on my Windows machine
and got bash + other shells and loads of unix utilities
re-compiled for Win, including tar, gzip and bzip2.
They have no file name limitations and work excellent!
I also copied some exe files I needed plus appropriate
DLL libs to another Win installation in order to use
them as a 'raw' environment for simple operations on
files like archiving, generating MD5 sums, copying,
splitting, etc. They work fast & nice from the DOS command
line.The files I generate are handled without problems in
various unices.
Try this if you need more flexibility in Windows.
BTW, has anyone tried compiling gnupg under Cygwin?
I can't try this at the moment.

Hi All,
There's that funny Evidence Eliminator, i.e. the way they advertise
themselves on their website and the price (ugh!) are funny (or even
annoying). It's an efficient wiper of many sorts of data for _all_
Windows systems, but eats some memory unless you throw all unnecessary
options away (like sitting in the system tray all the time). I wish I'd
be able to write a long DOS batch file doing the same thing :( I believe all this is possible without paying 150 USD....
IMO it's scary how much you have to wipe in Windows to get rid of all
sensitive (or just unneeded) data.

Thanks for this great info.
I've been using Eraser for a while but used EE (the bad one ;-)
since I couldn't find a way to wipe registry stuff.
Yes, they are great, I'm now using contig and pagedefrag, great apps,
no need to buy norton or similar software.
Many thanks, you've just helped me a lot on my way to reduce the
cost of using Windows!
