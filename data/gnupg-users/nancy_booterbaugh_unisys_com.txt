@_subject: GnuPG on Windows 2000 
I'm new to this group, and this is my first posting, so please be gentle
with me.
I am using PGP 6.5, but am looking into cheaper alternatives now that the
simple PGP that I have been using (command-line, simple encrypt/decrypt with
public/private keys, one user) has suddenly been quoted to me for $75K for a
renewal license.  I have just updated to a W2K system.  Is a working
(bug-free) GnuPG available for W2K?  Is there a binary that I can download?
Any hints on how to do that?  What, if anything, do I need to buy?  Thanks for all your help.

Thanks.  But on the  page, the binary is
only listed for Win 95, Win98 and NT, not Win 2000.  And in the archives of
this group, I found some reference to many bugs found running the 1.0.6
version of GnuPG on windows 2000.  Does anyone have any experience with this
product on W2K?
Thanks for your help.

the win32 binary should work well with W2K. You can get it here
->  or download it together with
a free graphical frontend at ->  -- but in any case
visit  for more documentation.
Good luck,

Thank you!!  I'm on a W2K system (Gasp!) and don't have access to Gnu stuff.

@_subject: Converting from PGP 
I'm converting from PGP to GPG and am having some trouble getting the
command-line put together in the correct order for it to work.  The PGP
command I am using to Decrypt and Encrypt are the following:
To Decrypt:
pgp.exe %1\%2 +BATCHMODE +FORCE +VERBOSE=0 -z "passphrase" >>%logfile% 2>&1
%1/%2 is the path & filename of the file to decrypt
To Encrypt:
pgp.exe -esw %1\%2 %3 +ENCRYPTTOSELF=ON +BATCHMODE +FORCE +VERBOSE=0 -z
"passphrase" >>%logfile% 2>&1
%1/%2 is the path & filename of the file to encrypt, and %3 is the recipient
Can someone help me by telling me how to put together a gpg command to do
the same things?  I seem to have trouble using multiple commands that
require arguments.
Thanks loads!

@_subject: Password as an option 
Can someone tell me how to use the passphrase-fd option on Windows 2000?  I
am trying to convert from PGP to GPG, and I need the syntax in GPG to do the
pgp.exe "C:\filename.pgp" +BATCHMODE +FORCE +VERBOSE=0 -z "passphrase"
How do I set up a file descriptor from my file name within a bat file?

Nope.  Please look into using the passphrase-fd option.

Thanks!  I guess I was looking for a way to feed passphrase a file name.
The echo does work.

The information you seek is in the gpg.man documentation file tha tcomes
with GnuPG:
echo passphrase|gpg --batch --yes --passphrase-fd 0 --symmetric FILENAME

I am converting from PGP to gpg on Windows 2000, and have run into a little
snag.  I am encrypting a file with the following command:
gpg --recipient TBG -se testfile.txt  1>testfile.txt.gpg
I expected the encrypted file to be named testfile.txt.gpg, but the
resulting file was empty.  When I looked in the directory, I saw that a
second file was created and named testfile.gpg - and that file, in fact, was
the encrypted output!  When I looked in encryptGPG020118.log, I saw the
gpg: using secondary key 870318E1 instead of primary key D6E9F5DB
gpg: This key probably belongs to the owner
gpg: writing to `testfile.gpg'
gpg: ELG-E/CAST5 encrypted for: 9AE18FE8 TBG-EDI gpg: DSA signature From: webmethods (D6E9F5DB AIT Unisys)
Return code=0
Both my AIT Unisys key pair and the TBG-EDI public key are originally from
PGP.  My questions:
1) How do I make the keys the "primary key"?  Or does it matter?
2) What does "gpg: This key probably belongs to the owner" mean?
3) Why is the encrypted output going to testfile.gpg instead of

Thanks to all for your help!
I tried --output, and it does work (even though I am on a Windows =
Hash: SHA1
Actually the "secondary key" has to be used because if you use a DSS=20
(resp. DSA/ElGamal) key for encryption then the "primary key" can't be=20
used (or shouldn't be used) for encryption because it's a DSA key. The=20
"secondary key" is an ElGamal key and this one is used for encryption.
Either use
gpg --recipient TBG -se testfile.txt  -o testfile.txt.gpg=20
as Steve suggested or use
gpg --recipient TBG -se testfile.txt.gpg=20

I'm using it on W2K, and haven't had any problems with it.  Even the
--output works

Does the w32 binary work on Windows 2000 too?
