@_subject: storing gpg keys on a database 
If I understand you correctly, you want to build a database with a table like this:
mailaddress VARCHAR(100) PRIMARY KEY,
pubkey BLOB NOT NULL
Is that correct?
If so, it shouldn't be that hard to do - just run a cronjob every now and then which fetches exactly those values and inserts them into the database (if you were to use a bash script or something, chances are you have to ascii armor it).
By the way, what exactly would your application do that gpg --export  does not?
