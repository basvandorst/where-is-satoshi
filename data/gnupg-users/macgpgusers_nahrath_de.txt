He should check his ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf file (or ~/.gnupg/options if he is
running an older version of GPG) for the entries

default-recipient $MY_KEY_ID
Usually you _want_ to be able to decrypt messages you encypted to someone
else's key yourself.
To prevent this you may try the option '--no-default-recipient' on the
command-line or uncomment the lines in the config file.
Probably it was encypted only once, but for the two keys.
I guess, the --default-recipient-self may be a default option in your GPG
installation. So I don't see any mistakes on your side.
