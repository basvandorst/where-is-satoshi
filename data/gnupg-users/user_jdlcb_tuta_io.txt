@_subject: "clipboard contains no valid encryption data" 
A while back I installed gpa (GnuPrivacyAssistant) in the Linux container on my Chromebook. Getting it up and running was straight forward.
Recently I found it necessary to powerwash the same Chromebook and upon reinstalling gpa and importing my keys found that when I tried to decrypt I received an error message saying that ?clipboard contains no valid encryption data?.
I?ve found 5 year old Reddit posts that site the same issue but not concrete suggestions to alleviate the issue.
As well, a search on duckduckgo hasn?t turned up anything.
Anybody have any suggestions???
Thanks in advance.
