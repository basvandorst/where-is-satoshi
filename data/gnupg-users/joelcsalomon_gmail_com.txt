@_subject: WinPT & Enigmail don't show the same keys 
I was under the impression that GnuPG kept track of everything, but I
noticed that Windows Privacy Tray and Enigmail do not always show the
same keys.
Both are accessing the correct version of GPG (C:\Program
Files\GNU\GnuPG\gpg.exe), and at least WinPT knows where the GnuPG
keyrings are (C:\Users\chesky\AppData\Roaming\gnupg).
Can someone explain to me what?s going on with my system?

Actually, I was noticing that WinPT was not showing keys that Enigmail

Is a build of GnuPG more recent that 1.4.9 available for Windows?

@_subject: "Signature verification failed" 
I?m using Thunderbird 2.0.0.21 + Enigmail 0.95.7 (20080808) with GnuPG
1.4.9 under Windows.  On some messages (e.g., this recent one from
Thomas Bohn: ) I get
the message, ?Error - signature verification failed; click Pen icon for
details?.  The error message from GnuPG is:
OpenPGP Security Info
Error - signature verification failed
gpg command line and output:
C:\\Program Files\\GNU\\GnuPG\\gpg.exe --charset utf8  --batch --no-tty
--status-fd 2 --keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve --keyserver
pool.sks-keyservers.net --verify
gpg: Signature made 06/19/09 23:53:14 using DSA key ID 69274BBB
gpg: BAD signature from "Thomas BOHN "
Where does this problem come from?

Hmm and double hmm.  Is there someone else using Thunderbird+Enigmail
that can duplicate the error message?

Interesting, now it comes up as good.  Did you change some setting?

D?oh!  I was so focused on the original error message I didn?t notice
that he was reporting a normal condition.  Thanks for catching that.

@_subject: How to 'un-sign' a key? 
I foolishly signed a key I had not verified well, and the signed version
is on a keyserver.  How can I unsign it?
I have tried the following (changing the key ID to 0xDEADBEEF):
That?s not all that?s supposed to happen, is it?

I tried the command again; not sure why I got a different result:
Okay, now what do I do?

@_subject: published key security levels 
How about this? (I?ll reduce the security levels to two for my
suggestion, but it should scale.):
I generate two keys, one low-security (e.g., ?Joel Salomon webmail?) and
one high-security (?Joel Salomon smartcard?).  I sign the low-security
key with my high security key, but I don?t ask others to sign it; the
only key I put into the web of trust is my high-security key.
If the low-security key is compromised, can the attacker rename it (or
otherwise fool people into thinking it?s my high-security key) without
removing my (high-security) signature on the key?
