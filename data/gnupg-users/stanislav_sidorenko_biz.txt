Cards do not used to verify signatures. In my case GPG checks a signature generated by card and fails because signature is invalid.
But it seems I've already found the issue, it is not in gpg-agent, but in gpg file cardglue.c, lines 1324-1328:
          init_membuf (&data, 1024);
          snprintf (line, DIM(line)-1, "SCD PKSIGN %s%s",
                    hashalgo == GCRY_MD_RMD160? "--hash=rmd160 ": "",
                    serialno);
          line[DIM(line)-1] = 0;
hashalgo is an int variable that contains hash id. As far as I understood this code generates a request to scdaemon and forces using RIPEMD160 if hashalgo == GCRY_MD_RMD160 or default hash (SHA1?) if hashalgo equals to any other value. I've made a quick&dirty fix that enables using SHA256 instead of RIPEMD160.
                    hashalgo == GCRY_MD_SHA256? "--hash=sha256 ": "",
Using my custom build I've successfully signed a message using SHA256. It is not a problem to add all other hashes but I'm not sure about the impact of such patch because I've just quickly checked the code :)

I've tried to use SHA256 digest for signing using openpgp V2 smartcard and got the following error:
gpg: checking created signature failed: bad signature
gpg: signing failed: bad signature
gpg: signing failed: bad signature
It happens only if gpg uses gpg-agent which is configured to use scdaemon for accesing smartcards.
If I disable gpg-agent usage (--no-use-agent switch) and enter card PIN code in the console then signing with SHA256 work perfectly. In case of enabled gpg-agent only SHA1 and RIPEMD160 can be used. It looks like an issue in gpg-
agent or scdaemon.
The issue was found on gpg 1.4.10 and gpg-agent 2.0.14.
