I was able to reproduce your problem, so I tried to import the key with pgp 6.5.8 (available from  ) which worked perfectly. I then exported the key from there to get a file which gpg imported without complaint. wierd. Anyway here is what I get when I have gpg export it yet

It looks as if you are using a DSA key which can only generate signatures. I suspect that, if you were to generate an ElGamal sub-key, this would solve your problem.
Best of luck
