The only justification for this sentiment popular among old-timers boils
down to "it's always been this way around here."  I suppose they expect
Germans to write scho"n instead of schön and live with it forever.

Long time Eudora user here, bought and registered version 3.0.
About ready to move everything to Mozilla Mail which, when coupled with
enigmail, handles signatures just beautifully.
Can't sing the praises of enigmail at a loud enough volume.  Truly
excellent, and identical on Linux and Windows.
But there's nothing wrong with Eudora's handling of the signature files;
they show as attachments in every mailer I know of.

Hash: SHA1
If you always encrypt to the same recipient you can add a
default-recipient line in your gnupg.conf file and your batch file
reduces to:
 off
if "%1" == "" goto syntax
type %1 | gpg -ea > %1.gpg
goto done
echo syntax: enc filename
echo writes filename.gpg
If you don't have a default recipient it will prompt you on stderr and
the batch file still works.

Unless you happened to connect to a keyserver that never gets updated,
which is unlikely, the only way to get the guy to update his key is to
write him and remind him his key has expired.

NOT tongue in cheek: if you have letter-frequency tables as short as
four letters long and set a random-generator based on those tables, you
can often recognize the writer in the generated text, by his writing
style.  With six letters it's very robust but even with four you get
Faulkner-like text from Faulkner letter frequency table.

How I usually do it:

the -r in the parameters list means "recipent" and it's the email

If you often send to the same recipient (e.g. yourself) you can create a

Hash: SHA1
I've used Eudora in Windows for at least six years and since I tried
MozMail with Enigmail I'm seriously thinking of switching.  The PGP
integration is superb and coexists with certificate security, it's the
only MUA I've used that was able to get through the proxy servers at
work and connect me to my ISP (without having to use a klunky web
interface), and it's the same on both the platforms I use regularly.
Exactly the same, down to the eternally boggling Ctrl-M for new message.
As for Outlook, the 2003 version is probably the slickest interface out
there but you really need to be running under Exchange server to see all
its virtuosities.  And in Outlook I find the PGP current-window hotkey
functionality to be only one step removed from full integration.

Yes.  In your PGPkeys application, select the keys you want to export
and on the Keys menu select "Export."  Be sure the check "include
private keys."  This file is importable by gpg, it will make its own
copy is its own file format.
You'll have to keep them in sync by hand, I think, I'm sure someone
somewhere has come up with a way to do it automatically.

You should very rarely generate a new keypair.  As for the security of
your keyrings, that pretty much depends on the security of your
passphrase; we have to be able to move keyrings from machine to machine
otherwise we're only identifying machines, not ourselves.
When I first got into PGP I went hog wild and created keypairs for every
email address.  I came to regret it.
