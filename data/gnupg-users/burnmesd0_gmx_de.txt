@_subject: How to delete a uid from a secret key? 
I have a UID in my secret key, which actually is the name and email of a friend of mine. So it has to be removed from there. But when I say "deluid", GnuPG tells me to toggle. But the UID is not in my public key, it is in my secret key! How can I remove this UID?
Thanks for your help in advance
