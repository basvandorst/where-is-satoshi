@_subject: Best practices for multiple e-mail addresses 
I have three distinct e-mail addresses: work, home, and another business. What's the best practice for keeping a key for each address? One key with multiple addresses in it (i.e. a key for me as a person)? A separate key for each address (i.e. a key for each of work/home/business as a unit)?
How do others do it?

@_subject: Windows multi-user installation? 
Is there a way to install GnuPG in a Windows multi-user environment? By default, GPG just stores the keyrings in its installation folder. I want to install it into C:\Program Files\GnuPG and have it store its keyrings and such in C:\Documents and Settings\\Application Data\GnuPG or something like it.
Anyone tried this?
