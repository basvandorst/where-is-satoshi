@_subject: Errors compiling 1.2.4 on OpenBSD 3.4 
i have problems compiling gnupg-1.2.4 on OpenBSD 3.4. It's a fresh
install. The error appears with make and gmake:
_mpih-mul1.s: Assembler messages:
_mpih-mul1.s:114: Error: Alignment not a power of 2
_mpih-mul1.s:132: Error: Alignment not a power of 2
gmake[2]: *** [mpih-mul1.o] Error 1
gmake[2]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/gnupg-1.2.4/mpi'
gmake[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
gmake[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/gnupg-1.2.4'
gmake: *** [all] Error 2
I also attached the output of ./configure as a .txt file
Any ideas?

No, i have all the public keys, they are retrieved automatically. The
gpg output is saying that the signature is good, but mutt don't mark the
mails with an "s" for signed, and tells me that the signature could not
be verified (which is not true, due to the good gpg output). So it seems
that my mutt configuration has problems only with mails from this list.
Yes, but don't worry, your sigs are okay. Try to send me a PM. I think
everything is okay then ...
I'm just going to ask the mutt guys :-)
