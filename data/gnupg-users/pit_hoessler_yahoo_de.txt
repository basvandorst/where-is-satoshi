@_subject: Can't Encrypt in Freebsd 10.1 
Hi Antoine,
please try it as a normal user, not as root.
Normaly the key-ring-file depends to a real user and not to root, who isn't a normal user.
May be it will help you.

gpg -e -r NAME test.txt
where NAME is the user id of the recipient's key.
If you want to encrypt for uid NAME and explicitly hide a given recipient's
keyID when sending the message you may use the -R option.
Well, that's what the man page tells us, IIUC.
