@_subject: Best way to get fingerprint programatically 
This was really interesting. Thanks for that tip (all of you). :)
Updated a key the other day, in a more manual way.
What about updating sub-keys?
$ gpg --with-colons -k 0xlongid | awk -F: '$1=="fpr" {print $10}'
Any convenient way to automate that, or can I just loop it? ?something like:
$ for k in $(gpg --with-colons -k 0xlongid | awk -F: '$1=="fpr" {print $10}'); do \
 ? Eric
