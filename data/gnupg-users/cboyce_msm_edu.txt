@_subject: MPI too large 
When decrypting a file I get the following error message.   I saw
previous posts but was unable to find what the resolution
gpg: mpi too large for this implementation (55559 bits)
Command line
Echo passpharase| gpg --passphrase-fd 0  -u xx  --batch --openpgp
-o "position.txt" --decrypt "position.txt.pgp"
Microsoft Windows 2000 [Version 5.00.2195]
gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.2.2
Any help would be appreciated.
