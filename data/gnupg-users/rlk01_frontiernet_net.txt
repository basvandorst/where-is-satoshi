@_subject: "No path leading to one of our keys found" 
I'm receiving an error msg I don't know how to correct.  Here's the
typical session:
Good signature from < Sender >
Could not find a valid trust path to the key.  Let's see whether we can
assign some missing owner trust values.
No Path leading to one of our keys found.
WARNING:  this key is not certified with a trusted signature
Anyhow, the decryption takes place ok, but I get these messages.  I
think the WARNING is because I haven't assigned a level of trust to the
particular key owner's public key, but the two references to "path"
problems I cannot correct.
Can someone help?

Unless I missed something somewhere, TkPGP isn't offered in either a zip
format (for Windows) or as an executable (*.exe)
If you know otherwise, please let me know.

@_subject: Three basic questions 
I did check the Faq and other documents before fielding these
1.  As I use Netscape for 100% of my e-mail, is it normal to send the
encrypted file as an attachment?
2.. I would like to put my signature at the bottom of my e-mails so that
others can obtain my public key and send encrypted mail if they so
choose.   What is the normal information people should display at the
bootom of an e-mail message?
3.  Is there a GUI somewhere that simplifies the process of encryption,
decryption and verification for use with GnuPG?
4.  Finally, all our computers at work run Windows 95/98, and I wondered
if it's possible to put all necessary files on it so that I may retrive
an encypted e-mail without installing anything permanently on the
company computer?

@_subject: Saving public key to a file 
I'm having a small problem with syntax.
I'm trying to save my public key to a file called MyKey.pub, so I can
send it to someone.
I execute this line "gpg --export --armor MyUserID MyKey.pub" and I get
a "File not found" message, and it prints to the screen.
One last question, I hope...
When I finally do get this right, and send this file to a friend, will
it automatically contain a fingerprint?
I've read and reread the Handbook, but I'm still having trouble, sorry.

@_subject: Adding signed mail in netscape 
============================== START ==============================
I received an e-mail yesterday in Netscape (Linux) that had a special
tag attached that indicated it was not encrypted, but was digitally
signed, similar to the gnupg fingerprint.   On opening the security
pane, I see that Netscape uses it's own flavor of crypt algorithim, but
does allow you to use others, like PGP or Gnupg.   Has anyone used this
feature before in Netscape where they have added, and use regularly,
Gnupg to sign their Netscape e-mail?
If you have, could you explain the install procedure?
