@_subject: GPG and 1024-bit (or multiple) subkeys 
New to list; first post.
We send member companies our 1024 bit public key with its 1024-bit
subkey to encrypt their A/R files before they're FTP'd to us.  A new
customer is requesting we generate a new key for them that has a 2048
sub key, claiming GPG requires this by default.  So I added another
subkey, 2048-bit, but the customer says GPG is looking for a 2048
subkey *by itself*.  Does that make sense?  Doesn't GPG have an easy
programmatic way to specify a subkey and/or bit size?

"By itself" meaning a key without any other subkey.  They want us to
generate a new public key with only one subkey, and that at 2048-bit
instead of 1024.  I suppose we could also make a copy of our existing
public key, then delete the 1024-bit subkey (keeping the 2048-bit
subkey we recently added), but I'm hoping there's a command line
argument/flag for GPG to encrypt a file using a public key with two
subkeys, specifying the 2048-bit subkey and ignoring the 1024-bit
