@_subject: why gpg use SHA1 instead of pref??? 
Its question of why gpg use SHA1 hash encryption of message. For testing I send
message to self and pgpdump will show RIPEMD160 in hash of signing, its normal
expectation of my prefs. But for encryption its use of hash SHA1. Here is some

What I must do for using RIPEMD160 hash of encryption??? Its normal because
encryption specifications requirements? Or its error of gpg?
Why he will use RSA encryption as other symmetric ciphers like CAST5, 3DES,
BLOWFISH,, in prefs, and, RSA its not in prefs list?
Sorry of bad enlish.!

i try to answer this few days before it but it was not post on list so now, i
post again.
but, its confusing output of pgpdump. plain text + SHA1 must be encrypt of
symmetric algorithm and after, its session key is encrypt of public key cipher.
im right or wrong? So why, he will use SHA1 in hash of symmetric key. its
expectation to use SHA1 hash with assymetric public key of receiver. or im not
understand you its really SHA1, with symmetric key its part of protocol??
how its possible to know which symmetric algorithm it was used to encrypt
message?  how i must obtain this informtation from pgpdump?
i think, it will be very good if well have some matrix of prefs, which
assymetric and symmetric algorithm he will use in all this cases. thanks David
to help all peoples of gpg list!!
