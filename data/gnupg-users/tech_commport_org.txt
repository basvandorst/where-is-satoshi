@_subject: Clear all signatures on key? 
I'm trying to figure out how to remove all signatures from all my GPG
keys. I've RTFM but I've missed something I'm afraid. Here is what I am
1. Type "gpg --list-keys" and I get a list of my keys. (me is a
fake email address for the sake of this post...)
2. I type gpg --edit-key me
I am now in edit mode
Command> list
(I get my key information)
Command> uid 1
(I then select my key)
Command> Delsig
Nothing deleted.
Command> Minimize
User ID "My Key etc etc":
already clean.
Command> check
uid "My Key etc etc"
1 user ID without valid self-signature detected
Command> quit
3. I type 'gpg --list-sigs" and I get a list of keys thusly:
C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator>gpg --list-sigs
pub   1024D/XXXXXXXX 2005-08-10
uid                  My Key (Email Encryption/Signing Key) sub   4096g/XXXXXXXX 2005-08-10 [expires: 2006-08-10]
sig          XXXXXXXX 2005-08-10  My Key (Email Encryption/Signing Key)
Question: What signature is listed there that is reported from my
--list-sigs command? What have I missed? I would think I have no
signatures installed on my key?
Thanks for the help and info,
