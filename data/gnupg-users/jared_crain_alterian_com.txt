@_subject: GPG on Windows 2003 
Hi, all.  Please CC me on any replies, as I am not subscribed to the list.
I have GPG installed on a Windows 2003 server (32-bit).  Looking in the install folder, it appears that it is GPG version 1.2.2.
I am having an issue when I try to decrypt a file whose decrypted size is greater than 2 GB.  When encrypted, the file is smaller as it is encrypted and compressed.  When I run the decryption, no error is output (output matches for files whose decrypted size is less than 2 GB; files that are decrypted successfully/completely).  If the decrypted size is over 2 GB, the decryption takes place, and a file of exactly 2 GB is created.  I have read elsewhere that GPG can decrypt files of effectively unlimited size.  Here are my questions:
1) I wonder if this is related to the server being a 32-bit windows server (since each application can only address up to 2 GB of memory).  However, it appears that GPG streams the decrypted results out, not holding the result in memory.  Also, when watching the system performance while GPG is decrypting, I do not see a spike in memory usage.  Is there something GPG is doing that might cause it to hit this limit?  If it is GPG hitting some sort of 2 GB limit because of the OS, does anyone know of any work-arounds?
2) Do I need to upgrade to a more recent version of GPG?  I see there is now something called "gpg4win 2.1.0".  When I originally installed GPG on this server, I do not recall that being available.  Is it actually GPG version 2.1.0, or is it GPG version 1.4.11 in gpg4 win version 2.1.0?  And can I install this without wiping out my existing keychains, etc?
Many thanks for any feedback you can provide.

Many apologies!  When I posted my question, I was laboring under some misinformation provided by the file's originator.  The file was apparently inadvertently truncated before being transferred, but we did not know.  When the originator supplied an un-truncated file, it did successfully decrypt to the correct size.
