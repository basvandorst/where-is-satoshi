I exported a key from gpg 1.2.5

Ftped as binary to another system, and tries to add ./gpg --debug --verbose -ka /workarea/ACHgnupg/myfile.gpg

@_subject: Batch gpg encryption : prompt 
I am doing scriptewd/batch gpg encryption , and I am
getting the following repeated prompts: It is NOT certain that the key belongs to the person named
in the user ID.  If you *really* know what you are doing,
you may answer the next question with yes.
Use this key anyway? (y/N) y
How do I eliminate these prompts? This script will be automatically run.

@_subject: signing non default key 
Forgive the newbie question:
I want to sign a key , I use
I enter Commnad > sign
     Yard2004_UCLA
Are you sure that you want to sign this key with your
key "John Yard (aix admin) " (78B3C4BA)
Really sign? (y/N)
This issue is , I need to sign this key with another key ,
How can this be done / what is the syntax for this ?

@_subject: simple gpg syntax question 
Forgive the simple gpg syntax issue,
I have gpg --verbose --trust-model always --yes --armour --recipient XXXXX_UCLA --encrypt $T1 which encrpts a file , I would like to sign it in the same command , I would like the output
to be $T1.asc if I sign it seperately :
gpg -u UCLA_XXXXXX2009 --sign ucla.asc
I will get ucla.asc.gpg as my signed output , I
Need to have $T1.asc as my output.
I am reverse engineering this system, I
have to emulate the behavior of the original.
So how can I gpg -u UCLA_XXXXXX2009 --sign ucla.asc
and have the output be ucla.asc ?

--encrypt $T1
like the output to be $T1.asc
gpg -v --yes --trust-model always -r XXXXX_UCLA -u  -sea $T1
-v, --verbose
-r, --recipient
-u, --local-user-name (may be omitted if default-key specified in gpg.conf)
-s, --sign
-e, --encrypt
-a, --armor
.asc implies armored output. That option was the important missing piece.
The .gpg extension is usually used for binary OpenPGP files.

@_subject: secret key not available 
I exported a key that was needed by a bank
from a pgp 6.5.8 secret keyring and inported into
gpg using -import .
Now when I sign using that key I get
'signing failed: secret key not available'.
In gpg I see the key when I do a gpg -list-keys,
But don't see it when I do a gpg -list-secret-keys.
When I cat the exported key asc block It describes itself
as a public key.
Any clues as to what I need to do. I see this key on my pgp
Public and secret keyrings....
