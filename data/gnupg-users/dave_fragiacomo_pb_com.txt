@_subject: Using passphase-fd from within a batch procedure 
I would like to initiate gpg to decrypt a file (testfile1.gpg) from within
a batch procedure that has been executed with the %1 variable being set to
the passphase.
"gpg --options FEDopt --output Compressed\testfile1.txt --decrypt
How would I get gpg to recognize the %1 variable as being the passphase
rather than gpg interactively requesting the passphase to be entered?
Thanks for your support.

@_subject: Using passphase-fd from within a batch procedure 
Not sure if you received this or not since the mailing list doesn't reflect
the text I replyed with.....
I tried your suggestion but it didn't work.  I received the following
output from the execution of the batch file....
gpg: public key decryption failed: bad passphrase
gpg: encrypted with ELG-E key, ID A5A2229C
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
When I decrypt the file in an interactive mode with the same passphase I
passed to the batch file, it works fine.
There seems to be a method by using the "--passphrase-fd 1" command whereby
it would read the passphrase from a file, but I can't seem to get that to
work either.
Can someone provide the correct syntax to use and what text should be in
the contents of the file containing the passphase?

Taking the space out between the %1 and the pipe, did the trick.  Thanks
for all those who helped out.
