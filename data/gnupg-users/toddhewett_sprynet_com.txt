@_subject: Webscript Problems....Converting from PGP to GPG 
Howdy Folks,
I am trying to get  a perlscript  working using GPG as  opposed to the
PGP50i  it is currently working with.
The PGP Command is...
(/usr/local/bin/pgpe -fatr name +force=1 2>/dev/null) |
The GPG command I thought would work is.
(/usr/bin/gpg -fatr 'name +force=1 2>/dev/null) | /bin/mail -s
'Title of subject line'
 name
The following  command line input sends an email fine.
echo 'check this out' | (gpg -ater 'name 2>/dev/null) |
And this command line sends an empty message
echo 'check this out' | (gpg -fatr 'name 2>/dev/null) |
I am hoping there is something obvious that someone can help me with here.
Thanks For the help,
Todd Hewett
