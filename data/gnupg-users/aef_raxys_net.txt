@_subject: A forgotten patch? 
I recently came to know that Felix von Leitner (Fefe) did a code audit
of GnuPG in 2009. According to him, the patch fixes lots of problems
that might be usable as in attack vectors on GnuPG. It seems however, as
if this patch was never included into upstream GnuPG. Because of that,
he keeps maintaining his patch and offers it freely on his personal
website [1].
Although I don't know him personally, as far I know, Felix von Leitner
is a professional code security auditor and a reputable member of the
Chaos Computer Club. In earlier releases of GnuPG he was even mentioned
for supporting the project [2].
What are the reasons which lead to the patch never being applied?
Is there any archived discussion available about that topic?
Have the problems addressed by the patch been fixed otherwise?

Well thank you for the explanation. Sadly, I think my knowledge about C
is not sufficient to fully judge the situation. Although I have to say,
that the first example sounds a bit like a hack. I just hope you are
right, a lot depends on it.
I think the majority of people work for people they don't necessarily
like that much. I suppose it's related to the unfair distribution of
wealth in our world. Being funded by Facebook isn't the most reputable
thing either.
Is there anything in the patch you would reconsider to accept, if there
was a bug report for the patch? I would gladly write one if that would
help to improve the quality of GnuPG.
Kind regards
