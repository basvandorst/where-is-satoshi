I'm at the gpg.exe application, which file do I clearsign exactly? Do I need
to export my key? I'm a little new at this.

I realize that, but how do I make it so that my files are fit to be
clearsigned? I was given a bunch of information from a website that said
what needed to be clearsigned. How do I put this information into a file
that gpu.exe can read and clearsign?

My instructions just tell me to clearsign the following and then the paste
the results in a box. Here's what i have to clearsign. Keep in mind I'm
using GnuPG for windows. mode     new_user
username XXXXXX
fprint   XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
FUDForum XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Fossil   XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Moin     XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Zine     XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Now what exactly do I do with this?  I put it in a text file and then verify
it with gpg.exe? The same gpg.exe thats in the pub folder? So far everytime
I try to clearsign the .txt file with the info posted above  but it does not

I figured it out, there was a "sign" button on the windows version which was
the clear sign.
