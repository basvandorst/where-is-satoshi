@_subject: gpg with current pgp keys 
looks like the passwd thing is ok.
Maybe the person who encrypted the message used IDEA as symetric key algorithm? IDEA is not a free encryption algorithm and that's why it's not supported in gnupg by default.
You have 2 options:
- Tell the person who wrote the message to use CAST or 3DES as symetric cipher. (Can be switch in PGP preferences)
- Use the gnupg IDEA extensions ( not allowed for commercial use afain )
BTW, is there already a FAQ or HOWTO on implementing this? Would be nice.

@_subject: cant import pgp secret keyring 
Hash: SHA1
As mentioned only several posts before, there is a faq on this.
Have a look at  ->documentation
In short form: remove the passphrase from your secret key in PGP,
export it with PGP, import it with gnupg, set your passphrases back.
Be !very! careful with the exported secret key since its not
protected by anything. Wipe it after the procedure. Don't do this in
an unsafe enviroment.

definetly not. 'load-extension idea' works fine for me.
The problem must lay elsewhere. It's intresting that Gamma Pi does
not seem to get any error messages. If you changed the right option
file, and gpg can't find an extension you specified, you should get a
message like:
'/usr/local/lib/gnupg/rsa : cannot open shared object file: ...blah,
blah ,blah'
So maybe gpg is not reading the 'options' file you think, or there is
something wrong with the load extension line. However this should
give you a message like this:
'gpg: /home/jerome/.gnupg/options:73: invalid option'
unless it begins with ' which would be a pretty trivial error :-)
However shit happens :-)
If this won't help you, I am pretty clueless.
