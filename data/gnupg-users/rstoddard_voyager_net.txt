Hash: SHA256
I received the notice that 2.0 has been released. I'm currently using
GnuPG 1.4.5, which I downloaded as part of the Gnu for Windows
package, and GPGshell for Windows 3.52. Can I upgrade to v2.0 without
abandoning GPGshell? Do I need to uninstall the earlier version if I
don't want to run them side by side or can I just install the newer
version over the older?
I apologize for asking such basic questions, but I'm somewhat new to

@_subject: Signing/encrypting options using GPGShell 
Hash: SHA1
I'm using gpgshell, and it gives me the option of signing or
clear-signing messages. It also contains options for encrypt and
encrypt/sign. When I try to "sign" it, it in fact seems to encrypt it.
Is this "just the way it is" or is there a bug (or operator error)?
Also, is there a way using PGPShell to cache the passphrase for a
certain interval? I'm assuming likely not, but though I'd ask anyway.
