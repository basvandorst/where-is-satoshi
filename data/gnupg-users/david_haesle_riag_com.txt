@_subject: GnuPG Question 
I have just started to look at your freeware gpg.exe for windows
2000 and I have a simple question for you.  I have imported one
public key for my test and when I try to encrypt a file,
the executable prompts me with a "User ID" question.  What am I suppose to put for the UserID?
When I list the keys, I receive the following information:
pub  1024D/F4F614CF 2003-12-16 BSWA SCDOR SALES uid                            SQL_Sqlut
