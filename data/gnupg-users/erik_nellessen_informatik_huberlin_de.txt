@_subject: Perform only asymmetric encryption/decryption 
When I encrypt data using GnuPG, GnuPG uses hybrid encryption. This really is a good idea for most use cases. But in my (I admit, rather special) use case, only using asymmetric encryption/decryption is what I need. Is it possible to use asymmetric encryption only? The interface I would wish to have takes plain data and provides an RSA encrypted cipher text (and vice versa for decryption).
Does GnuPG provide any kind of interface for direct asymmetric encryption/decryption operations? I guess I could try do it similar to the write_pubkey_enc function in the file g10/encrypt.c. But is there an easier/more official way?
What I want to do is certainly possible using OpenSSL. But as I am changing an existing system, a possibility to do this with GnuPG would be the easiest way for me.
Kind regards,
Erik Nellessen

No, this is not about encrypting large amounts of data with asymmetric encryption. ;) It is about encrypting and decrypting small strings, which are still way smaller than the public/private key. So I guess this could be possible using the interfaces for encrypting/decrypting a data encryption key. What is the best way in OpenPGP to encrypt/decrypt small strings using asymmetric encryption/decryption directly?

If I understand it correctly, --override-session-key does not allow me to set the session key before encryption. It allows me to set the session key when decrypting, so I can do it without using the private key. The option is used to reveal the content of messages without revealing the private key.
See: But following this approach, I would need to be able to change the session key before encryption. So I think this does not solve the problem yet. Am I right? Any other ideas?
