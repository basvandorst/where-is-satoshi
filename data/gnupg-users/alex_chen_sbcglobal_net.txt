@_subject: Failed to build gnupg-1.2.4 on Windows with Cygwin and gcc 3.3.1] 
I downloaded gnupg-1.2.4 and tried to build it on Windows under Cygwin.
I did that under the bash shell.  I first ran 'configure', which took quite some time to finish.
Then I ran 'make' from the top directory.  The compilation seemed to went smoothly until
it came to linking.  Then I got the following error messages:
gcc  -g -O2 -Wall   -o mpicalc.exe  mpicalc.o ../cipher/libcipher.a i.a ../util/libutil.a ../intl/libintl.a
../mpi/libmpi.a(mpi-add.o)(.text+0x258): In function `mpi_add':
to `_mpihelp_sub_n'
../mpi/libmpi.a(mpi-add.o)(.text+0x32a): In function `mpi_add':
reference to
pi/mpi-add.c:136: undefined reference to `_mpihelp_sub_n'
The list when on and on.  I suspect somehow the compiler was adding the leading '_' in referencing
the functions.  But I do not know how to change the configuration.
Has anyone encountered similar problem?
Any help is appreciated.

It turns out that I have to turn off the assembly option, i.e. configure
