@_subject: automating decryption with vbscript 
Is there a way to automate gnupg using vbscript? I've been tryng to
figure out how to pass the passphrase via the script. I thought the
command below would work but it still calls the pop up box and asks for
"C:\Program Files\GNU\GnuPG\gpg2.exe" --passphrase "mypassphrase" -o
"C:\Brian\MyEncryptedFile.txt" -d "C:\Brian\MyEncryptedFile.gpg"
We are using gpg4win as the frontend. I can pass along the vbs script I
have been working on if it would help.

@_subject: Can't open PGP file with Gnupg 
I'm having an issue opening a file sent to us. They are using pgp
commend line version 6.5. We are using GnuPG 2.0.12. When we try to open
the file we get the message File contained no openPGdata. Any help you
can provide would be greatly appreciated.

@_subject: file contained no OpenPGPdata 
I asked this last week but I don't think it got answered.
We have a customer using pgp command line version 6.5. The file they are
sending us is giving us the error "file contained no OpenPGData" We are
using  GnuPG 2.0.12, GPA 0.9.0.  We have not been able to resolve the
issue. We are not having any issues with our other customers but are
uncertain if anyone else is using the same pgp version. Any help would
be greatly appreciated.

Thanks Charly for the quick response. We are a windows user. I'll need
to verify the exact version of pgp they are using. I won't be able to
see if that works until tomorrow but hopefully it does.

GnuPG requires Unix line endings.
Maybe, just maybe the file that was created by 6.5 command line (would
that be PGP Command line 6.5.8?) is not Unix line ended.
You might want to try and convert that file from his current format to
Unix line-endings, using a text editor. As a Macintosh user, I would
avail myself of BBEdit. I guess that you are a Windows user, I don't
know which editor would be available.
Just a thought.

I should be able to send you a test file tomorrow. We will try adding
that flag as well.

I'm happy to take a look at a file to see what exactly is wrong if
you're willing/able to send me one.  I'd need the key to decrypt it, so
either encrypt the test message to my key (99242560), or make a new key
for the purpose.
Most likely the problem you are having is that PGP version 6.5 is beyond
antique at this point.  You might try adding the "--pgp6" flag to your
gpg invocation, which enables some workarounds for various PGP 6-isms,
but basically the problem is that PGP 6.5 predates the standard that
GnuPG follows.

Thanks, I'm correct in that GNUPG is not compatible with IDEA but is
with casts and 3DES?

How is the pgp user encrypting this?
If it's with symmetric encryption, then pgp6.5.8 uses IDEA by (In order for the pgp user to change this default behavior, the user needs to use the following command:
pgp +ciphernum=1 -ce filename  (this uses CAST5)
pgp +ciphernum=2 -ce filename  (this uses 3DES)
pgp6.5.8 can use only the 3 cipher algos: IDEA, CAST5, or 3DES,  nothing else.
If they are encrypting to your key, then how did you generate this key in gnupg?
You would have needed to use the gnupg option of --pgp6 or pgp6.5.8 will be unable to use that key.
It might be advisable to download a free commandline version of 6.5.8 (available here:   )
and set up a test system, and see if you can communicate with it using gnupg, and then tell the pgp6.5.8 client what additional commandline entries the client needs to use.

Thanks all that helped on this. As it turned out it was the transfer
process that was messing the key up as it passed through some extra
server security.
