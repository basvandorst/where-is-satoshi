@_subject: GnuPG - where is the .exe file??? 
I am trying to set up secure email encryption using Thunderbird, Enigmail
and GnuPG.
I have everything in place bar GnuPG.
I downloaded it and extracted it.
I then have to add the GnuPG executable path in Enigmail so that they work
My problem is finding GnuPG.exe. It doesn't seem to be in my GnuPG folder.
Any ideas where I am going wrong? View this message in context: Sent from the GnuPG - User forum at Nabble.com.
