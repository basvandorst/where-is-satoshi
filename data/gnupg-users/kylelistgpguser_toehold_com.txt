One thing I've wanted once in a while, that PGP/MIME doesn't deliver, is
signatures that I can separate from the email.  The signature on a PGP/MIME
message is over the whole MIME part, MIME headers and all.  If I want to
save just an attachment (or just the text part) and retain the signature, I
can't, because the signature is over the whole message.
It's not really a big deal, of course.  Once I see I have a valid file from
someone, I can sign the file myself to verify later.  Still, I look at
PGP/MIME signatures as something of a waste because they're signing stuff
that's tangential to the "real" signed data.
I used Pine before Mutt.  I recall the transition being easy, but that was
a long time ago.  Things change, and memory fades.  My Mutt config still
has some keys bound to their Pine meanings.
I'd be interested in seeing your config for these things.  It sounds like
the kind of stuff I've wanted to do but hadn't figured out how.

I VOTE FOR GREAT RUNES.  OF COURSE, WE'LL HAVE TO MAKE A PATCH SO THAT
ASCII ARMOR CAN FIT IN THIS CHARACTER SET.  IT'LL PROBABLY COME OUT TWICE
AS LONG, BUT IT'S A SMALL PRICE TO PAY FOR INTEROPERABILITY WITH MORSE

I had a similar situation some time ago.  You may be interested to read it
