Hi Every,
While I waiting for reply on this problem, I found some one else has the
problem posted to the list but there is no followup.
But anyway I try to apply Windows 2000 SP3 to my machine, and the problem is
My OS is Windows 2000 professional version, and the service I download the
service pack.
