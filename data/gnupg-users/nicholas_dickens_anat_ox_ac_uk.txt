@_subject: Same private key on multiple sites 
If you are using linux (or similar) just copy the .gnupg/secring file onto
the other machine. But only at first setup, otherwise you will delete the
existing secret keys. I'm not sure about how to export your secret key but
if you can, youshould just be able to import it on the other machine.
