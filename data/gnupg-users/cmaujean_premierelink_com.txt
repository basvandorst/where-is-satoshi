umm, correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't hardcoding the passphrase in a text file somewhere Completely break, destroy, invalidate, and otherwise mangle the whole point of encryption?

I am trying to find a mail client that supports gnupg and IMAP, runs on a Gnome/Redhat 7.1 system and doesn't require 4 hours of perl module downloads on my T1.  Anyone have any suggestions?
A related question: any news on a Mozilla/GnuPG plugin?

2. Cool idea on the CRC thing, guess I should read the spec Gnupg seems a bit on the overkill side for simple CRC type mangling checks. MD5 should work just fine for that, Perl's MD5 module runs on every platform that perl runs on...
1. Having a passphrase hard coded, or having no passphrase at all means, IMHO, that the origin of the message is untrusted, and unverifiable I can't trust that the signing key wasn't stolen and is being used by my arch-nemisis to impersonate my friend or business associate.
