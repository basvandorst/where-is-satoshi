@_subject: Deleting a Public Key from a server 
When I had a crash (and no backup) I lost my old sec-key. Now I created a new one but people don't know which one to use or use the wrong one. How can I delete the the old pub-key ?
I am totally new to GPG and Terminal-commands/usage. So please be so kind to explain it like to a 3 year old kid. Thanks!
