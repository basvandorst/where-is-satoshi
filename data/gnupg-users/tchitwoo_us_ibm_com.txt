I need to import an additional secret key to my keyring. I am running gpg 1.4.5. What is the command to do this? I thought it would be "gpg --import-secret-keys , but that doesn't seen to work.

@_subject: Encrypt Error - There is no assurance this key belongs to the named 
I am getting this error when trying to encrypt a file using a public key generated by PGP Desktop 10.0.2 (Build 13). I am using gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.5. I think the error is being caused by the validity setting for this key in my keyring which is "validity: unknown".
Two questions:
First, is there a way to set the validity parameter in the version of GnuPG I am using.
Second, are there any known incompatibilities between PGP Desktop 10.0.2 (Build 13) and gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.5?
Thank You in advance for your assistance.

Is this an error (something that actually prevents you from encrypting),
or is it just a warning (letting you know about something, but not
preventing the encryption)?
This is done by validating the key and signing it with your own key.
If you want to shut off all validation checks, putting "--trust-model
always" on the command line will do that.
None worth mentioning, but I believe a security vulnerability has been
discovered which affects version 1.4.5.  You may want to consider
upgrading to the latest 1.4 (1.4.10 as of this writing).

Can you provide the output of --list-sigs ?
That doesn't look like it has been signed or perhaps you didn't issue
save afterward?

Thanks for the info Doug. I don't think I have ever encrypted a file with more than one key. Would the command be something like the example below?
gpg --output test.txt.gpg --encrypt --recipient 359B3EB2 DAE72D59 test.txt (where 359B3EB2 is their key and DAE72D59 is our key)

Perfectly valid. That's why it's called the "public" key.
Sounds like a minor misunderstanding on his part. You sign a message with your private key, he verifies the signature with your public key. You encrypt messages TO public keys (your and his) and then you each use your private keys to decrypt them.
If I were in your shoes I'd simply encrypt the file to my key and his, and send it to him. Chances are excellent that it will all work according to plan.
Good luck,

-e == --encrypt
-r == --recipient
gpg --output test.txt.gpg -e -r 0x359B3EB2 -r 0xDAE72D59 test.txt
Alternatively, you can set default-recipient in gpg.conf to your key
