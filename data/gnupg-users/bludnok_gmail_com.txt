Hello everyone,
I recently downloaded gnupg via link from I ended up with v1.2.2
As soon as I checked the gnupg.org site I realised a newer
version was available and installed that. It seems to work except that when I do "gpg --version" I get an error message above the version info relating to a file called "iconv.dll" which is not mentioned anywhere
on the site that I can find, nor is it one of the files in
the distribution.
Do I need this file to run gnupg on WinXP? AS you can see from the signature, I'm going to continue using
v 1.2.2 for now. Will this leave me open to any attacks or bugs?
Thanks for your time,

Unfortunately, when I try that URL I get the following error message:
550 directory change failed; directory does not exist.
When I go to plain ftp://ftp.gnupg.org I can see that there is no
"gcrypt" subfolder.

Thanks for the help so far everyone. I've been able to download the new version from a different network.
I think the firewall at my office doesn't like FTP sites. My other question was: Is the old version I have at the moment vulnerable to any attacks or
bugs that were fixed in the new version, or will the upgrade just
provide more functionality?
