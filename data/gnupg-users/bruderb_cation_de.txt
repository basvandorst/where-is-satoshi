@_subject: newbies difficulties 
Hej all,
Im quite new in gnupg and using gpa as frontend.
I have troubles in generating keys runnning Debian or Windows:
Using gpa with root grants works fine, but with restricted (user-)
grants gpa seems to have troubles to call gnupg for generating keys. It
simply hangs in Linux and gives 'GnuPG execution failed: Could not spawn
external program.' in Windows.
Anybody knows something about that and can help me?

You could take part in a local key signing party or make contact to an
universty for IT and arrange a meeting with people with the same
interest, what actually would be a key signing party.
Also, for the second question, have a look at CaCert.org.

I see you're running Windows, so I cannot help you with this. But
Enigmail should include a feature for exporting keys on the GUI, doesn't it?

The peace of the puzzle that makes it possible for someone to help aout
is answering the question: What kind of Unix/Linux??
No,no,no,no,no - to answer each question! ;-)
On typical distribution there are binaries avaliable - no need to
compile the sources.
So: Which Distribution??

Hej Chris,
I cannot imagine why the kind of CPU should provide any matter to gnupg.
Me myself I'm using gnupg on my eeePC1000 very comfortable since it is a
part of enigmail which is a plugin for Mozilla Thunderbird. I use it on
Debian Linux (Lenny).

Hej Timo,
I guess the keyword for google is 'unattended keygeneration'.
You will be prompted to the batch mode of gpg:
gpg --batch --gen-key < ./keygen

Hej Timo,
here is the hard way: Pipe the output (fingerprint) into a file and read
the file from php (and optionally delete it).

Hej list members,
whatever you ar talking about with this topic: I like using OpenPGP VERY
MUCH and find it VERY useful and useable with enigmail in Thunderbird
(Icedove) on Debian Squeeze. Thanks for every hand and mind developing
this fine peace of software!
By the way: Using OpenPGP with enigmail in Thunderbird, I miss a feature:
Usually the recipient rules work but if they fail (perhaps due to
background update of Thunderbird and not working plugin), I would like
to have a chance to see that the written message is going to be send
unencrypted BEFORE sending. Or vice vera: I want to see that a instantly
written message is going to be encrypted....
Thanks in advance,

Hej Simon,
thanks very much for your comment! I didn't know that setting yet.
But I'm lacking phantasy of how to use this for preventing me of sending
unencrypted in case that Enigmail does not work properly....
So, if it does not work, the confirmation request will not appear and
mail goes out unencrypted, doesn't it?

Your explanation has nothing to do with OpenPGP. Of course everybody
could or should use TLS against his server....

Hej Don,
Icedove is the derivate from Thunderbird in Debian, forked because of
licence inconsistance.
So, if you're using Debian/GNU Linux, install it from repositories,
otherwise install Thunderbird.
