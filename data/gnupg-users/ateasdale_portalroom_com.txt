@_subject: Cpanel, PHP + GnuPG 
Hi there
We have recently bought a dedicated server that uses CPanel as it's control
panel.  This has GnuPG installed along with a utility for adding keys via
the control panel.  We have managed to add keys, but are at a loss as how to
get our PHP scripts talking to GnuPG to encrypt an email.  Does anyone have
a sample script that they wouldn't mind us having so that we can learn how
to do it? Otherwise, can anyone point us in the right direction as the
CPanel forum has drawn a blank on any GnuPG related topics

@_subject: Does apache have to run as the site owner? 
we have a problem that with PHP we can't see the keys in our virtual hosting
accounts.  This is what our programmer sent to me (as I'm a non-tech).  Does
this make sense? ....
This is what we have found in httpd.conf:
# If you wish httpd to run as a different user or group, you must run
# httpd as root initially and it will switch.
# User/Group: The name (or  of the user/group to run httpd as.
#  . On SCO (ODT 3) use "User nouser" and "Group nogroup".
#  . On HPUX you may not be able to use shared memory as nobody, and the
#    suggested workaround is to create a user www and use that user.
#  NOTE that some kernels refuse to setgid(Group) or semctl(IPC_SET)
#  when the value of (unsigned)Group is above 60000;
#  don't use Group nobody on these systems!
