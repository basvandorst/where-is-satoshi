@_subject: Automation of decryption 
Two points:
    - Don't use a passphrase unless you want a human to type it in.
    - Don't remove the passphrase without understanding that this
      reduces the security of the file to the security of the system
      where the file is stored.

Hmm, let's try that again:
    - Don't use a key with no passphrase without understanding that the
      security of the key is reduced to the security of the system where
      the key file is stored.

@_subject: Clearsign of HTML-pages 
If the signature is inside the document that it signs, then it changes
the contents of the document.  What is the signature supposed to be
checked against?
For example, to make a signature of this document:
that results in the hypothetical signature:
    ----- BEGIN BOGUS SIGNATURE -----
    DEADBEEFDEADBEEF
    ----- END BOGUS SIGNATURE -----
That signature will only be valid against the *exact contents* of the
above document.  Placing the signature *within* the document, as HTML
results in a completely different document.  That signature no longer
validates against the document, because its contents have changed.
That's why signatures are always explicitly separated from the document;
either by having the document delimited with the familiar
----- BEGIN PGP SIGNED DOCUMENT ----- etc., or by having them as
separate files (or MIME parts, or whatever makes sense).
HTML documents are atomic; the whole thing is a single entity.  A
separate signature can be made, as a separate file, but not embedded
into the document itself.

It generates entropy from various system events, as needed.  For
details, the source is always available:
The 'random.c' file contains the random-number functions used by GnuPG.

@_subject: Batch Program Needs to Bypass the Passphrase 
Easy: don't set a passphrase, and be aware of the massive reduction in
security that entails.
The passphrase is there to *ensure* that the human being who owns the
key is actually present at the keyboard.  If you want a key that has
none of the security of a passphrase, make a key without a passphrase.

That is only because encryption doesn't require access to your secret
key (it uses the recipient's public key).
To decrypt a message, or sign one, you'll need access to your secret
key, which will require entry of whatever passphrase is set on the key.

[taking this public on the gnupg-users list]
Hmm, I've noticed similar things on this mailing list, and others, from
other people's signatures (and informed them).  Thanks.
It does seem to be peculiar to mailing lists, in my experience.

@_subject: Can anyone tell me why it is happening (fwd) 
I didn't see any suggestion that it should become Jeanine's problem.
Rather, the suggestion was that Jeanine make it the company's problem --
by reading the documentation, training herself in how to solve the
issue, on the company's time.
If Jeanine expends her own resources to solve the issue, then it *does*
become her problem -- she's validating the original decision to load her
with more work than she's being paid for.  If she requires more training
for duties that she didn't ask for, then that's the company's
responsibility to ensure she receives that training.
Which is another good reason not to validate that decision by accepting
the extra burden of training on her own time, or with her own resources.

@_subject: Options to revoke a key 
Revoking a key requires access to the key.  Access to the key requires
the passphrase.
This is necessary to prevent someone in posession of your secret key
from revoking it without your permission.
Infeasibility of brute-force compromise is a goal behind the algorithms
used to protect the key.  If it were feasible to do so, we'd want to
know about it so that it could be fixed (made infeasible) again.
As far as the software is concerned, someone who has lost their
passphrase is indistinguishable from someone who never knew it.
For this reason, the documentation (and, I believe, the keypair
generation process) recommends creating a revocation certificate *at the
time of the key's creation*, since losing the passphrase os one of the
most common circumstances for wanting to use a revocation certificate.

Which is indistinguishable to the software; it doesn't matter, as far as
the algorithm is concerned, how much knowledge you have if you're
brute-forcing passwords.

Same here.  By human accident or programming bug (same thing?) I've been
re-subscribed to this list without asking.
Could the powers that be please investigate and correct?  It seems a lot
of people may be affected in this way.

The admins have solved the problems much better than that; the
subscriber list has been restored from the erroneous setting it had.
I'm glad it was this easy to solve the problem.
