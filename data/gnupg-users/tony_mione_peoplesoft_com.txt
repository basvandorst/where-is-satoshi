@_subject: C/C++ API for GnuPG 
I have been looking for an OpenPGP based library for C/C++. I noticed
that GnuPG only generates executables (plus libraries for the
underlying crypto and other utility routines.) The FAQ says that this
project (of providing a full API) will not be taken on since there are
some concerns about openning possible security holes.
I have looked at Gpgme. I like it to some degree but I do not like the
fact that it forks another process and calls gpg at the command line. I am
trying to avoid that type of interface. I would use libgcrypt for my
project but it ONLY implements the crypto and I can really use the
packet processing features of the source code in g10.
So, what are the security holes that may be openned if this is made
into a library? Do people involved with Gpg believe that the same
holes [may] exist in the PGP SDK marketed by PGP, Inc. then NAI, and soon
PGP International?
In my mind, a programmatic API would be better than spawning processes
that may need to have a passphrase in the command line. Does this make
sense or am I missing something here?
Thanks for any help that people can give here.
Take care.

@_subject: GPGme supported platforms 
Is there any definitive list of platforms for which GPGme is supported?
Looking at the 'configure' file, the host_os case statements list about
except Apple DOS 3.3 and OS390 (Gaaccck!)
In general, does the process spawning and IPC support work well on most
of the unix and windows platforms?

I guess you mean config.sub: That is a generic file, used with all GNU
program.  The file gets updated from time to time.
It should work on all POISX systems and most other Unix systems.
Windows is a bit different and we have an extra internal gpgme
interface for that (w32-io.c).  It used to work, but the current
version might not yet work.
It is pretty important for us that we know if windows platform support
works. Has anyone else used GPGme on windows (without cygwin, etc.) and
can they confirm that it works reasonably well. Thanks.
