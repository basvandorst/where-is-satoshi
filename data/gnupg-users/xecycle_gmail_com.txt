@_subject: Agent failed to get password from pinentry-gtk-2 
============================== START ==============================
Hello, I added gpg-agent to my .profile recently, but I cannot
use it now.  By some debugging I found it failed to get the
entered password from pinentry-gtk-2; with pinentry-curses it
works.  pinentry-qt4 is even worse, it complained about "no
pinentry", though I have it installed and is sure I have the path
What can I do in this case?  I use gpg mainly from Emacs so I
don't think I'll be able to use pinentry-curses all the way.
Here's the versions I use:
gpg-agent (GnuPG) 2.0.18
