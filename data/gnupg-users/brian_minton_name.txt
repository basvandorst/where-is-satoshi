@_subject: Mainkey with many subkeys?? 
Hash: SHA256
I recently created a key, with a RSA 4096-bit main key (certify only)
and 4 subkeys: one DSA for signing, and one ELGamal for encryption, for
communicating with people who I don't know are using ECC, and one each
of ED25519 and nistp384 for people who are.  The cool thing is that
since the dates on the ECC keys are newer, gpg 2.1 and other  versions
that are able to use those keys will do so automatically, while gpg and
other openpgp implementations which don't support ECC will basically
ignore those subkeys and use the DSA/ELGamal ones.  When signing a
message I often just use both signing capable subkeys, so everyone will
be able to check the signature.

Not to mention the fact that they released technical documents about

be a good idea, after reading about Certificate Transparency for TLS,
to have a similar thing for OpenPGP, which seems to be what they are

I would just backup the expired and revoked keys, then delete them.  I
personally never have used  my revoked keys.  I mean maybe once in a very

The Debian project solves this by having the secret key shared using

do at my employer is split the secret key passphrase. Yes, this is a
manual process but very secure. For highly important keys we assign six
trusted individuals, three have defined one half of the passphrase and
three have defined the other half. The halves are backed up physically
and stored securely in two separate locations. No one person knows the
entire passphrase ever. When encryption is required, one person from
each of the three people physically inputs their half of the
passphrase. Decryption happens normally. Obviously this only works if
you only encrypt a small amount of secret material or do it
infrequently. We have found this to be a very secure method.

Mailpile may be useful.  It lets you scan in a bunch of messages, and decrypt them, and indexes
them, keeping the index and message store encrypted.  It has command
line as well as a gui.

It breaks mailpile because gpg-agent is not session aware.  A user could
be logged in locally, using mailpile, and a remote attacker could access
the web interface of that locally running mailpile instance, which since
it is talking to the same gpg-agent, would think the remote user is
logged in (or more precisely, has the private key).
I think that one solution would be to have mailpile use a per-session
gpg home dir.

I meant what I said about them gmail being a client.  I agree that they
are also an email service, and it's true that you can access the gmail
mail service with imap, but I don't think it's as popular as their web
interface.  To be fair, I don't have any verifiable sources for that
claim.  But, doing so loses some of the best features of gmail (google
search on your inbox, google chat, conversation view, etc.)  Yes, I
know that lots of email clients have conversation view and search, but
for comparison, searching my ~12GB of mail on Thunderbird takes a lot
longer and is a lot clunkier of an interface than the nearly instant
search using gmail's web interface.

For encryption, people encrypting to you will use whatever key their
software can use. If the ECC key is newer, then senders that can use it
will by default, while senders that can't will use your ELG key. So,
keep both secret keys available and you'll be fine.  Note that I have a
few extra ELG keys which I keep around just in case I need to decrypt a
file that I encrypted with them.  There's nothing wrong with them, so I
haven't revoked them.  However, gpg (and probably other PGP clients will
use the newest usable key, so people encrypting to me with gpg2.1 will
use EA49CFDB55D113E9 to encrypt, and people using gpg 2.0 and earlier
will use 28FA8B9659A70692.
For signing, I like to put both key IDs (in my case, ed25519 and DSA) in
my gnupg conf file, so signing automatically uses both keys. The trick
is to use the key IDs of each subkey with an exclamation point so gnupg
takes that specific key.
For instance, here are the relevant lines from my ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf-2
file (side note: if you use both gpg 1 and 2 you can use that kind of
config file name to have different config files for each version):
*local-user 37B9507ACFF2016E!
local-user 6B8EB3A065CFBAA9!*
The nice thing about this setup is that I don't need to have any sender-
or recipient-specific rules.

It is not possible.  All the key servers share everything uploaded to
them. There is no real way to delete it.  The best you could do would
be to revoke that particular ID.  However, that would only increase the
size of the key.
Fortunately, from a usability standpoint, there's not much difference
between a 7K public key and a 70K one.  Most of the time, people either
download them automatically from the key servers, or copy/paste from a
web browser, etc.  Since the fingerprint of the main key won't change,
you can always use that to unambiguously refer to your public key.

I run a key server, which allows me to do as many key-retrieval queries
as I like, without giving any information away to the rest of the

adding keys to the keyserver network, with respect to my social
network.  In particular, it's not easy for any keyserver to see which of
its peers' peers a given key or set of keys, originated from.  However, in theory, an attacker could track the progress of a given key across
the network of keyservers by quick querying, but it's a pretty small
window between the introduction of keys to a single member of the pool,
and it being shared to all the keyservers.

of asymmetric (public) key pairs that are used to decrypt keys that have been

Key-transport keys are usually used to establish keys (e.g., key-wrapping
keys, data-encryption keys or MAC keys) and, optionally, other keying material
(e.g., Initialization Vectors). That usage (data-encryption keys) is exactly what gnupg uses to encrypt a

As you can see, it is looking at the correct keyserver (side note, I have 4
keyservers specified, it would be nice if I could configure dirmngr to try all
of them, but that's a separate issue), but it doesn't try to retrieve the key.  If I
manually retrieve the key using the same keyserver, it works.
$ gpg --keyserver hkp://jirk5u4osbsr34t5.onion --recv 24C6A8A7F4A80EB5
gpg: key 24C6A8A7F4A80EB5: public key "CentOS-7 Key (CentOS 7 Official Signing Key) " imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
and then I can verify the signature.

============================== START ==============================
My guess is, the gpg one also is doing MDC, so you'd have to add the
equivalent HMAC code to openssl, but that's just a complete guess.??

No, the decryption (of the message's session key) is performed entirely
within the smart card, using the smart card's internal processor.? The
session key is then in copied to the computer's main memory to perform
AES or whatever symmetrical encryption the message is encrypted with.?
The smart card is actually as a separate computer that performs basic?
encryption on the user's behalf, while making it as difficult as
possible to access the private keys.

There are some problems with sshfs, however, such as slowness and
locking.  It would probably be better to run an imap daemon on your mail
server, and have mutt use imap to access the mailbox.

I believe the original question was, how to allow gpg to automatically trust
the root certificates provided by the os or Thunderbird.
