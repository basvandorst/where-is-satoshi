@_subject: unable to use the public key 
Hello. I am using gpg v 1.4.7 on Windows.
I have successfully traded keys with a vendor I am working with. Gpg insists on using the subkey and will not use the primary  key.. here is what I am seeing:
gpg -seav -r 3DDD3ABE -u 6BEC8C4E --passphrase "passphrase"  "C:\Documents and Settings\user\Desktop\pgptest\test.txt"
You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: "USA TODAY "
1024-bit DSA key, ID 6BEC8C4E, created 2008-07-02
gpg: using subkey C970A114 instead of primary key 3DDD3ABE
gpg: using classic trust model
gpg: This key belongs to us
File `C:\\Documents and Settings\\xxx\\Desktop\\pgptest\\test.txt.asc' exists. Overwrite? (y/N) y
gpg: writing to `C:\\Documents and Settings\\xxx\\Desktop\\pgptest\\test.txt.asc'
gpg: ELG-E/AES256 encrypted for: "C970A114 BOAD072013 "
gpg: DSA/SHA1 signature From: xxxxx at usatoday.com ("6BEC8C4E USA TODAY)"
Is there any way around this. The vendor cannot decrypt the file unless I use the primary key.
