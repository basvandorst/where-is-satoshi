this might help:
1. Open the profile folder of Thunderbird.
2. Open the file pref.js with a text editor.
3. Find lines similar to : user_pref("mail.identity.id1.pgpkeyId", 4. Replace "0xC8D5E165" by "0x2AD07B94".
5. Save your changes.
You can get the same effect by editing the point "OpenPGP-Security" in your
Email-account settings.

@_subject: known-plaintext attacks 
1. Is the AES-Encryption of a file by gnupg vulnerable to known-plaintext attacks ?
2. Does this depend on the lenght of the plaintext ?
plaintext is just 1 Byte or even 10 GB ?
3. Is it possible for sombody, who does not know the strong Passphrase, to guess reliably, if the encrypted data contains a known file ?
4. Why or Why not (1.,2.,3 )?
