@_subject: gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=4c) 
Hi Group,
    I installed GPG a few weeks back and presently I am decrypting some symmetric cipher text. One of the errors that has shown up last night (for the first time) is
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=4c)
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=4e)
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=47)
I tried looking in the mail-lists but did not find anything (may be I skipped it) but can anybody please let me know why this error occurs and wats the workaround for it.
I would really appreciate all help
thanks much
