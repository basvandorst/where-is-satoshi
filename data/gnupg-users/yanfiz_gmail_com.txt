@_subject: Subkey Usage, Expire Date and Preferences problem 
When I create unattended key with cv25519 or ed25519 as subkeys, GnuPG
doesn't apply 'encrypt' usage, expire date and preferences. There is no
problem with RSA.
(PS : My example key numbers were padded with X and Y)

Oh, sorry. I made a mistake in 'Key-Type:' line. Right one :
Key-Type: eddsa
