@_subject: Modifying location of secret keyring under Windows 
I want to have my secret keyring on my floppy drive. So I modified the OPTIONS file by adding the following line:
secret-keyring A:\secring.gpg
and moved my secring.gpg to A:\  .Now GPG does not find my secring
anymore. Instead it shows the following error message:
D:\PROGRA~2\WinPT>gpg --list-secret-keys
gpg: keyblock resource `D:/Program Files/WinPT//A:\secring.gpg': file open error
So it keeps the old location and appends the new one. How can I specify another drive?
Best regards
