After playing with it a bit, I have decided that the password test utility at  is useless for checking PGP/GPG pass phrases.  It was designed to test short passwords, and does so by looking for dictionary words and fragments of dictionary words.  When it finds a predominance of words or word fragments, it automatically assumes a bad password, no matter how long or random the list may be.
I have tried pass phrases made up of ten or more misspelled English words, which the password checker identified as breakable in one day on a home PC-- despite there being somewhere in the vicinity of 6 x 10^37 combinations to try...
Pass phrase strength is a matter of entropy.  To check a PGP/GPG pass phrase, start here:

Is there a FAQ or similar documentation that describes the
special issues in porting GnuPG to Windows?  I am especially interested in the RNG (how it collects entropy) and the problem
of allocating memory that is not swapped out to disk.
BTW, today's beta release of WinPT shows real progress with the
current window and file manager functions.  I am impressed by the progress of both GnuPG and WinPT over the last few months.

Hi Malte & group!
I know this is a common belief, but I know it is FUD.
Windows has several million /operators/ who are walking =
security holes, because they are completely ignorant.  The =
OS family itself is no more or less secure than, for instance, =
Linux.  (Although of course Microsoft network /application/ =
software is horribly insecure, as demonstrated by numerous =
IIS holes, swarming Outlook worms, root exploits in every =
release of IE, etc. etc.)
A full Nessus scan of my home Win98 box failed identify the
operating system and provided no advisories.  Using Floke
Integrity provides similar protection as Tripwire, and the
Pegasus Mail MUA has a perfect security record, over a 10 year
period.  As long as you use it for its proper purpose-- a
network /client/-- Win32 can be made as secure as any OS on the
On the other side of the coin, the HoneyNet project found =
that the half-life of unpatched Red Hat on a high-bandwidth
connection is about 72 hours until cracked and owned.  That's
less secure than any Windows OS, out of the box.  Linux can be
operator to do it.  Even then, Bad Things can happen.  =
Just last week, Robert J.Hansen, a well known crypto engineer =
and UNIX programmer, had his own Linux box rooted.  (He blames =
a wu-ftpd exploit.)  This forced him to revoke his =
long standing public keys.
None provided.  If you want to wipe the swap file properly on
9.x/ME, you have to disable dynamic swap file allocation, and
use a 3rd party app like eraserd.exe.  I have used DOS batch to
reconfigure autoexec.bat to tell the wiper to eat win386.swp on
start-up, then return to normal automagically.  (Anyone wants
the generic batch files, ask & I'll send them along.)
Back to the point:  As far as I can tell, an entropy gathering
daemon similar to dev/random would offer a major improvement
over the RNG now used in Win32 GPG.  I can't write one, but I am
hoping that someone will sometime soon.  As for memory locking,
that's mostly a public relations issue-- maybe .001% of users
could be affected by swap file leakage, and besides, the text
editor will always spread plain text all over the swap file...
IMO every time a major GPL application makes it over the fence
into the Windoze world, a small part of Microsoft's foundation
crumbles away.  There is no better way to promote GNU/Linux and
its cousins, than to teach Windows users to rely on applications
native to the GNU environment.  Right now, new business users
have /no/ legal alternative to GnuPG for PGP crypto.  A few
thousand people who still think computer =3D Windows are getting
their first exposure to the GNU world via GnuPG, and many more
are to come.  If these folks are left with the impression that
the GNU community is hostile or elitist-- which it is not!-- the
only party to benefit will be Microsoft itself.
The helpful & pro-active nature of the Linux community is =
what sold me on GNU, and the only reasons I am using Windows =
right now are 1) AutoDesk CAD, 2) lots of lost-time =
incidents with dual boot configurations, and 3) I need a =
real modem anyway.

Not to mention that they have been one of the worst spammers on Usenet, off and on, and don't mind indulging in a variety of slimeball tactics like slandering their critics.
If you want an /efficient/ version of EE, check this:
Not a problem.  Eraser has a "task list" function for automating
routine clean-up chores around the hard drive, and comes with a DOS application, eraserd.exe, that happily accepts commands from DOS batch.  Unlike EE and EEE, it's GPL.
How much to wipe depends on your threat model.  EE was designed with neurotic fear in mind, and that's the basis of
their whole sales pitch.  Most any /practical/ threat model is
very adequately addressed by using Scramdisk or similar to confine data & applications to an encrypted container or partition. To spot data leaks from applications (such as the
temporary files written & wiped by the GPGtray front end), use filemon.exe from  -- lotsa fun free toys there.
If you need to wipe (not just delete) registry keys, I only
know of one way to do it:  Have autoexec.bat wipe your entire
system.dat & user.dat files on start-up, and replace them from
known clean backups. (Remember to update the backups when you install or remove applications!)
Nah, it's not that bad.  It usually takes Eraser about 10 seconds to eat everything on my hit list, and I do tend to be paranoid.  Well, this is wandering off topic for the list, so I'll quit on the subject.  Anyone who wants to see my slightly outdated nonsense on how to realistically clean up a Windows 9.x box, can go to  Steve K
