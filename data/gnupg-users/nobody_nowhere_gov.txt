@_subject: Kleopatra Start Error (Win7) [AUG Resend] 
When attempting to start Kleopatra, I get the following error:
"The procedure entry point libiconv_set_relocation_prefix could not be located in the dynamic link library iconv.dll"
This happens every time.  Kleopatra's never worked, even after reinstalling 2.0.4 update.
Everything else seems to be OK.
Many thanks for any help with this!
