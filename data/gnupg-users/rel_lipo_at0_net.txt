Could anybody give me a pointer to the reason why the module
skipjack.c is in a directory called "do-not-use"?

A .../contrib/do-not-use/README.skipjack could help to avoid questions like mine, too.
That a good reason plus a very good one. This line would be a good content for a README.skipjack-file.
