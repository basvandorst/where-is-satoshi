@_subject: Importing non-self-signed keys 
I am having major problems importing public PGP keys with GnuPG (version 1.0.0.) Importing keys created with GnuPG works just fine
however. PGP 2.6.X keys do not work at all, but I guess this is a known
fact due to licensing troubles?
I have had no luck importing PGP 4 and 5 keys neither, GnuPG tells me this
can be due to the fact that these keys are not self-signed. Is there a way
around this, or can only self-signed keys be imported? Lots of people seam
to forget to sign their own keys, it's a good thing it's done automatically with GnuPG:-)
I also tried importing a RSA and a DSS/Diffie-Hellman key, but then I got
the message "invalid armor header". What does this mean?
Thankful for any help.

Yes, I would say it is, and it has a number of features that can't
be found in PGP. Check out  there you'll see a list of
features found in GnuPG.

@_subject: gnupg reports "no valid OpenPGP data found" 
I'm trying to import a key from a keyserver (certserver.pgp.com) using
GnuPG 1.0.1 and when I do that I get the message "No valid openPGP data
found" and no key is imported. This key is from PGP 6.5.2 and it's a
Diffie-Hellman/DSS key. Does GnuPG support this algorithm? If not, what's
the latest PGP version that will interact well with GnuPG?

@_subject: Revoking key 
I would like to revoke a key that I have been using up until now,
mainly because I chose a too big key size when I created it (2048).
Another reason is that I have gotten the impression from the GnuPG
changelog that decryption is faster with keys generated with v1.0.2, ir
this correct? The key I want to revoke has been spread to keyservers.
After reading the GnuPG manual it seams I have two options, either use
--revoke-key or edit the key and run revkey on it. If I choose the
latter, is it enough to first run "key 1" followed by "revkey"? Can I
then just send it to a keyserver, and rest assured that my old key will
not be used any more?

@_subject: Revoking key 
If that's the case, which I doubt everyone agrees on, I think the GnuPG
manual should be updated. It currently states:
"The longer the key the more secure it is against brute-force attacks,
but for almost all purposes the default keysize is adequate since it
would be cheaper to circumvent the encryption than try to break it."
What made me think so was the GnuPG changelog at appwatch.com:
Among the changes this is mentioned: "New encryption keys are generated
in a way which allows a much faster decryption"
So is decryption faster in 1.0.2 only on newly generated keys, or on
keys created before too?
