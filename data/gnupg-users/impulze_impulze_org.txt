@_subject: gnupg refuses to work on a read-only filesystem 
What do i have to pass to gpg to work on a read-only filesystem and a
homedir which is not available? Meaning to be forced to not create
anything except messages on stdout and stderr and to be forced to not
read anything except the key i want to decrypt.
I tried passing the switches --keyring /dev/null (though i think this is
not the right way to do it) --no-random-seed-file and --lock-never.
Thanks in advance.
