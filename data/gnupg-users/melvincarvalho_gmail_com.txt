Why do you want N and E?
I think exponent is almost always 65537
Some apps display these numbers, e.g. firefox does for X.509 RSA keys.
  Maybe the app you are using has the value.
Not sure the easiest way to get the modulus otherwise but I know you
can do it with the bouncycastle java library.

I'm wondering if this could be as an attack vector against (say),
freedombox, if it became popular e.g.
1. Lets say FBX got a big sponsorship, could the key servers cope with
1 million, 10 million, 100 million new keys?
Granted, this is a nice problem to have! :)
2. Could a malicious or anti-freedom oriented entity use this to
disrupt the FBX network, for example by using a botnet to keep
spamming key servers, similar to email spam botnets.

Much in the same way the email was integrated into the web with products

@_subject: what is killing PKI? 
I think everyone on this list would love to see more pervasive PKI
adoption.  Peer reviewed literature certainly provides a high quality
basis, in not only describing a problem, but offering well thought through
viable approaches.  Although not academic, I've read through many papers,
I've been very grateful for the research produced and made available time
and again to advance knowledge in technical areas.  I've started looking
trough the pointers on this thread, thanks for the links.
However, I would point out that this is not the only approach, when it
comes to adoption.  For example, the WorldWideWeb paper written hypertext
conference, that had the first working web server, web browser, most of
HTTP ahd HTML described, was peer reviewed and dismissed after submission.
I do think there are advantages to trying to think outside the box
sometimes, especially when it comes to things like The Web and Web
Integration.  I'd love to see for example, a browsable web of trust, or a
PKI experience that you could use simply from a browser, that even a
beginner would find intuitive.
I dont work day in, day out with GPG, but I do take an interest, but one
thing the web has proved time and again (perhaps like no other technology
to date) is the ability to deliver to a mass audience.  It's not the only
approach, but perhaps looking at a big picture can help deliver GPG to a
wider audience.

Yes, trust should be additive, rather than one WOT to rule them all.
There's no perfect trust system, but you can do things to increase the
confidence interval.  You can generate a lot of functionality with limited
trust too.  The thing I dont like is when trust creates a barrier to entry
that does NOT allow you to do things.  Users should have freedom to choose,
I was at TPAC a couple of months ago and Mozilla did an impressive demo of
crypto in the browser to generate keys and encrypt/decrypt.  The W3C Crypto
working group will hopefully provide some great API for those that wish to
work with the web and with PKI.  I think in this way it may be possible to
scale the great features of GPG to a wider audience.  But as I say, most

We came to a similar conclusion with the WebID [1], where in fact, I do
actually use my GPG master key as my X.509 and WebID key.  You may be
interested in looking at WebID for client server interactions, currently
there are working demos over TLS, tho many people say that the UI for
certificates in browsers make them unusable.
That three concepts should be considered as topics in their own right:  A)
identification, B) authentication and C) authorization.
Which (B) and (C) are often separated, (A) and (B) are often coupled
together.  After about 5 years of work, WebID is being rewritten into new
specs which contain solutions to A,B,C separately.

As of 2012, the most efficient attack against SHA-1 is considered to be the
one by Marc Stevens with an estimated cost of $2.77M to break a single hash
value by renting CPU power from cloud servers.[29] Stevens developed this
attack in a project called HashClash,[30] implementing a differential path
attack. On 8 November 2010, he claimed he had a fully working
near-collision attack against full SHA-1 working with an estimated
complexity equivalent to 257.5 SHA-1 compressions. He estimates this attack
can be extended to a full collision with a complexity around 2^61.
Given that ASICS these days are running at 1.5 terra hashes per second,
2^61 doesnt sound that much?

I've been doing a lot of work with bitcoin lately.
Bitcoin is essentially a ledger where you have an array of fingerprints
(160 bit hashes of a public key) and a value (number of coins in wallet).
Transactions involve signing transfers from one key to another, which also
creates new coins in the process, when the distributed ledger syncs up.
Unfortunately bitcoin only supports ECDSA and not RSA.  But I wonder if a
fingerprint of your GPG key could be used as the basis of a payment ledger?

@_subject: How difficult is it to break the OpenPGP 40 character long 
Here's a good page that shows how it's hashed:
essentially its
prefix . ripemd-160(sha256(pubKey)) . checksum
base58 encoded with a custom alphabet
That's great.  Satoshi used the Koblitz curve for performance.  I noticed
this one is also not in the upcoming Web Crypto API, I believe it's related
to that curve not being in browser NSS (network security services).
That's OK, I'm curious about making a system that doesnt necessarily go
onto the bitcoin block chain, but could be used with GPG keys, making each
keypair a theoretical wallet.
Yes very helpful.  The question is whether the fingerprint contains enough
entropy such that it would be impractical for an attacker to find a key
that hashes to it either with preimage or birthday attack...

@_subject: Thoughts on Keybase 
different answers.  A better question might be, "How do you name things
(e.g. people)". If different parties name things in a similar way there's
an order of magnitude more chance of growing the network.  Keybase has a
proprietary, centralized naming strategy largely incompatible with the
architecture of the web.  If that sounds like a criticism, it isnt.
Because almost everyone else does the same thing.  Hence identity systems
are balkanized.
Where I think keybase shines is with convenience and utility.  Such systems
have chances of organic growth.  But people tend to over estimate the
chances of making it to millions of users, which is what keybase possibly
needs to change the landscape.
We need a web of trust that's universal (the only way I know to do this is
to use URIs for naming), so that it can span many systems and grow the
network effect.
In awww this is a document, we like to put data inside documents.  Then you
can make statements about both things.  I may like Ricky Martin's home page
but may not like Ricky Martin.
Id suggest having an anchor inside such as  or  then tie key value
pairs to it.  It turns out that anchors are very hard to grok on the web
for most people, though.
Using anchors also allows multiple data structures on the page.  One for
the user, one for the key, one for anything else you'd like to add.
yes, but as it's designed hard to get traction
very worth while noting the usability patterns tho
