@_subject: Automation of GPG processing 
I need to automate an encryption process. When I execute the command
below to process the encryption I am getting the prompt from GPG asking
if I really sure that this key belong to the recipient. gpg --output [output.gpg] --recipient [public_key_name --encrypt
After that I need to enter "Y" in order to continue. But, it should be a
fully automated process. What should I do, so it will not ask me any
Thank you in advance,
