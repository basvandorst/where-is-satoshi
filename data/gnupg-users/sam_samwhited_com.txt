Right after spamming the list I realized that the ftp server probably
also handled rsync. Other recommendations are still welcome though.

I was considering running a GnuPG mirror for a while, but couldn't
find any information about where (geographically) they needed mirrors,
how often they recommended syncing, or where to pull from (presumably
there is an rsync server somewhere?).
Is there a page on the GnuPG site somewhere that discusses setting up
and running a mirror or a mirror-maintainers mailing list?
P.S. Damn Thunderbird interface; one of these days I'll actually hit
"Reply List" on the first try. Sorry, you'll be getting two of these

@_subject: can someone verify the gnupg Fingerprint for pubkey? 
It would also just be an unwanted extra step for a lot of people.
Might be a good idea so long as it could be turned off in the config

Yes, but that actually serves a purpose, it prevents people from
losing their key when they make a simple typo which is quite easy to
do. I'd consider this an important step.
I think you're probably right, it would cut down on inappropriate
signatures and...
...yes, it's hardly onerous, but it's still one extra step that does
nothing for more advanced users (except perhaps when they haven't had
enough coffee early in the morning :) ).
Don't get me wrong I think it's a good idea but I also think that
(from a basic interface perspective) there should be a way to turn it
off. It's the equivalent of the "remember my selection" button that
should be on any dialog that's not performing something

If you're going to add it to the --expert option it almost seems silly
to restrict it to 8192. Might as well pick an arbitrarily large number
since the point is to account for "silly" and/or experimental use
cases anyways.
2^32 should more than cover it (while we're being silly)
I read a paper a while back discussing key size in which they
generated extremely large keys on large clusters for some reason...
I'll have to see if I can dig it out.

Certainly both; while accidental collision isn't probable, 32-bit IDs
aren't exactly collision resistant either. This, coupled with the fact
that a nice GPGPU is now relatively inexpensive makes brute forcing
collisions not only possible, but relatively easy for a determined
