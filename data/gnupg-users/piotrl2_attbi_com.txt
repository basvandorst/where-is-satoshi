@_subject: problem invalid packet 
I have problem with encrypting a file.
I'm using gpg (GnuPG) 1.0.6 on Windows NT 4.0 SP6
I encrypted rather large tarball (~30MB) using just
symmetric cripher (gpg -c)
When I'm trying to decrypt, gpg is complaing about
invalid packet and zlib inflate problem.
See below for the full error message(s).
Does it mean that the file is corrupted ?
Unfortunatly I do not have access to the original,
so I'm not 100% sure that this is not a problem with
transmission over the net...
thanks, ~piotr
