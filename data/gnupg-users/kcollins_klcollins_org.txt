Due to reasons that I do not wish to go into, I've been forced to move
from Linux to Windows.  I've made the translation with one
Following a Mozilla guide, I tried to move my gpg keyrings to the CLI of
gpg for windows.  This was done so that I could get Thunderbird signing
and encrypting my e-mails.
Apparently my secret key mae in just fine, as I can at least sign
outgoing e-mails.  But my public keyring is hosed.  Here's what I get
when I run 'gpg --list-keys':
gpg: checking the trustdb
gpg: mpi larger than indicated length (2 bytes)
gpg: keyring_get_keyblock: read error: invalid packet
gpg: keyring_get_keyblock failed: invalid keyring
gpg: failed to rebuild keyring cache: invalid keyring
gpg: 3 marginal(s) needed, 1 complete(s) needed, classic trust model
gpg: mpi larger than indicated length (2 bytes)
gpg: keyring_get_keyblock: read error: invalid packet
gpg: keydb_get_keyblock failed: invalid keyring
gpg: validate_key_list failed

As it turns out, there was _one_ bad key in my keyring.  I was able to
successfully pull the remaining keys from the keyservers.  I recreated
the trustdb with no problems.
Thanks for all the help, I think I'm back in business now.

For the record, the guide I followed was this one:
  I was setting up 'enigmail'
for Thunderbird.
I have my keys rings working now...with the exception of one key, that
appears to be malformed.  I'm going to contact my fried who owns that
key to day and see if he has had any problems with it.  BTW, the key in
question, can't even be imported from a key server without gpg complaining.
This is good information.  I may backup and try this later tonight as I
still have a pristine copy of the gpg stuff on a Linux box at home.
