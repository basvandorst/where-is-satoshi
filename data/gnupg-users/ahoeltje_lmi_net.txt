@_subject: gnupg 2.0 Build fails 
Hello gpg Folks,
I downloaded the gnupg-2.0.20 files and the associated required lib
sources, including pth-2.0.7, today.  The configure, make, make check,
and make install, all went well in this order:
    libgpg-error-1.11
    libassuan-2.1.0
    libksba-1.3.0
    libgcrypt-1.5.2
    pth-2.0.7
However the make for gnupg fails with this compiler error:
    gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I..     -g -O2 -Wall -Wno-pointer-sign
    -Wpointer-arith -MT allocsa.o -MD -MP -MF .deps/allocsa.Tpo -c -o
    allocsa.o allocsa.c

    error:
          unknown type name 'intmax_t'
      extern intmax_t imaxabs(intmax_t j);
             ^
My system is an iMac running OSX 10.8.3 but it would appear that my
recent XCode 5 update has upset the magic of stdint.h and intmax_t.
Notice the "MacOSX10.9.sdk" in the include path that make is looking at:
    /Applications/Xcode5-DP.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms
        /MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk/usr/include
This is totaly wrong.  It should be:
    /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms
        /MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.8.sdk/usr/include
I do not see any notes in the README or INSTALL regarding how to tell
make which Mac SDK to use.  Is there a ./configuration option?  Do you
have any suggestion on how I get around this?
