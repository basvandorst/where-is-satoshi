@_subject: gpa problem 
I have gpa 0.7.0 installed on FC4 system. When i try to search a key a
window saying connecting to the server hkp://yyy please wait and that's
all. I have tried all the available servers and this is always the same.
gpa keep this window as long as i closed gpa. Any idea ?

gpg: recherche de ? 0xA4B8368F ? du serveur hkp pgp.mit.edu
