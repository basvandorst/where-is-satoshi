I am new to GnuPG, so I downloaded the latest binary for Windows and ran the

You need a User-ID to identify your key; the software constructs the user id
from Real Name, Comment and Email Address in this form:
    "Heinrich Heine (Der Dichter) "
Real name: Johne Doe
Email address: jdoe
Comment: TestId For John Doe
You selected this USER-ID:
    "Johne Doe (TestId For John Doe) "
Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit?
I cannot get out of the change prompt to complete the key generation.  What
am I missing?

My mistake, I was running the software on my notebook which was configured
to 1680x1050 and the displayed character is very small, I misread the (O)Kay
for (O)Key so I was thinking that I was not changing the key and was unable
to supply the right character to end this prompt.
Sorry about that!
