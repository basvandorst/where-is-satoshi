@_subject: gpg --verify complains that my own key is not trusted 
I don't understand why gpg complains about sigs made with my own key.
It's possible that I'm missing something, but I hardly see what:
$ LC_ALL=C gpg --verify gcompris_5.0-2_i386.changes  gpg: Signature made Fri Feb  6 00:00:52 2004 CET using DSA key ID 5C33C1B8
gpg: Good signature from "Yann Dirson "
gpg:                 aka "Yann Dirson (as Debian member) "
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
