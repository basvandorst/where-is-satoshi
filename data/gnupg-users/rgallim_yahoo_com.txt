@_subject: Decrypting Multiple Folders 
I am in a windows environment and have 3 individual files that are stored in folders that are named with the date they were created, yyyymmdd.  Is there are way to decrypt all of these files in the folders and store them in either a new folder with sub-folders as dates or append the original date to the file.  An example is below.
Currently stored:
  file1.gpg
  file2.gpg
  file3.gpg
  file1.gpg
  file2.gpg
  file3.gpg
Preferred Output:
  file1.txt
  file2.txt
  file3.txt
  file1.txt
  file2.txt
  file3.txt
Clear as mud?
