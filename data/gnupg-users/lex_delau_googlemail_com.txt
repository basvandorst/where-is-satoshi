I'm a beginner in encrypting E-Mails. It would bei nice if you could help me
in my question:
I want to use GnuPG with a masterkey (to sign) and a subkey (to encrypt) on
Windows XP (GnuPG 1.4.9) and Ubuntu (GnuPG ?.?.?).
Now I'm not sure, what keys i should use after typing "gpg --gen-key
--expert" and what keys are secure. DSA/ElGamal: It's the default setting, but DSA only encrypts with 1024bit.
DSA2: I don't know if it's compatible with other versions.
RSA/ElGamal: RSA can encrypt with 4096bit, but I read that it is more
unsecure than DSA.
So can I use the default setting DSA/ElGamal 1024/4096 or should I use RSA
with a higher bit number?
Thank you for your help.
Best greetings from Germany

I've now chosen RSA 4096/4096 because your answers are plausible to me.
Thank you for helping me!
