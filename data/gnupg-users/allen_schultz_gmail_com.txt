Ok. I'm getting a wierd signature verification message in two programs and I have a few questions. First the situation.
Inline signatures received from more than one person. Recently checked Godwin Stewart's signature (0xD769AF76) first with FireGPG. It is giving me a flat out "Wrong signature". When I copy to clipboard and tried with WinPT (Using Windows 7), it gave me the following status below.
Signature is good. Warning: This key is not certified with a trusted signature! There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
First. Does the trust warning screw up FireGPG's signature validity or am I missing something else? Second, is this the normal reaction from GnuPG v1.4.9?
Any help in understanding this would be helpful.

Apparently I dont have the permissions right on the directory. Now with

I ask this in my LUG?

For the reason of SHA1 issues in the news, I've recently set up

The old key will continue to be valid for some time, but i
prefer all future
correspondence to come to the new one. ?I would also like this
new key to be re-
integrated into the web of trust. ?This message is signed by
both keys to certify the
the old key was:
pub ? 1024D/EE79C636 2009-04-24

And the new key is:
pub ? 3072R/DAD4736B 2009-05-20
? ? ?Key fingerprint = 16AD EFE1 D68F C8A8 B086 ?68CD 1A35 85C7

sub ? 2048R/5687B83E 2009-05-20 [expires: 2010-05-20]
To fetch my new key from a public key server, you can simply do:
?gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-key DAD4736B
If you already know my old key, you can now verify that the new
key is
signed by the old one:
?gpg --check-sigs DAD4736B
If you don't already know my old key, or you just want to be
extra paranoid, you can check the fingerprint against the one
?gpg --fingerprint DAD4736B
If you are satisfied that you've got the right key, and the UIDs
what you expect, I'd appreciate it if you would sign my key:
?gpg --sign-key DAD4736B
Lastly, if you could upload these signatures, i would appreciate
You can either send me an e-mail with the new signatures (if you
a functional MTA on your system):
?gpg --armor --export DAD4736B | mail -s 'OpenPGP Signatures'
allen.schultz at gmail.com
Or you can just upload the signatures to a public keyserver
?gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --send-key DAD4736B
Please let me know if there is any trouble, and sorry for the

Thank you for the information. I will clearsign this using the

EE79C636 has already been updated [and uploaded] with an

As far as signing or verifying through email. The subject has
already been discussed. Again, it's your choice. I may sign at a
"unverified - fingerprint through unsecure medium" per the
questions gpg asks. It does not validate the rest of my public
ring. But that was only done with the older EE79C636 as of the
signing of this email.
Let me know if this signature does not work either.
