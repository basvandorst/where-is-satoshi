-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
Since the problem was mentioned in the FAQ, I assumed this was the
problem at hand; I didn't think any further information was necessary.
Apologies.  In any case, it isn't my own problem; I'll have to
investigate next time he and I are in the same state (some months
from now).
Thanks -- PSM

Hash: SHA512
I've extracted some Thawte and CAcert keys and certs from my browser and
imported them into gpgsm.  ls -l ~/.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d/ lists the
three private keys that I imported, and all of the corresponding certs
show up in --list-keys:
$ gpgsm --list-keys psmay

Neglected to mention that the aforementioned problem was in gpgsm from
gnupg-2.0.3, with it and its four dependencies at latest release
versions, freshly compiled this weekend.
