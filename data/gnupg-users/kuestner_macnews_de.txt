I'm still in the process of learning how to use GPG for signing and  encrypting messages. I use MacGPG on, you guessed it, OS X.
The interface of the GPG Keychain app makes it really easy to do some  powerful stuff. And you know how it is, if powerful stuff is put in  the hands of ignorant people:
Now I'm stuck with what you never want to get stuck with: I have keys  on the keyserver that I don't want to be there and I don't want have  the private key anymore. The keys are of unlimited validity.
I have the passphrase, though, and I thought that this must be the  key (no pun intended) to everything. Unfortunately, the more I read  about it, the more I learn how wrong I am.
I understand that technically there is no software command that I  could send off anywhere that could fix the situation, right?
But somebody must be owning and administrating the keyserver  subkeys.pgp.net. How can I get to this person? And how can I prove  that I am the rightful fool to request deletion of those keys from  the server?
I cannot believe that minutes of stupidity will leave the servers  running with in a sense corrupt entries for the rest of the lifetime  of gpg/pgp technologies. Surely this whole scheme must have a method,  maybe manual and not-free support, for such a scenario?
Any help?

Thanks David.
I feared so after I read up on all this stuff.
Wow, is it just me or does anybody else consider this a major design  flaw of the whole setup?
For two reasons:
- After decades of IT, how can one still design software that is  absolutely unforgiving to people's stupidity in a critical area.  That's like being able to close a window of unsaved work without  being prompted to save.
- It is so easy to make life miserable for somebody else. What would  prevent me from picking any e-mail address that isn't mine and upload  dozens of keys to the key servers, maybe even give them misleading  comments like "current" etc.. If anybody were then looking for the  public key to joesmith there would be a useless mess  of keys without telling which one is correct to use. And worst of  all: Joe Smith has no way of fixing the situation, even if he is  legitimate owner of the joesmith e-mail address.
It strikes me, that GNU-supporters would bash MS (or for that reason  any vendor of proprietary software) for dishing out once more a  thoughtless, immature and insecure software design.
I understand it must not be simple to revoke or disable keys. But it  shouldn't be impossible either, especially in the light of anybody's  capability to put public keys under my name on the server.
Am I missing something?
Well, my issue is not so much with the keyservers. I guess with  faster and more hardware this scheme could be maintained for decades.
But if the keyservers are not directories to look up public keys,  then what are they? And if they are meant as directories, how good  are they if they are flooded with garbage keys.
Can gpg use this keyserver? It is listed in the settings of my MacPG.  Is using this server recommendable for everybody?
Thanks for your answers, David.
I'll do some more reading how to deal with this. This page has a  suggestion to work as good as possible with the situation:
I'll have to think through it when I'm less tired. All this key stuff  is still very foreign to me.

Okay. I got that by now. I think the problem was that MacGPG makes it  really easy to get started with GPG:
There's a plug-in that integrates nicely with Apple's Mail. And the  Keychain Assistant let's you do all the key creation and uploading  things easily. That's great. That's a start to get people actually  using GPG.
But then unlike the command line tools the software does not  recommend to make a backup copy of your private key. It does not  recommend to make a hard copy of your key. It does not recommend to  create a revocation certificate. It also does not explain that  downloading a public server means that this key can be trusted. That  of course is a not so good start to get people actually using GPG.
In my case, there was also a bug: When I tried to delete a key I  didn't want, up came a cryptic error message. So after a while since  I had just been playing around after all, I thought I just delete my  keychain and start from scratch. Did that twice actually for the same  reason. And that's how I lost those private keys.
Anyway, regarding MacGPG, it's a great software even at 0.3.x. I can  only commend the creators for the effort they have put into it so  far. Now to prevent that others get bitten like I was I will suggest  to the authors that they will build recommended practices into the  software. So after creating a key it could prompt the user to export  a copy, print a hard copy and create a revocation certificate. The  deletion error could be fixed, and before deleting a key, the  software could warn of the implications and advice to create a backup  copy first somewhere else. Before uploading to a server it could  explain the implications of that. And before downloading a key it  could again explain some more of the meaning.
You're absolutely right. It wasn't meant to be inflammatory, nor was  I in an angry mood or something. I was trying to be straight-forward  with my reasoning. But after rereading my post when it came back I  bit my lip and felt offended by my own words. Ouch!
So, please, if somebody took offense at my post, it really was not  meant like that. My apologies.

Thanks John. I will.
Regarding my personal web of trust: I get a clearer picture now and  for starter I'll exchange keys directly with my friends.
As for the "unwanted keys" for my e-mail address. At least for now I  know that I was the one who put them there. So if somebody uses them  to encrypt messages (because he or she thinks like I did that any  public key with the right e-mail address assigned to it is good  enough), it's not like someone unauthorized would be able to read  these messages. Nobody can read them. That's only semi-bad, not  really bad, if you know what I mean. (c:
Coming as a newbie to all of this, I'd say there's a long way to go  until this whole thing is ready for my Mom to use it. And I think  that's what we eventually want to do, right? That encrypted messaging  becomes the norm, not the exception.

I can more and more see that thanks to everybody's willingness on  this list to explain.
And documentation should be part of the whole process. There is so  much to understand about private and public and passphrase and UID  and e-mail access and fingerprint and web of trust and delete/revoke/ disable and ...
It will take some serious effort to make this practical for average Joe.
By the way, I do work in IT with a bunch of Sun boxes and databases,  just never dove into mail encryption until recently. Now if I mess up  so badly, then average Joe will, too. Or maybe not, because he or she  will give up before that. And he wouldn't look for hidden config  directories to delete them from the command line.
I will suggest to the MacGPG team, that such clear information is  also added into the software process, not just a help file. Again, it  is great software and there's plenty room from 0.3 to 1.0 for such  usability fixes.
