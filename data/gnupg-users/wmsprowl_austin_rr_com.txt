@_subject: problem getting gpg to work 
I have a zipped file that I un zipped and then notice the file types are
I installed the gpg and un tarred it in a different location where the zip
folder is, does that matter?
Also, what command do I use to unzip the gpg file ?
When I ungpg or gz the file I need to be a txt file for importing into
Many thanks
