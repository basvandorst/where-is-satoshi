@_subject: how to use gpg with a smartcard, when there is no smartcard 
I have a little problem with gnupg and smartcards.
I added to my key a signing subkey for my smartcard. This works great when the smartcard reader is attached to my computer, which is my home Now I have a copy of my secret key etc. on my usb stick and want to use my key for signing at work, without having a smartcard reader attached.
Gnupg complains now, that it can't find the smartcard reader, which is true at work, and I'm not able to use any signature function anymore.
Is there a way to tell gnupg, to use another subkey or whatever it needs, for signing?
There must be a possibility to sign something without having a smartcard reader attached, right?
Thx for your help and the great software,

Enigmail you can workaround, you just give him a key id like this
"0x!" <-- the "!" is important
Just like you do when you want to avoid the use your card (thx to the
guys here from the list, who gave me the hint ;))
