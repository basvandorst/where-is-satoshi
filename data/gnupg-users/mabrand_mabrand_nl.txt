@_subject: problem with static libgpg-error 1.9 on MinGW 
Hi,
I have been working on updating from libgpg-error-1.8  to libgpg-error-1.9 in mingw-cross-env. Mingw-cross-env is a cross building environment for MinGW. One of its features is that it builds static versions of all its libraries.
Anyway, I have a new runtime problem with applications linked to static libgpg-error-1.9.  Compiling and linking go fine, but at runtime in Windows, the program crashes. Under Wine, the program hangs keeps producing this message:
err:ntdll:RtlpWaitForCriticalSection section 0x473374 "?" wait timed out in thread 0009, blocked by 0000, retrying (60 sec). I'm pretty sure this happens before main().
Any easy example is tests/basic.c from libgcrypt-1.4.6.
I would be grateful for some insights into this problem or hints about how to do further troubleshooting.
