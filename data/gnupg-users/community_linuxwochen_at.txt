@_subject: scdaemon troubles 
i'm using a opengpg smartcard with gpg for signing, decryption and ssh
after a clean boot everything works fine...
but after a suspend to disk under linux using the hibernate script and
the kernel suspend option(s) i have the a strange problem
ok...at first it does not work...
then i kill the scdaemon: now i get the pinentry prompt but afterwards a
error message "agent admitted failure to sign with the key" (when i do
now i kill scdaemon again: now everything works as it should...
haveing to kill the deamon twice is a bit strange...
so my question is, does anybody have a glue what's going on or should i
do some debugging myself?
