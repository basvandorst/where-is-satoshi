@_subject: permissions of *.gpg files 
Hello gnupg-users,
I have a problem with encrypt files (or anything).
GnuPG can't read *.gpg files by permissions.
What the permissions and owner i have for *.gpg files?
How i can run GnuPG for creating *.gpg files with more other owner
that execute owner?
stan $ /usr/local/bin/gpg --no-secmem-warning --homedir=/home/web/stan/
.gnupg --armor --always-trust --yes -r Pavel --encrypt-files /home/web
gpg: WARNING: unsafe permissions on homedir "/home/web/stan/.gnupg"
gpg: /home/web/stan/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: can't access: Permission denied
gpg: fatal: can't init trustdb: trust database error
secmem usage: 1408/1408 bytes in 2/2 blocks of pool 1408/16384
