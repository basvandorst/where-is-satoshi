@_subject: Meta and Trusted Introducer 
i have a question about meta & trusted introducers and gnupg.
How am i able to sign a key and let him a trusted or a meta introducer for me ?
Why want i have gnupg to do that ?
I want to have a RootCA (that's simple: i can full trust that key, from users
sight) ,
but for organizational reasons i need a SubCA.
The users sign the RootCA as a meta-introducer and the RootCA signs the SubCA as
a trusted-introducer.
At last the SubCA signs the users key "normal".
Is this possible with gnupg ?
