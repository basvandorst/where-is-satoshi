@_subject: question about expired key 
While creating a new key with GNUPG, I choose to have it expire on
August 19, 5 pm (this was obviously a while ago, well before August
19). I even included a comment that states that this key would expire
on the aforementioned date. I then uploaded the public key to a
Problem is, it's been well past Aug 19 and I still don't have any
indication that this key has expired. A search on the MIT public key
server shows the key itself, but does not indicate that this key has
Any ideas? I created this key as a test to learn more about GNUPG and
didn't mean to use it on a regular basis...
If anyone wants to check it out, the key in question is for the email

@_subject: PGP 8.1 message 
I am having some problems with messages and keys created/encrypted
using PGP 8.1. I was, for example, sent a public key block exported
from PGP 8.1 and gnupg refused to import that key into my keyring,
giving me the message "gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found". I had to
install PGP 9.0, import the keys into that, export them from PGP 9.0
and then was able to import it into gnupg.
Similarly, for the message sent by the same user, I got an error
saying "gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.gpg: decrypt_message failed:
eof" when I tried to decrypt a text file he had sent to me containt an
ASCII-armored PGP 8.1 message.
I'm running GNUPG 1.4.1 on Mac OS X.
Appreciate the help...
