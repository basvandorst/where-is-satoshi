@_subject: GPG fails to verify clamav 
I downloaded clamav 0.90rc3 from
I want to verify the integrity of the downloaded file. When I do
gpg --keyserver random.sks.keyserver.penguin.de --verify it fails, saying this:
Ren? Berber, in message
  , says that my GPG installation is broken.
Can anyone tell me how I can fix it?
Thanks in advance.
I also tried using the protocol name in front of the keyserver address
(hkp://). It didn't work.

Thanks. The first couple of times it didn't work. Netstat said SYN_SENT for 62.94.26.10 port 11371 but didn't connect. The third time was the charm :-)
