Well, let me ask you this. Is it useful/useless/ridiculous/orwhat to
attach your public key as a sig at the end of an email, such as below?

@_subject: Gnupg-users Digest, Vol 111, Issue 2 
I used PGP years ago (when it was still free and the source-code was
readily available). I created key pairs. I haven't used any encryption
for quite some time, and now I'm trying to move back into using it.
I'm beginning to learn about GPG, and I transferred my key pairs to
GPG. But, these are old keys. I should probably create new ones. Is
there any good reason I should keep my old decryption keys? (Hope this
doesn't sound too elementary).

@_subject: gpg: Go ahead and type your message 
I'm sure this has been a topic of inquiry many times, but I can't seem to
find useful information about it. I haven't used gpg command line for a
long time (I actually haven't used gpg much at all in the past few years,
as I've had a Windows machine, and I just don't trust the OS), but I have
gpg on my android phone. It utilizes the terminal. When I type in gpg
(return) I get the message that I placed in the subject line. I'm not
really sure what I do at that point. If I use Ctrl C, the program
terminates. If I hit CtrlZ, I think it suspends the program (but I'm not
Would/could I use this area to type a text message that I would then,
subsequently, encrypt/sign/save? If so, where could I find a set of basic
commands to use with this (what appears to be) text editor?
If this isn't what it's intended for, what's it for? Thanks for bearing
with me.
