@_subject: Announcing GPG-DIALOG.PL 
Fellow GPG Enthusiasts,
I have written a simple menu driven interface to GPG
that I find easier to use than memorizing the command
line. You may find it useful too. It is at
ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/GnuPG/gpg-dialog.pl. This script is written in generic Perl and should run
on both the Unix and Win32 platforms. The script is
essentially self documenting.
Do use it and give me your feedback at this email
