@_subject: Please Help - how do I unsubscribe to this mailing list? 
You know, this issue comes up *way* *too* *often*.
How about redesigning the web page to make it easier to figure this out? Granted, it /does/ say right there, "To unsubscribe from Gnupg-users, enter your subscription email address:), but it's buried beneath all the other information.
Clearly there are many people going to this site and not finding what they want after a few seconds of scanning. Wouldn't it make sense to create another highlighted heading titled "Unsubscribing to Gnupg-users" so everyone could figure this out with minimal effort?
Just a suggestion.
