@_subject: Opening the Gnupg interface on linux 
Hello everybody, very new to linux, and pretty unfamiliar with gnupg still,
only used a few times. Yesterday i was able to open an actual window of
Gnupg through my terminal with a command similar to ~/.gnupg    now when i
enter this it tells me this is a directory and wont do anything with it,
any help?
