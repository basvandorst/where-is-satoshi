@_subject: Howto integrate (G/P)GP into sendmail -D?! 
Hi there!
  I just stopped by the webpages, so please
  give me a cc:Eisert THANX!
   Actually i wonder how to integrate the
   PGP stuff into a sendmaildaemon, since
   i've several users in an intranet and want
   to automatically crypt just the outgoing
   mails... is there a good FAQ about this?!
   BTW, is this stuff usable for VPN's?!
    (FreeBSD/Linux)
   Thanks in advance!
