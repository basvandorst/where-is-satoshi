@_subject: Remove photos from OpenPGP key in the keyservers 
I have made the mistake of adding the same photo with different file
sizes using Enigmail and export it to the servers.
I have already deleted two of the three photos using the CLI, but the
key in the server still has three photos and a size of 70 kB.
Is there anyone I could contact to export this attached public key which
only has one photo?
Kind regards,
