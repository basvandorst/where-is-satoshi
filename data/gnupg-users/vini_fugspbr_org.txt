@_subject: Problems to import and export private keys using GnuPG v2. 
Hi guys,
I have just installed FC6 with GnuPG v2 and am now having problems to import my previous private keys, funnily the same problems happens if I try to export the key that I generated using gpg2.
When I try to import the key I get a message saying that "importing secret keys not allowed" - see below. The same happens if I try to export a private $ gpg --import private.pgp
gpg: importing secret keys not allowed
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:       secret keys read: 1
I think I must be missing something very small as importing and exporting keys should be trivial. Would anyone know the solution for this?
Thanks a lot,
