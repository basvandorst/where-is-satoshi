@_subject: insecure memory 
I get a message saying that my memory is insecure when I use the gpg
utility. What is it really complaining about, should I worry about this,
and if so, is there a fix?
Thanks. Steve.

@_subject: understanding what gnugp can do 
I'm new to this software pcakage and looking through the minihowto it
looks like gnupg performs the basic encryption and decryption work
but is not part of a mail system persay. Can someone point me to a
a Free Software mail client which interfaces with gnupg? If I'm
using an existing mail client which uses pgp, can openpg be a dropin
replacement like openSSH is for ssh?
Thanks. Steve.
