@_subject: OpenPGP card problem 
Hi to all,
I've just subscripted this list after a few days spent looking for a
solution to my problem:
I've just bought a OpenPGP card and a card reader (SCR 335) to use with my
Ubuntu 9.04 laptop.
I've installed the udev scripts, as explained in the fsfe howto (
I've used gpg to set-up the first data on the card: Name, Language, PIN,
etc, but when I've tried to change the Admin PIN the behaviour of the
software became strange; mainly gpg doesn't want to change the PIN, nor the
Admin PIN.
I paste an example:

Hi, just to inform that I've tried also on windows with the correct drivers
for the card reader and the last version of gnupg for windows...
Is there anybody out with the same problem/a solution?

Hi to all,
do you know if there problems installing GnuPG on AIX 6.10? Which libraries
does it needs? Is there a pre-build package to speed-up the installation?

============================== START ==============================
Hi all,
I'm a little bit in trouble because I'd like to sync all my data (secring,
pubring, and so on) between my home pc and my work laptop.
I tried to make a symbolic link for pubring.gpg (secring.gpg isn't a big
issue, is not modified so often) to a DropBox folder, or an USB key but
seems that seahorse mess up everything creating a pubring.gpg~ file and a
new keyring.
So I'm looking for another front-end that allows me to use two pc, and that
can "support" seahorse, firegpg and so on.
If you have any suggestions, are all welcomed, otherwise I'll start to
create a little program (I always want to learn gtk) to do this.
