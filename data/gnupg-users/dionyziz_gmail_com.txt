@_subject: Viewing a key revocation reason 
What is the canonical way of viewing a key's revocation reason? I
found a command in the wild [1] to do it, but it seems that there must
be a better way.
Thanks for your time,
Dionysis Zindros.

@_subject: Multiple GPG public keys with one private keys 
You can have multiple public/private key pairs for your public
identities. Then you can maintain a secret public/private key pair
that links your identities together. Encrypt the private keys of your
public identities with the public key of your secret identity and
publish them. Then all you need to decrypt any message sent to the
public key of any of your public identities is the private key of your
secret identity. Simply use your secret identity private key to
decrypt the secret key of your public identity (which is a published
encrypted message) and subsequently use that private key to decrypt
the message that was communicated to you.
This could be easily automated, but I'm not aware of any
implementations that currently do that. However scripting it should
not be too hard.
Finally, mathematically, in the bitcoin world, we've seen hierarchical
deterministic keys. I see no reason why they could not be adopted in
GPG also, although the bitcoin implementation requires use of elliptic
curve keys. However, no implementation exists for GPG as far as I'm
