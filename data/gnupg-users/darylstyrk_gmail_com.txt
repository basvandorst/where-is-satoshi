I have looked at the ASCII Ribbon Campaign which asks people to include
the following in their sig.                        _
ASCII ribbon campaign ( )
 against HTML e-mail   X
                      / \
I suppose something could be started to also educate the GP of why it
might be worth more than 'heard about it' for signing and encryption.
