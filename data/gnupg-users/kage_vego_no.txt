@_subject: invalid packet (corrupt file?) 
I'm trying to decrypt a symmetrically encrypted file, but get the following
error message(s):
C:\gpg\gpg>gpg -v -o c:\out.bkf -d d:\data.bkf.gpg
gpg: CAST5 encrypted data
gpg: encrypted with 1 passphrase
gpg: original file name='data.bkf'
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=63)
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=66)
gpg: WARNING: message was not integrity protected
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=37)
The outfile is written, but only partially.
Does this simply mean that the .gpg file is corrupt and that the archive can
be recovered? It has been burned on a dvdrom, and I had some issues getting
3GB+ file burned.
This is gnupg 1.4.0 running on Windows XP
The error messages aren't all that informative, not even in verbose mode.
Thanks for all help!

@_subject: invalid packet - ignore errors? 
*Is it possible to make gnupg ignore errors when decrypting files?*

Note: I sent this earlier, but got no response. If someone could help, or point
me to any resources of help, I'd be grateful!
