@_subject: Error with SimpleSecure 
I was looking for a simple script to send the output of an order form
(cc to me.  I found SimpleSecure and followed all the directions to
get gnupg working.  I tested it myself by encrypting a file on the server
then sending it to my local machine to decrypt.  I then proceeded to use
SimpleSecure's test form in ReadMe.html.  I entered in all the info it
wanted, using my own public key.  I hit the submit and everything seems
fine until I get the email.  This is what I get:
This message was encrypted using SimpleSecure 1.5.
gpg: Invalid option "-feat"
I can't figure out what's wrong.  Can anyone help me?
Also, since I'm going to be sending myself submissions signed by my own
pub key, is it safe to delete the secring.gpg file off the server?
Thanks in advance for everyone's help.

Sorry about that previous message.  That's what I get from jumping into
things.  Anyway, I fixed the problem by switching to GSecure.cgi.  What a
great thing it is to figure something out :)
Well, if someone can answer my question below, that would be great.

Sorry, I mean to say encrypt with my public key on the server.  When it
gets emailed to me, I'll then decrypt it with my secret key.  What I want
to know is if theres any problem with leaving my secret key on the shared
server (where hundreds of people use it).
