you can also set a configuration variable in /etc/rc.conf.  it's name is
rand_irq, and you can put in there:  "1 5 10 11 12 14 15", or you can say:
"rndcontrol -s 1 -s 5 -s 10..." either manually or in your /etc/rc.local.
now, does anybody recall the [freebsd-]command which tells which interrupt
gets called how many times (gee, i keep forgetting...)?

i like pgp5 because it lets one choose between several matching keys to
import when given an ambiguous string argument.  i still use it just
because it queries the server and returns the number i need for gpg, but
this can't be the most sensible thing to do.  btw, i don't have an ldap

yes.  furthermore, one needs to put gnupg's tmp-files where no gangster can
get at'em.

you might want to set the sticky bit.  that way, only accounts which
created files can purge them.

when i import some key, gpg outputs a line saying:
[IMPORT]: 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
what does this mean?

sorry to bug you, but my recent q to the topic was wrong-worded, this is my
next try:
when importing keys, gpg outputs several lines of status-info, one of which
looks like:
[gnupg] import_res 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   (numbers might be wrong).
what, known ones, is the meaning of this conundrum?
