@_subject: importing keys for use in gpg 
i'm having trouble importing keys for use in gpg.  i have a file called
herb  that looks like this:
;-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----  Version: 2.6.3a   ;-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- (munged with semicolons so it doesn't trip up mua filters)
with someone's public key in it.  i got it by fingering them.  now, how do
i add this to my keyring so i can encrypt mail and send it to them?  when
i try [jon jon]$ gpg --import herb gpg: Warning: using insecure memory! gpg: invalid radix64 character 00 skipped gpg: key 22B730A5: unsupported
public key algorithm gpg: key 22B730A5: no valid user IDs gpg: this may be caused
by a missing self-signature gpg: Total number processed: 1 gpg:  w/o user IDs: 1
[jon jon]$
i double checked and i have already signed my own key and set it up so i
trust myself fully (i should have done this, right?).
my manpages don't work:
No man page due to missing docbook-to-man  and the gpg-howto doesn't say much more about importing keys, which i find
odd because supposedly that's one of the more frequently used tasks.
pgpi also lets you do things like:
pgpk -a finger://example.com/user
which is pretty nice when the person who's pubkey you want isn't on a
keyserver but in his finger output.
any pointers on any of these topics would be appreciated.

@_subject: compiling idea,rsa modules for use with gnupg 
i need to compile the idea and rsa modules for use with gnupg.
however, i cannot find the document that tells how to do this and
where to find the source files.  i looked on the gnupg site for a
while.  can someone please send me a pointer to where this documentation is?

@_subject: subject line -- to hide or not to hide 
hah, i've never heard of an rfc for an rfc before!
that said, i think that it's a good idea to develop some sort of
subject system.

@_subject: aka - having the same keypair serve for 2 email addresses 
Hash: SHA1
sorry if this is a faq - if so, please point me in the right direction.  i
have two email accounts, one for work and one for personal.  i currently
have two different keypairs, one for each.  i'd like to simplify so that i
can use the same keypair and so that my 2 email addresses show up as
"aka" as such:
