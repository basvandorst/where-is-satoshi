@_subject: (1) BAD signature and (2) auto SHA1 
Hi, GnuPG people!
I can easily verify the signature for almost all messages that I receive (I use mutt 1.2.5.1i + gnupg 1.2.1). But there are few messages that I can not verify automatically. So, I would like to ask you two questions.
1. First group of messages returns "BAD signature". What is the best way to find out whose fault it is (as in famous Russian question)? It is my fault, or it is the fault of my correspondent?
2. Second group of messages contains messages like this:
    -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
    Hash: SHA1
    Beginning of the message...
    End of message.
    -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----
    Version: GnuPG v1.2.1 (GNU/Linux)

    6YC96a+V6MbxlwJpThv1m3w=
    =HEsh
    -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----
So, my question is: how can I verify the messages like this one automatically? Are there some rules or something that I can put into my ~/.procmailrc or my ~/.muttrc?
Thank you in advance,
