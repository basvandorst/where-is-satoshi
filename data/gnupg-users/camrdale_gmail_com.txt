I have an armored detached signature that I want to dearmor (without
using the original plain text). I can do it on the command line with
the --dearmor option, but how can I do it in GPGME? Is it possible?

Thanks, I was aware of that, but hoping for a built-in method that
would do it better, including checking the checksum for me. Oh well, a
dirty hack it is then. ;)
