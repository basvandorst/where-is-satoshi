@_subject: Need to test with a PGP Universal Server user 
Hi folks,
  I need help to test the interoperability of my custom PGP app with other PGP apps.  One example is that I like to test my app with a PGP Universal Server user.  I'd be interested in testing with other 'not-for-free' PGP products too.  Is anybody available for a quick test?  If so, please let me

Does anybody know how I can get my hands on a PGP Universal Server test harness?  I would like to test my app with PGP Universal Server, and finding users to test with has been difficult.  Any ideas?
