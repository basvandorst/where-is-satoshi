@_subject: Renewal of revocation certificate required after adding a new 
Recently I have added a new identity to my GPG key pair. Can I still
use my existing revocation certificate with my key pair or do I have to
renew it because of the added identity?
I am supposing the revocation certificate just refers to my main
key ID regardless of the identities belonging to the key pair. I have
discussed this with some colleagues but we could not fully clarify the
Thanks for your feedback.

Thanks to all confirming my assumption.
To be honest I have little knowledge about what is going on when a key
pair is revoked. I just know that I would have to import the revocation
certificate to my public key ring. And as soon as I have freshly
published it to a keyserver my key pair is marked revoked.
I suppose the revocation certificate being a kind of replacement of my
public key. As it is bound to the fingerprint of a key pair it can mark
the key pair revoked as a whole. I suppose such a key can never be
activated again. This is somewhat opposed to a key pair with all of its
identities being revoked. Some or all identities could later be
activated again and - moreover - this key pair could later even get
new identities not being revoked.
I would greatly appreciate anybody to confirm or correct my rough
understanding of the revocation certificate and process.
Nice side information.

Hhm, it's working on my machine both with "hkp://" and with port number:
# gpg --keyserver hkp://pgp.mit.edu:11371 --search-keys torbrowser at torproject.org
gpg: data source: (1)	Tor Browser Developers (unknown) (2)	Tor Browser Developers (3)	Tor Browser Developers (signing key) Keys 1-3 of 3 for "torbrowser at torproject.org".  Enter number(s), N)ext, or Q)uit > My GnuPG version is 2.1.18.
Under Debian Stretch I have solved similar keyserver related issues
with the option "standard-resolver" in ~/.gnupg/dirmngr.conf. I hope it
