@_subject: File Transfer with SSH1 
Hi to all,
this is not a specifiq question for this forum, but maybe someone can help
I´m trying to do SCP (like FTP) but via SSH1. I´ve found so many clients
that let me do Telnet with SS1 but not File Transfers.
I´ve found for Linux one client (SecPanel) that works fine, but I´m looking
for Windows NT or 2000 with same funcionality.
So please If somebody knows any I would appreciate so much the information.
Thanks so much.
