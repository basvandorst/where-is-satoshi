@_subject: Problems with armored Keyrings 
it seems, that gpg is unable to work with ASCII-armored keyrings.
Neither i could list the contained Keys nor i could import them to my
keyring. Here is one Example of the error message:
[nirgalvallis:~] alex% gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring ~/dsm.gpgkey.asc --list-keys
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=2d)
gpg: keydb_search_first failed: Ungültiges Paket
I could reproduce this Error with gpg 1.2.1 on MacOS X and WinNT 4.0
and gpg 1.0.6 on Linux.
I tested with 2 different Keyrings. One of them i created using gpg
1.2.1 on MacOS X. You could find it at
 (armored)
The other Keyring someone created using PGP 8 at Windows. It's armored
too and produces the same error. Both Keyrings only contain Public
Is this a known bug?
