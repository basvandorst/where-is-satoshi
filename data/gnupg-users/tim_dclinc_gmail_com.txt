@_subject: automate pga clipboard 
i am using GPA 0.9.9 to encrypt text file data. i copy/paste my text into the clipboard and hit encrypt. Im prompted to choose public key. After choosing, i get the following results (less the blah blahs).
I would like to do this from a command line so i can do unattended. can this be done? does anyone have examples of syntax?
