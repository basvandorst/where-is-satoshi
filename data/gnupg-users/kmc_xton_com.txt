Hi Everyone,
Can someone help me with installing GPG on a HP-UX11 system? I want to
use the Entropy Gathering Daemon (EGD) and I think I understand it is
possible to do this using the "./configure ... --enable-static-rnd=egd"
flag. Would someone mind confirming this for me?
If GPG is already installed on a HP-UX11 system without useing the
--enable-static-rnd=egd, is there any way to configure GPG to use EGD
after GPG has been installed?
THank you in advance,

As an update to this:
I visited egd.sourceforge.net and its now very clear how to do this.
THanks for your patience.

Does anyone know how I can verify that I am generating keys using the
entropy gathering daemon?
I am familiar with GPG and Linux, but will now be using HP-UX. And in
addition to following the instructions for correct configuration and
install, I would also like to test that new keys are being generated with
the increased randomness from EGD. Does anyone have a suggestion on how I
can do this?
Thanks in advance,
