@_subject: HP-UX installation error of gnupg version 1.4.12  
Good Morning!
I am attempting to install gnupg-1.4.12 on an HP-UX box. I have been able to do the "./configure" and "make" steps of the installation. However, I am getting the error below when attempting to do the make install step (as SU), which seems to indicate that the process can not locate bison. However, I have bison installed. Running a whereis command for bison lists it in the normal directories...
Has anyone else attempted the installation on an HP-UX? Do I need to edit a file or two to point it to the installation of bison?
Thanks ever so much!

This might be a timestamp/make problem.  If you don't care about i18n you may simply do
  ./configure --disable-nls
Bison is only required for gettext and should not be called unless there is a problem with timestamps etc.

Thank you, that is all it took!

Can anyone tell me how to remove myself from this list? I tried sending an email to the email listed on the site, but I haven't gotten a response and still get the emails.

The GNU project is pleased to announce the availability of Libgcrypt version 1.6.2.  This is a maintenance release to fix problems found in the recently released versions.
Libgcrypt is a general purpose library of cryptographic building blocks.
It does not provide any implementation of OpenPGP or other protocols.
Thorough understanding of applied cryptography is required for proper use Libgcrypt.
Noteworthy changes in version 1.6.2 (2014-08-21) ================================================
* Map deprecated RSA algo number to the RSA algo number for better
   backward compatibility.
* Support a 0x40 compression prefix for EdDSA.
* Improve ARM hardware feature detection and building.
* Fix powerpc-apple-darwin detection
* Fix building for the x32 ABI platform.
* Support building using the latest mingw-w64 toolchain.
* Fix some possible NULL deref bugs.
Source code is hosted at the GnuPG FTP server and its mirrors as listed at  .  On the primary server the source tarball and its digital signature are:
ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.6.2.tar.bz2 (2418k)  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.6.2.tar.bz2.sig
That file is bzip2 compressed.  A gzip compressed version is here:
ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.6.2.tar.gz (2874k)  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.6.2.tar.gz.sig
Alternativley you may upgrade using this patch file:
ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.6.1-1.6.2.diff.bz2 (17k)
In order to check that the version of Libgcrypt you are going to build is an original and unmodified one, you can do it in one of the following
* Check the supplied OpenPGP signature.  For example to check the
   signature of the file libgcrypt-1.6.3.tar.bz2 you would use this
   command:
     gpg --verify libgcrypt-1.6.3.tar.bz2.sig
   This checks whether the signature file matches the source file.  You
   should see a message indicating that the signature is good and made
   by the release signing key 4F25E3B6 which is certified by my well
   known key 1E42B367.  To retrieve the keys you may use the command
   "gpg --fetch-key finger:wk at g10code.com".
* If you are not able to use GnuPG, you have to verify the SHA-1
   checksum:
     sha1sum libgcrypt-1.6.3.tar.bz2
   and check that the output matches the first line from the
   following list:
cc31aca87e4a3769cb86884a3f5982b2cc8eb7ec  libgcrypt-1.6.2.tar.bz2
cdaf2bdd5f34b20f4f9d926536673c15b857d2e6  libgcrypt-1.6.2.tar.gz
302592ec4183b727ad07bdd47fc4d50d717f42e2  libgcrypt-1.6.1-1.6.2.diff.bz2

  Many thanks to all who contributed to Libgcrypt development, be it bug fixes, code, documentation, testing or helping users.
Happy hacking,
