This is why there's option to disclose a message's symmetric session key.

In GPG you can set the key owner to 'I do not trust signatures by this key'.
I don't know if it works as expected (i.e. negative weight on signature).

the message is signed then encrypted
no and it should not encryption is the second step after signing because it hides the originator
this way.
this proves nothing at all
there is no way/need to multiple encrypt
there's no simple way (as it shouldn't be) to multiple sign
possibly, although this is rarely done

but you can't do this to make a message that will be decrypted to the base
plaintext in one pass
It is bad on the grounds of OpenPGP default threat model.
My question is: what do you want to prove (or prevent) with  the
sign-encrypt-sign model? What do you do with messages that look like you
aren't the designated recipient, or worse you are visibly not their
designated recipient. Throw away them for they are invalid?
You want to detect it, prevent it, prove it or what?
Define your threat/trust model first. Analyse sikmilarites and
dissimilarities with PGP threat model. Compare with other analyses (your
approach looks a lot similar to one 'PGP vulnerability' that gets widly
announced every two years or so).

Hash: SHA1
It is described in the two-part documentation to the original PGP 2.
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
My point is that you (your mail client) are trying to do a thing, that
you won't know is right or wrong. Sometimes the originator wants to spread
the information, sometimes not. Sometimes the man in the middle is doing the
forward with good intent, sometimes, not. How do you (your mail client) warn
a user 'when this is needed'?
How you will detect a difference when someone reencrypts the message to me,
and the originator encrypts the message to me but won't sign it later
(nobody does this, as I see as long as I use PGP)?
OpenPGP defines a way to mark the message that its circulation should be
limited. It is called 'for your eyes only'.
But why? Why you worry about this, but you don't worry that someone's
machine in the message path isn't compromised?
- From the standpoint of usability it is a very bad thing to flood end user with lots of uninteligible information. You yourself said that your user is
no cryptography expert. He won't know what your mail client is talking
It is very easy to write a software that will present a lots of information
to the user and make him decide. But the average user doesn't like this. He ehas say 1000 messages to deal - a day and don't want to have to deal with a
single one more that is necessarily needed.
Since your first mail I try to devise a larger scale threat model that
involves checking circulation paths on the receiver side. I can't. I can do
this for limiting circulation on sender's side. In PGP this is done via
'eyes only', elsewhere it is called DRM.
It is different in a way that sign+encrypt message can be 'opened'
(deciphered and signature verified) in one decryption pass.
A typo. It should say 'widely'. Yes, I consider this paper to be bogus. I don't consider the problem to be
bogus, but I think that PGP and mail clients should not be doing lawyers'
jobs - expressing important information in a way so both the originator
and recipient can't be contextually mistook for someone else.
We can't solve a social problem with technology.
If you want to approach the problem, make a good implementation for 'for
your eyes' option for both sending and receiving messages. Include From and
To headers in a message when signing it. Check the included headers when verifying the signature.

@_subject: Key with no signing possibilities 
Why they should? When you'll be decrypting the session key
they plant you a bug in the keyboard or place a TEMPEST van nearby. Then no
point in asking for your passphrase.
Have you lately checked all your machines for small but visible $80
keylogger from thinkgeek?

I was thinking of situation when the key is identified to deliberately make
false signatures (on keys with bogus IDs).

I try to specify the key in the most generic way possible. Okay, I'll confess:
I'm working on a simple XML markup for signature policies, and I think the most
important element of this is to specify a key in a way that user will be able to
obtain it - by hand or autmoatically.

You are reinventing MS Palladium/NGSCB here.
It is not a solution.

isnt the preferences system designed to address the situation? (I assume
that LANC GPG supports the obligatory 3DES/SHA1 suite).

@_subject: Prefered decryption key? 
No, your data is encrypted in a way that can be decrypted using the private
key correspodning to the public key the data is encrypted with.
You may decrypt the data reencrypt the data to the other key, though.

@_subject: FW: How to add an X.509 cert to an OpenPGP key (was: [Enigmail] 
I don't think so. Embedding X.509 data in OpenPGP keys is still a feature of
commercial PGP.
