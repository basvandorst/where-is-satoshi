@_subject: gpg-agent 2.1 persistent socket between sessions 
I would like to know what is the correct way to get a gpg-agent 2.1 persistent socket between session ?
I have some cronjob that must use a key stored in the agent.
Actually the first time a gpg-agent is launch, it create a socket in /run/user/PID/gnupg/ but when i logout this folder is cleaned by systemd and then if i come back i can't reconnect to the running gpg-agent because the socket has disapear...
This problem appears since i uprade to Ubuntu 17.10, it seems before systemd don't clean the /run/user/PID folder so the socket persist between session.
I don't think it is an Ubuntu bug, it seems to be a normal behavior that systemd clean this folder so how i could get a persistent socket for my gpg-agent ?
thanks in advance for your help.

Ok great enabling lingering works, i don't know why but on previous Ubuntu version lingering is not enabled but the /run/user/PID folder was not cleaned...
Thanks !

Have you tried to tell `systemd` to "linger" your user account?
