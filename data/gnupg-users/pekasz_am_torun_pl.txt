@_subject: problems with sub keys (fwd) 
I have installed just gnupg on Solaris. For the cooperating
with pine I'm using pgp4pine software
Here is one problem with sub keys. If I were encrypt or
encrypt and signs with recipients pgp pgp4pine has problems
to choose key because the are present pub as well as sub.
My question. Is sub necessary, or I can ti remove and
use only pub of recipiens (witout secondary key)
After key-gen command I have created sub too. Does it make
like my problems, while the peoples need to sign e-mail
with my public key? Can I remove my own sub and left
only primary public key (pub) or I should left both
pub and sub?
Best Wishes

@_subject: Newbie question: GnuPG and PGP 
thank you for your posting, I have directly this same problem.
There are legal possibility to use PGP 5.x or 6.x on UNIX
server for US or Canadian peoples only. I'm from Poland. For
UNIX users PGP 5.x or 6.x can be used without limitations.
So, I had a concept to install on Windows station PGP 5.x
and for UNIX server, whom I administrate GNUpg 1.0.4 to
hope, that this let to interchange keys, signed and encrypted
messages between server equipped with GNUpg and Windows-stations
with PGP. The steps, which I have made are similar and effect
this same. My friend, who has received a mail signed with GNUpg was
validating the signature as "NOT OK", but this same verification
made with GNUpg - as "OK"
I think, that is big problem to discussion on list, so
let me advice you to subscribe a list, because I suppose,
that is not possible to solve with one e-mail.
I wanna get answer from list as you.
                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
