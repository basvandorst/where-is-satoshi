@_subject: Question about keyservers on Windows 
Hash: SHA1
Hello Everyone,
I'm a new member of the list but I've been using GPG for a bit now on
Linux.  I recently installed it on my Windows machine and needed to
revoke a compromised key. When I tried to send the information to the
keyserver, I got the following error:
Sending of keys failed
gpg: sending key 0078B6E4 to hkp server pool.sks-keyservers.net
gpg: system error while calling external program: No such file or directory
gpg: WARNING: unable to remove tempfile (out)
\gpg-A57D4D\tempout.txt': No such file or directory
gpg: no handler for keyserver scheme `hkp'
gpg: keyserver send failed: keyserver error
I am using the latest version of GPG (downloaded from the site) and I
KNOW this works on Linux.
Can anyone help?

@_subject: Syncing secring for mobile users 
Hi Thomas,
What about storing your entire secring on a removable drive and simply
pointing gpg to that drive when you need to. If you're using more than
one computer I would assume there might be some times when others have
access to that machine so maybe storing your private key on a machine
might not be the best practice. A removable drive might be the answer
for you.
To answer your question, I've not gotten my workflow quite down yet
either. It's been about 10 years since I last had to use encryption
technology and even then it was on a single, secure, machine that I had
near total control over and there were protocols in place for accessing
it. So I'm coming at this, essentially, as a new user.
Right now, once a day, I export my entire secring to a thumb drive and
then import it to my other computers. This seems to have worked for the
most part, though there have been a few glitches. I'm still in the
market for something better but that is what works for me at the moment.

@_subject: Allowing paste into pinentry-gtk-2? 
I don't have an answer to your question, Todd, but I have to second
your frustration with not being able to paste to the pinentry. I've
never really seen a good justification as to why paste has been
disallowed either so I'd love to see it implemented.

@_subject: Which release should we be using? 
Hash: SHA256
So I'm currently running 1.4.10 for GNU/Linux even though I know that
2.0 has been out for a while. I chose to stick with 1.4.10 and 1.4.11
because I don't like having to use pinentry since it doesn't support cut
and paste. My questions are these:
1) Is there any real reason why I *shouldn't* be using the 1.4.x branch
of GPG?
2) If I should be using 2.0, is there a way to disable pinentry so gpg
can work the way the 1.4.x releases do?

Hi Werner,
I'm not sure I can see how being able to cut and paste a passphrase is
in any way like not having a passphrase at all. My passphrases are
stored in a Keepass database that resides in a TrueCrypt container. It's
protected well. My actual key is protected by a 62 character passphrase
that I'd like to cut and paste into GPG. Considering all of that, I
think it's a bit extreme to say cutting and pasting a passphrase from
two heavily encrypted containers is such that you may as well not have a
passphrase at all.
Still, thanks for your input. I suppose I could always implement c+p in
my version of pinentry or I'll just stick with 1.4.x for a while.

Since I've never used Pinentry, I'm obviously missing something here.
While I'm aware that spying on X-Window is not too complicated, how does
manually entering a passphrase into Pinentry make snooping harder.
Admittedly, I've never looked at the code so I probably don't know the
whole story. Is entry into Pinentry vulnerable to traditional keylogging?

I read about this attack a few years ago on Bruce Scheiner's blog. It
scared the crap out of me then and it still worries me quite a bit. Of
course, it's just a variant of what we've been telling people forever
now: if the system is compromised, encryption is useless. Still, it's
pretty scary stuff.

Hash: SHA256
So in the course of another discussion on this group, I was told that I
might not actually need my 160+ random character passphrase for good
security. A few URL's were included, including this one
( on
password strength.
If I'm reading the article correctly, I would really only need a 13 to
16 random character password to achieve the 100+ year protection against
brute force attacks. Is that right? Am I really wasting THAT much effort
or am I reading this wrong?

The typical user most likely *does* believe files are locally
encrypted then sent to Dropbox. But isn't that still pretty
meaningless? If Dropbox is encrypting your file then you have to trust
that Dropbox either can't decrypt the file or that, if they can, they
would never under any circumstance compromise your security. One name:
If you don't encrypt it yourself using a tool that is *known* to be
secure then it really can't be trusted. Someone hacking a server is
really the least of your security worries.

@_subject: Storing secrets on other people's computers 
Does having possession of your secret key really make you less secure?
I mean the whole purpose of a passphrase is because you assume your
secret key is *not* safe simply being unprotected in your possession.
Law enforcement, hackers, even friends could *easily* get physical
access to your key so it's the passphrase that's of value.
I've actually thought about posting my key to Bittorrent in case I
ever lost it. It's economical and just as secure as sitting on my pc.
As long as you have a good passphrase, having physical possession of
your key gives an attacker no real advantage.

@_subject: private key protection 
Your private key being stolen isn't really that big of a deal. If you
have a very strong passphrase, possessing your private key gives an
attacker almost no leverage.  With a strong passphrase, the average
attacker isn't going to be able to break your key on modern hardware
and anyone who could break it probably doesn't need your private key
to decrypt your messages anyway.

Hi Everyone,
This is a stupid question I'm sure but I can't seem to find an answer
to it in the source code so I thought I'd ask here. When GnuPG is
selecting primes for RSA key generation, what parameters are set for
the primes? Is there a floor and a ceiling set for the numbers
generated? Please feel free to point me to the right place in code if
need be.

GPG can read and clearsign any file. Just put the information into a
file and then execute the given command against that file.

Hash: SHA512
Hello Everyone,
I'm having a devil of a time with Ubuntu 11.04 with GnuPG and need a bit
of help. This MIGHT be a problem with the Enigmail plugin but I think
it's probably something to do with my GnuPG configuration so I'm asking
here first.
Basically, I have GPG 1.4.11 installed. For some reason, I also have the
binary for gpg2 at /usr/bin/gpg2. However, my Enigmail is picking up
For some reason, every time I do anything to an encrypted message, I
have to re-enter my passphrase. If I open a message, I enter my
passphrase, then, when I reply to it, I have to enter it again. And to
send that reply? Yep, enter it again!
Obviously, something is amiss.
Can anyone lend me a hand and help me figure this out? I've even gone
as far as to rename the gpg2 binary so it couldn't be found by the
system, renamed the gpa.conf file (just in case) and added the
"no-use-agent" entry to my gpg.conf file with no result.
Help?!? Please!

@_subject: Stumped and need some help with agent 
Hi David,
Thank you for the help! So I went ahead and I downloaded gpa
(thankfully, I didn't need to compile it. It was in my distro's
repository) and installed it. I made the changes to the .conf file as
suggested.  When I typed 'which gpg-agent' to make sure I had agent
installed it told me it was in /usr/bin/gpg-agent. When I executed it,
I get the message 'gpg-agent is installed and running'. Everything
looks fine.
When I look in my process list, I don't see gpg-agent. And when I go
to Thunderbird and try to access encrypted messages, I still get
Enigmail's passphrase manager instead of pinentry. Note that I've told
Enigmail to use gpg-agent instead of its own manager but that makes no
difference.  The problem of having to enter my passphrase at every
step continues.
Does this look more like a problem with Enigmail than GnuPG?
Understand, I am not using GPG2 but rather 1.4.11.  However, it looks
like I have gpg2 installed (/usr/bin/gpg2).
Any other suggestions?

Wait...you expect me to read the man page? What kind of barbarian are
you, anyway?!? lol Just kidding. For some reason, with all my
troubleshooting, I never even considered reading the man page. I'll do
that and see what I can find. Thank you for the help!
Sounds good. I assume the way it's started now is on an 'as needed' basis?
I figured that out while going through some of the posts relating to
gpg-agent. Is this a permanent change? I know pinentry is supposed to be
a safer way to enter passphrases so I'm assuming that the mandatory use
of gpg-agent will continue on into future versions?
Let me ask this: are there any major security implications (aside from
sacrificing the security of pinentry) to hacking gpg2 to not use agent?
I'm not considering doing this as I don't see a real need but I'm curious.

@_subject: GnuPG on Mac OS 
So I've installed GnuPG on a friends Mac and, for the most part, it's
working fine. She can encrypt/decrypt/sign with no problems at all. But,
for some reason, every time she does one of those functions, she has to
re-enter her passphrase. She's using the Enigmail plugin for Thunderbird
and we set the 'remember passphrase for' option to 500 minutes but it's
ignoring it.
Am I missing something crucial here? How can I get it to remember her
password for a longer period. I know this sounds like an Enigmail
question but I'm asking here because I think it has to do with GPG-Agent
or some other component of the tools.
Can anyone help?

Thank you, Werner.  The system already has GPG installed and they  won't want a second copy, I'm sure. I thought GPG4Win added a new  context menu item that would allow easier file encryption. If not then  they don't need anything else.
