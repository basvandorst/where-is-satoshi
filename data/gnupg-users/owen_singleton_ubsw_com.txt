@_subject: Using IDEA 
We are trying to use the IDEA algorithm to decrypt a number of files =
sent to use.  We have obtained idea.c and compiled it, placed it in =
$HOME/lib and added the 'load-extension idea' line to the options file.  =
gpg is not able to find/load the extension though.  Could someone please =
give us a pointer or to?  I am sure the answer is very simple but we =
haven't been able to work it out.
We are using gpg 1.2.1 on Solaris 8 Unix.
