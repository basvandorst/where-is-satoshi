@_subject: Imported Secret Key?  Compatibility with 6.5? 
Hello all.
I am attempting to get GPG to work for me, but so far am having some
trouble.  Let me give you some background.
I created my keypair with PGP Freeware 6.5.2 (for windows).  To get GPG to
use these keys, I can either copy the keyfiles or ascii export and then
import them.  Either way seems to work fine.
Now, using GPG, there seem to be compatibility problems. When the recipient is another GPG user, the message can be decrypted just
fine.  If both encoded and signed, the signature comes out fine.  However,
if the message is cleartext signed, the signature is marked as bad.
Now, to make things interesting, the opposite happens when the recipient
is using PGP Freeware 6.5.  He is able to verify my plaintext signature
but when attempting to decrypt (signed or not), he gets an error,
"encrypted session key is bad" .. So, after a bunch of testing, I don't really know what the problem is.  Is
it that I generated my key with 6.5?  Is it an interoperability problem? Perhaps with those photo-ids that are embeded in keys?  What can I do
about this?  Scratch my key and make a new one?  I'd rather not do that if
I can avoid it.  Would that even help? Any assistance will be welcomed.
Thanks much,

@_subject: GPG & PGP 6.5.x (was: PGP 5.x and GnuPG) 
I can confirm this problem.  I was one of the people that emailed William.  I tested it with GPG 1.0.1 and PGP Freeware for Windows 6.5.2.  Perhaps
there is some kind of option I am missing or something?
I have the following settings in my options file:
load-extension rsa
load-extension idea
keyserver wwwkeys.us.pgp.net
Any suggestions?  Thanks.
