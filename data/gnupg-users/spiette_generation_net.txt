@_subject: gnupg and mutt's pgp_encryptself 
Content-Disposition: inline
I am using stock mutt 1.2.5.1 with gnupg 1.0.6 on a RH 7.3 system. Each
time I encrypt a message for someone it is stored encrypted for my
recepient on my $record mailbox, but not for myself. With mutt 1.2,
pgp_encryptself is no longer a valid setting. What I have to do to have
it encrypted for me too?
