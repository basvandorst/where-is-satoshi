@_subject: Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme integration? 
Is there a utility that integrates gnupg with ssss (Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme)?   And maybe using smartcards?  If not has anyone seen a HowTo that shows how to integrate them?

Thanks for all the input...  good stuff.
I can think of a bash script that
- generates the passphrase (using /dev/urandom) for a gnupg private key,
- pipe the random passphrase into ssss to generate the shares, threshold - and every time the passphrase is needed, combine t shares to recreate the original random passphrase.
A problem I see with this approach is that an attacker can easily modify the script  to output the shares... breaking confidentiality.
Even binary code can be reverse-compiled and re-engineered to spill the Does anyone know of techniques to protect code from being reverse engineered with standard off the shelf techniques...?

As well as backing up your private key and password on other electronic storage (CD/memory stick... encrypted of course), I recommend that you print your private key, a revocation certificate, and your passphrase on paper, and store that document in a safe place... a secure lock box, ... a safety deposit box in a bank.  I've had bad luck with CD/DVD media going bad, and consider them an unreliable resource simply because of integrity problems.
Also, you may want to use Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme to split up your passphrase among ***trusted*** friends, so that no single friend has the passphrase, but requires several of them to regenerate your passphrase when you loose your passphrase.  Trust, in this context, really is about, statistically, how often someone follows the rules set up to maintain a secure environment, and not what or who you feel good about or admire.
Trust is only created when you set up these types of structures... anything else is going on faith.

@_subject: Revocation certificates 
Generating a revocation certificate as soon as you generate your key pair is a wise thing to do, in case you lose control of your passphrase ... I did that.
My question is, if I edit my key pair... let's say I add a new uid to my key pair... do I need to generate a new revocation certificate or will the original revocation certificate work on the modified key pair?
