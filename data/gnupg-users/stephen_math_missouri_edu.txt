@_subject: Problems with a key or passphrase I was given 
I am in charge of maintaining a script that creates messages for a mailing list, and these messages are supposed to be signed using gnupg.  This is all stuff I was given, in particular, I did not create the keys.
The set up I have seems to work if I use a version 1.0.4, but not for any later version.  I get error messages, and I have no idea what they mean.  I am guessing that something is corrupted, and perhaps version 1.0.4 did not properly handle it.  If it is corrupted, I would like to know if it is possible to fix it without changing the public key.
This is (in effect) how the script uses gnupg:
cat passphrase message | gpg --passphrase-fd 0 --force-v3-sigs
--clearsign--no-secmem-warning --batch
and the response is
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=73)
gpg: keydb_search failed: invalid packet
gpg: key C380B4D8: secret key without public key - skipped
gpg: no default secret key: secret key not available
gpg: [stdin]: clearsign failed: secret key not available
If I run version 1.0.4 I still get error messages:
Reading passphrase from file descriptor 0
You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: "gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=73) near 1
gpg: read_keyblock: read error: invalid packet
gpg: enum_keyblocks failed: invalid keyring
[User id not found]"
but gnupg still produces a signed message as its output.
