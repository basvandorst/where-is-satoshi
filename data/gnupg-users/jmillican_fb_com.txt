Hi, I'm Jon - I work on OpenPGP support at Facebook. I thought you might be interested to hear that we now support fetching public keys via the Graph API.
Keys can be fetched from someone's profile "public_key" field, e.g. you could fetch my public key with the query:
  /1617090031?fields=public_key
If you would like to experiment with this, you can try it out with the Graph API Explorer at  (you'll need to be logged in to use the tool).
