@_subject: Perform only asymmetric encryption/decryption 
I'm not sure I totally understand your requiremens, though if you are
looking to run RSA encryption on strings and are not using any of the
authentication parts of gpg, then openssl is the way to go. I suspect it's
not possible with gpg's provided interface.
If using pgp is really more convenient then letting it do hybrid encryption
will be much easier though it sounds like you have a good reason for
wanting to avoid that.

@_subject: How to make "gpg --card-status" forget an old card 
I got a new Yubikee Neo and loaded my encryption key to it and
generated new signing and authentication keys. everytime I try to
decrypt a file using the new key, it asks me to insert the old key.
(which i don't have here).
When I run gpg --card-status I see that it still associates the key
with the old key:
~ ? gpg --card-status

I'd like to know how to make gpg forget about the old cards keys

@_subject: Getting rid of key stub when moving key to new smart card? 
I am having the same problem. The only way to make it see the key on
the new card that I have come across is to completely remove the
entire .gnupg directory and not restore any of it, then import the
public key and only then run gpg --card-status.
If I don't completely wipe everything out (including all other keys
and signatures) then the stub (if thats the right term for this) seems
to survive.

@_subject: Using gpg for ssh access 
When setting this up I missed the step of explicitly enabling ssh agent
mode in gpg agent so it would listen for connections from ssh (and pretend
to be the ssh agent) then I had to set the environment variable for the ssh
socket to the gpg agent socket. After a short while this grew tedious and I
installed envoy (arch Linux) to manage the gpg agent though there are many
other equally good ways of doing this.
Not having the agent working was really frustrating to figure out why it
would not use the key, so perhaps this could be something worth checking,
if only to double check that you are connecting to the correct agent.

@_subject: Primary and Signing Key on Different Smart Cards 
I have a similar setup and have been doing it successfully. I have two
yubikey neos with signing keys. I found that because of bugs in gpg 2.1 I
had to put the same signing key onto both neos. Once I did that it worked
smoothly. It would be preferable to use different keys and I'll do that if
these problems are fixed (and I haven't checked in a while, perhaps they
have been)
PS: the bug is that gpg will only use the newest signing key, rather than
the newest signing key that is available now.

@_subject: Prefer a currently available signing subkey? 
I had exactly the same problem, and there is an open bug about this (wanna
fix it?) I forgot the number.
I tried to solve it first by creating three copies of the master key. One
that knew about both signing keys, and one independent copy that knew about
each of the signing keys. So I could switch signing keys by switching which
copy of the master key I had in the current .gnupg directory. This was very
much too cumbersome.
Then I expired one of the keys and put the same signing key on both cards.
Juggling them got old fast.

So you weren't alike if you can do this (yes it works) rather you where
asking if you should ;-)
A hash of The message passes through near field magnetic induction which
does emit radio waves. Then a response is sent back containing the
description key for that message.  Perhaps someone here knows if a secure
channel is negotiated for this exchange. I'm guessing not.
With all such things it's useful to consider the overall situation for
yourself and decide if it protect against the threats that affect you.
My situation is fine with that risk, because there are easier ways to get
the key (rubber hoses and the usual discussion here)

using openkeychain with a yubikey nfc is totally solid, and convenient.
I've been using them for years. they also plug into the bottom of the
phones which some people prefer.

@_subject: Setup encrypted email 
Yes! All the encryption happens on your computer (and or your phone) and
you have complete control of the process.
The flip side of this is you are responsible for the whole process. There
are *many* ways to go about this for different
people in different situations. Here is just one option.
* make yourself a key using gpg
* put that key on the devices you want to use (I use a yubikey for this,
and that costs $ which is totally optional)
* setup your email, gpg4win is one popular option:
* set it up on your phone. openkeychain is popular on android and has been
solid for me for years.
* setup facebook to send you encrypted notifications (optional and purely
for fun)
* get comfortable with this process for a while then explore more complex
and or customized options.

@_subject: GPG on Android 
for years I've been using openkeychain and keeping a signing and encryption
subkey on an nfc yubikey.  when I went to use encrypted email on the phone
(which is basically only from Facebook) I tap the key to the back of the
phone. if I want to read the same email on my laptop I plug out in there.
it's been smooth and solid for years.
recently I got a yubikey 4 which i plug into the USB port on the phone. it
works just as well. I slightly preferred the NFC version.
