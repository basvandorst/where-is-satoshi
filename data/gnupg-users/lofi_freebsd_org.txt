@_subject: How to change passphrase for ssh-keys? 
I'm using the ssh-agent function of gpg-agent. When I recently changed all the passwords on my system, I noticed that gpg-agent uses its own passphrase to protect the ssh-keys added to it - however, I couldn't find a way to change that passphrase in the documentation.
What is the recommended way to do this? Note well, I'm not talking about the passphrase protecting the ssh-keys themselves, I'm talking about the passphrase that gpg-agent uses to protect them *after* they have been added to gpg-agent through ssh-add.
