@_subject: Compatibility with Privacy Guard on the server & PGP for Windows on 
Dear GNUpg group,
(Please CC: me since I am not a subscriber to the group.)
I need a solution for encrypted email (for secure web orders) from the
web server to a Windows 95 desktop.  I have used Network Associates PGP
desktop tool on Win. 95 (as an add on to MS Outlook) and it seemed to
work pretty nicely.  As I am sure you know, the server PGP version from
Network Associates is very pricey.
I have read about some of the compatability issues between PG and PGP
but have not seen anything to answer the following question:
I would like to install GNU PG on a Linux server to encrypt email
Will the PGP desktop application for Windows 95, decrypt GNU PG
encrypted email?
Will I need to generate the key via PG on the server and then load it
into PGP on 95?
If this will not work, what are some other options (with a VERY easy to
use desktop tool)?
Thanks for your comments.
