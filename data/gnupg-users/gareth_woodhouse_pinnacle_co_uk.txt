New poster desperately in need of assistance!
I have GNUPG V 1.0.7 on Unix that we use for encryption but I now have to be
able to decrypt this from a Windows OA so I obtained the Binary version of
GNUPG for windows V 1.2.1.
I can not get the Windows version to decrypt what has been created via the
Unix V1.0.7 version.
Could this be because the Windows version is Binary and I think the Unix
version defaults to ASCII?
Could this be because of the Version mismatch?
The problem is I can not use the Windows version to do my encryption because
it requires installation on the Client PC's and that is not feasible for us.
Any help would be gratefully received.

I am getting the following
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: decrypt_message failed: eof.
I am using the following decrypt statement
C:\Gnupg\gpg --output  --decrypt  --quiet. Now there is definitely valid data in the file as the Unix version decrypts
this correctly.
I have imported the correct keys.
Should I encrypt the data in a binary form to begin with as currently it's
encrypted in ASCII format?
If Yes which option is required to do this?

@_subject: Possible Bug with WINGPGA? 
This message is in MIME format. Since your mail reader does not understand
this format, some or all of this message may not be legible.
I am using WINGPGA to allow batch decryption via gpg (GnuPG) 1.2.1
Home: C:/GnuPG
Supported algorithms:
Pubkey: RSA, RSA-E, RSA-S, ELG-E, DSA, ELG
Cipher: 3DES, CAST5, BLOWFISH, AES, AES192, AES256, TWOFISH
Hash: MD5, SHA1, RIPEMD160
Compress: Uncompressed, ZIP, ZLIB in a windows 2000 enviroment to avoid repetitive password requests.
However after 3000-3300 decrypts the decrypt fails and I have to kill the
agent - restart it and re-input the password for it to work again.
Has anyone else found this problem or hads anyone a possible work around?

I am also looking for a similar solution to a similar problem.
I have a gpg call in a transaction loop but my users want the password to
appear only the once and not for every record that requires decrypting.
Therefore my thinking was I could have 2 blocks of code within my loop 1 for
the first record found when the password would be entered and the second
block which would be run only if a flag raised from the first block, the
second block would  contain the same gpg --decrypt type command but with a
password suppression option....
Please tell me such a option exists.......

Hi Graham,
oops.  I should probably add this important factoid.=
  Sorry for not saying
it earlier:
I'm trying to setup a batch system - so a GUI shell doesn=
't work unless it
can be controlled via some sort of automation process.
I read the FAQ that recommended dispensing with passphras=
es altogether, but
I'm not sure I understand the full implications of that.=
  It seems better to
have the management program send the password on the com=
mand line that to
have no password at all.  I'm guessing that stealin=
g the keyring file is all
someone would need if there were no passphrases.  I=
'd rather make them have
to steal the keyring AND find AND steal the passphrase b=
efore they could use
the keys.
I've used the --password-fd 0 option to send the pwd on S=
TDIN, but in
Windows that means using an input pipe from a file writt=
en to disk.  Is
there another way?
I just realized something though -- these other shells mu=
st have a mechanism
for getting the passphrase from themselves to GPG -- doe=
s anyone know how
they do it?

What you can do is use the gpg-agent programs WINGPGA.exe and killagent.exe
with the -use-agent (something like that).
WINGPGA.exe starts a background agent that holds the pass phrase after
entering it one time and holds it in memory automatically entering it for
any further decryptions the killagent.exe kills the background agent
clearing the memory and eliminating the threat of the pass phrase being
