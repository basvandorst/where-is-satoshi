@_subject: [GPGOL] No keys found 
I have just installed the latest WinPT and GPGOL on a Windows XP SP2, with
Outlook 2003.
The installation was successful and I have created my own set of keys and
imported some friends public keys.
In WinPT I can sign and encrypt with my key and I can encrypt using my
friends public keys.
BUT, in Outlook/GPGOL I create a new mail, select "Sign Message with GPG"
and press Send. I now get an dialog, "Secret Key Dialog" which has a
DropDown control that's EMPTY!
If I instead select "encrypt message with GPG" I get "Recipient Dialog", and
my recipients are in the "Recipient which were not found" edit field.
So I'm guessing that GPGOL can't find my keys!
I have checked preferences for GPG and GPGOL and they are all pointing to
the directory where pubkeys.gpg and seckeys.gpg are.
Anyone that has a clue what the error is?

of GPG.
"Sorry your GnuPG version is not compatible. You need at least GPG 1.1.9x or
One would think that 1.4.2.2 is better than 1.1.9x, but ...

Now not only do WinPT work with the latest GnuPG, but it also made Gpgol
Thank you very much!
