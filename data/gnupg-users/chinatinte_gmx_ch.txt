both :-)

Hi list,
I received an encrypted mail. Every time I tried to decrypt it, I got the following error:
gpg: Ung?ltiges "radix64" Zeichen 3a ignoriert
gpg: Ung?ltiges "radix64" Zeichen 2e ignoriert
gpg: Ung?ltiges "radix64" Zeichen 2e ignoriert
gpg: Ung?ltiges "radix64" Zeichen 28 ignoriert
gpg: Ung?ltiges "radix64" Zeichen 29 ignoriert
gpg: Ung?ltiges "radix64" Zeichen 2d ignoriert
gpg: Ung?ltiges "radix64" Zeichen 3a ignoriert
gpg: Ung?ltiges "radix64" Zeichen 2e ignoriert
gpg: Ung?ltiges "radix64" Zeichen 2e ignoriert
gpg: Pr?fsummenfehler; 5ae41f - ae60e1
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=55)
I tried to find a solution in the net with no success. What I then did was: I did delete a part of the encrypted message, basically all empty lines and the following text which was after the header: "Version: PGP Desktop 9.0.2 (Build 2424) - not licensed for commercial use: After doing so, I saved the message and was then able to decrypt it.
Don't know if this is of any significance, but maybe it helps someone who faces the same problem as I did.

Hello list,
first of all: Sorry if my question reaches the wrong list, but I have a question someone on this list may probably answer easily.
If a company has shared keys: How does encryption work then? Are several owners of a share needed to encrypt data? I just try to find out how it works in the real world...
Thanks a lot

It is the second.
This is what I meant. Does this mean that, if you want to encrypt a file, everybody has to use his/her key? The background of my question is that a company claims that one of their managers has forgotten the key and therefore, they can't decrypt some files. These files contain, of course, some evidence they should produce in a court case. Beside the fact that there seem to exist some ways to reconstruct keys, I ask myself if they didn't need the key to encrypt the files...

Thanks all for your help.
Now, the story gets even more funny: They claim to have used PGP split-key, then encrypted the files with a randomized key, then encrypted the key with individual keys.
So far so bad. But now comes the best: They claim that, because one of the managers wasn't able to remember his mantra, they decided to _delete_ all encrypted data.
 Best thing that can happen is that they encrypted something later... But I see support for my opinion that the thing smells :-)
Thanks again

lol... worse: it is reality. I hope I'll be able to post the docs one day soon...
