@_subject: problem loading rsa extension to use with 2.6.3i key 
I've been trying to use an imported key from pgp 2.6.3i but gpg never
seems to load the rsa module.
I have in the /home/admin/.gnupg/options file the following line:
load-extension /home/admin/.gnupg/rsa
I've tried using the default RedHat RPM as well as compiling my own but
no luck.
The rsa module was downloaded as rsa.c and compiled using the info at
the top of the file. The resulting file 'rsa' was placed in
I've also tried copying it to /usr/lib/gnupg/rsa
According to the mini-howto, RSA should show up in the Pubkey line.
[admin admin]$ gpg --load-extension ~/.gnupg/rsa -h

sign, check, encrypt or decrypt
default operation depends on the input data
Doing an strace -o gpglog gpg --load-extension ~/.gnupg/rsa -h shows no
trace of 'rsa' in the logfile apart from the first line where it prints
the arguments.
I really need to be able to use gpg (because of the perl interface) with
a 2.6.3i key (not possible to change at the moment for various reasons).
Any suggestions as to why this isn't working would be welcomed.
Solutions are even more welcome ;-)

As a followup to my earlier message, I've found that typing --version
shows all the algorithms whereas -h doesn't.

However, when trying to use the key to sign a file:
[admin admin]$ gpg --clearsign text.txt
gpg: protection algorithm 1 is not supported
gpg: no default secret key: unknown cipher algorithm
gpg: text.txt: clearsign failed: unknown cipher algorithm
I figured this out too.. it's because there was a passphrase on the
2.6.3i key when I imported it. It wasn't the error message documented,
but reading through the list archives I found various comments about
this sort of thing so tried it anyway.

Not sure if this is right, but have you tried something like   symmetric => 1, as part of the options for the perl code?
