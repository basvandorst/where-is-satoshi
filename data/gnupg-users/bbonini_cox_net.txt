@_subject: key file extension 
Is there any sort of naming convention on place for key files?
I see all sorts of sutff, xxx.txt, xxx.gpg, xxx.pgp, xxx.asc

Well I can't say I'm entirely sure what your trying to do but wont' some
sort of loop work?
I can think of a million in *NIX but I'm lost when it comes to MS stuff.

@_subject: can't run script 
gpg -d qce.asc > qce
chmod 700 qce
rm -f qce
If I run this while in the dir containing the script all is fine
but if I run it from elsewhere I get:
gpg: can't open `qce.asc'
gpg: decrypt_message failed: file open error
I thought it was just a permissions thing so I 777'd everything just to
see but still get the same thing.

Well that worked but I could of sworn I also tried $HOME/bin/file...

@_subject: can't run script 
BTW: I don't know of anyway to have umask activate execute permissions
on a file, do you? I thought 0 will only do rwx on directories. At least
that's how it works on my system 027 will give rw-r-----

Right, right, I understand that, poor choice of words in my description.
Ok, now I'm with ya.

Hmmm, why bother encrypting the data in the fist place? By automating
the decryption you essentially render the security useless and anyone
who gains access to the script can run and decrypt your data.
Maybe I'm not understanding what you want to do.

Can you not run sftp or are you in MS hell @ work ??

But assuming your secure environment became compromised now all one has
to do is run your automated decryption routines. That's all I was

How can I force Evolution to use textmode signatures?

@_subject: evolution & textmode 
Thanks Nick, however I have no problem with it being an attachment but I
was hoping for it to be a textmode attachment rather then binary.
IE: looking for this:
gpg: textmode signature, digest algorithm SHA1
rather then this:
gpg: binary signature, digest algorithm SHA1
gpg: armor header: Version: GnuPG v1.2.2 (GNU/Linux)
gpg: Signature made Fri 16 Jan 2004 09:33:42 AM EST using DSA key ID
gpg: Good signature from "Brian V Bonini (Personal) "
gpg:                 aka "Brian V Bonini (gfx-Design)
gpg: binary signature, digest algorithm SHA1

Because quite a few mailing lists will not allow it because it's a
binary attachment. Half-ass anti-virus tactics I suppose. Obviously can
work around it but was just curious if it was possible with Evo.

I realize that, but the whole scenario still brought about the question,
so I asked.
