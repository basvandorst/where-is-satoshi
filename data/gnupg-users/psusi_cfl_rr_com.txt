I would like to keep the private portion of my primary key stored offline and use an expiring secondary key for day to day signing.  To accomplish this I have tried backing up the key after creating the secondary signing key, then attempting to delete the private portion of the primary key from the key ring, but even when I explicitly specify the primary key ID to delete with --delete-primary-keys, the secondary private key is also removed.
How can I remove ONLY the private part of the primary key, and not the secondary key(s)?

Yes, I meant --delete-secret-key
This does the trick, but I still do not understand why --delete-secret-key removes BOTH the primary and subkey secrets when I specifically gave only the ID of the subkey?  Shouldn't it remove exactly what I say and no more?

Can this be overridden?  I thought that is what the ! suffix was for,
but it still deletes the whole thing.
