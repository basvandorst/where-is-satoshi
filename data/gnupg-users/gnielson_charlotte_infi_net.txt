Has anyone compiled gnupgp successfully on Digital Unix systems running on Digital Alpha
servers? I am needing to install pgp at a virtual host at Mindspring.
Any info appreciated.

Has anyone compiled gnupgp for Digital Unix systems running on digital
Alpha servers? I have been trying unsuccessfully so far to get
Mindpsring/Earthlink to compile it on their server to use with a virtual
host account we have. Any help appreciated.

I need to install gnupgp on an Earthlink/Mindspring virtual host. As you
can see from the message below, they are encountering a problem when
running make. Can anyone shed any light on this? They are running Digital Unix systems running on Digital Alpha servers.
