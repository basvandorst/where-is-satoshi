Hi-ho.  Arch-newbie, here, but I couldn't find anything about this in the docs or in the mailing list archives...
My system is a freshly-installed RedHat 6.2 on a Sun Ultra-5:
[mjinks gnupg-1.0.1]$ uname -a
Linux embley 2.2.14-5.0  Tue Mar 7 21:50:41 EST 2000 sparc64 unknown
[mjinks mjinks]$ gcc -v
Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-redhat-linux/egcs-2.91.66/specs
gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)
[mjinks mjinks]$ ld -v
GNU ld version 2.9.5 (with BFD 2.9.5.0.22)
I'm trying to install gpg version 1.0.1; worked fine just a few minutes ago
on my box at home (RH 6.1-intel), but here I have trouble.   The compile dies
with this output:
Making all in tools

Now, I notice that the tail end of the ./configure script prints these messages, which might maybe be relevant but I'm not sure of their significance:
creating config.h
linking ./mpi/sparc32/mpih-add1.S to mpi/mpih-add1.S

linking ./mpi/generic/mpih-sub1.c to mpi/mpih-sub1.c
g10defs.h created
Went looking and I see that there is a ./mpi/supersparc/, but no sparc64, for
example; is this even relevant to my problem?
Is this a known issue?  Anybody else run up against this?

Well, okay... Would it help if I offered you (or another GPG developer if you
aren't interested or don't have the time) a login on my box?  With Ultra's
being so cheap these days, and Solaris still so unusable as a desktop, I can
only imagine that there will be a lot more people in the same boat as me.
I don't have the expertise to debug this myself but I'd like to help any way
I can.
I'd offer to send you an Ultra, but they aren't _that_ cheap. ;)
