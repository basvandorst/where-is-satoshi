I came across this message in the archive, and it looks like I am having the
same problem, where a file over 4GB will appear to encrypt correctly, but
won't decrypt. This appears to be a known problem. Is there going to be a
fix out soon for this issue, or should I split the files into smaller
My platform is Windows 2000, gpg versions 1.0.6 and 1.0.7 (same problem on

A question on the beta for the 1.2 version of gpg. Will it support files > 2
gigs on the Windows platform?
Is there a list of new features for 1.2?

Thanks for the reply, and the feature list.
I'm currently testing a 1.1.9 (I believe) copy on a 12 gig file. If anyone
is interested, I'll let the list know if it worked.

Just to let everyone know, the beta version still could not decrypt a large
file (the 12 gig one). I understand that it takes custom library calls
(different for each platform?), so I'm hoping someone will put it in.

I did this, and it came up with the same error message. Should I encrypt a
large file using a similar format? I tried doing this, but I couldn't find
the correct syntax to properly encrypt the file.
This is the type of command I used (not the exact syntax).
gpg -e --default-recipient-self < large_plaintext.txt  (??)

Ok, just to let everyone know, I did get this working, by using the
input/output redirection in both the encryption and decryption.
I think that a warning would be nice on encryption if the file is over a
certain size. When I attempted to encrypt the file in the standard way, it
didn't complain, but the encrypted file was damaged. I don't know how
difficult it would be to add, but it would be useful. Would need to check
for >4 gigs on a 32 bit system, and check to see if the input is via a file
or a redirection.

I'm no expert in encryption (far from it), but it seems to be that a lot of
problems come about by trying to make a platform completely secure, and
saying that everything that doesn't achieve that is insecure, and therefore
as bad as no security. I understand that if a system is vulnerable to an
attack it can be comprimised, but sometimes half a cake is better then none
In the case of passing passphrases between processes being a bad thing, yes
it is, but if your system is running a trojan or process that can grab info
passed between processes, you're SOL already. An earlier poster talked about
not having passphrases at all, which I think is a great idea, as long as
encryption and authentication are separated! I would like to see my users
using encryption, but the level of hassle needed to do it right now is too

Is anyone working at creating a managed .NET wrapper for the gnupg library?
I think it would be very useful.

I was thinking GPGME, as it seems to be the best general purpose library.
I haven't run across that project before.
Good point. I won't pollute this list any further.
