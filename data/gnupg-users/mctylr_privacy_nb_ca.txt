If you mean, are the source code files (rsa.c) in GnuPG the same as
OpenSSL? No. Different source code files, different licenses.
 (OpenSSL)
 (GnuPG)
If you mean, are there same algorithms in both GnuPG and OpenSSL? Then yes, they both implement a number of common algorithms,
and as well there is a fair bit of non-overlap (not all algorithms are
implemented in both). E.g. both have RSA, DSA/DSS, AES, MD-5, SHA-1,
and Triple-DES.
