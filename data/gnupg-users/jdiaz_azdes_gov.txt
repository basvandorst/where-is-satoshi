Good morning Paul.  Instead of having the mainframe run a process to call the script on the server, I was able to get an answer from 'them' regarding when the file would be available, and I've scheduled the process to run on the server.  All is well now.

I do believe that your issue is caused by your script being run by your client system, and gpg is looking for the secret key on your *client* system.  I think it is further indicative of this given that when you connect to server with Remote Desktop, it works.  If the key is on the server and script is being run on the client, the reference to gpg in script will need to use gpg --homedir gnupg_directory_on_server.
To test this, if you can edit the script that calls gpg, put a line in it to print out the value of the GNUPGHOME environment variable.
Another way that you could do this is make gpg list its secret keys with gpg -v --list-secret-keys.  By using -v option the first line of gpg's output will print the location of the secret keyring that is being listed.  If it does not match the location of the secret key you have on your server, you have found your problem.
If you do not have permission to edit the script, convince the responsible party to do himself.  It is the only way you are going to know if gpg is looking in right place.  When you get "secret key not available", your first recourse should be to determine if secret key you want is in your gnupg directory or if gpg is using the correct home directory.

Hello.  Long story, short:
Mainframe calls .bat file that calls C# application that calls second .bat file to call GnuPG to decrypt a file. Once decrypted, other stuff happens, e-mails are sent, blah, blah, blah.
Here's the issue: When the mainframe calls the .bat file to start the process, the decryption returns:
Decrypt error :gpg: armor header: Version: GnuPG v1.4.9 (AIX)
gpg: public key is 07F7097A
gpg: encrypted with ELG-E key, ID 07F7097A
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
if I list the keys on the server that this is running I see the key listed.
Here's the goofy part: If I login to the server with the credentials that the mainframe uses to call the first .bat file, and manually run the .bat file that starts the whole process, it runs correctly.

I'm logging in with the service account, which is the same account that the mainframe JCL uses.

Hello John,
When you say that you log in to the server,  are you logging into a user account on the server?  And do you get a command prompt (i.e. you are ssh-ing into your server)?

Paul, got it figured out.  Programmer too stupid.  The path to gpg.exe had changed, and I didn't catch it.

Spoke too soon.  The wrong path was part of the problem, but I?m still having the issue:
Mainframe calls .bat file that calls C# application that calls second .bat file to call GnuPG to decrypt a file. Once decrypted, other stuff happens, e-mails are sent, blah, blah, blah.
Here's the issue: When the mainframe calls the .bat file to start the process, the decryption returns:
Decrypt error :gpg: armor header: Version: GnuPG v1.4.9 (AIX)
gpg: public key is 07F7097A
gpg: encrypted with ELG-E key, ID 07F7097A
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
If I RDP into the server with the credentials specified in the mainframe JCL, I see this from the decrypt:
gpg: armor header: Version: GnuPG v1.4.9 (AIX)
gpg: public key is 07F7097A
gpg: using subkey 07F7097A instead of primary key AB96877A

      "FMCSFTPKey "
gpg: AES256 encrypted data
gpg: original file name='DE-ETE-090313'
What do I need to do, or have the owners of the encrypted data do, to resolve this?
