I read an article or something a while back stating the legal theory that if your passphrase is an admittance to a past crime, to hand over said passphrase would constitute as having said "testimonial value" and you could get away with not disclosing the passphrase.
But it is just legal theory, and I am no expert in law, american law, or even cryptography. So what happens in practice is anyone's guess really.

Hash: SHA256
What kind of tweets we talking about? And are you after someone who will be relatively independent to fill the role, or will the info for tweeting be suggested before hand?
I wouldn't mind a more active role in the gnupg community. As a non-programmer, I feel a bit useless at the moment just reading from the list.
