i don't know if it is the best place to ask this type of questions, but
if i'm wrong here could you tell me a right mailing list fot it.
I want to decrypt rrc2 encrypted mails and use libgcrypt for this
purpose. As i know the RC2 algorithm is implemented in libgcrypt
(rfc2268.c), but it will not be compiled (i concluded it from
"libgcrypt-config --algorithms" output). What should i do to get the RC2
algorithm compiled?
I use libgcrypt-1.2.1
Thanks in advans

Hi Johan,
you may be right. I tried it with ./configure
--enable-ciphers="aes,...,rfc2268" und after that found in Makefile
rfc2268 among the algorithms to be compiled, but after installation
rfc2268 is still missed in output "libgcrypt-config --algorithms"

Hi everybody,
to be able to use Ron's Cipher 2 i try to configure libgcrypt with
parameter --enable-ciphers
and it runs perfect, but
issues always
without rfc2268 (RC2).
I'm not blind, but for sure i make something wrong. Can it depend on my
computer or linux distibutive (suse 9.1) or may be i have to use another
versin of libgcrypt (i use libgcrypt-1.2.1)?
Thanks in advance
