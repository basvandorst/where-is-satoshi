I am new to GNUPG/PGP and need some help. I am in the process of setting
up a ftp job with a new partner. When I tried to sign the public key
from that partner, PGP is asking me to provide a passphrase for somebody
left the company already. Does this mean PGP is currently using this
user's key as the primary user ID? How can I switch to use my key?
What's the best approach to solve this problem?
Any help is greatly appreciated.
