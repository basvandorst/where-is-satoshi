After  installing  PKS  server and trying to add a key from a remote
  machine, I get this error message:
  kd_open: Error opening num_keydb (errno = 2)
  Could anybody give me a hint on how to solve it?

Hash: SHA1
Hello gnupg-users,
  What  are  the valid character sets for GnuPG preferences - both for
  Windows  and  Linux  versions?  I have received a couple of messages
  composed under Mutt and encrypted with PGP/MIME. Upon decryption all
  Cyrillic  messages show up as a lot of garbage. So, what is the best
  charset for Linux fully compatible with Windows and vice versa? Many
  thanks!

I was able to find the program called Bmail. It is a command line SMTP
mail server. What would be the mechanism of this program serving GnuPG
to fetch unknown keys?

@_subject: OpenPGP keyserver 
Hash: SHA1
Hello gnupg-users,
  Does anybody know of an OpenPGP keyserver running on UNIX/Linux that
  could  be  used  in  a  closed environment (for example, LAN with no
  Internet connection)?

@_subject: Keyservers not working properly with GnuPG 
Hash: SHA1
Hello gnupg-users,
  Can  anybody explain to me why some PGP servers react with "No valid
  OpenPGP  data  found"  message  when  I try to search for a key from
  within  GnuPG?  With  PGP  they  work just fine. And with the latest
  GnuPG  build,  a server reported when I tried to upload there a key,
  that the file cannot be read at all.
  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Hello gnupg-users,
  Can  the  Windows version of GnuPG be taught to work with the mailto
  keyservers? Are there some guidelines for that?
