@_subject: Which type of key should I choose and why? 
[Please Cc me any replies as I'm not subscribed to the list]
I was thinking of switching from one of the very early RSA/IDEA versions of
PGP (which I understand quite well, having been involved in the porting
effort to a minority platform) to the latest GPG.  I have to
admit to being very confused about the different choices of keys.  I
can't see anything in the docs explaining why I have the choice of
three options for generating keypairs.  Or why anyone would need the
sign-only option when a sign-and-encrypt option gives a superset of
the functionality.  Or why option number one is preferable to option
number four.  Or why option four is offered at all if number one is a
reasonable default.  Or why number one is the default if number four is
better.  I'm especially worried because you recommend people don't choose the
default keylength and explain why.  Maybe I ought not to choose the
default keypair for good reasons which you don't happen to have
documented.  There seems to be nothing explaining the advantages and
disadvantages of the various possibilities.
I looked in the FAQ.  It didn't help.  Worse, the FAQ has a bloody awful
user-interface.  I can understand an FAQ maintainter not wanting to end
up answering all sorts of questions by himself.  But the following
things make that FAQ seriously flawed:
  1) He won't accept questions unless they're accompanied by answers.
  But the people with questions to ask won't know the answers and the
  people who know the answers will find it difficult to spot areas where
  the documentation is inadequate because they already know more a lot
  about the subject.
  2) He won't actually accept questions at all because if it's not
  already there it's not frequently-asked so you shouldn't be asking for   it to be included in the FAQ.  And since you're not allowed to ask for
  it to be included, it can never become frequently-asked, only
  never-asked.  Circular situation.  There may well be many people out
  there with good questions which a lot of people want answers to but
  they give up because they're not allowed to ask them.
  3) The above two points are mitigated by the existence of this mailing
  list, where people can ask infrequently-asked questions, get answers
  and maybe those will make it into the FAQ if enough people ask them.
  Except he doesn't mention the existence of this list.  I spotted a
  mention of it by accident about 30s before I was due to give up in
  disgust over the FAQ.  That the FAQ doesn't mention this list as the
  place to submit questions which the FAQ doesn't answer is a serious
  flaw.  That bald paragraph at the start is enough to put most people
  off for good.
This is not good user-interface design.  GPG's user-interface may be
nicer than PGP's interface, as you claim.  PGP's FAQ interface is a lot
better in some areas...

But he *ought* to be the person who points out where to get answers.  In
this he has failed dismally, since the top of his FAQ contains
statements which logically lead to the conclusion that it is not
possible to get answers to questions which are not already in the FAQ.
He does mention mailing lists further down but by then many will have
given up in despair.
I do expect the FAQ maintainer to do his job properly.  He hasn't.  An
FAQ which starts out by discouraging people is a bad FAQ no matter how
good the rest of it is.
I do not expect a product which is supposedly competing with commercial
and semi-commercial products to require me to trawl around what is going to
be a vast archive, 90% of which will be inanity, to find the answer to
a question which is apparently so infrequently asked that it isn't in
the FAQ.
I do expect that when the main page  states:
  Please send questions about using, compiling and installing GnuPG
  to gnupg-users [...]
then that is the correct thing to do.
I do expect that if I were expected to trawl the mailing list archives
first rather than enquire on the mailing list, as you suggest, that
the main page would tell me to do that rather than telling me to
enquire on the mailing list.  If you are right, then that is another
flaw in GPG documentation...
I would also point out that if everyone trawls the mailing list, as
you suggest, and finds answers, there will be no feedback as to what
is actually an FAQ and the FAQ will never reflect the questions people
actually want answers to.  Of course, something like FAQ-o-matic would
reduce the burden on the mailing list as being part of the feedback loop
in determining what is and isn't an FAQ, but I have to work with what's
currently in place.
In short, read what I wrote rather than what you think I wrote; think
about the implications of what I wrote before blindly responding; do
your own bloody homework first.

I take it you meant "RIPE" and that was a typo.  They'll still suspect
that you have an encryption key (possibly signed by your sign-only key)
hidden elsewhere.
That's the least of your worries about RIPE.  Perpetual imprisonment is
another.  You can't be tried and jailed twice for the same offence.  But
if they ask you for your key and you refuse and get jailed, when you
come out and they ask you again and you refuse again, that's a separate
crime.  You can't duck a longer jail sentence for your real crime by
refusing to hand over your key because they'll just keep putting you
back inside until you've served more time than you would have if you had
originally revealed your key - at that point you'll hand your key over,
because they'll just keep going if you don't.
See above.  Refusing to hand over your encryption key effectively gets
you a life sentence if you're stubborn.  If you're going to give in
eventually, sooner rather than later is a better option.  Unless the
stuff you don't want them to see is time-sensitive in some way and you
can escape conviction for your real crime if you hide the details long
Thanks for your answers.  You've cleared up the query about why
signature-only.  Now all I need to know is under what circumstances
DSA+ElGamal is preferable to ElGamal (sign and encrypt) and vice
versa.  Does it come down to being able to delete the signature key
if you're quick enough (to at least stop them forging stuff in your
name)? You still have to reveal your encryption key or face a life sentence,
and that's likely to be more incriminating if you're a real criminal.
Basically, I'd like to know if the difference between the options is
technical (this cipher or this signature algorithm is stronger) or
operational (you can delete one of the keys if you need to and have
the time and maybe have some degree of protection against some forms
or abuse by authority).
Come to that, now RSA let the patent go early, are there any advantages to
using that instead of the others?

I just double-checked.  I knew it wasn't RIPA.  The official acronym
appears to be RIP.  Which is very apt, because our freedom and privacy will be RIP once it's in force.
That makes sense.  To a degree.  I'm uncertain about the practicability
of wiping out the signing key before they manage to kick the door in.
In theory, there's no difference between theory and practise; in
practise there is.  Theoretically you can challenge, but actually
succeeding with a challenge is unlikely.
While it would be nice for those of us who are not criminals but do
wish to keep our privacy, I don't see the gov't allowing it.  They don't
just want your past traffic, they want anything that might come your way
in the future.
Yep.  True criminals, of course, will use different methods completely.
They are generally part of a small circle who meet initially so it's
feasible to use a code rather than a cipher.  One that would not arouse
suspicion in mail would have to have a large dictionary of alternate
sentences for each concept to be coded and some sort of intelligence to
choose loosely-related sentences in a single e-mail (remembering to
delete sentences after using them.  So that:
  Mary finally had her baby.  It was premature and weighed 3lb 6oz.
Might mean "the job is on; next saturday at 4:15".
Of course, read as a whole, the e-mail would look like it was written
by a moron with low attention span and poor memory, but there are many
loons on usenet whose posts are less coherent than that.  Maybe some of
those loons are actually foreign agents using that sort of system to
communicate with their masters.
Perhaps Gnu could come up with a package like that.  By giving criminals
uncrackable encryption which is not a cipher it would completely kill
that argument by the govt that they need to be able to demand keys from
the rest of us since only criminals would find that method of encryption
practicable.  They could call it GnuSternlight, since it would resemble Sternlight's posting style.  They could produce a low-bandwidth (not
as wordy, or as coherent) version called Gnukeegan ("*chuckle* i expected you to say that, my little puppy").
Getting your encryption key also gives them traffic analysis.  If we're
at a stage where political dissent is effectively a crime then they
don't need to discredit you by forging with your signing key, they just
disappear you.  Stage one is finding the dissenters by reading their
mail; stage two is disposing of them.  Once a gov't has the will to do
that it doesn't need to resort to the artifice of forgery, it has the
will and power to use blunter methods (like having some tame doctors
declare you insane).
I'm pretty certain of it.  The "criminals" argument doesn't hold up.
The previous proposals about key escrow were revealing: you could use
strong encryption without escrow if you were a defense contractor or
equally important company (i.e., one the gov't could require had a tight
security policy) and you used it on a UK-only private network.
Putting it together, the spooks are behind this.  Before PGP it was
difficult to contact a foreign power if you were in a job with security
implications.  You can't phone their embassy - all the lines are tapped.
You can't snail-mail them - all the letters are steamed open.  You can't
walk in - the entrance will be under photographic surveillance and the
snaps compared with copies of ID cards.  Etc., etc.
Now the Kremlin just has to arrange their key appears in the Morning
Star (don't try fingering kremvax for it because those packets will be
sniffed and your IP address noted; maybe the response will be
substituted too).  Then you can use an anonymous remailer somewhere
outside of UK/US effective control.  That has the spooks *saying* this is a big problem.  Gov't believes them and pushes through an idiotic bill, quelling any dissent by mentioning the security aspects to dissenting MPs.
But it isn't that big a problem.  The security services can counter it
by setting up lots of double-agents who contact the KGB using PGP.  They
can use them to feed disinformation or to flush out sleepers.  They can
also use TEMPEST techniques and keyboard/computer bugging (since they're
allowed to break in and plant bugs).  It's intensive work, but feasible
for a small number of criminals and suspected traitors.  It just means
they don't have the resources to spy on the rest of us.  And they want
an excuse to do that because the end of the cold war means most will be
out of jobs unless they can come up with another excuse.
Let's be blunt (or burgess, or philby, or mclean, or...) the biggest
threat to our security has always been somebody high up in the security
services.  They have the opportunity to have private discussions with
the other side under guise of performing their job.  They have access to
all sorts of sensitive info not just about secrets but about who could be blackmailed.  RIP is going to damage our security by putting more juicy info on who can easily be turned by blackmail in their hands.
This isn't really the right place for all that, but nobody else fighting
RIP seems to have thought of it.  They're all fighting the stated
reasons behind it and that's a battle which can't be won because the
reasons the spooks told gov't are far more persuasive.  Only when you
attack the faulty logic and falsehoods behind those will you stand a chance.  Rant over...  Apart from handing over encryption keys, it's pretty much formalizing
existing practise.  Of couse, if a specific tap under HS Warrant picks
up encrypted traffic, you'll be forced to hand over your keys.  This
isn't about going after Ronnie Biggs or Gary Glitter, it's about
spook-work.  If it manages to also catch a petty criminal once every
10 years, that's a bonus.
That's what I gathered.  At a guess, in the first DSA is taking the
place of MD5 from the original with EG in the RSA role and in the
other option EG is being used both for encryption and cryptographic
hashing.  But I've yet to find anything confirming that guess or
saying why one is preferable to the other.
Good thinking.  That's certainly a good point.  Using EG for both
functions would therefore presumably mean either accepting weaker
signing or more time-consuming encryption.  But that's a pure guess
which may be wrong.  Basically, this is a weak-spot in the docs because
users shouldn't have to puzzle it out for themselves or make guesses.
It's as intrinsic to correct operation as choosing the right key size
and that is covered in detail.
Whoops!  The irony-lock key on this keyboard has stopped working. :-)
Which also means it's had more attention for longer.
I noticed.  But I don't know if EG got added to PGP because of technical
superiority or to evade the patent difficulties that made it such a
hassle to ensure you were using it legally.  So I don't know if I should
be using EG or RSA for encryption strength now that GPG offers both.
Trouble is, one of the reasons I'm looking at GPG is for use with
automated verification systems used by various domain registrars.
They use PGP but don't say what version.  I know I can get RSA and
(somewhat dubiously) IDEA but I still don't know if that's enough to
interoperate with what those registries are using.  Or maybe DSA/EG is
enough but the packet format will cause me problems.
So I noticed, although I hadn't realized that was the AES selection.  To
be honest, if they're happy with it, I'm not, given the political
constraints they probably operated under...

Provided they take your word for it that it is a signing-only key.
Maybe you fiddled with the packet data somehow to make it appear to be
a signing-only key.  Maybe you're using a hacked version of GPG that can
put a wrapper around a cryptographic hash to turn it into an encryption
algorithm (it may be crude, and possibly weaker than a "real" encryption
algorithm, but it works).  By the time they've taken your encryption key away and found they can't decode all your traffic, you've destroyed the "signing" key.
That puts you in a situation where you can't turn over one of your
encryption keys.  For most people that would put them in deeper trouble
from the perpetual imprisonment problem; for the types of people the
gov't are really going after that might be preferable.  If you're a
traitor then destroying your encryption key protects the rest of the
network and means it's no good them trying to rubber-hose the password
out of you.  You end up in prison for life but all the other moles are
protected.  Ditto for hardened criminals - life imprisonment with your
dependents being cared for by your cronies is better than what your
cronies would do to you if you grassed them up by revealing your
encryption key.
They're going to want the keyring on the spot.  No messing about or
extracting the key you say is your only encryption key.  They'll take
your computer then insist on the pass phrase.  We know from previous
cases not involving encryption that they take the computer away anyway
as the first thing they do in case there's any incriminating stuff on
it.  That won't stop just because they can now insist you hand over
your encryption key so they can read your e-mail they've recorded.
They'll want everything on your computer and they'll want to ensure
you can't delete anything.  The only way of doing that is to impound
your computer.
In any case, they also have the legal power to sneakily break in and bug your computer.  If you're under serious suspicion they'll do that
in order to ensure they get your pass-phrase.  That or park a van
near your house for a while so they can monitor your keyboard emissions.
Too expensive in resources for lightweight criminals but those are the
sort of people who will give in to the threat of perpetual imprisonment.
If you can decrypt all the messages they want decrypted on the spot that
ought to be enough.  I doubt it will be.  RIP is basically fishing-
expedition stuff.  They want everything on your computer *plus* the
contents of any encrypted e-mail and any encrypted filesytems *plus*
(in some cases) opening up your hard disk and trying to pick up deleted
stuff from residual magnetic fields.  They already do that sort of thing
in cases where they have "reasonable grounds" to suspect the computer
contains incriminating evidence ("reasonable grounds" appears to mean
that they suspect you of something and you have a computer).
Don't forget they'll have your computer.  They could give that to the
TTP, but I doubt it will happen.  Anyone you nominate they'll suspect
of having a pre-arrangement with you to hide certain text.  Anyone
they nominate will be suspected by you of having an arrangement with
the gov't to hand over secret keys.  TTPs in this scenario are every
bit as flawed as TTPs for key escrow.  They're really Untrusted Third
Parties.  If they happen the only ones the gov't will ever use are the
ones who are their puppets - you'll not be able to reject their choice
unless you pick another of their puppets.  The police might not go
along with this deliberately, but you can bet they'll be supplied a list
of "approved" TTPs.  The police may not get your future traffic but
the spooks will.
So your only sensible option after using a TTP is to revoke your encryption key and generate a new one.  Which means that there's no point in using a
TTP in the first place.
You can't even rig a thermite charge around your hard disk and set it
off at the first signs of trouble.  You'll claim you're not refusing to
hand over your key but that it no longer exists so you cannot.  They'll
claim you have another copy hidden away somewhere (which you probably do
if you're serious enough to rig up a thermite charge) and you're refusing
to hand over that one...
That won't stop messages coming in using the old key until you manage to
get the revocation published.  Which is hard to do when you're in a
police cell while they read through all the plaintext you've just
supplied them (and "follow up leads found in the plaintext").  And then they'll want those new messages decrypted and the leads followed up, by which time some more will have come in...  The only way to escape that
trap if you get a lot of encrypted mail is to hand over the pass-phrase at
the start.  Eventually, the mail will dry up in most cases, but it could
take a long time for some people.  Subscribing to a mailing list that
encrypts mail sent to recipients would be a bad idea...
Nope, I mean that they find out who you've been communicating with if
you were using an anonymous remailer.  Even if the content to and from
one particular person was always innocuous, they'll still be suspicious
of that person.  Similarly, if that person is also under suspicion or
has known past history, that will throw further suspicion upon you no
matter what the content of the mail (can you say "known associate"? - if
you chat to somebody in the pub every so often and you have no idea he's
really a criminal, you can still end up under investigation as a known
associate).  And if you've been corresponding with that nice young
Bulgarian lady (or gent, if you're that way inclined) you met on
Technically, finding out who you've been corresponding with via an
anonymous remailer involves reading the decrypted content, but it is
actually also traffic analysis - it tells them who you've been
corresponding with and how often.  Even if the content looks innocuous
you could have been using a code underneath the cipher, so the traffic
analysis aspect is important.
Not really appropriate here, though.  Except to the extent that the only
way we're going to be relatively safe is if more people use GPG so that
they don't have the resources to go after everyone.  It's ironic.  The
US finally allows export of strong encryption; France drops its ban
on the use of strong encryption; the UK enacts legislation that kills
privacy on the net and civil liberties and exceeds anything the US has tried to put into place in the past.
Possibly not.  But there's slightly more chance of a different version
of PGP operating with what they're using, it looks like.  What with
your mention of version 3 and 4 packets, and GPG's mention of some packet
field incompatibilities it's starting to look like I'll have to go for
PGP to be on the safe side.  If the registrars had thought of checking
or ensuring GPG interoperability they'd tell us to use PGP or GPG.  The
only way of being sure it to try it and it's probably not worth the
extra time and effort involved if it doesn't work.
Yep, but I reckon the NSA must believe it's within their capabilities
(even if only just and only for a very small number of messages per
week) to crack or it wouldn't have been allowed to be chosen.  No
matter how public NIST were, you cannot know what out-of-band
communications were taking place between them and the NSA (but you can
guess).  Certainly the NSA would have been consulted about the strengths
of the algorithms in case they knew of serious flaws.  It would be easy
for them to say they knew of a flaw but they couldn't reveal what it
was for security reasons (like it would alert the Russians to the fact
that their favourite cipher had the same flaw).  A few fiddles like
that could knock out a couple of good candidates (with NIST inventing
plausible excuses for dropping them) and leave one the NSA prefer in its place.  I don't say it happened, just that you can't be sure it

While it would be nice for those of us who are not criminals but do
wish to keep our privacy, I don't see the gov't allowing it.  They don't
just want your past traffic, they want anything that might come your way
in the future.
Yep.  True criminals, of course, will use different methods completely.
They are generally part of a small circle who meet initially so it's
feasible to use a code rather than a cipher.  One that would not arouse
suspicion in mail would have to have a large dictionary of alternate
sentences for each concept to be coded and some sort of intelligence to
choose loosely-related sentences in a single e-mail (remembering to
delete sentences after using them.  So that:
  Mary finally had her baby.  It was premature and weighed 3lb 6oz.
Might mean "the job is on; next saturday at 4:15".
Of course, read as a whole, the e-mail would look like it was written
by a moron with low attention span and poor memory, but there are many
loons on usenet whose posts are less coherent than that.  Maybe some of
those loons are actually foreign agents using that sort of system to
communicate with their masters.
Perhaps Gnu could come up with a package like that.  By giving criminals
uncrackable encryption which is not a cipher it would completely kill
that argument by the govt that they need to be able to demand keys from
the rest of us since only criminals would find that method of encryption
practicable.  They could call it GnuSternlight, since it would resemble Sternlight's posting style.  They could produce a low-bandwidth (not
as wordy, or as coherent) version called Gnukeegan ("*chuckle* i expected you to say that, my little puppy").
Getting your encryption key also gives them traffic analysis.  If we're
at a stage where political dissent is effectively a crime then they
don't need to discredit you by forging with your signing key, they just
disappear you.  Stage one is finding the dissenters by reading their
mail; stage two is disposing of them.  Once a gov't has the will to do
that it doesn't need to resort to the artifice of forgery, it has the
will and power to use blunter methods (like having some tame doctors
declare you insane).
I'm pretty certain of it.  The "criminals" argument doesn't hold up.
The previous proposals about key escrow were revealing: you could use
strong encryption without escrow if you were a defense contractor or
equally important company (i.e., one the gov't could require had a tight
security policy) and you used it on a UK-only private network.
Putting it together, the spooks are behind this.  Before PGP it was
difficult to contact a foreign power if you were in a job with security
implications.  You can't phone their embassy - all the lines are tapped.
You can't snail-mail them - all the letters are steamed open.  You can't
walk in - the entrance will be under photographic surveillance and the
snaps compared with copies of ID cards.  Etc., etc.
Now the Kremlin just has to arrange their key appears in the Morning
Star (don't try fingering kremvax for it because those packets will be
sniffed and your IP address noted; maybe the response will be
substituted too).  Then you can use an anonymous remailer somewhere
outside of UK/US effective control.  That has the spooks *saying* this is a big problem.  Gov't believes them and pushes through an idiotic bill, quelling any dissent by mentioning the security aspects to dissenting MPs.
But it isn't that big a problem.  The security services can counter it
by setting up lots of double-agents who contact the KGB using PGP.  They
can use them to feed disinformation or to flush out sleepers.  They can
also use TEMPEST techniques and keyboard/computer bugging (since they're
allowed to break in and plant bugs).  It's intensive work, but feasible
for a small number of criminals and suspected traitors.  It just means
they don't have the resources to spy on the rest of us.  And they want
an excuse to do that because the end of the cold war means most will be
out of jobs unless they can come up with another excuse.
Let's be blunt (or burgess, or philby, or mclean, or...) the biggest
threat to our security has always been somebody high up in the security
services.  They have the opportunity to have private discussions with
the other side under guise of performing their job.  They have access to
all sorts of sensitive info not just about secrets but about who could be blackmailed.  RIP is going to damage our security by putting more juicy info on who can easily be turned by blackmail in their hands.
This isn't really the right place for all that, but nobody else fighting
RIP seems to have thought of it.  They're all fighting the stated
reasons behind it and that's a battle which can't be won because the
reasons the spooks told gov't are far more persuasive.  Only when you
attack the faulty logic and falsehoods behind those will you stand a chance.  Rant over...  Apart from handing over encryption keys, it's pretty much formalizing
existing practise.  Of couse, if a specific tap under HS Warrant picks
up encrypted traffic, you'll be forced to hand over your keys.  This
isn't about going after Ronnie Biggs or Gary Glitter, it's about
spook-work.  If it manages to also catch a petty criminal once every
10 years, that's a bonus.
That's what I gathered.  At a guess, in the first DSA is taking the
place of MD5 from the original with EG in the RSA role and in the
other option EG is being used both for encryption and cryptographic
hashing.  But I've yet to find anything confirming that guess or
saying why one is preferable to the other.
Good thinking.  That's certainly a good point.  Using EG for both
functions would therefore presumably mean either accepting weaker
signing or more time-consuming encryption.  But that's a pure guess
which may be wrong.  Basically, this is a weak-spot in the docs because
users shouldn't have to puzzle it out for themselves or make guesses.
It's as intrinsic to correct operation as choosing the right key size
and that is covered in detail.
Whoops!  The irony-lock key on this keyboard has stopped working. :-)
Which also means it's had more attention for longer.
I noticed.  But I don't know if EG got added to PGP because of technical
superiority or to evade the patent difficulties that made it such a
hassle to ensure you were using it legally.  So I don't know if I should
be using EG or RSA for encryption strength now that GPG offers both.
Trouble is, one of the reasons I'm looking at GPG is for use with
automated verification systems used by various domain registrars.
They use PGP but don't say what version.  I know I can get RSA and
(somewhat dubiously) IDEA but I still don't know if that's enough to
interoperate with what those registries are using.  Or maybe DSA/EG is
enough but the packet format will cause me problems.
So I noticed, although I hadn't realized that was the AES selection.  To
be honest, if they're happy with it, I'm not, given the political
constraints they probably operated under...

@_subject: Which type of key should I choose and why? 
[Please Cc me replies as I don't subscribe to the list]
Provided they take your word for it that it is a signing-only key.
Maybe you fiddled with the packet data somehow to make it appear to be
a signing-only key.  Maybe you're using a hacked version of GPG that can
put a wrapper around a cryptographic hash to turn it into an encryption
algorithm (it may be crude, and possibly weaker than a "real" encryption
algorithm, but it works).  By the time they've taken your encryption key away and found they can't decode all your traffic, you've destroyed the "signing" key.
That puts you in a situation where you can't turn over one of your
encryption keys.  For most people that would put them in deeper trouble
from the perpetual imprisonment problem; for the types of people the
gov't are really going after that might be preferable.  If you're a
traitor then destroying your encryption key protects the rest of the
network and means it's no good them trying to rubber-hose the password
out of you.  You end up in prison for life but all the other moles are
protected.  Ditto for hardened criminals - life imprisonment with your
dependents being cared for by your cronies is better than what your
cronies would do to you if you grassed them up by revealing your
encryption key.
They're going to want the keyring on the spot.  No messing about or
extracting the key you say is your only encryption key.  They'll take
your computer then insist on the pass phrase.  We know from previous
cases not involving encryption that they take the computer away anyway
as the first thing they do in case there's any incriminating stuff on
it.  That won't stop just because they can now insist you hand over
your encryption key so they can read your e-mail they've recorded.
They'll want everything on your computer and they'll want to ensure
you can't delete anything.  The only way of doing that is to impound
your computer.
In any case, they also have the legal power to sneakily break in and bug your computer.  If you're under serious suspicion they'll do that
in order to ensure they get your pass-phrase.  That or park a van
near your house for a while so they can monitor your keyboard emissions.
Too expensive in resources for lightweight criminals but those are the
sort of people who will give in to the threat of perpetual imprisonment.
If you can decrypt all the messages they want decrypted on the spot that
ought to be enough.  I doubt it will be.  RIP is basically fishing-
expedition stuff.  They want everything on your computer *plus* the
contents of any encrypted e-mail and any encrypted filesytems *plus*
(in some cases) opening up your hard disk and trying to pick up deleted
stuff from residual magnetic fields.  They already do that sort of thing
in cases where they have "reasonable grounds" to suspect the computer
contains incriminating evidence ("reasonable grounds" appears to mean
that they suspect you of something and you have a computer).
Don't forget they'll have your computer.  They could give that to the
TTP, but I doubt it will happen.  Anyone you nominate they'll suspect
of having a pre-arrangement with you to hide certain text.  Anyone
they nominate will be suspected by you of having an arrangement with
the gov't to hand over secret keys.  TTPs in this scenario are every
bit as flawed as TTPs for key escrow.  They're really Untrusted Third
Parties.  If they happen the only ones the gov't will ever use are the
ones who are their puppets - you'll not be able to reject their choice
unless you pick another of their puppets.  The police might not go
along with this deliberately, but you can bet they'll be supplied a list
of "approved" TTPs.  The police may not get your future traffic but
the spooks will.
So your only sensible option after using a TTP is to revoke your encryption key and generate a new one.  Which means that there's no point in using a
TTP in the first place.
You can't even rig a thermite charge around your hard disk and set it
off at the first signs of trouble.  You'll claim you're not refusing to
hand over your key but that it no longer exists so you cannot.  They'll
claim you have another copy hidden away somewhere (which you probably do
if you're serious enough to rig up a thermite charge) and you're refusing
to hand over that one...
That won't stop messages coming in using the old key until you manage to
get the revocation published.  Which is hard to do when you're in a
police cell while they read through all the plaintext you've just
supplied them (and "follow up leads found in the plaintext").  And then they'll want those new messages decrypted and the leads followed up, by which time some more will have come in...  The only way to escape that
trap if you get a lot of encrypted mail is to hand over the pass-phrase at
the start.  Eventually, the mail will dry up in most cases, but it could
take a long time for some people.  Subscribing to a mailing list that
encrypts mail sent to recipients would be a bad idea...
Nope, I mean that they find out who you've been communicating with if
you were using an anonymous remailer.  Even if the content to and from
one particular person was always innocuous, they'll still be suspicious
of that person.  Similarly, if that person is also under suspicion or
has known past history, that will throw further suspicion upon you no
matter what the content of the mail (can you say "known associate"? - if
you chat to somebody in the pub every so often and you have no idea he's
really a criminal, you can still end up under investigation as a known
associate).  And if you've been corresponding with that nice young
Bulgarian lady (or gent, if you're that way inclined) you met on
Technically, finding out who you've been corresponding with via an
anonymous remailer involves reading the decrypted content, but it is
actually also traffic analysis - it tells them who you've been
corresponding with and how often.  Even if the content looks innocuous
you could have been using a code underneath the cipher, so the traffic
analysis aspect is important.
Not really appropriate here, though.  Except to the extent that the only
way we're going to be relatively safe is if more people use GPG so that
they don't have the resources to go after everyone.  It's ironic.  The
US finally allows export of strong encryption; France drops its ban
on the use of strong encryption; the UK enacts legislation that kills
privacy on the net and civil liberties and exceeds anything the US has tried to put into place in the past.
Possibly not.  But there's slightly more chance of a different version
of PGP operating with what they're using, it looks like.  What with
your mention of version 3 and 4 packets, and GPG's mention of some packet
field incompatibilities it's starting to look like I'll have to go for
PGP to be on the safe side.  If the registrars had thought of checking
or ensuring GPG interoperability they'd tell us to use PGP or GPG.  The
only way of being sure it to try it and it's probably not worth the
extra time and effort involved if it doesn't work.
Yep, but I reckon the NSA must believe it's within their capabilities
(even if only just and only for a very small number of messages per
week) to crack or it wouldn't have been allowed to be chosen.  No
matter how public NIST were, you cannot know what out-of-band
communications were taking place between them and the NSA (but you can
guess).  Certainly the NSA would have been consulted about the strengths
of the algorithms in case they knew of serious flaws.  It would be easy
for them to say they knew of a flaw but they couldn't reveal what it
was for security reasons (like it would alert the Russians to the fact
that their favourite cipher had the same flaw).  A few fiddles like
that could knock out a couple of good candidates (with NIST inventing
plausible excuses for dropping them) and leave one the NSA prefer in its place.  I don't say it happened, just that you can't be sure it
