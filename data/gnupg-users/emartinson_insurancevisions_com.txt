@_subject: Upgrade GPG on Windows 
I have used GPG for years in a automated environment and I now need to upgrade the installed version of GPG from 1.0.6-2 to current. I have tried to copy the new .exe and .dll files in the folder and I loose my keys. I have figured out that my homedir is "HOME: C:/gnupg" for the old version and the new version uses the windows/user folders. I searched the net can can not find a command to update/change the default folder. Please advise. Erik Martinson
