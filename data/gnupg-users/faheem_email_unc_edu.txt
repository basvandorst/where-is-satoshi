@_subject: deleting duplicate key 
Dear gpg people,
I have been using gpg for some time without difficulty. However, I have
been having some difficulty with key management.
$ gpg --list-keys
gives me pub  1024D/9A9886FE 2000-10-28 Hassan Mitha (None) pub  1024D/AB9666ED 2001-01-16 Hassan Mitha (I disabled this key in desperation when I could not delete it).
$ key 1 gives me No secondary key with index 1
And various other options give me unhelpful responses which I will not
attempt to reproduce.
What should I do? Thanks in advance for any response.
Please cc me. I am not surrently to subscribed to the gpg mailing list.
                           Sincerely, Faheem Mitha.
