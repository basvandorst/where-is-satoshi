@_subject: Own Mail: PGP running on local server; Is it secure 
Hi all
Thanks for your comments, not exactly a ringing endorsement! Some of  their linguistic quirks could be excused given they are French, But  I'm glad I asked the question before backing them..
If PGP implementations aren't too far off topic for this list what do  you all think of Another attempt to hasten PGP use amongst non-techs but with a  software rather than hardware approach:
Mailpile is an e-mail client!
Mailpile is a search engine and a personal webmail server.
Mailpile is an easy way to encrypt your e-mail.
Mailpile is software you run yourself, on your own computer.
Mailpile is an effort to reclaim private communication on the  Internet. A project to rescue our personal lives from the proprietary  cloud and prevent our conversations from being strip-mined for  corporate profit and government surveillance.
