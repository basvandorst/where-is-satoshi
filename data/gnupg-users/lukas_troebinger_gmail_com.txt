not so recommended. So i went with haveged because of the algorithm it
uses. Haveged runs as a background daemon and won't bother you in the
I know a good hosting provider where it is preinstalled and a good linux

@_subject: gpg4win HKPS in gpg.conf correct slash 
when using the sks keyserver you can choose to use the HKPS version. In the
gpg.conf file you need to specify the path to the CA cert "keyserver-options
ca-cert-file=/path/to/CA/sks-keyservers.netCA.pem". In Windows, what is the
correct slash to use?
Is it / or \?
Thank you guys

Windows officially supports a forward slash in its core APIs but not in
