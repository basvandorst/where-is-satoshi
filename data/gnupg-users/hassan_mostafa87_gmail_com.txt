@_subject: Elliptic curve operations 
It's my first time to use this library and I am not a developer. all what I
am doing is elliptic curve operations to simulate some EC based algorithms.
first of all I wrote the following code to generate a curve and just get
the secret key and display it. it gives me segmentation fault 11. please I
need an urgent help in this.
# include # include # include # include # include # define AM_PATH_LIBGCRYPT
# define LDADD = $(LIBGCRYPT_LIBS) */
int main ()
if (gcry_check_version(GCRYPT_VERSION))
puts ("\nIntialization Succeed\n");
puts ("libgcrypt version mismatch\n");
if (!gcry_control(GCRYCTL_INITIALIZATION_FINISHED_P))
puts ("libgcrypt has not been intialized\n");
abort ();
gcry_ctx_t my_ctx;
const char *curve = "NIST P-521" ;
gcry_error_t err = 1 ;
err = gcry_mpi_ec_new ( &my_ctx, NULL, curve);
puts("Allocating a context for EC operations is");
fputs (gcry_strerror(err), stderr);
puts ("\n");
const char *d = "d-mpi";
int copy1 = 1;
unsigned int x_bits = 0;
gcry_mpi_t x = gcry_mpi_new (x_bits);
x = gcry_mpi_ec_get_mpi(d, my_ctx, copy1);
gcry_buffer_t x_buffer;
x_buffer.size = 0;
x_buffer.len = 1024;
unsigned char *x_buffer_name = x_buffer.data;
size_t x_buffer_len = 1024 ;
size_t *x_size;
gcry_error_t err2 = 0;
err2 = gcry_mpi_print(GCRYMPI_FMT_USG, x_buffer_name, x_buffer_len, x_size,
fputs (gcry_strerror(err2), stderr);
puts ("\n");
gcry_ctx_release (my_ctx);
gcry_mpi_release (x);
return 0;

@_subject: library intialization error 
I am a new to libgcrypt. i had an error when I tried just to initialize the
library. I followed the manual for initialization but when try to check
it's success it give me general error. the code as following
# include # include # include # include # include # define AM_PATH_LIBGCRYPT
int main ()
if (!gcry_check_version(GCRYPT_VERSION))
fputs ("libgcrypt version mismatch\n", stderr);
gcry_error_t e1 = gcry_control (GCRYCTL_ANY_INITIALIZATION_P);
fputs (gcry_strerror(e1), stderr);
puts ("\n");
return 0;

@_subject: Elliptic curve operations problem using libgcrypt 
I am a new user of libgcrypt. I am trying to do math operations on elliptic
curves for example scalar multiplication. I am started with writing a code
which simply initialize the library then generate a context for EC
operation and the get the private key and display it. in my code.
1. I am trying to get the private key value in variable called x but it
gives an error.
2. then display this x.
please I need help in this urgently.
