I think from a security pov, this feature would be highly desirable.
I guess a compromise that wouldn't hurt the keyservers too much would be:
 - store the date when a key was last retrieved in the keyring
 - refresh when the key is older than xx days. Let it be set to <7 only with --expert or something like that.

@_subject: making it easy to find keys 
[where to put the public key]
I think the filename is not relevant at all - this information is, after all, contained in the URL referencing that location. Myself, I use  (which is, of course, my keyid).
A standardization here would be desirable - IIRC there was discussion of a low-security auto-encryption protocol a while back that would work like this:
A sends mail to B, with X-PGP-Key:  header.
Mailer of B sees this header, automatically fetches the PK, and asks the user to verify the key (a good GUI is very important here. A short explanation why it is important to verify the fingerprint etc.). This GUI would presumably locally sign the key (optionally a public signature - to be used by those  who know what this really means).
In this way, people (semi-)transparently can use PGP encrypted email, without ever bothering about the technical details, and without having to configure a keyserver explicitely.
The 'encryption set up wizard' of the mailer would automatically generate a key, print out a revocation cert, explain about how important that is, publish the key to a keyserver, and use a keyserver URL by default. Experts can change the URL to their own canonical location of their key.
So, between any two people using this mailer, only the first mail in each direction would be unencrypted. (In a similar vein, the application should track MSO(E) users in the address book and automatically don't send inline signed mails instead of PGP/MIME for those).
Now who's going to implement this...
Lacking any implementations of the above scheme, it doesn't really matter how you do it.  IMHO it is important to have the key on the keyservers as far as this is possible, because many people don't bother to look through mailheaders or (or .sig's) to retrieve keys.

Welcome to the OpenGPG world!
The signature is attached to it; whenever you export a public key, all attached parts are exported, too. (Everything you see when you do 'gpg --list-sigs ' from the commandline).
Yes, it is good practice to upload the key to the keyservers every time you get a signature.
Yes and no. It is good when the keyserver is available in all keyservers, so somebody receiving a signed mail from you (or wanting to send an encrypted mail to you) doesn't have to hunt for the key.
But on the other hand, most keyservers automatically sync their key with each other.  So, uploading your key to any of the wwwkeys.pgp.net [1] servers will send it to all others, too. (ObPlug: for certain advanced users of gpg, this is not necessarily true -

@_subject: RSA - IDEA Public Key Imports and Encrypts Fine with 
IDEA is used in two places, AFAIK:
 - to protect the secret key (you said you imported the public key, so this doesn't apply here)
 - as symmetric algorithm in encryption
BUT: the use of IDEA for session encryption is only one of several possibilities - if you encrypt to a key, there is a choice of several algorithms the sender can use. One of these choices is IDEA, but another is 3DES, which is always available. So if you encrypt messages *to* a key which indicates IDEA in its preferences, but IDEA is not available, gpg will chose 3DES to encrypt the message.
Of course, this doesn't change the fact that you won't be able to decrypt messages encrypted with IDEA with a stock gnupg. So if you have such a (secret) key, the thing to do is change the preferences on that key and publish the new version of the key, and also (since people will use the old version still) get a version with idea enabled (I don't know anything about license issues, so you might not have that route available).

@_subject: trust problem 
First, the most important thing you need to understand: this limit of 5 steps is completely arbitrary. Personally, I think 5 steps with 5 random people is too much. On the otherhand, I'd be inclined to trust a much longer chain when it consists of people like Werner Koch, David Shaw, or perhaps some well-known Debian developers who - to me - have a very good reputation.
But to be sure that simon's key is really his, you (as peter) need to have extremely high trust in blake, elena, chloe *and* alex - and, since you haven't directly signed elena, chloe and alex' keys, it is very probable that you don't even know them (if you knew them, you could give them a phone call to identify them and exchange fingerprints over this trusted channel - so your problem of the 5 steps limit wouldn't exist in the first place).
So while you may know and trust simon (whos key you just not have come around to sign) to correctly verify the key of K, how can you be sure that you really have simon's key?

Google around, and search a paper by prof. Ueli Maurer (ETH Z?rich - where I study, incidentally) on this subject.
It's not as easy as you think. Consider

         ------> P3 --------/
So, with the cycle between P2 and P3, calculating the trust you should have for P4 becomes non-trivial - because, clearly, the fact that P2 and P3 have cross-signed their keys should matter - simply eliminating the cycle will distort the metrics (and which link in the cycle will you remove?)
The other thing: even the simple trust model gpg uses currently is too complicated for most people - try explaining it to somebody (in a non-technical profession, perhaps) who just wants to use email and doesn't care for security. This *does* matter because many people think that everybody should be using encryption (after all, email *is* terribly I think such a db would be completely bogus. Trust is a very personal thing.

@_subject: Questions about subkeys acrobatics (from Adrian von Bidder 
Right. I don't trust my work computer to carry the primary secret key - so I can contain potential damage by revoking the compromised subkey.
I'm not a cryptographics expert, but IIRC in some cases it is not good to encrypt the same content to many different keys (This obviously happens already if you send a message to several users - I don't know if this is a real problem or if it isn't, or if gnupg works around this being a problem).
Also, there would be quite a long transition period until everybody would send me messages encrypted to all applicable (not expired/revoked) subkeys. In this period, I'd often receive messages with not-updated gpg/pgp versions, encrypted with the wrong subkey.
While this problem is true for subkey signatures, too, I feel that in most cases it is worse not to be able to decrypt a message than just not to be able to verify a signature.

It's not watertight. If I have both your secret key and your email account, I can do all of this, and have in the end a trusted key to your name where you don't have the secret key.  Granted, I'll need coninued access to your mail account, but in some circumstances this may be easy.
I think it's important to think again about what David said: a signature on a key is a public statement. It's not just that you (as the recipient of such a 'sign my new key' request) believe that nothing bad is going on, but you are publicly asserting that the key is genuine, and others rely on this. Possibly to do things with expensive real-world consequences if you are wrong (sending passwords, ...)

Because the owner of the old key does not have the secret key of the new key.  Depending on circumstances this might make a difference.
There might be not a big difference between trusting a new subkey and trusting a new key on the grounds of the above email. BUT (and it's the same argument that came up in this thread already), it's a big difference between trusting a new subkey for encrypting messages and *signing* a new key, which means that other people then are going to trust that new key based on your belief.
All signatures on a key have a date - I think it is entierly plausible to implement a trust model where older signatures have less impact on key trust. Independently of the expiration date which is set by the signer, this would be influenced only by the user of a public key.

You never sign the subkey - I do usually not look at subkeys when I sign a key, since it's entirely in the keyholder's interest to properly manage the subkeys.

You could also add a notation subpacket when signing a key and list the available subkeys at the time of your signature.

It depends.
I have several email addresses, too, but I use them mainly to receive mail - I almost always send with the one I'm using here (yes, this is for both work and private email atm). So I have decided against using multiple digital IDs entirely for now, I only use my one key with its one email address.
If you have strictly separate work and private email addresses, I would recommend that you also have separate keys: it's different 'roles', you are a different person if you send mail from word vs. as a private person.
I would use multiple userids if you have some email addresses where the distinction is not in the function/role: an 'old' and a 'new' address, for If you decide for having multiple keys, there is the next questions: do you cross-sign the keys, or do you make a certification key which sends the email keys (for instance with only the name on the cert key, without email addrs). Or do you want to keep the identities separate entirely, to make a point that those keys are really different, and that perhaps somebody might want to trust one without trusting the other (for whatever reasons).

Ah, sorry - I assumed it was a general bug.
Closer inspection tells me: It's a mixture between bad error handling/bad error message on gpg's part and a subkey usage policy on the keyholder's part: the subkey in question has a creation date in the future. The subkeys on that key look like this:
sub  4096g/3C3A2A02 2000-11-30 [expires: 2001-12-31]
sub  4096g/1D0768FB 2002-01-01 [expires: 2002-12-31]

[signing the mails]
Let's first look at what attacks are possible: basically, somebody could send a bogus order email directly, instead of entering it in the web form.
From what you say (order emails are processed automatically, web site is on a big hosting server anyway), I think your assessment is correct that signing doesn't buy you a big benefit.
To which key do you want to encrypt the emails? I would recommend that you generate a special key pair for this and do not just use the key pair of the show owner. So either the shop owner or the ordering system can change the key without much hassle - and as gpg with multiple secret keys works just normal (selects the right secret key to decrypt automatically), the additional work is close to zero.

You can then probably write a script/program to generate the possible passphrases (you probably know not only fragments, but perhaps also the general form of the parts you don't remember - where they numeric, alphanumeric, punctuation, how long were the parts etc.). So you should be able to narrow it down to a few thousand possible passphrases - then, depending on your coding skills, you can use a script that calls gpg (with --passphrase-fd; very slow) or a program that reads the secret keyring file and brute-forces it directly.

The hard part is to get people to use it.
All in all, I think X.509 vs. PGP is mostly just a question of how to encode a public key with associated ownership information. Currently it seems more complicated to implement peer to peer trust models in X.509, but I'm convinced that this is only a user interface thing, and not intrinsic to the technology.

No, I think you can just do exactly the same as with X.509: ship a few PGP keys of some CAs which are trusted by default for casual users. Or don't, and just go in 'encrypted/untrusted' mode by default.
Serious users can then install PGP keys of servers they trust. I fail to see the difference here between operation with X509 certificates, or operation with PGP keys.
I'm guessing here, but if I were implementing TLS/GPG, I would use the OpenPGP keys for authentication only, and create a session key on connect. Again, same as with X509/TLS, you can operate in an assymmetric mode where only the server authenticates itself with a public key, and the client does not present a public key to the server.

You will almost always have unencrypted copies unencrypted file contents lying around after encryption and deleting the unencrypted file: it is almost impossible to force the file system to really overwrite blocks of a file - writing to an existing file is allowed to allocate new blocks on the filesystem instead of overwriting the currently allocated To ensure that unencrypted file contents is really overwwritten, you'll have to read the filesystem code to understand how block allocation works (so you may come to the conclusion that a certain way of overwriting a file will never allocate new blocks), or you'll have to write a filesystem yourself, offering control about overwriting blocks to the application. (I *think* that there was some version of the Linux file system ext2 offering the option of overwriting deallocated blocks automatically. Or perhaps this was just a rumour - not sure at all.)
The next step is paging: either disable paging entirely, or use an encrypted swap file/swap partition (with quite high performance cost, of course.) Or, as a compromise, code something up to automatically overwrite the swap partition on system shutdown (users of swap files run into the same problems as above.)
The next thing to worry about will then be block re-allocation within the disc: all modern discs may reallocate disc blocks internally on some errors - and some tools might get data from there. (Once you are at this level of paranoia, you've probably got the budget to run all your systems from solid state disks - yank the battery out and nobody will ever recover anything.)

People, why do you all insist on cc:ing me? Plese do not.
simple: encrypted mail is encoded in base64, all changes in whitespace are irrelevant (and there are very few MTA/MUA/MDA problems that really corrupt non-whitespace ascii characters in email. And those usually don't survive long...)
with signed mail, whitespace becomes significant. There are some MTA and many MDA and MUA-related issues regarding whitespace. Also, not all gpg/pgp versions behave the same regarding whitespace at end of line.
Additionally: encoding issues. Encrypted mail again is protected by the base64 encoding and by having the signature inside the encrypted part. So gpg will always be able to look at the signed data directly, because no other code in the mailer can interpret the base64 encoded data.
Signed mail is open to be modified by the MUA because it is just text, and contains the 8bit-characters directly (raw or in qp form). So many MUA/MDA and even some MTAs play with the encoding...
PGP/MIME can go around the encoding issues: it is properly standardized how a PGP/MIME message must be generated, so all implementations should know how to verify it (not all get it right - evo had some nasty bugs there.) The whitespace issues are *in principle* also possible to work around for inline PGP: strip whitespace at end of line, and you're mostly safe.

@_subject: Checking expiration dates 
Sorry, you did not undestand entirely correctly.
You *may* use v4 OpenPGP keys in that way, but you don't have to. By default, gnupg creates a primary key (what you call master key) which is used for signing (keys and data both) and a subkey for encryption. The change wrt expiry is that v4 does not have an expiration date in the key, but only in the self signature. So a key expires when all userids have expired. By renewing the self-signatures on the userids you can change the expiration date of the userid (and, hence, the key) - IIRC all implementations should only look at the newest self-signature of the userid under consideration when verifying a key.
The primary key is completely independent from its subkeys. You can add subkeys to a primary, and you can have subkeys expire, and you can revoke subkeys, all this doesn't affect the primary key.
Validity of the primary is determined by the validity of the userids - as long as there is a valid userid, the key can be considered valid. You could even have a window of time where the key was not valid at all, but it would become valid again when a valid selfsignature is added to a userid, or a valid userid is added to the key.
I'm not entirely certain of all facts, for details you'll have to figure out exactly which self-signatures are interpreted by the various OpenPGP implementations on key verification.

Thanks for that script, this is certainly useful.
I think this assumption does not always hold. I have many keys set to full trust in my keyring - these are mostly keys from prominent Debian developers. I trust them because I feel I can judge from seeing their email on the mailing list how competent they are - certainly better than I can judge from seeing them once at a keysigning party.
Trust is always a personal thing, and everybody needs to find their own working compromise between usability and paranoia.  In my case, the fact that I rarely need to transmit really secret data helps - encrypting ordinary email by default is different from encrypting account passwords etc.; in the latter case I take an extra look at the trust path.

If your main goal is full compatibility with PGP users, then you don't need the IDEA algorithm, afaict.

@_subject: Revoking Old Keys... my problem 
Hash: SHA1
You'll not like that: the proper procedure is
 - never lose your key or forget your passphrase
 - never use a key when you don't have a revocation certificate prepared for such emergencies.
The only thing you can do: notify all people you suspect of having the old key that it was compromised, announce your new key. Of course, you'll have to redo all the key-signing you've done on the old key and get people to verify that this is really your new key.
Also, RUN and generate revocation certificates for all keys you use NOW. Store them on floppy, and print them out (seriously. You'll not be able to read that floppy when you need it.) Store this in a secure location. So if ever something like that happens again, you can still revoke that For the same reason, it makes sense to always set an expiration date on all keys you use (I use 10 years - which is long enough not to cause trouble for me for a long time, but I won't have old keys floating around indefinitely if for some reason the secret key and the emergency revocation cert both are killed.)
As for the old key on the keyservers: tough luck, there's nothing you can do. You may have luck convincing one or two keyserver operators that they should delete your key, but since the keyservers are networked, and since anybody can just re-upload your old key, it would keep popping up again and again.
So, since you've changed your email address, you can just take that lesson about key handling and then forget about it all - in a few years nobody will even remember that it was you with that key (a common name like yours has advantages, I see - I'd have the additional problem that there isn't anyone with the same name, as far as I know:-)

After you have created a userid, there is now way to change it. After you have published your userid, there is no way to delete it (you can delete it locally, but your friends and probably the keyservers will still have it).
So you're basically out of luck. You can create a new userid, with name and email, and ask people to sign that one.

I like this bug. It should convince people that using PGP/MIME will be the Kai, the problem is correctly identified: the long version line.
The question is: who breaks it into two lines? The sender or the recipient?
MUAs should not send lines longer than 76 chars, so at a first guess it could be on the sending side.
OTOH, the sending side could be breaking the line correctly, with a '=' at the end in the quoted-printable output. Then it would be sylpheeds fault for not correctly reassembling that line (inline is a signature on the *decoded* mail body, as opposed to PGP/MIME, where the signature is done on the encoded body as it is sent over the network).

Short summary:
You can use subkeys in this situation. The main advantage: if somebody gets hold of your laptop (assuming that you have only secret subkeys on the laptop, but not the primary secret key), you can revoke that signing subkey and generate a new one, without losing your whole key.
The person holding a secret subkey can use this, of course (signing messages, reading messages encrypted to that subkey), but can *not* generate a new subkey, or sign keys, or revoke the subkey or other key parts. So, you lose authenticity on old signed messages, and secrecy on old encrypted messages, but you don't lose your key with all the signatures you've created on it.
But I recommend reading the web page, as this method has quite a few drawbacks; the most prominent being that automatic key retrieval dos not work with most (all?) current keyservers.

David Shaw, gnupg-users, 28.2.:
I see subkeys.pgp.net actually is five machines, not three. Anybody changed the DNS as a result of David's message?
Verification makes me suspect that your 'I think' is an understatement :-)
Thanks for the diff, will apply to the webpage asap.
Btw: What's up with keyserver.bu.edu (128.197.128.140)? It seems to be offline very often. AFAICT it's not a TCP ECN issue.

@_subject: OT: Revoking Old Keys... my problem 
Hash: SHA1
As there is no absolute safety or security, the answer to such questions is invariably 'it depends'.
If your primary goal is not to have another bad key floating around, so you want you revocation cert to be available in all cases, then a webmail account may be a good solution. Just remember that you can't store the revocation certificate in an encrypted form, so anybody hacking your webmail account (or any sysadmin...) could revoke your In my case, I'd be most annoyed if my key got revoked by error, so I do not have the revocation certificate online anywhere. It's on printout and floppy *only*, and the primary secret key (which is necessary to generate the revocation cert) is on my home machine only, which is behind NAT, and switched off most of the time. All other places where I'm working get only a secret subkey ( for details), so even a compromised secret subkey won't give the attacker the power to revoke the key.
Of course, in my case I trade the safety of nobody being able to revoke my key but myself against the possibility of losing all copies of revocation cert and primary secret key.
Yes, a safe in a bank would be even more security in this direction, but that's where the overhead becomes too much when I look at what I use gnupg for at the moment.

Well, of course you can encrypt it. But how likely are you to remember how you encrypted it when you have to use an emergency revocation I should have said that I don't recommend to encrypt it - it should be accessible no matter what happens.

@_subject: Key expiration in PGP (CKT) 
AFAIK, you're right, older PGP versions don't handle chagned expiration dates correctly. You can, however, use gpg --edit and delete the older selfsigs, and send that modified key to the PGP user (he will need to delete your key, of course, and not update it from anywhere else, or the old selfsigs will be there again...)
greetings & HTH

@_subject: RSA and GPG 
Hash: SHA1
Not sure if this works:
in PGP, set an empty password on this secret key (so the secret key is not protected at all.)
Then, export the secret key from PGP, import in gnupg, and set a password on the secret key again.

@_subject: key-signing for pseudonyms 
My policy is: I only sign
 - photo ids where the photo matches the person
 - userids with full name
everything else doesn't really make sense for general keysignings.
There may be exceptions, these are considered on a case-by-case basis.

@_subject: GnuPG 1.2.4 fetches revoked key 
You ask the keyserver for a key matching a specific keyid, and the keyserver sends back all keys with this keyid. Nothing wrong with the I guess the GnuPG spec does just not intend two keys to have the same keyid, so behaviour is unspecified at best. And relying on the old key not being present in the recipients keyring is not really a good idea, I guess GnuPG could check if there's an un-revoked key with that id when checking signatures, but OTOH it may as well decide that it's a weird special case and just not change its behaviour. Reasonably, in my book.

@_subject: gnupg subkeys HOWTO: looking for a kind soul 
A long long time ago, I wrote the GnuPG Subkeys mini-HOWTO at .  I have received a lot of positive feedback over the time, and the page still gets quite a few hits.  But over the last few years, I've not kept up with gnupg developments (though I'm still a regular user), and especially I have no idea about compatibility issues between various versions of GnuPG and possibly other OpenPGP So - anybody wants to officially take over maintenance of this mini-HOWTO?  Access to my host for publication can be arranged if necessary, but I'd prefer if the document moved, and I'd just place a redirect to the new Please cc: me on replies.
Thank you & all the best
