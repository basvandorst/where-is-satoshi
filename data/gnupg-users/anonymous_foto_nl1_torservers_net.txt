@_subject: US banks that can send PGP/MIME e-mail 
Ing in Netherlands distributes software (windows, mac, and linux
versions) - so apparently it's easy enough for enough average joe's to
figure out how to install an app.
In the states, the trend of banks offering proprietary apps for
smartphones is snowballing.  Banks what users to take their software
so bad they're offering free miles and contests to get customers to
take the bait.  Such an app could embed an email client that does
everything the advanced users would do, and hide everything possible.
Such an app could even hide the email address, and hide the fact that
email is used at all, if they wanted.
They're not good at it.
Moreover, the nerds among them are a very different variety of nerd
than that which would understand or appreciate the needs of a comp
sci/math/software nerds.  This is very evident in their websites,
which only offer a point-click GUI interface with no shortage of
marketing gloss, round corners, and flashy shit that fails when using
a proper and hardened linux or unix OS with hardened browser --
ultimately insulting the intelligence of self-respecting nerds that
really just want to connect over SSH and skip the BS.
The cost of securing their webserver and all the flashy shit that they
compulsively upgrade on a regular basis cannot be cheap.
A bank forward-thinking enough to cater to nerds with ssh for
transactions and openpgp for statements would spend the least amount
on security, and simultaneously achieve a more secure infrastructure
than the other banks who try to keep up with the latest web animation
tricks, and all the holes that this emerging junkware continues to
Different sectors of business think differently.  Bankers fear risk
where it's small with respect to the gains, and then they take on
stupidly risky investments when it's inappropriate.  You're giving the
banksters too much credit here.  When it comes to security, they just want to do what the next guy is
doing, and not give it another thought.
The average American has ~14 bank/credit card accounts.  I shit you
not.  So it's not just one account they must "go pickup" their
statement from.  You could not make a convincing claim that only 0.01%
of Americans would appreciate their statements *delivered*
Many customers cannot cope with the manual effort of downloading all
their statements, so they simply don't.  They see their balance and
send a payment, and let the statements rot online, and ultimately get
archived and cleaned off the server.
Others resort to giving all their bank usernames and passwords to a
3rd party whome they must trust, which downloads the statements for
them, and then offers yet another "pickup" service (yes, these users
must still login to a website, but at least it's 1 site and not 14).

The installation problem takes care of the other.  Hushmail users need
not know any more than yahoo users when opening an account.  A HM user
may not even be aware that PGP is in play, or what PGP is.
It's been fixed.  Check out countermail.com, or hushmail.com.
For the /other/ users.
I'm not sure why you put so much stock into the MBA.  An MBA merely
makes someone into a good bullshitter, so their idea, however flawed,
is better marketed to upper management.  In the end, the result is
better marketing spin, not better ideas.  And worse, better ideas end
up losing out to better marketed ideas.  When one MBA is pitted
against another, the decision makers ignore it anyway, and vote with
their gut and use whatever data supports the decision they've already
made -- not the other way around.  It's a sham.
It's really not a good time to attempt to prop these guys up, when
every economy in the world is suffering acutely from their colossal
and aggregate incompetence.
Do you need a business study to prove that a helicopter costs more to
maintain than a bicycle?  The contrast is so sharp, one would be a
fool to even consider funding such a study.
I won't waste any time trying to track down the proof that you're
asking for.  But I will say that ssh and textual interfaces are
decades more mature than javascript, Adobe Flash, Flash cookies, and
all the other dodgy shit you find on bank sites (and casino sites
alike).  And the difference in complexity is staggering -- complexity
being directly proportional to defects, which in turn are directly
proportional to security vulnerabilites.  Moreover, an SSH server wouldn't drag the bank into the vicious
pattern of chasing the shiny.. e.g. there would not be a need to work
on improving the smoothness of animations that must glide accross the
screen.  New web frills are emerging on a rapid and ongoing basis - highly
unstable.  This means the cost of securing it is an ongoing cost.
This recurring cost is needed just to keep up with the new bugs that
are being introduced -- a cost that comes on top of the normal cost of
intrusion detection and incident response.
I know studies have already proven the relationship between complexity
and bugs - although I don't recall where the research was done, it's
not just my imagination.  And the relationship between bugs and
vulnerabilities is security 101.

@_subject: smartcard: transferring to another account 
============================== START ==============================
I have a smart card with several keys.  All the keys are 2048 bits due
to the mentioned gnupg limitations.  All the keys are set up under unix
account 'A'.
I would like to use one of those keys under unix account 'b'.
I can export the public key, but clearly not the private key.  I have
imported the public key into the other account.
account 'B' can access the card, but I guess it is missing some type of
"stub" gnupg uses to mark the keys on the card?
How do I manually re-associate the secret key on the card with the
public key I imported?
I do not want to just copy the entire .gnupg directory over as there are secret keys I don't want exported.  Again, do to driver issues, I apparently have no way to even list what
is on the card!
