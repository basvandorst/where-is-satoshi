@_subject: Encrypting and decrypting 
Hi I need some help.
I want to encrypt a file to several persons. I have do it in this way:
gpg --output test1.gpg  -r skyzoprenick -r evega --yes --encrypt ask.mp3
But the problem with this, is that the gpg is encrypting the file to the last recipient, how I could encrypt it to many recipients? that is possible?
Also I need to decrypt the same file that I have encrypted to various recipients, so any of the recipients could decrypt it.

@_subject: gpg & pgp keys 
I'm trying to use my SECRET (private) key of PGP of Windows  into  GPG in Linux, I exported the private key with this option: gpg --allow-secret-key-import. but when I run this command : gpg --list-secret-keys, it dont show me anything. I have to do something aditional to tell gpg which is my secret key? What I have to do?
Also I want to export my gpg Linux public key into a file, for the PGP Windows users.  I should export the ownertrust to a file? So the windows users could import the public key?
Please help me out, Im tired of using windows, I need a complete Linux running, with kmail and gnupg.

@_subject: encryption date & time 
Hi I would like to know if there is anyway to encrypt a file and decrypt it with the same date and time that was originally encrypted.
For example:
test1.exe  the date is 18/05/2001, Time 12:00:00  encrypt it to another file is going to create another file test1.gpg 18/05/2001, Time 12:01:00
I need to decrypt it to the same date and time of the original one:
test1.exe  the date is 18/05/2001, Time 12:00:00
Is does possible?
