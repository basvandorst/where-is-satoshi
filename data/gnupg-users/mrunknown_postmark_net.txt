@_subject: Script use of GPG 
Hash: SHA1
im trying to use GnuPG to call from a PHP script to encrypt email
submitted from a form. Unfortunately, i cant seem to get it to work.
basically my question is how can i get GnuPG to operate with
basically no environment. specify all the files needed on the command line?
currently this is what the output of the script gives in stderr:
gpg: keyblock resource `/root/.gnupg/secring.gpg': file open error
gpg: Warning: unsafe ownership on file gpg: /root/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: can't access: Permission denied
gpg: fatal: can't init trustdb: trust database error
secmem usage: 1408/1408 bytes in 2/2 blocks of pool 1408/16384 the same command works just fine if i type it all out on the command
line and operate it. anyone know a way to get around this?
