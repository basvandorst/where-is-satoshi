I'm looking at easy way for my email recipients to validate that email sent
from me is actually from me.
I was thinking about some web way, ie: they could copy and paste email body
to verify it.
Is there some secure provider of such service?
Are there maybe better ways to do it?

I cannot "force" my recipients to install any PGP software so I was thinking
about creating signature verification form on my website. If someone wanted
to check if the email is really from me, he/she could paste the signed email
part on the form, then the server-side script would verify that.
I'm quite new to PGP, so correct me if I'm wrong and don't laugh too much :)
; would this be achievable?
I know I'd need to have my public key accessible to the validation script.
While writting this response I've actually stumbled across a page that I
think does what I need (
Actual coding of the script should be v.easy, I'm just not sure if the
concept is correct.
Thanx in advance

Agree with the DNS poisoning, my form would need to be SSL'ed with my private
In terms of educating my recipients - yes, it may be tricky, that is
probably the weakest point of my concept, will need to think how to approach
The solution should be both easy for the recipient, but also somehow
spam/hack proof.
Just one more question:
What parameters are used to create the hash? well, apart the message itself
and my private key.

I'd like to thank you everyone for the valuable input.
After considering all pros and cons of PGP based solutions I have decided
that it will be easier to go X.509 certificate way with gateway-type
installation, so all our email accounts are included.
