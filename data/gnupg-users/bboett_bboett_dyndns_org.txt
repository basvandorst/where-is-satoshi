have this problem pending for a long time now, and now its getting acute
again :D
i am not able to transfer my primary key to the laptop....
i tryed the following:
bboett gpg --export-secret-subkey >gpg.sub
bboett gpg --export-secret-key >gpg.sec
bboett scp gpg.s* laptop:
and on the laptop:
laptop:~/zebot$ gpg --import ~/gpg.s*  gpg: key E0807C30: already in secret keyring
gpg: key E0807C30: already in secret keyring
gpg: Total number processed: 4
gpg:       secret keys read: 4
gpg:  secret keys unchanged: 4
laptop:~/$ gpg --sign testfile
gpg: secret key parts are not available
gpg: no default secret key: general error
gpg: signing failed: general error
E0807C30 being the fingerprint of my main key....
so i don't know what to try next??

yep forgot to specify that i do have defined a default key in my
~/.gnupg/gpg.conf, and that giving an explicit user names yields exactly
the same result and error message....

hmmm that was what i tryed first until someone here pointed me out that
i had to import also the secrete key parts....
nevertheless, now the probelms grow even stranger:
gpg --delete-secret-and-public-key E0807C30
gpg: key `E0807C30' not found: eof
gpg: E0807C30: delete key failed: eof
laptop:~$ gpg --import gpg.sec gpg: key 0D1DC4FE: already in secret keyring
gpg: key E0807C30: already in secret keyring
gpg: Total number processed: 2
gpg:       secret keys read: 2
gpg:  secret keys unchanged: 2
laptop:~$  gpg --edit-key E0807C30
immediate return....
perhaps a buggy version of gpg??
laptop:~$ gpg --version

uhm really sorry to bother and to be such a clutz...
i am only working on the laptop, not touching the workstation...
only from the laptop
uhm as said a part from the export of the keys i didn't do anything on
the workstation....
darn... got it solved....
heh really stupid looking afterwards....
had to import the secret key before the public key.... other way round
it doesn't work....
all the tampering of the secret keys was useless... had to remove all
traces of the key, then install the secret key, and then the public, in
that order it works....
hmmm other question since i am at it...
the old secret key of my laptop, i revoked it, can i safely delete it,
    or do i have to keep it around? the revokation certificate was send
    to the key servers some time ago...

i have the trouble of having to transfer and keep updated my laptop...
on the main station i made an --export and --export-secret-key and on
the laptop i made --import of both
--list-keys is fine...
but if i try to sign anything i get:
gpg -u bboett --sign test.mail gpg: secret key parts are not available
gpg: skipped `bboett general error
gpg: signing failed: general error
naturally i could copy over the whole .gnupg directory.... but there
should be a mechanism to achieve this without resorting to such
