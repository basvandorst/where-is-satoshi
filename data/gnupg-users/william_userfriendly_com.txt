Well, I don't know about this.  I've had a large problem with PGP 6.x not being
able to decrypt messages encrypted by GnuPG, regardless if they key it is
encrypting to was created in GnuPG or PGP.
I've posted it here, but so far no one has posted a solution. I've received
about 6 messages privately from people who read my problem in the archive who
are having the same problem and asked if I had a fix (which I don't).

Yes, and I then encrpted the same message to myself, and tried to decrypt it
using PGP 6.5.2 on Windows98.  Same error.
I know the problem doesn't occur for everyone, but it is certainly occuring for
me, and for at least one of my customers, and for a handful of people who have
emailed me asking for a solution.
