This sounds like a silly question but where can I find a fast, good
keyserver in Europe (from Sweden)? I searched the FAQs and
documentations but found nothing.

Thanks. My second question is now, how do I find out about a key ID
when the person in question does not supply one? He only says in his
(signed) articles "PGP key at a keyserver near you".
Ask him? But in that case I might as well ask for the public key in
the first place...
% gpg --keyserver wwwkeys.ch.pgp.net --recv-keys email
did not work (not very suprising).
(I ask since there might be some cleaver "trick" that might be useful
to know in the future.)

The main reason for the confusion on my side was becaurse I did not
realise how the keyservers worked. I am now (partially) enlighted.
Reqest: Add a section about this in the manual. E.g. "The keyservers
are a network of databases which hold peoples public keys. All servers
holds the same information. If you know the key ID of a person you can
% gpg --keyserver wwwkeys.ch.pgp.net --recv-keys keyID
but if you only have the email address you can query the database.
Start you favorite browser and point it at some keyserver and fill out
the form. You can either get the public key thru the browser but the
webpage will supply the key ID too (see above). The latter might be a
slightly higher security level since browser are known security
holes[1]. It all depends on your level of paranoia. NOTE! The keyserver
might have many keys for the ``same'' address  {TODO: How come?}. Be
careful with which you choose.
To find keyserves, do a ``host -l pgp.net''. Note that round robin DNS
is used so you might find diffrent servers when you query the database."
Footnotes: [1]  I will not go into the details here since this is just a hunch
from my side. An attack would probably supply the wrong key ID but I
feel a direct connection to the keyserver from gpg is better then a
retrival via a browser. But I don't trust Netscape etc. at all OTOH -
call me paranoid if you want to.

Mailcrypt 3.5.4/pGnus0.97/GPG 1.0.0
When I recieve a encrypted email and I decrypt it using Mailcrypt, the
*decrypted* mail is stored in the nnfolder - but I want it to be
*encrypted*! I want to keep my private mail private even *after* I've
read them.
1. An encrypted mail arrives and is stored in specified folder,
   nnfolder:Foobar - still encrypted.
2. I open the mail and decrypt it (C-c / d) and reads it.
3. The *decrypted* text is saved to the nnfolder:Foobar isntead of the
   encrypted.
4. Anyone that can read my files[1] can now read the mail as plaintext
   and if he has been smart he has first got the encrypted mail.
5. Repeat 1-4 until the villian has enough with plaintexts/encrypted
   text to to make some attacks at my secure key.
Using Mailcrypt is not the most secure way in the fist place but much
securer then to save the plaintext.

I think whatever scheme you decide on, it have to have support for it

I think "semi-bogus" subjectlines will solve the problem as
nicely. I.e. don't say "The party at you place on saturday" but
"Regarding the weekend". That could refer to everything from parties
to murdering your local member of parliment. If you are afraid someone

Thanks, thi already told me this privately and I decided then that
this does not help. The problem to get the "Tony Nelson

from the left marging is 31 (i.e. (forward-char 31)). The problem is
to get "Tony Nelson", "(optional comment)" and
I have found a way of doing this with regexps so the problem is
solved, but if --with-colons had put colons between the wanted parts
too, I would use it.
I mostly asked in the eventuallity there existed some good way to
produce a parse-friendly list (like --with-colons which I did not know
about before-hand - forgot to RTFM).
I have a working solution, I was hoping there where a easier way.

Mailcrypt can't handle PGP-MIME (as you probably know) but later
versions (5.8.x) of Gnus (GNUS is ... ancient, I assume you mean Gnus
[which your headers indicate]) can handle MIME natively and doesn't
rely on TM. This doesn't help you in your specific question but work is done to
make Mailcrypt understand PGP-MIME. There seems to be the need to
rewrite some of Gnus mail handling routines first though. Yuck.

Is the encrypted message sent as MIME? Mailcrypt does not understand
PGP-MIME (rfc2015).

I work on a set of elisp functions that will syncronize GnuPG's public
keyring and the BBDB's pgp-mail field (see mc-bbdb.el and bbdb-pgp.el,
don't know where you can get the latter but the former is available
from ).
My question is; is there an easy way of getting a list of who is in
the keyring and his email addresses?
What I want is something like:
"John A" email1 email2
"Anne" a d
It would be much easier for me to parse then the current output of

Thanks, thi already told me this privately and I decided then that
this does not help. The problem to get the "Tony Nelson
" is not hard since the number of characters
from the left marging is 31 (i.e. (forward-char 31)). The problem is
to get "Tony Nelson", "(optional comment)" and
I have found a way of doing this with regexps so the problem is
solved, but if --with-colons had put colons between the wanted parts
too, I would use it.
I mostly asked in the eventuallity there existed some good way to
produce a parse-friendly list (like --with-colons which I did not know
about before-hand - forgot to RTFM).
I have a working solution, I was hoping there where a easier way.
Thanks anyway.

Ok. I have a working solution and will stick to it. In Gnus there are
some RFC822 code, I will have a look at it.
Thanks. Case closed.

I have

load-extension ~/bin/GnuPG/lib/rsa
