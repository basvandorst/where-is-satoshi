I'm interested in it too. I know GPG gives a lot of readable output, so I
guess I must take only the return value of the gpg executable, right ?
But for example, I don't know how to display only the fingerprint of a key
without all the display around that I must grep/cut/sed away. But maybe I
have the wrong angle of attack ?

@_subject: getting an encrypted file to show what public key was used 
The key who has the Short Key ID of F1940956 has the same short Key ID
as : This is a flaw in the OpenPGP protocol (If I remember right). Short
Key ID are only the last 8 hexadecimal characters of the full
fingerprint. And the flaw make that OpenPGP verify only that short Key
ID instead of the full fingerprint, and that leads to collision of Key
ID even if the keys are differents ...
The easier solution for you would be to create a new key
