@_subject: error during make 
Hi Guys,
I was following the instructions per readme, and I am stuck with this error. I'm getting this during the make command.
rm -f libcipher.a
: cru libcipher.a cipher.o pubkey.o  md.o dynload.o des.o twofish.o  blowfish.o cast5.o rijndael.o  camellia.o camellia-glue.o idea.o  elgamal.o rsa.o primegen.o  random.o dsa.o smallprime.o  md5.o rmd160.o sha1.o sha256.o  rndlinux.o     sha512.o
: libcipher.a
Making all in tools
make: Fatal error: Don't know how to make target `../cipher/libcipher.a'
Current working directory /orpogdp1/app/proj_software/gnupg-1.4.16/tools
*** Error code 1
Any help would be appreciated.
