The German post office seems to have problems figuring out what an
encrypted mail is and what not.  Open MLs do not carry encrypted mail
for pretty obvious reasons.
I wonder why the Deutsche Post still allows to send letters in
envelopes when with a minimal extra fee of 0.10 DM compared to post
cards :-)
["Betreff" is German for Subject]
It is considered a good thing to include the message-id and part of the
message to check what's so bad with that.  And it would also no be too
bad to include the intended recipient.
