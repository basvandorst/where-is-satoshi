@_subject: Toggle the authenticate capability 
I have a keypair that was initially generated with the defaults, so the
signing key also has the authenticate capability enabled. I want to add
a separate authentication subkey for use with an OpenPGP smartcard. Is
there any way to turn the authenticate capability off on the signing
key? It doesn't sound like it should be that difficult, but I've
searched using several different search terms, and I can't seem to find
a way to do this.

Hi Andrew,
I didn't think that it would actually hurt anything, but, I wasn't sure
about the internals. I'm a little bit OCD (or anal, or whatever
neo-psychobabble term applies), and having the authentication capability
on the signing key, after creating a authentication subkey just LOOKED
wrong to me, whether it is wrong, is another story...
Thank you,
Roy A. Gilmore

Hi Peter,
Well, that got me thinking, and, I generated some dummy keys with gpg
from gnupg-1.4.21-1.fc24.x86_64, gpg2 from gnupg2-2.1.13-2.fc24.x86_64,
and neither gpg or gpg2 enabled the authentication capability on the
signing key. However, when generating dummy a key with enigmail from
thunderbird-enigmail-1.9.6-1.fc24.noarch, enigmail does enable the
authentication capability on the signing key. This is NOT because of
gnupg defaults, this is problem with enigmail. I still wish there was an
easy way to turn off this capability on existing keys.
Thank you,

Hi Werner,
Well, I feel stupid now, after reading your message, I tried
"change-usage", and it works. It's not in the man page, or listed in the
--edit-key help menu, but, there is a one-line note in the NEWS file,
stating that is for testing, so "change-usage" is actually documented,
and I missed it somehow.
Thank you very much,
Roy A. Gilmore

@_subject: Smart card 
I've been watching this thread for a while, and felt the need to chime
in. Are smartcards (or USB tokens) a PITA? Sometimes. BUT, leaving your
private key on your laptop, tablet, or phone is about as secure as
leaving a spare key to your house under the door mat. I cringe every
time soft tokens are brought up. Laptops, tablets, and phones are
hacked, lost or stolen frequently. If a physical smartcard or USB token
seems like too much of an inconvenience, then your data probably isn't
worth taking the time to encrypt in the first place. How much is your
data worth to you?

@_subject: Smart card 
OMG, this thread has gotten completely out of hand. I will reply to my
own message in an attempt not to add too much to the hate and discontent
already present. This is exactly why I normally only lurk, rarely
comment, and only ask a question when I absolutely have to. I'm sorry
that I bothered. I was trying to be brief when I made the "key under the
door mat" analogy. But, I stand by the idea that I believe allowing
physical access to your private key is a very *BAD* idea. Given enough
time and resources, any system can be compromised. I don't believe that
smartcards are the answer to all security issues, but, I do believe that
a smartcard can *HELP* to reduce *SOME* of potential exposure,
especially if used in a reader with a built-in pinpad. If the idea of
smartcards gets somebody to start asking questions about security, and
doing *SOMETHING* about their security, aren't they much better off than
before? Anyway, please just let this particular fork of this thread die,
and forget that I tried to contribute, I won't make that error again.
