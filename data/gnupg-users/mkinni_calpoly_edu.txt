I find it very confusing.  In fact I don't know the difference between the two!

So theres already been a lot of arguing over this and bla bla bla. Basicaly, for a newbie, what is the difference between the two product lines?  Should an average user go with 1.4.x or 2.x?
capabilities like 2.0.x, but some changes will certainly apply to both.

Hash: SHA256
Hello, I have 50 or so keys I need to --lsign-key as quickly as
possible.  Is there any way I can accomplish this in one foul swoop?

Hash: SHA256
Hello, I want to move my keyring files from %appdata%/gnupg to R:/
I know you can do this somehow, I just can't figure out how.  Is there something I can add to ggp.conf?  Or is there an environment variable I can set?

@_subject: how long should a password be? 
Hash: SHA256
Everyone says it should be as long as possible, but there comes a point
where it's just impossible to remember anything longer than 20
characters.  What do you think?

@_subject: confused about public key strength 
Hash: SHA256
Hello, I can't seam to figure out how the different bitstrengh of my
public key effects anything.  If someone encrypts something to my
private key, isn't the strength of the private key that matters?
So I have a 1024bit DSA pub and 4096 elgamal key.  Isn't the lengh of
the elgamal key what determines how strong the file is encrypted?
What does the size of the public key even matter?  I understand that it
can be used as a singing key, but I have an RSA subkey for that instead.
