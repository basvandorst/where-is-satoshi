Hello !
    Does somebody has an explanation about this fact:
    Checking a ClearSign signature inside my mailer answers "Bad".
    Copying that message inside the clipboard and checking it, answers "Good".
    May be this could happen with this message.

Hello !
    You are right.
    But what I noticed is this:
    Let's suppose your Key has 4 UserID's and all fully trusted.
    You add one UserID more "Winston Churchill".
    All 4 previous UserID's are compromised too, at the moment you added another one.
    That's what *I think* I noticed.

@_subject: how to create a symmetric cipher 
Hello Wei !
--symmetric [File]
    will use CAST5 by default, but you can change that choice by using --cipher-algo option.
    Or better yet, you can define a permanent list of preferred encryptions in --personal-cipher-preferences : the first one will be used for symmetric.
    AES is "S7"
    Example:
personal-cipher-preferences S7 S1 S10 S3 S4 S2
    Of course, each time you make a symmetric encryption, you'll need to type a PassPhrase (but not the one you are using for your secret key), and the recipient must have that PassPhrase in order to decode.

Hello Matthew Loring !
       --passphrase-fd n  Read  the  passphrase from file descriptor
n.  Only the first  line will be read from file descriptor n.  If you use
0  for  n,  the passphrase will be read from stdin.  This can only
be  used if only one passphrase is supplied.
       --passphrase-file file  Read the passphrase from file file.
Only the first line will  be  read  from  file file.  This can only be
used if only one  passphrase is supplied.  Obviously, a
passphrase stored in  a  file is of questionable security if other
users can read this  file.  Don't use this option if you can avoid it.
       --passphrase string  Use string as the passphrase.  This can
only be used if  only  one passphrase is supplied.  Obviously, this
is of very ques-  tionable security on a multi-user  system.   Don't
use  this  option if you can avoid it.

Hello Ramon !
    First message doesn't verify; this one has a good signature.
    It's hard to say why a ClearSign doesn't verify.
    In the headers above you can see that your message comes to us in 7bit us-ascii, while I can suppose you were writing in something like iso-8859-15. Several charset translations occur during Internet travel. Who knows what exactly happens?
    I suggested a few months ago, to send ClearSign in Armored form; this mean no encryption but compression, and no problems with charsets. But several people complainted as they reader could not show the message.

deluid:   Delete a user id.   Note  that  it  is  not  possible  to retract
a  user  id, once it has been send to the public (i.e. to a
keyserver).   In  that  case  you  better  use revuid.
    So, what's to be done is Revoque all obsolete UIDs, and use Primary in the EditKeyMenu to flag the current user ID as the primary one.
    And after maintenance, upload the key to a KeyServer.

Hello Condor !
    Usually, public and secret keyrings are in C:\GnuPG\Keyrings and are named pubring.gpg and secring.gpg but the extension and the name may change depending what you decided at first.
    You only need to copy those files to the adequate directory in your new pc.

Hash: RIPEMD160
Hello dmdm !
    The answer given to you is exact. Each generation answer adds a "- ", and depending what soft you are using, you can go back in generations asking several times to Decrypt the same message.
    Each time you ask Decrypt, you go back one generation of keys and     By this way, you can include a public key in a message and sign the whole. First generation of Decrypt/Verify shows you "Good signature from X", second generation allows you to include the public key in your keyring and be sure it's recommended by the sender.

    I'm trying for the first time GPG with a SmartCard (chip card) and it doesn't work despite the device is recognized.
    I'm trying with my ID card and with my bank card, but none works.
    I get this message:

RFC 5581             The Camellia Cipher in OpenPGP            June 2009
1.  Introduction
   The OpenPGP protocol [RFC4880] can support many different symmetric
   ciphers.  This document presents the necessary information to use the
   Camellia [RFC3713] symmetric cipher in the OpenPGP protocol.
2.  Requirements Notation
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
3.  Camellia
   Camellia is specified in [RFC3713].  It is a 128-bit symmetric block
   cipher (as are AES and Twofish in OpenPGP) that supports 128-bit,
   192-bit, and 256-bit keys.  This document defines the use of Camellia
   in OpenPGP.
     +---------------------+----------------------------------------+
 Camellia Key Length | OpenPGP Symmetric-Key Algorithm Number |
     +---------------------+----------------------------------------+
         128         |                   11                   |
         192         |                   12                   |
         256         |                   13                   |
     +---------------------+----------------------------------------+
   OpenPGP applications MAY implement Camellia.  If implemented,
   Camellia may be used in any place in OpenPGP where a symmetric cipher
   is usable, and it is subject to the same usage requirements (such as
   its presence in the Preferred Symmetric Algorithms signature
   subpacket) as the other symmetric ciphers in OpenPGP.
   While the OpenPGP algorithm preferences system prevents
   interoperability problems with public key encrypted messages, if
   Camellia (or any other optional cipher) is used for encrypting
   private keys, there could be interoperability problems when migrating
   a private key from one system to another.  A similar issue can arise
   when using an optional cipher for symmetrically encrypted messages,
   as this OpenPGP message type does not use the algorithm preferences
   system.  Those using optional ciphers in this manner should take care
   they are using a cipher that their intended recipient can decrypt.
4.  Security Considerations
   At publication time, there are no known weak keys for Camellia, and
   the Camellia algorithm is believed to be strong.  However, as with
   any technology involving cryptography, implementers should check the
Shaw                         Informational                      [Page 2]
RFC 5581             The Camellia Cipher in OpenPGP            June 2009
   current literature, as well as the Camellia home page at
    to determine if Camellia has been
   found to be vulnerable to attack.
5.  IANA Considerations
   IANA assigned three algorithm numbers from the registry of OpenPGP
   Symmetric-Key Algorithms that was created by [RFC4880].
6.  Normative References

@_subject: How do I use gpg to decrypt encrypted files???? 
Hello BosseB !
    If you don't specify the final file, GPG writes it to stdout (the screen); and if the file contains non ASCII carachters, you'll get full of garbage.
    You should use instead:
gpg --yes --output finalfile encrypted.asc
    (The "-D" is not mandatory as GPG assumes you want to decrypt).
    But there is an easier way: install GPGShell and you only need to rightclick on the file and call the appropriate decrypting menu:

Hello BosseB !
    I guess GPGShell was not well installed, because it exactly offers what you
are looking for.
    You don't need the GPGTools at first; use only the rightclick in the explorer, and you'll get all the GPG opions: Encrypt, Sign, ClearSign, Decrypt

Hello BosseB !
    First of all, uninstall both.
    After, reinstall GPGShell, enabling GPGTray and all context menus, but not     Reboot.
    RightClick on GPGTray and review the Configs for GPG and GPGShell.
    Go to Explorer, and RightClick on a file: you see the actions.

@_subject: I forgot about the meaning of some options... 
Hash: RIPEMD160
Hello Faramir !
    Let's take an example with my own:
    1st, you don't need to write the whole words but only their tags:
default-preference-list S7 S11 S12 S13 S1 S10 S3 S4 S2 S9 S8 H3 H8 H9 H10 H11
H2 H1 Z1 Z2 Z3 Z0
personal-cipher-preferences S7 S11 S12 S13 S1 S10 S3 S4 S2 S9 S8
personal-digest-preferences H3 H8 H9 H10 H11 H2 H1
personal-compress-preferences Z1 Z2 Z3 Z0
    The algorithm list is:
? Cipher-Algos:    ? Digest-Algos:    ? Compress-Algos:  ?
?                  ?                  ? Z0  Uncompressed ?
? S1  IDEA         ? H1  MD5          ? Z1  ZIP          ?
? S2  3DES         ? H2  SHA1         ? Z2  ZLIB         ?
? S3  CAST5        ? H3  RIPEMD160    ? Z3  BZIP2        ?
? S4  BLOWFISH     ?                  ?                  ?
?                  ?                  ?                  ?
?                  ?                  ?                  ?
? S7  AES          ?                  ?                  ?
? S8  AES192       ? H8  SHA256       ?                  ?
? S9  AES256       ? H9  SHA384       ?                  ?
? S10 TWOFISH      ? H10 SHA512       ?                  ?
? S11 CAMELLIA128  ? H11 SHA224       ?                  ?
? S12 CAMELLIA192  ?                  ?                  ?
? S13 CAMELLIA256  ?                  ?                  ?
    2nd, those preferences depend wether they are in gpg.conf or not; your key
is not branded. If you'd like (and it's of course the best) to brand your
public key in order to send it to KeyServer and allow everyone to know what
kind of Hash, Crypt and Compress algorythms you prefer, you must use the
"--edit-key/Setpref" menu.
    Let's suppose I want to brand my key 0xCFAF704C :
gpg --edit-key 0xCFAF704C
setpref S7 S11 S12 S13 S1 S10 S3 S4 S2 S9 S8 H3 H8 H9 H10 H11 H2 H1 Z1 Z2 Z3 Z0
    With those four settings in gpg.conf, GPG will take your first choice that
matches the first allowed choice in the public key you are encrypting to. And
your public key will indicate your choices providing you branded it before
sending to KeyServers.
    And while you brand your key for algorythms, you may want to brand it for
your preferred keyserver too:
keyserver

Hello Martin !
    They can call another key with a similar name. :-)
    It's not easy to answer that question, as it depends on your own system.
    When you read a signed message, GPG provides a way to call automatically the sender's public key on your designed servers, when it doesn't find it in your PubRing; it goes on the Net, retrieves the key, incorporates it in your KeyRing and than verifyes the signature on the message. This process can abort if ID's doesn't match.

@_subject: Unable to decrypt/verify from own machine 
Hello 20 !
    First of all, you shouldn't put the PASSPHRASE on the command line; GPG will prompt you.
    "--compress-algo 1" means you'd like ZIP ?
    In this case you should use either "--compress-algo Z1" or "--compress-algo ZIP" but not "1".
    May be you are confusing with "--compress-level N" or better "-Z N" where "N" defaults to "6" if you don't use this parameter.
    Are you aiming to decrypt your own message? If yes, you must encrypt the file both to *you* and the receipient, and add "-r me at myemail.com"
    So:
GPG -se --compress-algo ZIP --cipher-algo CAST5 -u me at myemail.com -r client at hisemail.com -r me at myemail.com -o C:\user\encryption\out\targetFile.xls.gpg C:\user\encryption\in\targetFile.xls
    Of course, you should put in your gpg.conf most of your preferences; not on the command line:

Hash: RIPEMD160
Hello Smith, !
    Let's suppose you are trying to import two key pairs that have been created
with an older version of PGP: PGP2, PGP6, PGP7, PGP8 or other.
    GPG is warning you, that you are about to include in one of those imported keys ("pss") a set of preferences that your friends *may* use if they match their own set of preferences, and send you an encrypted file that *may not* be compatible with your system.
    So, for that key ("pss"), it is strongly recommended that you accept the suggested preferences and save them in the key. After that, you extract that public key and send it to servers, in order to update your already uploaded     That means that people using that key, would not use algorythms that *may not* work.

    Using the EditKey command with "pref" and "showpref" on your own key, shows you what are the actual settings.
    Using the list above, you can choose the order you want those algorithms to be used. You can establish your own list that means "I'd like that one first if possible, and if not the 2nd; and if not the 3rd; and so on". GPG compares your wishes to the receipient ones, and chooses the first that match.
    So, using the board above, you can set GPG.CONF with something like this:
default-preference-list S7 S11 S12 S13 S1 S10 S3 S4 S2 S9 S8 H3 H8 H9 H10 H11 H2 H1 Z1 Z2 Z3 Z0
personal-cipher-preferences S7 S11 S12 S13 S1 S10 S3 S4 S2 S9 S8
personal-digest-preferences H3 H8 H9 H10 H11 H2 H1
personal-compress-preferences Z1 Z2 Z3 Z0
    If you set an unsupported preference, GPG complaints.
    When you made all your choices, you can brand your public key with them, using the EditKey menu and "setpref default-preference-list"; after that, you can send your public key to servers in order to update them.
    From that moment, anybody who wants to send you a message knows what algorithms you are preferently using, and he will take the first of your choices that matches his choices.
    That works, as I experimented it: a previous version of GPG didn't accepted algorithm Z3  (BZIP2) and as I had it branded in my public key on servers, I couldnt decrypt messages any more... Changing my "setpref" without Z3 an uploading my key on servers, restored the functionality as no more messages came in Z3.

    Enigmail has no cryptographic code itself, it only passes the commands to GPG.
    So the question is: are 1.4.15 and 1.4.11 self compatible, and answer (for me) is

@_subject: Can I revitalise an old key-pair? 
Hash: RIPEMD160
Hello MartinHvidberg !
    The keyserver holds only your public key; obviously you need the secret key
at home.
    What you should do in my opinion, is recover all the old key pairs you are able to get (with the passphrase), and revoque them but keep them (for the case
you still get a message encrypted with one of those so you can read it anyway),
and send them to the servers.
    You can choose one existing key pair (or create a new one), with a signing (main) key allowing use of most recent signing algorithms (with a 1024 signing key you'll reach RIPEMD160 as a maximum Digest-Algo)
    And create subkeys from time to time, depending on the risk (keyloggers if you are using non safe PC, USB stealing), and uploading to servers.

Hello Chris !
    You can use GPGShell that has a non-specific utility to encrypt-decrypt-sign windows.
    While you are working in a program, ensure that its window is the active one, and right click on the Window/Encrypt function of GPGShell.

Hello Robert !
    Does it make sense to disable SSL in my browser for a couple of weeks?
    HTTPS is linked with TLS v1.2 128 bit ARC4 (2048 bit RSA/SHA) instead.

@_subject: Requesting public key with GnuPG 1.4.18 
Hash: RIPEMD160
Hello !
    Is this behaviour correct with 1.4.18 ?
    When I request the public key on a signed message, GPG cannot find it and I
get this message:
=== Begin Windows Clipboard ===
gpg: Signature made 02/20/14 14:11:43
gpg:                using RSA key 0x05E136A0
gpg: requesting key 0x05E136A0 from hkp server keyserver.kjsl.com
gpgkeys: key FC3B17DE05E136A0 can't be retrieved
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: Total number processed: 0
gpg: Can't check signature: public key not found
=== End Windows Clipboard ===
    I see key 0x05E136A0 is about to be requested from server, but what's that secundary number "FC3B17DE05E136A0"?

Hello Werner !
    I had a doubt, as I didn't notice before that the long KeyID has the same last 8 digits than the short.
    Did always GPG get the key from a server with the long KeyID? I was thinking it used the 0x8

@_subject: default user and recipient 
Hash: RIPEMD160
Hello Herb !
    In GPG.CONF:
default-key 0xCFAF704C
encrypt-to 0xCFAF704C
    means that the default key for signature is defined; and the message or file will be encrypted always to it too, for your personal use, otherwise you couldn't read your own message.
    If you got the public key of the other person, you need to tell GNUPG what you want; two ways for that:
Add "-r person" on the command line
    or
default-recipient person (in GPG.CONF)

    ...OK, stamping "emit-version" twice in GNUPG.CONF restores version like in

    But what was the purpose of this feature?

Hash: RIPEMD160
Hello !
    With 1.4.16, I suppose there is no way to change the size of the main key (actual 1024), isn't it?
    I'm limited to RIPEMD160.

Hello David !
    ...yes but I mean: I've a DSA 1024 key KeyID: 0xCFAF704C
    Is there a way to upgrade to a 2048 key without changing main key KeyID: 0xCFAF704C ?
