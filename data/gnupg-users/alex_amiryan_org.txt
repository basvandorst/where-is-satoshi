I've printed out my paperkey and keeping it in my home. I am not making
any illegal things, so police will not come to investigate my house one
day :). So it is secure for me in case that one day my home and work
computers explode at the same time :)

No, I don't agree with that. For example I am using GnuPG to send
sensitive information, such as monthly invoices to tax service. I don't
want somebody to intercept these documents, thats why I am using GnuPG.
Using GnuPG is not meaning that I am hiding illegal things. Just I am
using my right of privacy. For example if I am saying something quietly
to my friend, it is not meaning that I am saying bad things about somebody.
I wrote, if my home and work COMPUTERS explode at the same time. For
example because of electric shock (It happened to me twice in my life :)).
