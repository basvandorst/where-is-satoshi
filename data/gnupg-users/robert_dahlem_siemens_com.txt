@_subject: How to verify that a signature is from a specific sender 
How do I verify (or decrypt and verify) something so that I can be sure the mail or file was signed exactly by sender X and noone else?
In other words: I have a little shell procedure running on all my mail. Purpose is to receive and store some files automatically if they where encrypted and signed by a specific sender. If I have a large keyring then everyone with a public key entry in my keyring can send such a file to me and my procedure will happily store it even if the sender is not the one I would like to allow to.

This still fails on files whiche are signed _and_ encrypted, probably because it cannot decrypt the files without access to ~/.gnupg/secring.gpg
That's what I'll do after messing around with this stuff for quite a while now. :-)
Thank you anyway.
