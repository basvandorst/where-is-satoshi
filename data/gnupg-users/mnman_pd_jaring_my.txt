@_subject: could not encrypt to 29 keys using gpgshell 
Hash: SHA1
Hello gnupg-users,
I have problem using gpgshell. When I want to encrypt n sign to
29 group members keys using gpgtray current window, I received
following message: "bad command or file name". I could encrypt n
to 28 members keys. Anybody using gpgshell encounter this
problem ?
By the way I use gnupg 1.2.4 and gpgshell 3.20. OS Windows ME.

Hash: SHA1
Hello gnupg-users,
I need help.
I'm a newbie to gpg. I've already import all my pgp keys to gpg. When
I try to sign & encrypt to others using The Bat built-in gpg, I
receive following errors:
gpg: mnman skipped: public key already present
gpg: D6506963: There is no indication that this key really belongs to the owner
gpg: [stdin]: sign+encrypt failed: unusable public key
I could only sign & encrypt to myself.
My gpg.conf as below:
default-key 0x0F8CFE9629D7378D
encrypt-to 0x0F8CFE9629D7378D
keyring c:\gnupg\pubring.gpg
secret-keyring c:\gnupg\secring.gpg
What could be the source of error?
Thanks in advance.

Just installed GnuPG 1.4.2 rc1 to my Win ME.

What does this means ? TIA.
