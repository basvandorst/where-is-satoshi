@_subject: decrypt corrupted file 
I have a partially corrupted pgp encrypted file. Decryption fails with
the following message:
gpg: fatal: zlib inflate problem: invalid block type
Is it somehow possible to tell pgp to skip the problematic block and
continue in order to rescue at least some information?
