@_subject: Does the SCM SCR3320 work with GnuPG? 
If it is a v2 card as you mentioned earlier you should try using GnuPG 1.4.10. I had pretty much the same issues with a PC/SC reader (ReinerSCT cyberjack ecom plus) on Debian Lenny (1.4.9-3+lenny1) until I tried 1.4.10 with which there were no problems, except that I did not get the keypad to work yet.
