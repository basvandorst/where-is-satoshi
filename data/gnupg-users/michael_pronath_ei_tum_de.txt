@_subject: missing self-signature 
I've got a PGP-key from a company's key server.  GnuPG 1.0.7 refuses to
import it, because it is signed only by the trustcenter, not by the
user, therefore "missing self-signature".  I can't change their policy,
therefore my question is:  Is there any way to use this key with GnuPG,
or do I have to use PGP on Windows, as they suggest anyway?
