Another big dip this fortnight, though not quite as big as last time.

============================== START ==============================
Updated graph at A minor rise in MSDs this fortnight.  I suspect it's due to the
ElGamal key revocations

I've updated the footsie graph with these results:
Another small decrease this fortnight, but nothing dramatic.

The wild keysigning excesses of the summer are over; the graph is
levelling off a bit: Jason, are you interested in hosting this on your own site?  Updating it
is quite trivial and completely automatable.

Seems a bit broken to me.  The following keys are no longer listed in
the report:
... and that's just from the set of 79 keys in my LUG.  I can probably
find other no-long-appearing keys if necessary.  I've signed many of
these keys myself, so I know them to be valid.

Thanks, Jason.  As usual, I've taken your analysis and added it to
my footsie analysis, however the URL and presentation have changed
a little:
It now also retrieve the status.txt file for each analysis and use that
to generate the size of the strong and reachable sets over time.
Executive summary: the size of the WoT is increasing over time and the
tightness is also increasing.
By the way, the keyanalyze-discuss mailing list appears to be down.
