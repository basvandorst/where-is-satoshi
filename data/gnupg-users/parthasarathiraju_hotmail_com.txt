Hello All,
I have built the GnuPG -1.4.2 with ldap and curl support.As I am new to this product i don't know how to run the binaries like gpgkeys_curl, gpgkeys_finger, gpgkeys_hkp,gpgkeys_ldap.Through searching on the net i failed to find any helpful resources regarding these ones.
Can anyone please suggest me the way, how to execute these binaries or locate any helpful resources.
