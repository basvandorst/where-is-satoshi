You may try this:
Set registry as

you can put your key-rings and option file there.
Set registry as
for your GPG program location.
It's work for me. If there is anything wrong let me know, please.
users with just one registry setting.
user's specific keys go in their keyring.

Sorry, I don't really understand about your question. The answer of yours
that I have gave to you as last reply as below. BTW, if the original file is
in binary format that you can't decrypt it into a text file.
Or, your question is about encryption? If my guess is right, the command
should like this:
gpg -ear RECEIPT_NAME FILENAME_TO_ENCRYPT
For more information, you need to read gpg.man or use gpg --help.

Thanks for your reply, sorry about my question. The question is I need to use a private key (passphase) in order to decrypt
a pgp file. Using the command line you gave me in the previous email, I need to input
the private key when it prompt. Is there anyway I can use 1 command line to do the whole process ? Thanks Andrew.

To make gnupg speak your language, create a "GPGmo1.reg"
file containing the following text, verbatim:
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Mingw32\NLS]
# Save this to "GPGmo1.reg". You must select your
# own *.mo file and save it as "gnupg.mo" in the

# be c:/gnupg, c:/gnupg/locale, or the standard

# To activate: doubleclick on GPGmo1.reg.
# To disable: remove or rename gnupg.mo.

some times it didn't encrypt message before sending. Also, the

Anyway, it is a good and only (as I know) for OUTLOOK plug-in,

Hello all,
I've installed Mandrake 8.0 on my PC and it included the GPG 1.0.4, but I'd

manual. After installed, the GPG is still in 1.0.4.
Mandrake's GPG is a RPM package but there is no 1.0.6 RPM package yet. Is
that possible to remove 1.0.4, there are some dependent packages, then
install 1.0.6?

That is probably due to the setting of your PATH.

I am pretty sure that there is a Mandrake package with 1.0.6 out; I
have seen an announcement on Bugtraq.  However, I don't use Mandrake
and thus not able to tell you details.

I've got this tip for making GPG easier to use in Windows.
To add encrypt/decrypt commands to the context menu (right click on a file):
Assuming gpg.exe is installed in c:\app\gnupg
the id of the key you'd like to use is ID
then with
in the key HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell
(create the shell key if it is not there yet):
For encrypting create a key:
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\GPG encrypt and sign with \command
put double qoutes around the %1 in case the file name has spaces.
If you have more keys, then add more entries
For decrypting create a key:
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\GPG decrypt and verify (to file.out)\command

Hi Peter,
I think I didn't describe my question about long file name clearly.
I tried to decrypt a file "filenameover8.txt.asc", the out put file
is "filena~1.asc.out". I just wondered is there some way to ensure
that GPG can get a long file name form correctly.
If this is a limitation, it's OK. Those tips already help me much and
convenience enough. Thanks!
