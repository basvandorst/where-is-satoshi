@_subject: GnuPG failing to decrypt all files 
I have a curious problem. I just installed GPG4win and I'm having issues with my tests. I randomly selected three files from my desktop to encrypt. Two were clear text and one was an xlsx. I encrypted them in a folder with no errors. It did package them in a gzipped tarball I believe. When I decrypted, Kleopatra insisted there were no errors. However when I went to check only two of the files were present (one ascii and the xslx). The one that didn't decrypt was a bat file, so I thought it may exclude those from the tar so I changed it to a .txt extension to no avail.after testing for a bit I thought it was a fluke and moved on.
I then tried setting up GPG4win on a user's computer and encrypted 101 files. Mostly Excel and Word binaries (before they went XML). The same thing happened. 101 files selected for Encryption, 100 files decrypted. We saved a copy (only modifying the name) of the Excel file and out of 102 files, only 101 decrypted! And the copy encrypted/decrypted fine. The original file was still missing.
I went back to check my first error on my computer with verbose logging, and I clipped what I thought was relevant below (input/out errors) from the gpgagent daemon. Am I doing something wrong? Can I check to see what was encrypted file-by-file to ensure all files are archiving properly?
I'm hoping to replace a securitybox install with this. Any help would be appreciated.

@_subject: [OT] passphrases Was: Re: Allowing paste into pinentry-gtk-2? 
I think a lot of this password philosophy is nonsense for most people. The only things that are likely to be brute-forced are Edge devices with some sort of tactical purpose. Average Joe user is more at risk from phishing or another social engineering tactic.
I'm a big fan of ridiculously large passwords that are completely unintelligible that include all sorts of !)/GJhj32;':" characters for static non-user based accounts. Now that password has to be stored though, which then gets into how should the password itself be secured...

Actually around 58 months: just under 5 years.
Are you asserting that there exists a group that can brute-force a 64-bit key in a few seconds?

If you leave it up a user, they'll choose nothing, or the last four of the social. There should be criteria, but not public criteria.

Sender: gnupg-users-bounces at gnupg.org
Isn't the real problem that *any* policy (suggested or enforced)
reduces the complexity of guessing a password?  The moment you start
saying "pick three words separated by a space or dash" or "pick eight
random letters" or the like you make it easier to attack a password.
My employer insists on passwords that meet a defined and public set of
criteria.  I'm sure that in theory that actually makes them easier to
crack, since many millions of possibilities can be discounted.
In short: don't force a particular strategy on your users.  Much
better to explain to users the general problem, and then leave it up
to them to pick a password.

I prefer a homogeneous environment because once a plaintext user replies to an HTML message the HTML tags inundate the message and it becomes mostly unreadable. So in my opinion, either all plaintext or all HTML.

Hi Jerry,
I don't hate any one for using Microsoft - I even beta-tested Windows 3.11 and Windows 95/98
till I realised that though we filed bug reports Microsoft in Ireland took no notice.
And as an ex-Chairman and ex-Vice President of a US Company we had an ethical trading policy
to which the Microsoft Corporation failed to comply with. They still seem to be facing
problems in the EU.
If I were to suggest that you should support your local bank robber or mugger and give them
every assistance and that all criminals be released - you would suggest that I was mad.
Microsoft does engage in illegal business practices - and are supported by millions every
day with their lock in licences and anti-competitive practices.
I just have a better grasp of business ethics and better grasp in recognising software
freedom - but I don't hate people for their ignorance of Microsoft's bad and illegal
business practices.
Most people have Microsoft on their desktop or laptop without any choice. They do not have
the freedom of choice. Most people like my girlfriend just switch on their laptop or desktop
and use it without any knowledge that there are alternatives.
As some one said "Microsoft gives you Windows - Linux gives you the whole house" that whole
house is for free. Microsoft lock you in - they lock companies in too. They engage in
illegal business practices.
I often find it odd that people when they get to know about Microsoft's illegal business
practices that they continue to have a Microsoft Operating System on the desktop or laptop.
Companies that sell desktops and laptops operate with very small margins - but the licence
that goes to Microsoft is constant about 12 years ago it was a fact that IBM paid Microsoft
a licence fee for every machine it sold - $400 USD. So when desktops or laptops are sold in
a sale there is no reduction of licence fee which remains a constant.
A computer buyer can not go into say PC World and say "I like that HP or Acer, but I will
buy it with or without an operating system or with a Linux distro installed." They have no
choice. Microsoft's business policy is "No choice but Microsoft for the general consumer and
for the business user."
I support freedom of choice - I support ethical business practices. Microsoft Corporation
does not support any ethical principles. It is not a question of "I hate Microsoft." I don't
support unethical or illegal business practices.
I also think that the majority of computer users are in ignorance. But you can Google and
see for yourself the basis of business practice by Microsoft Corporation. Oh and once IBM
had a licence for Windows - IBMers are not told to talk about that.
But once you do know - then you have a choice - continue to support anti-competitive
unethical and illegal business practices of the Microsoft Corporation or if you support
ethical good practice and no criminal activity. Your choice as everyone else's.
As an oldy (63) I prefer plain txt. I don't admonish people for sending me HTML with all
manner of fancy fonts - I just accept it.

@_subject: Assuan processing failed 
I'm running GnuPG 1.4.9 on Windows. I'm trying to cache a passphrase using gpg-preset-passphrase so I can batch decrypt a couple hundred files. I've successfully decrypted the by manually entering the passphrase. However I'd like to cache the passphrase so that I can script the decryption.
I started gpg-agent as a daemon and get the following output: Set GPG_AGENT_INFO=C:\Documents and Settings\user\Application Data\gnupg\S.gpg-agent;948;1
The log file shows:
(Omitting datestamp & timestamp) gpg-agent[pid] listening on socket (path to)\S.gpg-agent
Datestamp timestamp gpg-agent[pid] DBG returning notify handle 00000734
I run the command: gpg-preset-passphrase --passphrase (passphrase) --preset (hexcode)
and it outputs:
Gpg-preset-passphrase: problem with the agent
Gpg-preset-passphrase: caching passphrase failed: Invalid response
Checking the log again I see:
gpg-agent[pid] Assuan processing failed: IPC read error
How can I correct this error?

@_subject: STEED - Usable end-to-end encryption 
It should probably be likened to sending a letter in an security-obscured and tamper evident envelope. How often is that done?
That being said, I've appreciated the discussion on this topic. Being a neophyte to mail encryption (I haven't even set up any of my own yet) gives a good perspective of the challenge.  Providing the tools, putting the security envelopes next to the regular ones, is a crucial first step and no matter how much user or carrier adoption hand-wringing occurs nothing will change until the tools are accessible. Note the distinction between "accessible" and "available".
Hash: SHA256
This one should be obvious: because a postcard doesn't allow you to
write much more than a Twitter post, and many times people need to
send more than a handful of characters.  In the mid-to-late '90s,
prior to the adoption of email, I was routinely sending my girlfriend
ten-page letters.  The envelope was pretty handy for keeping all those
pages together.
We keep on trotting out the envelope analogy, but perhaps we should do
some more thinking before we do that.  It doesn't appear to me to be
as advantageous to our position as we think.  The envelope gives the
letter author immediate benefits beyond just enhanced privacy.

I think a beta installer would be a good idea. I'll be glad to test it
on 32 bit Windows XP and 64 bit Windows 7. Beyond just normal operations
if you want to publish some regression tests I'll be glad to run those
too. :)
