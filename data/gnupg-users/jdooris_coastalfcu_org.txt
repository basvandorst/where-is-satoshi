@_subject: 1K file creation in PGP 
I have had several problems with PGP command line v8.5 build 303 creating 1K files that contain nothing when decrypted. I was told by PGP tech support that it was a known issue in that version of he software and if I upgraded it would resolve the issue. My question is will GnuPG have this same issue or not?
