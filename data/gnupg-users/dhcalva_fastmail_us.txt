How about just purging a Key that's had no activity in X amount of time,
say Six months?
On a side note, does anyone know of any way to get Thunderbird (And
presumably other email clients as well) to reply to the list address
instead of the person writing the email for this list?  This seems to be
the only one I'm having a problem with.
