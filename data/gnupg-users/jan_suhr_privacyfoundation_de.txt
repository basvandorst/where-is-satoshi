@_subject: gpg2 does not detect smart card adapter 
I am using the OpenPGP Card with a "Gemplus GemPC Twin 00 00" smart card
adapter and it works fine with gnupg 1. But gnupg 2 does not find my
smart card adapter and tells me "OpenPGP Karte ist nicht vorhanden:
Umbekanntes IPC Kommando" (OpenPGP card ist not available: unknown IPC
command). My system is Ubuntu and I used its gnupg(1) and gnupg2 packages.
Also removing libccid and pcscd did not help.
Any idea how to fix it?

I get the following message:
"Aufruf: gpg-connect-agent [Optionen] (-h f?r Hilfe)"
What to do?
Hopefully we will get this ok when the above problem is solved.

I retrieve: "ERR 103 unknown command"
I was told that you also will release 1.4.10 with support for the
OpenPGP Card V2. Do you have any schedule when this will be available?

I installed gnupg 2.0.12 but this had no effect. Unfortunately the error
is still the same.
Please note that I did _not_ upgraded the required libraries but used
the version which are provided in Ubuntu. Do you recommend to upgrade
the required libraries as well?
Any suggestion how to "fix" the error?

Hi Werner!
In installed gnupg from svn so that "scdaemon --version" reports to be
2.0.13-svn5074. Unfortunately I experience the same behaviour.
gpg-agent is up and running
All files in /dev/bus/usb/NNN/MMM have write permissions.
gpg-connect-agent 'SCD getinfo version' /bye
replies: "ERR 103 unknown command"
I get the same message when starting gpg-connect-agent first and
entering "SCD getinfo version" afterwards.
Thus I executed "gpgconf --reload scdaemon" but the previous error
message remains.
Doing a "ps xa" tells me that scdaemon is not running. So maybe "gpgconf
--reload scdaemon" was not working?
Thus I started "scdaemon --daemon" which seems to start the daemon.
Still "gpg-connect-agent 'SCD getinfo version' /bye" tells me "ERR 103
unknown command".
Any ideas are really appreciated.

@_subject: Changing GPG's default key type? 
For my understanding GnuPG is standard conform and creates a "DSA
primary key (1024 bits - not "DSA2") with an Elgamal subkey per default."
It was discussed in May to change this standard to 2048-bit RSA key:
I am planing to create some new keys which will be used for the next
couple of years. Therefore I am wondering if it is a good idea to create
2048-bit RSA keys already although it is not standard (yet). So
potentially it could cause incompatibility issues. I suppose most of the
correspondents (>90%) use GnuPG and thus should not have any problems
with the keys.
Do you have further information about the coming standard key type? Are
there any other obstacles or implications to consider and what is your
Thanks and regards

@_subject: problem: OpenPGP Card 2.0 + GnuPG 1.4.10b 
I installed the latest build of GnuPG 1.4.10b for Windows and tested the
OpenPGP Card 2.0 the following way:
1. Generated new keys on the OpenPGP Card 2.0 for email address
test at example.com
2. Encrypted a file: "gpg -e -r test at example.com testfile"
3. Decryted the file: "gpg -d testfile.gpg"
Unfortunately I retrieve the following error:
C:>gpg -d testfile.gpg
gpg: detected reader `Gemplus USB Smart Card Reader 0'
gpg: detected reader `Texas Instruments SmartCardSlot 0'

I don't understand the reason for this problem because the claimed key
278D09E8 is exactly what I generated before. "gpg --card-status" proves
that the required key is available:

Any idea what is wrong?
