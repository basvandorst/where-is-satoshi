@_subject: Diable comment string on a per-message basis? 
Is it possible to diable comments on a per-message basis? I'd like to be
able to tell gpg *not* to use the comment string in the options file when
signing or encrypting certain messages.

Removing it by hand worked, as did the --comment "" approach. However, I
was wondering why it was allowable to modify it manually. I thought
anything between the beginning and ending tear lines was supposed to be
"protected." Is the comment line an exception?

@_subject: Force binary encryption? 
Is there an opposite to the -a flag? I have ascii armoring turned on by
default in my option file, but sometimes I want to created a binary
encrypted file. Can I override the default on the commandline?
