I've just learned that I might attend Cebit. I was wondering if there
was plans to have a keysigning event / party ? and if so where the meet
point would be.

@_subject: PGP/MIME considered harmful for mobile 
Some Nokia phones also have issues. So for work related email I use a
company provided cert and S/Mime for signing emails, while for my
personal emails I use pgp.

@_subject: Best Way to announce a Key Party 
Hi all,
I'm trying to get as much possible people to a key party i'll organize
in 3 weeks. What are my best options , besides contacting local users
via biglumber, posting to upcoming.org and contacting the local LUG
(Area I'm targetting in Toronto CA) ?

Any idea how to fix this ?
