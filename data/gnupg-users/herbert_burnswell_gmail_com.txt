I am new to pgp and would like to understand the minimum flags that I
should be using for my encryption/decryption needs.  I just want to encrypt
files for decryption by one other person.  We have exchanged public keys.
I have read in several places that I can run:
gpg -e filename
However I receive:
You did not specify a user ID. (you may use "-r")
Current recipients:
Enter the user ID.  End with an empty line:
1. Can I set default behavior to not have to specify a user ID?
2. What other flags should be used per best practices?
Any guidance is greatly appreciated,

Sorry.  I found the default-recipient parameter in the ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
file.  However, when I set:
I receive:
No such user ID.
I have not uploaded my newly created key information to a keyserver,  Is
that a requirement?

which I assume means that the default key (I only have one) is used for
both encryption and decryption.  However, I receive:
No such user ID.
I have not uploaded my newly created key information to a keyserver,  Is
that a requirement?  What are good 'best practices' flags that should be
used with encryption and decryption with pgp?
Thanks in advance, any guidance is greatly appreciated.

Hello Herb !
    In GPG.CONF:
default-key 0xCFAF704C
encrypt-to 0xCFAF704C
    means that the default key for signature is defined; and the message or
file will be encrypted always to it too, for your personal use, otherwise
couldn't read your own message.
    If you got the public key of the other person, you need to tell GNUPG
you want; two ways for that:
Add "-r person" on the command line
    or
default-recipient person (in GPG.CONF)
Hi Laurent
Thank you for your reply.  I have updated my gpg.conf and imported the pub
key from the receiving user.
I am planning on putting my encryption/decryption into a script.  However,
when I run:
# gpg -r  -e I receive:
There is no assurance this key belongs to the named user
It is NOT certain that the key belongs to the person named
in the user ID.  If you *really* know what you are doing,
you may answer the next question with yes.
Use this key anyway? (y/N)
Everything works fine upon replying 'y' but obviously this will not work in
a script.  Any idea of how to not have this check?
