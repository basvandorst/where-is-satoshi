@_subject: Decrypt files with embedded filenames 
I was running into the use-embedded-filename option not working also on
Solaris using 1.0.6 and here's what I came up with:
The decrypt_message() call in decrypt.c causes opt.outfile to be set to '-'
since we assume --outfile isn't needed.  In plaintext.c the check for
opt.outfile is before the !opt.use_embedded_filename in handle_plaintext()
and use_embedded_filename is never used.
Change decrypt.c line 70 from if ( !opt.outfile )
if ( !opt.outfile && !opt.use_embedded_filename )
Hope this helps.
