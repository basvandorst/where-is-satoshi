@_subject: Encryting both file contents and file name with GnuPG 
I'm completely new to GnuPG.
Can someone tell me how I can encrypt the name of the file that I want to
encrypt please.
mySecrets.txt [a plain text file]
I would like:
szstt.asd [some 'apparently random name' file] [file contents encrypted]
I see that secureZip can do this, I have used a trial version with success.
However I would prefer to use GnuPG if possible.

SecureZip will take a file and encrypt both the filename and the file.
so far with GnuPG i can only see how to encrypt the file.
i do not want to use a specific name as there are too many files to do that.
i want something like;
gpg -recipient "Neil Phillips" -output_encrypt "mySecrets.txt" -encrypt
where i end up with my source file "mySecrets.txt" and a GnuPG encrypted file
whose name is the result of encrypting "mySecrets.txt"
sort of nesting i guess.
so where it says -output_encrypt "mySecrets.txt" i want the result of:
gpg -recipient "Neil Phillips" -encrypt [just the name: "mySecrets.txt]
i am using windows. the source file location is secure.
i want to place a copy of the source file in an unsecure place.
hence i want to rename the file as well as encrypt the file itself.
so the question remains, can i encrypt the name of the file in GnuPG?

filename inside the encrypted
--use-embedded-filename option if
i was hoping to do the following;
locate a source file.
place the name of the source file in a log.
encrypt the source file name and contents
add to the log the name of the encrypted file.
that way i have a list which tells me what the real name of the file is.
i can use the log to pick which file i want to decrypt.
the log will the kept locally which is secure for my purposes.

aha that sounds like a plan.
gpg should be able to give a hash, something like;
gpg -output sha1("a filename") -e filename
i'll give it a tryout tomorrow.

or rather something like;
type sha1(filename)| gpg -o 0 -e filename
echo sha1(filename)| gpg -o 0 -e filename

@_subject: defaults / homedir / loal variable / option file etc 
gpg -version = 2.0.14
So i'm looking at changing some of the defaults used by gpg.
cipher, compression that sort of thing.
i've read that i can use a command line to use a specific options file,
something like --options file
but thats a per use, not a set default behaviour.
it says i can place stuff in a file called gpg.conf that is located in my
C:\Profiles\xxx\Application Data\gnupg folder.
well there is no gpg.conf file there :(
it says --homedir can change the default location of the home directory, the
place where i should see my gpg.conf file.
it says that i can find my home directoy in the Registry under the key
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\GNU\GnuPG using the name "HomeDir"
well there is no GnuPG folder there :(
apparently i could set a user-level environment variable, GNUPGHOME.
no such variable exists :(
my questions are:
1. can i use a gpg.conf file to set some default behaviours for gpg?
2. where should the gpg.conf file be stored.
3. do i need a registry entry at all?
i do have an entry in the path variable which is allowing me to use gpg.
i have created a key for myself and can use that from anywhere in my file system
with gpg to generate an encrypted file without any error messages.
i'm assuming that my key does not contain settings for which cipher to use or
which compression method or which hash method to use and that those settings are
picked during the actual encryption of my file?
