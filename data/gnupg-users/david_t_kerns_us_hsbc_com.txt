I'm new to gpg so not sure if gpg has a recursion flag, but on unix:
gpg --encrypt --multifile `find /thisfolder -type f -print`
should work.

@_subject: keyserver 
I've searched the FAQ and mailing list (albeit not exhaustively) but don't
find much info on setting up a keyserver.
I've set up a keyserver inside the corporate firewall and am hoping to have
that one system share keys with a public server.
My thoughts are I only have to configure one system to barrel through the
firewall rather than every user on every server in my network.
Certainly I'm not the first one to encounter this. Can anyone point me to
some documentation?

@_subject: Keyservers and the future 
I don't mean to butt into the conversation, but it sounds like you're
missing the whole point.
The whole purpose of this is that it eliminates spoofing of the domain
It doesn't matter if there's 1 user or 1 billion users behind aol.com (or
johndoe.org) if the mail says it's the from domain xxx.org you can be sure
it IS from xxx.org not 11.22.33.44 spoofing to be xxx.org (apologies to the
holder of that IP address, as this is a purely hypothetical example)
Radu's question is then, "will the keyserver model scale to hold keys for X
billion domain names?"

@_subject: mpi larger than indicated length 
I'm doing some inter platform/product testing..
I was running GnuPG 1.4.1 and pks0.9.4 keyserver on Solaris 5.8
I sent my publickey to my counter part running PsypherOPS on the mainframe
He encrypted a file and sent it to me. When I tried to decrypt it I got the
following error message:
$ gpg -d IFO.SECURE.PGP
gpg: mpi too large (51692 bits)
gpg: Ohhhh jeeee: mpi crosses packet border
secmem usage: 0/0 bytes in 0/0 blocks of pool 0/32768
So I Googled the error message and found several articles about upgrading
to pks0.9.5 to rid the error
(I was a bit skeptical since I had sent him my public key and not used the
keyserver for the exchange)
but I figured I'd try it. I found pks0.9.6 on sourceforge and built and
installed it. While that was building
I Googled more and found an article that said GnuPG 1.4.2 had a better
error message for mpi problems
So I build and installed GnuPG1.4.2 (woot! I'm current, for the moment)
Now I'm getting the following error message:
$ gpg -d -vvv  IFO.SECURE.PGP
gpg: using character set `iso-8859-1'
gpg: armor: BEGIN PGP MESSAGE
gpg: armor header: Version: PsypherOPS 4.30.00 - :pubkey enc packet: version 3, algo 16, keyid 9E1BA0486180F04C
        data: [2047 bits]
        data: [2045 bits]

        data: [1024 bits]
gpg: mpi larger than indicated length (0 bytes)
        data: [MPI_NULL]
Can anyone shed some light on this?
Do I need to regenerate my key and send my counter part the new public key?
Or have I run into a compatibility issue with PsypherOPS?
