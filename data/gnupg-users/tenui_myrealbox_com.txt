@_subject: bzip2 cross-compiling problem 
I posted this yesterday morning but it seems to have gone missing in
cyber space, so let's try again.
I have installed the Debian MinGW environment to cross-compile gpg for
Windows. My first attempt, with 1.4.1rc2, seemed to compile without
problems, but when transferred to a Windows box I found there was no
bzip2 capability included.
I am using Libra Net 2.8.1. I have the bzip2 and libbzip2 .deb packages
installed, so what else could be missing, or is there some configuration
option I must include in autogen.sh or configure.ac?

Hi John,
Ever since the 1.3.x series started I have been native compiling my
Windows versions, but since the change in the Linux cross-compiling
environment it is much simpler to cross compile from Linux - except for
this bzip2 issue.
The official Windows installer release has bzip2 capabability....so how
the heck does Werner do it?

Thanks Maxine. That seems simple, but I would really like to include the
bzip2 capabaility in gpg.exe, as in the official installer version for
