@_subject: (1) BAD signature and (2) auto SHA1 
Hash: SHA1
Someone else already answered this better than I.  Basically it means the
message was altered since it was signed.  It may have been altered by
software not sensitive to signatures, or it's a dreaded attacker trying to
falsify a message.
In Mutt, the easiest way might be to pipe the message to gpg and witness
the output.  Type this:
It'll tell you if the signature is good.  In newer versions of Mutt, you
can do "escape P", and it will check the message for inline PGP like the
above and treat it accordingly.
Neither of those is automatic, though.
OT: I emailed you about a key signing after seeing your listing on
Biglumber.  Did that get spam filtered or something?
