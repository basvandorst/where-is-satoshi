I've been using FSFE Fellowship OpenPGP smartcard for a couple of
weeks and now I'm getting error messages.
I wonder if it's the smartcard reader (SCR335) or the smartcard
I've attached the output of:
gpg --debug 2048 --debug-ccid-driver -v --card-status
My gpg version is 1.4.10 and it is the one that comes with
Ubuntu-10.04-based systems (I use Trisquel 4.0).
I'd appreciate any hint. --Osama Khalid

Are you referring to the regular ATM card? Unfortunately, it seems
that SCR335 accepts only cards with the SIM-like part.
Also, what's the PowerOn command?
Thanks for the hint!

@_subject: Restoring a backup key 
When I generated my OpenPGP smartcard, I asked GPG to save a backup
version of the key. It did that in an
"sk_.gpg" file.
Now I'm trying to find a way to restore my secret key.
Currently, "$ gpg --list-secret-keys" has no output, but "$ gpg
--list-keys" does list the public key of my secret key.
Running "$ gpg --allow-secret-key-import --import sk_<...>.gpg"
returns in:
And it does not import anything.
I was wondering about the correct way to do that.
Thank you!

After a chat on the gnupg IRC channel, I found out that the backup gpg
made was only partial. It was for one of my secret subkeys.
$ gpg --list-keys

$ gpg sk_<...>.gpg
sec  1024R/567A2834 2010-10-01
The primary secret key is not included in the "sk_<...>.gpg" file. I
wonder why gpg would suggest that "backup of card key saved to
Am I missing something here?

Thank you, John.
The thing is that the card is damaged, and I don't have the secret key
in my kerying.
