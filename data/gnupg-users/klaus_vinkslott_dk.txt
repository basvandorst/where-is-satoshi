I had the same issue and changed dates on my key. Now if I look at my
keystore it looks as my public key life if extended:
klaus at zap:~> gpg --list-key 30096062
pub   4096R/30096062 2009-10-08 [expires: 2015-07-14]
uid                  Klaus Vink Slott sub   4096g/BA72310E 2009-10-08 [expires: 2010-10-08]
but my sub key is not and I guess that is a problem? Can I extend the
life of the subkey or do I issue a new sub-key. Will the new subkey
still carry on the trust from people that people that have signed my
public key?
Another thing that puzzles me is that even if I have uploaded my keys
again to public servers
klaus at zap:~> gpg --send-key 30096062
(in gpg.conf in have keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net)
the servers don't seem to list my new expiry date when I search my key
from the web interface.

Thanks. I opted to extend the key life as I don't suspect that my key has been compromised. I think that in doing so the the gnupg program/handbook is not very good in explaining how to select  key. I find it quite confusing that if you start the program with --edit-key [subkey-id] and issue a expire command - then I am offered to extend the life of the primary key. This let me to the conclusion that is was not possible to extend the validity on a subkey. My fault and now every thing is great for the next 5 years ;-)

This is a really good walk trough. Thanks. I will recommend it to others..
Yes after I updated my subkey I did another try and this time I succeeded.

I am looking for at system to handle signing and verifying documents (not mail) on a document repository on a webserver. I imaging a system who should be able to show the document, and tell who and when it was signed by. It should also enable the user to sign the document by uploading a separate signature file.
I am fully aware that a a solution like that can easily be compromised. But it allows the suspicious user to save the document and the signature to files, transfer both to a "known clean" pc and verify the signature.
Have anybody build a web front like that?

Hmm.. Although The Signserver project seems very interesting I have
difficult to see what it really does. I think I was searching for
something more simple.

I have just switched to use Claws mail and this gives me 3 options in
"Privacy System": PGP inline, PGP Mime and S Mime. On Wed, 26 Dec 2012 12:01:19 +0100 Werner Koch wrote in another tread:
So I guess the recommended selection should be "PGP Mime" like this?

I suspect that Rita was aiming at user E who at a later stage is added
to the allowed readers. User E will still not be able to read earlier
generated data. To my knowledge it is not possible to add another key
to a already encrypted message.
You would have to decode the original data and encode it again, this
time using user E and user C public keys.
