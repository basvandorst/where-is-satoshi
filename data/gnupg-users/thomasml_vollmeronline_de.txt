I use my standard text edit for this. It is vim with the gnupg plugin from Markus Braun (  ) installed.

Please keep the discussion in the mailing list.
Do You have the gpg-agent running? This is required for gvim.

First, this is not a newsgroup, but a mailingl list. Second, newsgroups and mailingslist are not a FAQ. They are for discussions. So everybody could help with problems while finding the solution.
Look at the release notes of version 1605. You find them right from the download link.
There You will find:
"- new plugin options to set preferences for symmetric/asymmetric and armor/binary files
- fix for use with gvim. !! plugin works only in gvim if gpg-agent is available !!"
I dont use gnupg on Windows boxes, so I cant tell You what package You need to get the gpg-agent. AFAIK before the Agent moved into the gnupg2 package there was a standalone package. But this should be way old now.
As I see for now, they do.
gpg-agent only handels the mantra input. Because of this the gnupg plugin needs it f?r the GUI vim. There is no console which can be used for the input and a GUI dialog is needed. This is what gpg-agent does.
