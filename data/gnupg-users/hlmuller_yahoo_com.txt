@_subject: Encrypt files using my secret key 
I apologize in advance for the rtfm response, but you probably want to investigate the --sign and --clearsign options in the gpg manpage.  If you are only looking for authenticity, and not secrecy, then encryption is probably not necessary.
Best regards,

Please, is that possible to encrypt files with gnupg using my secret key ? Then other people could decrypt it using my public key, in order to have authenticity, that is, it came from me ?
Thanks and regards,

@_subject: how to get private key 
It's highly unlikely that an individual would be capable of stealing a secret key and using it to decrypt messages.? A large corporation or government, maybe.? Make your passphrases complex.
I'm a little cautious myself with my secret keys, so I use two hardware based approaches to ease my paranoia:
1.? I use an openpgp card to keep my normal signing and encryption subkeys secure.
2.? I keep my main secret key on a usb flash drive, along with backups of my secret subkeys, and public keys.
These are useful resources for further reading:
Best regards,

@_subject: OpenPGP card stopped working 
I've used the OpenPGP card recently with Gutsy and the Hardy releases without issue. To troubleshoot you can try:
$ ps aux | grep pcscd
The above commands should report two lines, one for the grep command, and the other for the running pcscd.  If you only get the grep command, then pcscd is not starting and you will have to investigate why, or simply try reinstalling it.
If pcscd is running, then my guess is that there is something wrong with the smartcard driver.  It this case I would try reinstalling the driver also.
I'm using a GemPC Twin usb card reader.  To get it to work, I only have to install pcscd.  It pulls in the pcsclite and libccid dependencies.
Hope this helps,

I think I just bumped into your problem.  I've been testing Hardy, and haven't had any problems with the OpenPGP card until now.  I have to investigate further, but preliminary results indicate a udev or related problem.  In Gutsy, the device is created in /dev, in Hardy it is not.  Hardy is still alpha, so I expect breakage.  Additionally, I'm using the amd64 version, not i386.
This is more a problem for the Ubuntu devs I think than for Werner and gang.  So if you are using Hardy, then that may explain your problem.   Doesn't seem to be a problem with Gutsy though, just rechecked.
Best regards,

If you decide not to remove seahorse-agent, for any reason, you can workaround the issue by using the --no-use-agent option with gpg.  You still will be unable to decrypt with seahorse agent.
