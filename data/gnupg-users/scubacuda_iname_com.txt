@_subject: can receive, but not send, encrypted e-mail 
I just recently installed Enigmail/GnuPG on Thunderbird/Windows 2000.
I can receive encrypted mail from people, but I can't send out encrypted e-mail.  When I check the "encrypted" option, it still sends it out in lear text.  Not sure what I might be doing wrong...
Thanks in advance,
