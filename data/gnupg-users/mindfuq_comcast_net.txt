It's not case sensitive.  Also, the -c isn't necessary, unless you
really want a purely symmetric conventional encryption.
Yes Peter, that's right on the money.  The key dictates what
asymmetric algorithm is used.  This is because unlike symmetric
crypto, an asymmetric key is actually a number with meaning that
satisfies an equation with the other key.  With symmetric crypto, the
key can be any set of random bits and any algorithm can be used with
any key, provided that the key is the right length for the algorithm.
So if you want to create an RSA encrypted message, you must encrypt it
with an RSA key, which is an option when you generate the key.  Note
that you may have to use the --expert switch in order to get the RSA
option, I don't recall off the top of my head.

* lomax  [2002-11-01 17:56]:
You might say it's a shortcoming of GPG.  When you generate an
asymmetric key pair, the private key is encrypted with a symmetric
algorithm using your chosen passphrase as the key.  It would be nice
if the key generator would ask you what symmetric algorithm you
prefer, and default it for users who might not know what they're
I believe GPG simply defaults to CAST5 unless you override it w/ the
--s2k-cipher-algo switch.
Now this is a different than the case above.  AES128 is a property in
your certificate that merely recommends which symmetric algorithm to
use.  So here's what will happen if you distribute your certificate
with AES128 as your preferred crypto: the person who sends you a
message will know that you would like to receive AES128 messages, and
if their software supports it, that is likely what will be used,
unless they override it.
In GPG, you can go and change your preferred algorithm to whatever you
want using the --edit-key command.  Keep in mind the sender has
ultimate authority, and can override it with whatever they want when
they encrypt a message.

* James A DePrisco  [2002-11-03 19:04]:
Your questions aren't GPG specific, but I'll answer anyway.
Not at all.  Clearsigning is merely hashing the message, encrypting
the hash using your private key, ascii armoring this, and appending it
back onto the message.  You're not compromizing any sensitive
information, unless the message itself contains something sensitive.
Then in that case, it's dangerous.
By clearsigning, you're not revealing anything about your private key,
other than who the owner is.  ie. I can intercept and copy your
signature, paste it into the window at  and it will
reveal the keyID of the public key needed to verify it.  I could then
look on the key servers and find out that the key belongs to you, and
thus, verify the message came from you.
So the only danger would be if you needed to send a message to someone
anonymously (maybe using an anonymous remailer) so that no
evesdroppers could know your identity, but such that the receiver
needed to verify your identity.  In this case, it would not work.  You
would have to encrypt your signature w/in the message.  If you
clearsign an anonymously remailed message, then anyone who has your
public key or anyone who can retrieve it from a keyserver can verify
that you sent the message.
That unusual strange corner case is the only real issue with
clearsigning.  I recommend encrypting whenever possible.  If you only
encrypt the messages that need disclosure protection, then your
adversary will know what messages to attack.  Nicky Scarfo (a New Jersey mobster) is learning this the hard way
right now.  He only encrypted the data he cared to hide, so the FBI
knew what data to attack.  They sniffed his password, and decrypted
incriminating evidence.
If you and *only you* have your private keys; only then is your
protection assured.  If someone else gets your private key and your
password, they can forge messages posing as you.
If you sign a binary, your signature must be detached.  Otherwise, it
doesn't matter.

I came accross the --throw-keyid switch today.  It's an interesting
switch, in that it withholds the keyid of the receiver from the
encrypted packets.  As a test, I tried clearsigning to see if it would
withhold my keyid from the signature.  Didn't happen.  But wouldn't that be an interesting feature?  It would
protect a sender in the traffic analysis case described above.  The
receiver would either have to know who the message belongs to, or try
all the public keys on their keyring.. but at least traffic analyzers
would have one less peice of information.

Hey that seems to work.. I've always had the same question myself.
Thanks David.
I noticed something strange.. the --verify switch will not seperate
the data from the sig when it comes time to make use of the data.  I
had to use the --decrypt switch, which is awkward because the file
really is not encrypted in the first place.  It's probably just the
data and the sig zipped together.  I would say if this is a feature,
then the documentation should be modified to indicate that the switch
decrypts or uncompresses.
Also, I noticed the man page specifies the syntax as follows:
  gpg  [--homedir name]  [--options file]  [options]  command  [args]
It then lists available commands and options, but no BNF for [args].
My understanding of args is that it specifies the file to be worked
on.. however, args is plural, so does this mean we can list multiple
The --homedir and --options switches are documented under options, so
they should not be listed at this top level.  Technically, I could
specify each of those options twice according to the way it's
represented here.

Someone just pointed out to me that GPG takes a default action if no
command is given, but an argument is.  In fact, even if no command or
argument is given, there is still a default action.  So this indicates
another flaw in the man page.
The syntax in the man page is listed as:
   gpg  [--homedir name]  [--options file]  [options]  command  [args]
and the software is really doing this:
   gpg  [options]  [command]  [args]

@_subject: Changing signature algorithms 
I'm using GPG version 1.0.7 (stock), which is capable of the following
  Cipher: 3DES, CAST5, BLOWFISH, AES, AES192, AES256, TWOFISH
  Pubkey: RSA, RSA-E, RSA-S, ELG-E, DSA, ELG
  Hash: MD5, SHA1, RIPEMD160 My problem is that I can't find the switch to create a non-SHA1 hash.
I want to sign using MD5 or RipeMD160.
Another problem is that with the --cipher-algo switch, I cannot change
the algorithm used to encrypt the hash on my signature.  In fact, this
switch won't even let me select the default DSA algorithm.
I'm guessing that the answer to my second question is that the
algorithm used to encrypt the hash is determined by my key.  Is that
correct?  If so, then what is the --cipher-algo switch used for?
Then I tried to generate an RSA key, and was told it could only be
used to sign messages.  Why can't it be used for encryption?  To
confuse things, I ran a 'showpref' on the key, and it did not list any
asymmetric ciphers, not even RSA; but it did list symmetric ciphers:
AES, CAST5, 3DES.  How are these ciphers used with a key that can only
sign?  My understanding of a signature is that the hash is encrypted
with an asymmetric key, not a symmetric key.

@_subject: Changing signature algorithms 
* David Picón Álvarez  [2002-10-16 20:14]:
Tell me if I'm wrong- when I sign a message, the first thing that
happens is a hash is created (usually SHA1).  Then that SHA1 hash is
encrypted with my private asymmetric key.  So not only do I have a
choice of hashes (SHA1, MD5, RipeMD5), but I also have a choice of
asymmetric crptosystems (RSA, DSA, ..).
Using defaults and a default generated key, my signatures are composed
of an SHA1 hash which is encrypted with my private key using the DSA
algorithm.  Suppose instead I want my signature to be created by
hashing with SHA1 and encrypting with RSA.
I should be able to do that using this command:
  gpg --clearsign --cipher-algo RSA text_msg
but I get an error:
  gpg: selected cipher algorithm is invalid Or if I'm encrypting to myself.  I just tried to encrypt a message to
myself, using my public key; and when I use the --cipher-algo switch
as follows:
  gpg -ea --cipher-algo RSA text_msg
I get:
  gpg: selected cipher algorithm is invalid It doesn't matter what public algorithm I specify.  Then for kicks I
specified a symmetric algorithm, and it worked!  So it seems
--cipher-algo is used to select which *symmetric* algorithm to use.
If that's true, then what does the --s2k-cipher-algo switch do
I will try adding the subkey next.  However, it doesn't seem right to
have to do this, because when I do a pgpdump on an RSA sign-only key,
one of the lines reads:
  Pub alg - RSA Encrypt or Sign(pub 1)
This indicates to me that this sign-only key can be used to encrypt as
well; so I'm not sure what's causing the limitation.  Also, the
following lines are also listed in the pgpdump of the sign-only key:
  Sym alg - AES with 128-bit key(sym 7)
  Sym alg - CAST5(sym 3)
  Sym alg - Triple-DES(sym 2)
This is another indicator that this 'sign-only' key can be used for
encrypting, because symmetric algorithms aren't used to sign.
What am I missing?

@_subject: Purpose of --s2k-cipher-algo switch 
* Timo Schulz  [2002-10-17 08:23]:
I'm starting to realize this.  It seems --cipher-algo and
--s2k-cipher-algo both specify the symmetric key.
I was thinking that a key is just a block of random bits, and as long
as the key is large enough, any algorithm should be able to use it.
And this is probably true of symmetric ciphers, but I overlooked the
fact that every asymmetric algorithm expects to find numbers from each
key that satisfy an equation.  Since the equation is different for
every cipher, a key pair must only work for a specific
equation.. Unless someone is clever enough to make one that works in
multiple algorithms.
Now I'm trying to make sense out of the --s2k-cipher-algo switch.
It's described as the "cipher algorithm used to protect secret keys."
Since the secret (symmetric) key is encrypted with the public
(asymmetric) key, there should be no way to select the algorithm to
protect the symmetric key.  It should then be forced to use the
algorithm the public key is bound to.  Then it lists BLOWFISH as a
default, which is not an asymmetric algorithm.
I'm suspecting that the developers meant something different.
Generally the accepted terminology in crypto is as follows:
  secret key = symmetric key
  private key = secret asymmetric key
  public key = public asymmetric key
I've noticed a few places where the GPG docs use "secret key" when
they mean "private key."  It's looking like that may be what the
developers did when documenting the --s2k-cipher-algo switch.  So are we saying that the --s2k-cipher-algo switch enables me to
choose which symmetric algorithm uses my password to encrypt my
private key?

It seems like there shouldn't be any distinction at all.  If I
generate an RSA key, technically that key can be used for encrypting
or signing.. In fact, signing is encrypting; correct?  Signing is just
taking a hash and encrypting it like it's a message, only the in this
case the private key is used.  The algorithm doesn't care whether it's
a -E or -S key.
Equally confusing, ELG and ELG-E are listed.  No ELG-S?  With the
expert setting, I can create an ELG key that can be used to sign.
