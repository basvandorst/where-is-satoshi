I get the following error when I try to clone gnupg:
Cloning into 'gnupg'...
fatal: read error: Connection reset by peer
I?ve tried to clone it from two different IP addresses. Is there something wrong with the repository?

Your best bet is to use one of these two builds.?The first is using the Modern version. The second uses the older version. The second one also has more options such as a keychain and integration with mail.?
I don't know how to install the pgp software. I have downloaded the tarball and signature from the website. I have OSX El Capitan. I have terminal open but it is not clear as to what I need to do, what I need to type in to Terminal.
Please help?
