@_subject: Pipemode usage 
Hash: SHA1
I am having some troubles in correctly verifying PGP/MIME messages with
detached signatures, therefore I am looking into the --pipemode command.
It all works fine, except if text to verify contains an " character.
How do I have to escape the @ so that this works?
