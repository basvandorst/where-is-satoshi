@_subject: gpg problem while decrypting 
Hi ,
 I'm getting following error  under unix environment when i try to decrypt a
file  from another user .
'gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available'
I've generated a key from a user   'UserA' for example. It's working fine
But when i try to decrypt a file (which is encrypted from user a ) from a
user 'User-BCD'. it gives above error.
Both the user are on the same server.
The exact message is
gpg: encrypted with ELG-E key, ID 3E07473B
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
What may be the reasons. and how this problem can be soved.
Thanks & Regards,
Thanks & Regards,
