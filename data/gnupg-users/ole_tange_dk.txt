@_subject: Problems using 10kbit keys in GnuPG instead of 4kbit keys 
I am really happy that no one so far shown any problems in the part on
using 10kbit keys today (only the justification for using 10kbit keys
seems to be controversial). I have therefore extracted the
non-controversial part as a separate document:
That in itself should show that the problems of using 10kbit keys is
limited to the user self - the communication partners are not
(noticeably) affected by this.
Hopefully that will stop people from recommending against 10kbit keys
for the sake of the communication partners.
