I think this is a stupid question, but: is it possible to make a key for
encryption only - without signing possibilities?
Of course, I can do almost everything by hand - for example - not using
signing possibilities of standard key, but some MUA-s can't.

@_subject: PS. Key with no signing possibilities 
Second sentence was too short.
but some MUA-s can't use two keys in one time or using it not properly.
Encrypt+sign = Encrypt to recipient key and sign my key AND SIGN MY SIGN
ONLY KEY. Thats too much of goodies for me.

Thank You for answer, I think, I'll understand it. By the way:
"Never sign messages, only secure hashes of messages. (I think GnuPG
does this by default)" --Newton-Hammet

Hi All,
I'm new to this list, so Hello to Everybody.
I have few questions and one of them is:
DiskPerf versus/and/or EGADS
from On WinNT with GnuPG,
better entropy or better no?

Binaries of each tools and utils you need (GCC, binutils,  w32api, gdb,
make and so on)
And of course "strip"

Building gnupg on XP is easier than using MS Outlook, but you need the
latest stable versions of:
1. MinGW -- Minimalist GNU For Windows,
2. Minimal System  -- Msys.
You can find it at  or on Sourceforge.
The most easy way is take an executable versions (for today:
MinGW-2.0.0-3.exe and MSYS-1.0.8.exe) and together, in cooperative with
your Pointing Device (Mouse?) installing it - of course if you prefer
alone work you can take binaries in tar.gz format.
Next step - unpack GnuPG, ./configure, make, make check, make install.
You need no options for straight build.
Happy building
