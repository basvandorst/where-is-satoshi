Thanks for your carefully considered input Micah.
This has been on the todo list for a while (the blog is all static hand
written HTML at the moment). I made separate pages as requested just now and
they're online. Should make linking easier (just click on the article headings
on the blog front page).
No we don't have a sponsor offering that at the moment (I'd be delighted if we
did). Which archived mail gave you that impression?
Good point, I'll speak to Anna who made the video about getting it changed.
I guess you're referring to the blog (gnupg.org is HTTPS accessible, but
blog.gnupg.org is not)? The new site will host the blog on a single (not sub)
domain, so all pages will be reachable by an encrypted connection. Does that
answer your question?

I could do that if others are happy with the idea. Any objections? Werner?

Yup. That should be avoided. However there are only a few pages that
critically need to be https it seems to me. Anywhere that source files are
provided clearly needs to be secure. Ideally the manual pages too. But the
front page has no need in my opinion.

Getting Goteo approval
Posted 18th December 2013 by Sam Tuke
The targets are set, the rewards are prepared, the press release has been edited
and translated, and now we?re waiting for approval from the crowdfunding
platform Goteo.
Goteo is like indiegogo, but more forward thinking. It has a special focus on
communal benefits and rewards - projects that benefit society as a whole, not
just project donors (though they can get special rewards too).
Every ?good? produced by a campaign on Goteo, be it artwork, software, event, or
manufactured product, has a license assigned to it, like GPL or Creative
Commons, and as well as asking for money, projects ask for other forms of help
called ?non-economic needs?, like translations or product testing. Goteo?s own
source code is Free Software too, meaning anyone can run their own Goteo
crowdfunding server. That?s the feature that swung our decision to use it for GnuPG.
Because the type of project on Goteo is quite specific however, the acceptance
phase of launching crowdfunding is taking us longer than expected. Right now
we?re working with Goteo?s small team to answer questions which aren?t on the
webforms you fill out when you design your project with their system.
I?m hoping to provide what?s necessary and get acceptance quickly. As soon as we
have it the crowdfunding will launch and newsletter subscribers and Twitter
followers will be the first to know.

Wow that's progress - clearly the newfound attention of 800 digital privacy advocates is having an effect at Goteo.

Yes, it really is :)
Thanks Martin - that last sentence is great even by itself.

Research would definitely be helpful. There are many well written guides, video
tutorials, and even e-learning courses on how to setup GPG however, and some
applications make it very easy.
While technical complexity is undoubtedly a problem, a huge number of
technically proficient people are not using GPG simply because they aren't aware
of its existence or importance. At least, that's what my own experiences tell me.
I'd like to explore this off-list; sounds like you've got some interesting ideas.

Those are great resources I hadn't seen before, thanks for the links!
What do you think about these two? I had a hard time finding quotes from your
articles that fit into 130 chars, so I reworded them:
"GnuPG provides encrypted email and file encryption...this technology is an
integral part of the survival skills of the digital age"
"Scalps have been claimed in Australian politics due to forged emails, yet GPG
has been able to prevent this for years"
Great - I am planning to use one, and I'll keep you posted.

Thanks Ben, I couldn't have asked for more :)
Don't worry about official endorsement from the Pirate Party AU - your quote
communicate GPG's importance sufficiently.

Thanks Marko! Is it OK if I rephrase two of them like this?:
"I use GnuPG because I was taught it's a sin to open other people's letters"
"I use GnuPG because ?I won't trade my independence for anything"

Hi all,
I'm working with Werner to promote GnuPG and raise awareness. To that end we're
collecting quotes from users - endorsements from people who know and trust GPG,
people like you.
If you want to help us, send your own statement about why GPG is important to
you. Please keep it less than or equal to 130 characters, so it can be used on
social networks.
I'll collect them and pick the best for use now and in future.
You trust GPG with what?
It's the only app that does what for you / your business?
Without it you couldn't do what?
"I can correspond with absolute comfort knowing that there was absolutely no
leakage of my mail" (Steve Gibson, Gibson Research)
"Since I started working with top-secret documents, I have been using GPG"
(Bruce Schneier)

Promoting GPG is also promoting crypto. People need a particular tool to use.
GnuPG also needs resources and support - especially for major new features in
future, so promoting its reputation is important.
If you don't agree then you can skip this thread. I realise it's an unusual one
and I don't wish to disturb the usual business of supporting users here.
