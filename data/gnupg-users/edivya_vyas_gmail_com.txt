@_subject: Fwd: rpm signing and verfiy with self signed certificate 
I am signing rpms in the rpm database using public key/private key for
signing the rpms and verify on target. If public key is not available,
error is thrown that public key not available.
Now I am looking for certificate verification for signed rpms. Which
certificate technique should I use for host identity? How can I ask rpm or
gpg to check the certificate on given path and if not available then show
me the error or warning?
