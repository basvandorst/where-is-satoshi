Robert J. Hansen  articulated:
As you stated, Microsoft is not planning any further service packs and
work on the 2003 branch has effectively ended. The 2008 branch is an
improved server and continued use of the deprecated version will only
result in further problems down the line.  Furthermore, while I would
never take lightly the updating of any major system component, be it
hardware or software based, there does come a time when you just bit
the bullet and complete the task. Actually, Microsoft has made updating
between versions of its server easier than you might have thought. You
could start here to get some very general information:
or, if you have paid support, contact them for complete details.
Good luck!

While I do not claim that any of the other large web based operations

By the way Rob, and I mean nothing personal, my reference to GMail as

The EU is a group of neo-fascists/socialists backed to a large extend
by Opera. You would have a better chance of getting a fair hearing as a
black man standing trail with a jury of the KKK than a capitalistic
corporation has in front of the EC, or as it has been called, the
Google is presently under investigation for anti-monopoly laws in the
US. Personally, I have always felt that the anti-monopoly laws in the
US were designed for the robber barons, AKA train & steel and oil
corporation. However, if you are going to use it against on entity, then
you have to apply it uniformly. In any case, your analogy is faulty
since you are comparing business law with criminal law.
Wow, at least, well according to you anyway, you are not an
indiscriminate hater. How thoughtful of you.
Absolutely, F**ken Bulls**t. You always have a choice. The truth of the
matter is that your girlfriend, or any other individual for that
matter, choose an OS that they can actually just turn on and have it
work without spending days attempting to get simple things like
wireless, printers, etcetera operational. Hell, I use FreeBSD as a
hobbyist OS on two machines and it doesn't even support the wireless
"N" protocol after over 5 years. The list goes on and on. People tend
to use what works best for them. Even more so, they use what works best
in their environment.
I need a citation for that. I did a quick search and found nothing
even beginning to approach this $400 mark. In any case, how long has it
been since IBM ceased PC production?
The manufacturer has all ready purchased a license to include the OS
installed. If you don't want it, erase it. How much simpler can it
get. 99% of PC buyers, and the percentage may even be higher, want a PC
with a fully functional OS installed. How many PCs would any store sell
if they came sans OS? I can probably count the number on one hand.
As far a the "Linux" installed, you most certainly can. Do a web
search, but don't use Google. They are under investigation (in more
than one country too).
I assume for starters that you don't use Google, purchase diamonds, you
wouldn't want to support another monopoly (De Beers), etcetera.
Now you really need to supply a citation.
What you are really trying to enforce is the concept of socialism. You
don't hate Microsoft, or any other corporation specifically. You are
using this pseudo "business practice" scenario as a smoke screen to
cover up the fact that you are really an anti-capitalist. You want
software to be free. I have no problem with that as long as it does not
deprive an individual of his due compensation. You usually get what you

Now, XP sales were terminated on October 22, 2010, with support for
service pack three to end on April 8, 2014. So what? Outlook Express is
no longer available. It has been superseded by another product which
works differently. What part of that has got you confused? There are
numerous users who still employ old, EOL'd operating systems. Does that
mean we have to support them at the expense of those who have moved on
to more modern systems and software?
You have also failed to calculate in the simple fact that just because
a system has Win XP installed it is also actively using Outlook
Express. I still have an old PC with XP installed that I keep around
for some gaming exercises. Outlook Express never was used on that
system. The newer version, AKA Windows Mail can run on any version of
Windows. Your assumption that Win XP =  Outlook Express is incorrect.
Windows XP was down to 64% as of March 2010 with Win7 surpassing Vista
by a few percentage points. That data is one year old obviously. I am
reasonably certain that it has progressed quite a bit. That much is
a given since Win XP is no longer available commercially. Outlook

Doug Barton  articulated:
This entire thread breaks down to a few simple principals of which the
most prominent one is if you are going to become a slave to the past.
While one's method may be more circuitous than another's is irrelevant.
The final goal is to produce a high quality product.
Microsoft realized that they could not produce a more functional
version of IE, aka IE9, without abandoning older versions of its OS.
They could have went to great lengths to make older and EOL'd versions
functional with IE9, but that would have been extremely costly and
wasted valuable resources. They simply bit the bullet and moved on.
There are several URLs including on Microsoft's own TechNet that you can
search for verification.
Take for example a user who happens to have a large collection of Disco
cloths hanging around his/her home. Should they keep them in some vain
hope that Disco will return or simply dispose of them and move on to a
newer wardrobe?
The point being that at some point you have to move on. Outlook Express
is dead. It has been officially abandoned by its creator. Yes, there are
still remnants of it in circulation; however, they will all die a
natural death soon enough. Heck, there are still users of FreeBSD 4.x
lurking around. Would you have the creators of every piece of software
out there continuing to waste time and resources on making their
software backward compatible? Do you fully realize what a nightmare
that would become? It is bad enough when a library version is bumped
and I have to rebuild 800+ applications. To continually support this
software is to waste time and resources. Many of the complaints from
FOSS users is that Microsoft's products are bloated. To continue to
support architectures that are no longer viable is to bring the same
criticism upon us.
Perhaps a possible solution would be to freeze "GNUPG" at its present
state of development. Now, start the creation of a new branch that
supports only modern, fully RFC approved standards. It might also offer
the developers a change to clean up some code, etc. Yes, it would take
time, but time well spent I believe. In this way, everybody would be
happy. Those wishing to use the older version would be free to do so;
while those wanting a more streamlined version would have that
opportunity also. It looks like a win-win situation to me.

Excuse me, but where did the term "bug" come from in this discussion? I
specifically stated "bloat". It you don't know the difference then this
discussion is never going to go anyway. Might I suggest:
 for further reading.
Actually, yes I would suggest that we all move. However, that would be
extremely naive of me like believing that readers actually view a
signature and pay heed to a posters requests. Now, RFC does explicitly
obsolete other RFCs, specifically: Obsoletes: 1991, 2440 as stated in
the RFC. There is no specific mention of any other RFC so obviously
obsolescence is not the question here. There are always going to be
slackers; it is just the nature of the beast.
I have no problem with that basic philosophy. If some user wants to use
a seriously comatose method, that is their right I suppose. However, I
find rather interesting the number of users who would state that I
should be willing to accept inline signatures even though it breaks the
functionality of sig-delimiters, plus adds garbage to the actual message
which inevitably some other moron then forwards or replies to with that
same garbage still visible, ad infinitum, yet bitch like little school
girls if some user posts using HTML or attempts to make use of a
Microsoft ".doc" formatted item. For the record, I am opposed to both;
however, that does not change the fact that, that same behavior is
I have seriously considered adding some body checks to my Postfix mail
server to reject messages with inline signatures. I would only then
need to whitelist a few actual bona fide senders that I actually need to
correspond with that still employ the older protocol. Now that sounds
like a real win-win compromise.

Not true. The government only need show that a crime was committed.
Exactly how the crime was committed is not a legal requirement;
although, it is usually something that a jury wants to hear about. It
is the same as charging an individual with murder even though a body
cannot be produced. If the government can show that the individual(s)
can reasonably be viewed as responsible for the death of another, even
without the body, they can be charged with the crime. This again,
pertains to USA law.
You have over simplified this. As the defendant in a criminal case you
are never required to submit any evidence; however, failure to do say
may lead jurors to question your innocents such as when a defendant
takes the 5th. ( avails him/her self of the fifth amendment rights
against self incrimination) multiple times during a court proceeding.
The act of hiding or failing to produce evidence is not a crime if
committed by the defendant. This pertains to USA law. How it is
adjudicated in other countries is beyond my scope of knowledge.

insightfulmac  articulated:
Please don't top post (corrected here). If you don't know what that
means, Google for it.
Windows, and DOS before it, uses a pair of CR and LF characters to
terminate lines. UNIX (Including Linux and FreeBSD) uses an LF
character only. The Apple Macintosh, finally, uses a CR character only.
In other words: a complete mess.
This has basically always been the norm. I have used many different
programs to convert between the multiple styles without incident. Many
modern applications, at least on a Windows platform, can transform
these different styles transparently for the end user. While I have no
experience with "GPGServices", I am wondering if that isn't something
that should be considered.
From the GPGServices web site:
GPGServices is a plugin for the global OS X Services menu, which adds
the ability to almost any application (e.g. Safari, Finder, or
TextEdit) to use OpenPGP functionalities. In a nutshell:
    Any folder: sign and encrypt.
    Any file: verify, sign, import, encrypt, and decrypt.
    Any text selection: verify and import.
    Any text field: verify, sign, import, export, encrypt, and decrypt.
Please note that some of these features are still in development.
I am assuming that the disclaimer there is to cover the fact that it
clearly does not work correctly for the above mentioned items when said
item(s) are created on different platforms.
