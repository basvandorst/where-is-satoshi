@_subject: Question regarding clearsigning emails automatically 
This has come up before in my conversation with others.  I think that
signing all mail as a policy is a waste of resources and a potential
source of annoyance, whether it's list mail or not.  I think that
sensitive material (code patches, or authoritative announcements of new
software releases, or analyses of the latest Communications Prohibition
Act, and the like) ought to be signed if possible; anyone who is
concerned about the validity of the message can check the signature if
they like.
But, by and large, it doesn't matter.  I don't really care whether it
was really the person I know as Lars Hecking who wrote the message I'm
replying to right now.  It only matters what's said in this case, and
not much who said it.  If I want to confirm all this, I can write to
Lars and he can sign it.  If I sign my mail to Lars, he'll quite
possibly even sign his reply.  But chances are exceedingly small that
any given item of information really needs to be corroborated.  Since
PGP became available, I've been asked only a handful of times to resend
something with a signature.  I'm reluctant to believe that's only
because people don't know that I have a signing key.
Having the signatures come up, and my mailer and OpenPGP client freeze
while I wait to download a signature that might and might not be on the
server that I use, only to discover that the signed material doesn't
even need validation, is somewhat irritating at times - semi-political
privacy agenda or no.

@_subject: GnuPG in universities 
I have to disagree.  I know I've already disagreed with Werner on a
very similar topic lately, but I'm rather sensitive to this topic, and
this pass is significantly different for me, largely because of the
inclusion of SSH.
In principle: SSH is still better than telnet or rlogin, even if you
can't trust the keys.  You just have to know what your keys are worth,
and not to entrust more to those keys than you're willing to lose.
It's not a usually a hard problem, since *typically* (but not always)
you're the only one at risk.
With OpenPGP keys, the problem is somewhat larger.  Other people place
their trust in your representation of yourself, and this is usually a
more signigicant component of using PGP/GnuPG than of using SSH.  But
this should not prevent you from using a more private, secondary,
non-representative key pair for some limited purpose.  You just need to
know -- and advertise -- what the keys are truly worth.  On a shared
system, they are always worth substantially less than on a private
system.  They are not implicitly worth nothing.
For example: I wouldn't use gpg on a shared system to represent myself,
though I would use it for other purposes -- for example, to encrypt
backups on tape.  (That's not a highly-secure backup.  I can't know
that a stolen tape is unreadable, but the odds are better than if the
backup is cleartext.) I certainly do use SSH on public machines, and I
will not telnet, but I don't log into systems I need to trust from
those machines.  It's a matter of wise placement of trust, not of rigid
all-or-nothing rules.
Soapbox: It especially does those of us who must support shared systems
little good for users to be led to believe that cryptography can
provide them nothing until they have their own computer -- and then
everything is magically safer.  (It's not: it might take significant
effort to make it safer.)  I don't think that Werner means to say that,
precisely, but the terminology definitely leaves that interpretation
open, and there's *always* someone who will take it.
The matter at hand: Of course, I wouldn't use gpg the way this poster
is asking, anyway. :)

OK, thanks.  GnuPG 1.0.6 tells me that this key expired Wed Jan 31

GnuPG 1.0.3 says that it *never* expires, and happily signs.
I'm afraid I've missed any notation in changelogs, announcements, etc
of changes relating to key expiry.  Can some tell me (or point me to)
what I'm missing?  I'm not sure whether to expect this problem
elsewhere.  At least one person I know is having the same problem,
though he doesn't know it yet, because he's using an older version of
gpg.  :)
Also, for future versions, it would be nice for gpg to say that the
signing key is expired rather than to say only that no usable key was
found.  (I have a default-key setting in ~/.gnupg/options, so there's a
single key that's specifically bad, I presume.)

Ah... I wouldn't have caught those -- I thought that the key simply had

So I need to replace this key.  Because I can't necessarily meet
everyone personally (or even call) right away, I want to send a message
containing the fingerprint of the new key, but this is useless if I
don't sign that message with my old key.  Can I force gpg to sign a
message using an expired key, or do I need to use an older version?
(I'm asking mainly so that the answer gets into the mail archive.  In my
 case, using an older version is not currently a problem, but that won't
 remain so, and it's probably not true for everyone.)

This is strange.  I know it's expired, and I don't want to continue
using it -- but it's all I have to validate new key information
electronically.  Are you saying that I should simply step back to the
beginning, with no credentials, because gpg previously allowed me to
think that my key was still valid, and because the situation involves
some slight ambiguity about whether the key still belongs to me?
I agree that gpg should not use such a key per default, but it seems
that a force option is very useful here.  Would you consider
implementing it, or no?
If I have to recompile, I might as well use an old (buggy?) version for
this step.  I just think it's a bit silly to need two separate builds
of the program in order to make a key transition under these

should be allowed, and can be covered with a single option?

This seems to be a common thought, but it's a bit misleading.  Even
without a good source of random numbers, a GnuPG port would still be
useful for decoding messages encrypted elsewhere, and verifying
signatures using keys generated elsewhere.
(I also don't agree that poor encryption is worse than no encryption.
The "false sense of security" argument is common, but it's only a false
sense of security if you're fooled.  Low security is still better than
none, so long as you understand exactly how good it isn't, and you know
whether that's sufficient to your purpose.)
I don't mean to downplay the value of good random numbers -- just to
say that not having numbers that are entropic above some arbitrary
threshold is no reason to lay all your cards on the table.  I also
don't mean to pick on Werner in particular, it just seemed like a

I'd argue that if you believe that signing all your list mail serves

then using PGP/MIME signing rather than "old-school" signing serves the

be equally respected.
A lot of mail clients still don't cope with *any* pgp signing format,
but that doesn't stop you from using one. Why should Mailer X's not

This is disappointing, but maybe it won't be such a large problem.
Currently I use the plugin support for two things:
    1. IDEA support. (I won't mean to get into arguments about this. I
    work for a nonprofit institution, so our use is noncommercial, and
    we can legally use it.)
    2. User-selectable RNGs. We run mostly on Solaris. Some machines
    have a real /dev/random, and use rndlinux. Others do not and can
    not, so we use rndegd or rndunix, depending on circumstances. With
    plugins, we don't need to compile two or three different versions
    of the executable for our software distribution system -- just
    uncomment the appropriate line in .gnupg/options.
I didn't think it was possible to compile IDEA into GnuPG or to compile
in multiple RNG drivers. But if I"m wrong, or if this is changing, I'll
have no complaints about removal of the plugin support.
I still don't really understand why you're so opposed to the plugins,
aside from irritation about people's using IDEA at all, but maybe that's
not important. I would only worry that in the future, it might again
prove useful, and we'd lament its loss.

Ah, okay -- didn't realize this.
I'd appreciate that. It's useful to be able to use the same binary
on all systems. It's convenient for system management, but it's also
nice for checking integrity of the executable. (You don't have 2 or 3
different, legitimate MD5 hashes for /opt/bin/gpg, for example.)
Maybe the default (if no RNG is selected by options) should be to use
the rndlinux driver since it's the most common interface, but allow it
to be overridden with "rng-options" or something.
Yes, I've noticed -- but the infrastructure is there to make it work,
if only people will contribute the right options and they'll enter
the code. It also seems possible to create a "generic" case for DLL
builds where some environment variable(s) will set the compile options.
This doesn't solve the immediate problem of builds failing, but it
does provide a way for people to work around it via mailing list ideas
without having to understand shell scripts, autoconf, etc.
Yes, that's a fair point. I don't worry about it much, myself, because
it provides a useful function. But if it's no longer necessary to
provide that utility, it's more of a hazard.

before unlinking it.
Does that seem desirable? It would involve no portable code, but it
would resolve the FAQ. Some might still prefer having it incorporated
into gpg, but this is perhaps better than nothing.
It would provide a way for someone to install programs into your $PATH
that would be able to read your temporary files. You could require
fully-qualified paths to minimize this risk. But it might come down
to something that you (the gpg development group) don't want to make
Meanwhile, if this bugs you as a user, there might be an alternative for
some varieties of UNIX. Define an unlink function that does a wipe:
int unlink(const char *path)
Then compile that as a shared object, and preload it into gpg. That
would vary from platform to platform, but here's the Solaris way:
(Your wipe command would need to perform its own unlink.)

no, it's probably looking for an AF_UNIX socket named ~/.entropy, or

Most things can use egd -- some well, some not so well. I've always been

Correct. The keysevrer maintainer has no way of knowing that a request
to remove a public key is a legitimate request unless it's signed by the
key's corresponding secret key. Even if you can prove that your name is
John Bull, the key pair on the server could be owned by some other John
Bull. This is precisely what a revocation certificate is for. It's a
well-formed document signed by the secret key stating that the key pair
is no longer valid.
This kind of circumstance is precisely why it's recommended that you
create a revocation certificate when you create the key, and store it
in "a safe place". This "safe place" should be a different place from
your secret key. (If you lose your secret key, you'll still have the
revocation certificate.) Some recommend printing the ascii-armored
revocation certificate on paper, deleting the online copy, and storing
the paper in a safe deposit box. That might be extreme for your taste,
but it's a useful idea.

* On 2002.10.10, in <20021011020603.GC1373
I'm interested in making better use of subkeys. (I would have begun
already if I could attach extant primary keys as subkeys, rather
than having to go through the whole business of retiring one key and
replacing its functionality with another. I'd love to see that directly
supported in gpg, since I'm not sure I understand the bit-tweaking you
have to do if you manually reorder packets.)
I've long heard about certain servers' habits of munging subkeys,
though. This doesn't bother me much if I can just deprecate those
servers, but can I ensure that the correct key gets onto the servers
which fully support subkeys, without intra-keyserver propagations
transmitting a bungled copy of my key? What's the risk -- should I just
not upload such a key to the servers at this time?

a particular person who throws IDs when sending to me -- that actually
could be significant computational savings.
I don't think this is useful in the common case, I only suggested it for
the rather rarer case of bulk processing, because it seemed like a small
change that was already suggested by the documentation.

Fair enough.
I wondered whether that might be a problem.
In this case, then, would it be appropriate to change the help text

is there another case where a user can profitably specify the decryption

I think it's pretty easy to call it "unethical" without much further

exploitable vulnerability and "fixing" it, without regard to what
internal subsystems this "fix" breaks. There's always someone whose
daily routine depends on something that's tangentially broken, who
would be glad to fix it as soon as they're back in the office, or a
maintenance window opens, or their grandmother's out of the hospital,

Jointly, consider whether your keyrings were backed up by the company
backup system, or on any other backup media you're leaving behind. If
so, you need to revoke. Taking the drive is no more helpful than wiping
in this case; it's easier to retrieve your key from backup than to
extract the ghostly bits from the disk. But anyone can walk away with a
disk, whereas one generally need admin privileges (whether legitimate or
temporarily acquired), so it's still wise to wipe or replace it whether
or not you plan to revoke.
(People can still cause trouble if they compromise your key, even if
you revoke it. Revocation gives you the means to renounce an impostor's
claims, but not the means to prevent him from making them. It's like
having to go to court to prove your innocence, vs. never being accused
of a crime.)
I always ensure that my keys won't be backed up, except on my own
personal media.
This is a good system.

* On 2004.04.09, in ,
I'm not a good one to talk about such things, but to throw in a little
support here: v4 and v3 only refer to the structure of the key data. You
can clearsign with any type of key, because "clearsign" only describes
the datastream of the signed material. GnuPG will clearsign with v3 or
v4 keys.
Only v4 keys allow subpackets; v3 as a key format predates subpacket
support in PGP. Allowing them in v3 keys would make the keys
incompatible across different v3-supporting applications, which would
pretty much negate the purpose of naming one key version "v3" and
another "v4".
You're presumably getting this error not because you can't clearsign,
but because you can't have a policy URL or notation in a v3 key.

Perhaps a note concerning how to go about a key signing belongs in

are always many more bad procedures.

You can. Whether there's a good reason [not] to do so is relative, of
When I first got a USB keychain I tried reformatting to ext2, but
now I keep it as FAT32 so that I can use the same keyring on any of
my operating systems[1] and with very minimal runtimes[2]. If you're
happily using only systems that speak ext3, then there's probably no
particular reason not to use ext3 on the USB drive -- but for the little
value that it gains you to do so, I'm not sure it makes sense to emplace
that restriction if it's not already there. I haven't found that using

My USB drive has statically-linked gpg executables for several platforms
on it, and multiple keyrings. (That's where "somewhat more complicated"
comes in; there's a shell script driver that accumulates options and
backends and such.) One goal of this arrangement is that I can perform
certain tasks on marginally-trusted systems outside my governance. Using
a broadly-available filesystem helps assure that remains an option, so
that I can consider whether it's wise independently of whether it's
possible. :)

I'm taking a guess at your problem, based on something I've seen on
Solaris. Recent versions of gcc will configure themselves to use a
shared libgcc.so, and that library will then have to be in the runtime
on each target system. It seems rather a poor idea for gcc ever to
configure that way, unless it's the stock vendor-provided compiler for
the system. I'm not sure what the value is believed to be.
There are several solutions to this, if it's your problem. The easiest
is to delete libgcc.so from your gcc library directory. On my system, it
was at [/usr/local]/lib/gcc/sparc-sun-solaris2.9/3.4.1/libgcc.so* . You
also can modify the specs file.
You'll need to recompile gnupg (or distribute libgcc.so) in any case.

I don't have this, I'm afraid.  However:
I've not needed to partition the drive.  I made some efforts early on
to partition it with both a Mac and a PC partition table.  I believe
this should be possible as they occupy different parts of the disk, and
one can craft the ptables so as to avoid one another, but in the end it
just wasn't worth the effort.  The Mac can read the USB drive if it's
partitioned as a single FAT32/VFAT pratition, so I just do that.  This
has the advantage also of allowing me a single keystore for all the
operating systems.
I've set up my USB drive with some subdirectories:
["..." is the mountpoint of the USB drive on whatever system I'm using.]
Inside each of the arch/* directories are gpg executables for each
system type, as well as whatever shared libraries (*.so or *.dylib) the
executable needs to run.  In general I've compiled the gpg executables
statically, so they don't need shared libs, but in some cases I did not.
In .../bin I have a script called "wrapper".  There are also files named
"gpg", "gpgsplit", and "pgpring".  These are copies of "wrapper", since
FAT32 doesn't support symbolic links.  I've attached the "wrapper"
script to this mail.
The effect of all this is that if I call .../bin/gpg with its path,
it figures out where it is and what system type it's on, adds the
arch/${SYSTEM} directory to LD_LIBRARY_PATH or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, and
runs the "real" gpg executable from the same location.  This has gotten
me all the multiplatform function I wanted from the USB drive, with a
single keystore also residing on the drive.  I also don't need to depend
on the integrity of the gpg executables or libraries on the host system.
This isn't perfect, and I'm sure someone out there is happy to point out
some of the flaws in this system.  They're correctible, if you're really
worried -- the problems are in the implementation, not the concept.  If
I get worried I'll rewrite the wrapper.
