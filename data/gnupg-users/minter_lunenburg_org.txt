@_subject: Problems with the gnupg 1.0.1 and FreeBSD 3.3 
I had that problem - banging on the keyboard didn't work for me, since I
was coming in over a telnet/SSH link.  One thing I found was, before doing
the --gen-key, was to run "find / &" to get the disk churning.  There was
plenty of entropy after that.

Hash: SHA1
Using gnupg 1.0.1 on a FreeBSD system.   I've run into a stumper of a
trust problem, and I was wondering if anyone could shed some light on it.
I'm going to encrypt a message to a guy whose public key I have, and I've
signed said public key.  But when I go to encrypt the message, I get the
following warning:

You need to compile the rsa module and add it in your options file.  See

@_subject: Untrusted key - no solution? 
I take it there's no solution to the problem of a key, signed by myself,
that gives:
Could not find a valid trust path to the key.  Let's see whether we
can assign some missing owner trust values.
No certificates with undefined trust found.

             It is NOT certain that the key belongs to its owner.
             If you *really* know what you are doing, you may answer
             the next question with yes
             Use this key anyway?
When you attempt to encrypt to it?  I've deleted the key from my keyring
and re-imported it, but still have the same problem.
Is this just "one of those things" that's to be expected?

Did you get Red Hat's public key and add it to your keyring before
attempting to verify the packages?

@_subject: Invalid subkey binding 
A friend of mine is using PGP Freeware 6.5.3 for Windows 2000, and I'm
using GnuPG 1.0.1.  He created a D/H keypair, and sent me his public
key.  WhenI try to import it, though, I get:
[minter minter]$ gpg --import senter.asc gpg: key has been created 9374 seconds in future (time warp or clock
gpg: key 444B090D: invalid self-signature
gpg: key has been created 9374 seconds in future (time warp or clock
gpg: key 444B090D: invalid subkey binding
gpg: key 444B090D: no valid user IDs
gpg: this may be caused by a missing self-signature
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:           w/o user IDs: 1
Is this error just due to a time skew, or is something else going on that
would prevent me from using this key?  I created a keypair on a Win98 box
to test it, and was able to import it without problems.

You're using the wrong key.  Go to
 and get key ID DB42A60E.
The key you have is the old PGP RSA key, kept around for compatibility
purposes.  The key listed above is the GnuPG key that's being used
nowadays to sign packages. Red Hat Support
