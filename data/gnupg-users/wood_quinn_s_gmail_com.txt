Key signing is held up as an integral part of asymmetric encryption's
usefulness- determining that you are indeed communicating with who you
think you are.
However, gnupg does not recurse signatures on imported or updated keys, and
I am unable to find a single reference to a simple method of determining
the most trusted (based on signature webs, hops, and/or other web of trust
concepts) key matching a full or partial ID (name, comment, or email.)
I would very much like to know if tools like this exist. Are any known, and
if so where can I find more information about them?

My question in simpler terms could probably be summed up "How can one find
the most popular- most signed- key (matching some query such as name or
email of course) while successfully avoiding falsely inflated signature
counts (such as keys which only have more signatures than another due to
their age or due to actual malicious acts like mass signing.)

I suppose I had hoped that the cost of generating new keys would
prevent too much gaming in a WoT-vote based system.
