@_subject: Combining Secret Keys 
Hello all,
I have three separate gpg secret keys. Initially, I wanted to keep the keys seperate, but today I'd like to have them all together. Is there a way to merge the keys into one key keeping them as they are now?
Many Thanks,

Sorry, my terminology wasn't accurate. I understand what you are saying. However, I was hoping to merge all three keys into one key (having three distinct, separate keys on the same keyring is what I have now). Anyway, I've almost decided to just keep the keys as they are.
I got the principles down many years ago when a computer crashed and I lost a secret key :) and its revocation cert... since that time I've made regular backups and have recovered from similar incidents and revoked keys.
Thanks for your time,

Hi folks,
Hope this isn't too inappropriate. It is OK to redistribute the GnuPG Windows binary installer? We'd like to distribute it with some scripts that by default setup the path, etc.
