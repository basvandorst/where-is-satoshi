@_subject: Convert GPG key to ssh key 
Hi everyone,
I am just trying to convert gpg key to ssh key to be able use it in
authorized_keys file and I am using *`gpgkey2ssh $key_id`  *command.
However this command does not work properly and gives this error :
gpg: error reading key: public key not found
gpgkey2ssh: gpgkey2ssh.c:278: main: Assertion `(algorithm_id == 1) ||
(algorithm_id == 17)' failed.
Aborted (core dumped)
I have searched the error however could not find a clear explanation. I
come across some blog posts suggesting to use *`ssh-add -L` *command to
extract public part of key pair but I need to use *gpgkey2ssh *command. I
have another environment for testing same command, somehow on that
environment *`gpgkey2ssh $key_id` *command extract public part of key which
is compatible with authorized_keys file.
I guess this is not a bug since same command works in another environment
but could find the exact reason of this error?  Any help is appreciated...
Note: gpg2 version that I am using is 2.1.0.
Thanks in advance.

Hi Daniel and Werner,
Thanks for the quick repsonse and more inline...
I am trying to convert RSA key and I am just avoiding use an external tool
such as monkeysphere while converting keys.
I will use subkey for ssh authentication and while using *`gpgkey2ssh
$key_id` *command I am giving subkey id explicitly. What I could not
understand is why the above command works inconsistently. It works on one
of my setups but does not on another.
No need to convert a key if you are using gnupg 2.1.  Run
Yeah I know that feature in 2.1.0 version, but why I am insisting on using
*`gpgkey2ssh` *command is I am going to automate this process and
since *`ssh-add
-L` *strictly requires an running agent and it does not extract public part
of key pair compatible with authorized_key file unless agent is running.
(as mentioned in this tutorial
 and
discussions in mailing list
to Werner Koch- using sshcontrol file during ssh authentication requires
using ssh-add command)
What I am really looking for is there a workaround to use
*`gpgkey2ssh` *command
without getting the error given in first mail?

@_subject: Unattended subkey generation 
Hello everyone,
Is it possible to generate sub-keys without user interaction?
I found this Unattended-GPG-key-generation
article, but currently it allows just one subkey while generating key pair.
What I want is a little bit different: I want to generate just sub-keys
without user interaction.
Last week in a mailing list post I saw the below command to change
passphrase without user interaction:
*`ECHO -e PASSWD\nMyOldPassword\nMyNewPassword\nSAVE|GPG --command-fd 0
--no-tty --passphrase-repeat 0 --status-fd 2 --verbose --edit-key E62651B3`*
Can I apply same approach while generation sub-keys? If yes could you
please provide me some sample ?

@_subject: How can I configure gpg-agent to run at system start-up? 
Hello everyone,
I am a newbie to GnuPG, and just wanted to use gpg-agent for ssh into my
server machines. I build GnuPG from source and using 2.1.0 version.
I followed the instructions described in this mailing list thread
everything worked fine.
I want gpg-agent start automatically after every reboot, so I wrote a small
init script to start gpg-agent. After reboot gpg-agent starts working,
however when I run ssh command, I get *"Agent admitted failure to sign
using the key"* error. (If I start agent manually, I don't get this error).
How is different starting gpg-agent manually from starting it inside a bash
script during system start-up?
FYI, I also tried to use upstart script distributed within gnupg-agent
Ubuntu package, it also did not work.
How can I configure gpg-agent to run at system start-up?

@_subject: relationship between primary keys and subkeys 
Hi everyone,
I have two simple questions about subkey mechanism. I search gnupg
documentations and mailing list, but could not find answers to my
questions. I would be so glad, if someone can answer below questions.
1) Is it possible to create a subkey of a subkey ?
2) What are the trust implications between a parent key and a child key? Is
it "Ultimate Trust"? How can we confirm this? Or is this something for us
to determine/interpret?
Thanks in advance.
