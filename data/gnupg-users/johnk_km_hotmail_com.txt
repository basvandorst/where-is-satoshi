@_subject: How to start gnupg? 
I just installed gnupg software from source.  There were no complaints that I could see.  In fact when I typed sudo apt install gnupg, the response was that the current version was the latest.  So, I assume that that means that the program is installed.  However, how do I start and use the program?  I have a large file that was encrypted with PGP and I want to decrypt it.  Am I missing something simple?  I am using Ubuntu 16.04 operating system.  I can not find this program in the installed program list.
