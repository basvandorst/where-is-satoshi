@_subject: Creating a ssl socket using OpenPGP keys 
I'd like to create a simple app to chat securely.
Use OpenPGP keys on both ends (because lots of users already have
OpenPGP keys)
User selects a public key to communicate
He or the system finds the IP/TCP address
The other end sees who is trying to contact him
The other end accepts or refuses the connection.
Both chat securely.
Is there an easy way to create a SSL socket using OpenPGP keys?
Any suggestion or alternative scheme would be appreciated.

Can an untrusted server remove messages and the receiver not
noticing it when using the protocol & app you suggested?
I'm looking into using SSL because I'm planning a decentralized network
and I don't want to lose messages because someone in the middle of the
network wants to.
