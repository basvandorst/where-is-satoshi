Remove the secring.gpg file. Replace it with a shortcut to the
location of your private key that is on your USB drive.
So now every time the GnuPG engine attempts to access your private
key, it will
be directed to the actual key on the USB medium.
As a side note, I hope that you have your revocation certificate
secured and stored on a medium other than that of your USB drive.
i.e. Backup CD-R
