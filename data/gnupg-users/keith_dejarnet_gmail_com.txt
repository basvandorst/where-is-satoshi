@_subject: GNuPGP 4 Windows and SSIS Question 
I've been tasked with automating process that calls for decrypting a file.
I'm using gpg4win with SSIS 2005 using and Execute Process Task.
For my Executable I'm using C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe and calling gpg
in my Arguments section.
I'm using the information found at which suggests using:
type passphrase | gpg --passphrase-fd 0 OPTIONS COMMAND
echo PASSPHRASE| gpg --passphrase-fd 0 OPTIONS COMMAND
So far I haven't had any success with either of these options.
Has anyone successfully been able to use gpg4win with SSIS? If so could you
post an example of the executable and arguments used?
