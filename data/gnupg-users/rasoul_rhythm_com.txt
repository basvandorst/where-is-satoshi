@_subject: Error using --no-default-keyring 
Hello folks,
I am sorry to pose this question again but I get another error trying
this command:
%gpg --homedir /usr/lsd/apache-ssl/htdocs/secureDB/PGP/.gnugpg \
--no-default-keyring --secret-keyring 1017716050.asc --decrypt
Here is what I have done:
%gpg --export-secret-keys rasoul > \
Then I do:
%gpg --homedir /usr/lsd/apache-ssl/htdocs/secureDB/PGP/.gnugpg \
--no-default-keyring --secret-keyring 1017716050.asc --decrypt
But I get this error:
gpg: CRC error; e478cc - 47d937
As I am very new to gpg, I appreciate your patience and help. So if you
think that this question has already been answered, I ask you very
kindly to answer it again one last time.
Thanks in advance

@_subject: using gpg 
Hello folks,
I have just hit a major malfunction and I was hoping that someone might
be able to help me. I am writing a web based interface to encrypt,
decrypt user's passphrases and save them into a database. I have no
problem generating, and encrypting a passphrase. The problem arises when
I try to decrypt a saved passphrase. Encryption of passphrase is done
like this:
--homedir $home --output $tempFile --no-comment --no-version --armor
--encrypt $recipient $phraseFile
where $recipient is : -r $user So everyone has an
encrypted passphrase using their own uid. The result is saved into the
Groups' passphrase encryption is done using the admin as --recipient
My problem arises when I try to decrypt a user's saved passphrase. Here
is the steps that I take:
       	# Execute user defined routine
        # this passes in the passphrase
        print FIN "$passPhrase\n";
        # this closes the communication channel,
        # indicating we are done
        close FIN;
        my         = ;    # reading the error
        my            = ;   # reading the output
        # clean up...
        close FOUT;
        close FERR;
If i did the same command on the command line, everything is dandy and
fine, file is actually decrypted, but when using open3() and through the
apache thread, nothing works.
The error, if that is at all error, is:
errors: gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
I am hoping someone who has done this kind of stuff in an application,
could help me find out what I am doing wrong. I appreciate all the
comments/help that I can get.
Thanks in advance

Hello People,
I am trying to delete a key pair from an Apache thread. Here is my
gpg --homedir /usr/lsd/apache-ssl/htdocs/secureDB/PGP/.gnupg --no-tty
--command-fd 0 --delete-secret-and-public-key testtwo
The documentation for gpg says that --command-fd should be used with
--status-fd but fails to explain how. Can someone shed some light on
this for me?
Thanks in advance.

@_subject: gpg New Bee 
Hello folks,
My apologies if this question has been asked before. I have created a
encrypted file encrypted with two different recipients. How do I decrypt
this file using the other user? The -u option does not seem to work. I
am running 1.0.6 gpg. %gpg -u  --decrypt myTest1.gpg
It keeps asking for my pass phrase and not that of the "test" user pass
Can some one tell me what option I should be using?
Thanks in advance.

Thanks for responding. I tried your solution but I am afraid I get an
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit ELG-E key, ID 0C18F568, created 2002-03-22

      "rasoul "
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=36)
gpg: decrypt_message failed: unexpected data
The command that I used was:
%gpg --output myTest.gpg --encrypt -r rasoul -r test1 myTest.txt
%gpg --export-secret-keys [test1 || uid] > gpgtemp.asc
%gpg --no-default-keyring --secret-keyring gpgtemp.asc --decrypt
Can you tell me what is going on?
thanks in advance

In the FAQs there is section for getting the key ids used to encrypt a

'/^\[GNUPG:\] ENC_TO / { print $3 }'
And here is the error:

@_subject: --command-fd 
Hi folks,
I am trying to my passphrase by running a perl program to this for me.
The docs mentions that:
--passphrase-fd n
                 Read the passphrase from file descriptor  n.  If
                 you  use  0  for  n, the passphrase will be read
                 from stdin.     This can only be  used  if  only
                 one  passphrase  is  supplied.   Don't  use this
                 option if you can avoid it.
--command-fd n
                 This is a replacement for the deprecated shared-
                 memory  IPC  mode.   If  this option is enabled,
                 user input on questions is not expected from the
                 TTY  but  from  the  given  file descriptor.  It
                 should be used together  with  --status-fd.  See
                 the  file doc/DETAILS in the source distribution
                 for details on how to use it.
So here is the command that my script is trying to execute:
gpg --homedir /usr/lsd/apache-ssl/htdocs/secureDB/PGP/.gnupg
--command-fd 0 --edit-key 1193 passwd
But gpg hangs in the middle of its work. Here is the output:
Secret key is available.
pub  1024D/8B7A4655  created: 2002-05-03 expires: never      trust: -/u
sub  1024g/A935EF26  created: 2002-05-03 expires: never     (1). Rasoul Hajikhani (None) <1193
Key is protected.
You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: "Rasoul Hajikhani (None) <1193
1024-bit DSA key, ID 8B7A4655, created 2002-05-03
After the last line, the program hangs. I could not find any info on
--status-fd in the docs/DETAILS file. Can someone shed some light on
this for me...
Thanks in advance.

--edit-key 1193 passwd I am don't want to type the old passphrase, and the new passphrase, but
rather have the programe write it to standard in. The programe still
hangs. Am I missing an option in my commande somewhere...? I have even
changed --command-fd to --passphrase-fd to no avail. Any ideas...?

@_subject: gpg Signature 
Hello there,
I have a question about gpg signature that I am hoping some one may be
able to answer. I have created a signature file with the '--sign'
option. The file contained plain text and now I would like to de-sign
the file, that is I want to convert the content of the file to plain
text again.
The gpg man pages does not mention how it is done. It talks about
'verifying' a signature, but I would like to get my plain text back. Is
that possible?
Thanks In Advance
