@_subject: A safe text editor // why??  
I wouldnt believe it's common or easily available.  Lots of hoaxes
on the net, probably some hoaxes feed from internet to vocal & back
to net.  Fortunately there's hoax buster web sites too.  It's an
interesting idea though, probably been tried.
  There's been interest in monitoring frequencies of CRTs for
  decades, but the equipment to do it was a lot bigger than a mobile
  phone. I recall way back discussion of extra metal screening round
  a few sensitive CRTs, beyond normal screening.  Of course normal
  screens had metal chassis or some metal coated plastic to reduce
  RF intereference to neighbouring radio equipment etc.  Back then
  we speculated on efficacy of mesh in front of screen),
  I saw no equipment, any that did might be less likely to
  discuss, as certain areas of employment have laws ...
  It was assumed anything sensitive was in cellars. Not just monitors,
  but humans speaking - spy films & product catalogues have long
  featured lasers shined off [dirt on] windows to pick up conversation.
  Some companies have long had (metal tinted) windows, eg a mobile
  phone operator, a pharmaceutical company & a tank manufacturer,
  where one needs to open & stand by a window to use a mobile.
  Accidental, or an appreciated secondary effect of sun screening
  to save building air con. costs ?
An enhanced non standard phone Might be possible ?
  - If it had an extra radio receiver squeezed in ? difficult
  - If extra software squeezed in ? expensive.
  - extra CPU cycles needed to analyse in real time,     (I'll ask a friend in that industry for opinion)
  - Extra antenna for signals might need to be longer for lower freq. ?     CRT freqencies are a few Meg I recall
    GSM & UMTS: 1 & 2 Gig
  Then consider options to transfer data back to bad guys:
  It would be expensive, but probably investigations have been tried,
  funded likely by governments, maybe large private corporations,
  or indirect from international criminal groups.
  There's lots of concern about Chinese spieing, theyre not short
  of budget. Red army apparently owns Huawei, manufacturer of mobile
  chips, which concerns some a lot.
  Considering value of secrets that might be harvested, & what it
  might cost to try - seems likely some will be experimenting,
  & that those most in the know might be constrained not to say ?

@_subject: Why trust gpg4win?  
Hi, Reference:
Therefore, changes that look like
back doors are VERY unlikely to find their way in a release, because
hundreds of people are looking how the software evolves and will
reject such a patch.
Yes, malign code would have to hide in plain view in source (& most
likely evil patches wouldn't get past the view of the people commiting
the `improvement' to the source repository ;-).
However you missed the point that many MS users are not programmers,
& will not be compiling their own binaries, so any malign entity
could regularly hack their nasty extras in, compile & issue binaries
that dont match published source (sure that would breach licence,
but irrelevant to an evil doer), & those without access to exactly
the same set of compiler tools would not easily knowof embedded
evil extra mods.
The solution of course is as you urged takethebus at gmx.de , to get
a free operating system such as Linux or BSD, complete with free
build tools  & compile your own (even non programmers can do that,
eg on an OS downloaded from
just type
) However for some thats too much effort, for them greater risk, their choice.

@_date: 2013-07-26 16:57:43
@_author: Julian H. Stacey 
@_subject: Why trust gpg4win?  
Not likely to happen regularly, per release, Analysing MS binaries.
I've no longer any idea how many different C compilers may currently be
available for MS, (I long ago gave up compiling for MS PCs :-)
I've never seen any net site that offers .exes to run on MS
that states exactly which compiler assembler linker etc was used &
in which order modules & libs were linked etc.
Knowing MS, they probably slip a mickey in as a tracer, & vary the generated
.exe according to which compiler (if theirs) licence number built it. One can't assume whoever offers a .exe has used a the same free GCC
compiler for MS aka  that we might by default
reach for.
It would be hard Work, comparing & analysing different _binaries_
not _sources_ to differentiate benign irrelevant differences from
link order & tools used, & maybe date stamp & trace of compiler
host & licence number, as opposed to possible differences from to
malign source manipulation,
I wouldn't waste time working unpaid analysing MS binaries to protect
clueless MS end users.  More fun to develop source code for projects.
I assume the vast majority would see it the same, most would only
get interested if someone waved money at us to analyse binaries for
MS end users.
The same BSI  that a
previous writer would prefer to distrust, I'd also consider perhaps as
a sponsor to pay independent consultants to analyse &/or generate
binaries for public use ... & not just for GPG.
Then the question: If government paid someone to do that, how could
we (the end user, this list, or the paying sponsor) trust that
person ?  The old Roman
  Get a collection of companies & governments or EU etc to sponsor
  generating of binaries on a custom compiler host where all parts
  of entire OS are read-able under http:// & ftp:// & where that
  host also offers a copy of itself so people can download a
  checksum'ed copy of image of host so people can run a clone & see
  the checksums are same.
  Could be fun work !
  ( It's fascinating how such projects start & grow & funded, at a lecture
  2 days back to 300 in Munich on 24th July   2 Americans from
  	   mentioned some of their users include US government, which was
  why when one arm of US goverment proposed blocking them, they got
  told by another arm of US goverment: Don't do that, we use them too!
  Some of torproject sponsors are arms of government
  So similarly, best not assume BSI is bad, or good, it might be a mix,
  not that I know.

I make my own RF blockers, though un-tested yet :
For maybe 10 years my business cards have been made from 80 gram/

into plastic, hot lamination pouches, using 2 alternate products:
  Leitz 100x Credit Card Hot seal laminating pouches 125 (250) mic
    1 Leitz 33810 bar code 5 411313 338103
  Ibico ibi pouches for hot laminating credit card 54 x 86 mm
    100 pouches . clear . 5 mil 125 micron permanently sealed & protected
    Years back I realised I could cut some aluminium cooking foil to
same size as the paper, & seal that as an RF / microwave test tool,
then an RFC card arrived, & I inserted the metal foil `card' behind
the NFC credit card, on the outside of the wallet.
The metal foil in sealed plastic puch is a much slimmer (0.26 mm)
than a credit card (0.8 mm), so fits well in same wallet slot as an NFC
enabled credit card (metal foil on outer side of wallet of course.
As cards are stacked offset in a wallet I assume it make sense to
decide where on the credit card the NFC chip is, for max overlap
of the foil.
I made a larger foldable excapsulated foil pouch for my brother's
wallet, (he had NFC cards before I did). I can't remember what
thickness plastic I used + 2 for British passports (some kind of chip).
I haven't tested them yet, just use them :-) I recently got an NFC
app to convert my Android phone into an NFC reader on USB coupled
to a PC, so I will test it some time, but :
A) I dont normally carry my NFC card, &
B) I haven't looked beyond    at
If aluminium cooking foil is too thin, some are thicker than others,
& I have some thin copper sheet too, but I doubt it will need that.
I've long been planning to insert aluminium foil in the new
version of my business cards, which BTW look like this
I guess computer clubs could create similar cards, with foil blockers.
I bought my hot laminator long ago, it does up to A4 size, since
then prices for laminators have crashed, & credit card sized ones
even cheaper, probably most on this list can with local friends
club together & buy/ share a laminator, & make ther own blockers,
but we need to check how effective they are :-)

- International source groups have few people per country,
  None paid to waste time begging to educate ignorant   politicians within their deadlines & foreign procedures.
- Only laws that may motivate most global source developers will be those of
  countries of passport, residence, mail list server & source repository.
  Leaving 190 countries each will ignore.
Inefficient to try to explain tech. to politicians ?  Quicker to tell them:
  They will cripple & expose their country: International groups will
  ignore their laws, & continue development.  Only their country's
  nationals will be crippled, out competed by rest of world's
  industries, banks, even industrial spies, international crackers,
  terrorists on net, & local criminals will All have better
  encryption than their local law restricted citizens.
  Even the USA failed to enforce Clipper or restrict international encryption:
   Dept of Commerce chased a crypt cat out of the bag for a decade, & failed.
   (USA munitions law, Crypt.c, freebsd.org, South African source repository.)
Best spend time protecting source projects,
- Insufficient resources to fight a globe of ignorant politicians,   so best structure projects so no few countries can cripple development.
- eg mirrors in several countries & regions, with backups, so if server   master has legal or net trouble, or a regional geographic incident,   people can switch to another server in another country & region.
- Individuals could also quietly offer logins to developers in other countries
  (so if one day a developers' country implements a law restricting
  export of code, next edit is done via ssh & vi in your country
  not theirs, so no file ever needs to be exported (aka USA munitions law).

@_subject: Terminology - certificate or key ? 
is empty.
Schnappschloss seems to be a wide word covering all sorts,
English has more words than German, so probably a selection of pictures
offers best way to choose best word for the function.
A latch is not similar to a deadbolt though. A latch is weaker.
A latch is spring loaded, or gravity assisted.
	...  Pictures
The silver, one from right end, is a snap lock. The brass at far right is a latch.
"Snap lock"   May be OK, or maybe Catch, (I'd be happier with the word Lock if
  that picture also had a tiny hole for a key (as mine does, crappy
  key but it is then a primitive lock.
"Dead bolts"
PS Wouldnt suprise me if British & American & other speakers of
English had different words for some of those things.  (I'm English
but decades in Germany so not always entirely certain translating back)

All UK cards I know of allow PIN change at the ATM.
