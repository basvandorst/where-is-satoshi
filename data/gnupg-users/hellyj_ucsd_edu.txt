@_subject: How to prevent emacs from unencrypting my files 
I've just discovered that emacs can unencrypt my *.gpg files without
prompting for a password. IMHO this largely negates the purpose of
encrypting files in case I lose my laptop.
What's the logic behind this? I know it's for convenience but can I
encrypt my files such they cannot be opened without a passphrase?
