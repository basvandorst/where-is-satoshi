@_subject: Importing a key from PGP 
I am trying to import this one key from PGP and keep getting this error...
C:\Program Files\GNU\GnuPG>gpg --import "Company Name.asc"
gpg: public key XXXXXXX is 21450 seconds newer than the signature
gpg: public key XXXXXXX is 21450 seconds newer than the signature
gpg: key XXXXXXX: no valid user IDs
gpg: this may be caused by a missing self-signature
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:           w/o user IDs: 1
Does anyone have any suggestions around this issue?
Thank you

Thank you that helped out alot.  We were able to get the key imported but
how would I incorperate that line into the encryption process?  I tried a
few different ways but it keeps getting errored out.
  We have a batch file setup to encrypt and here is the line we use...Any
help would be greatly appriciated.
"D:\Program Files\GNU\GnuPG\GPG" -q --yes --pgp7 -e -a -r %2 %1

Is there a way to ignore a signature when importing a key?
