@_subject: gnupg associated Windows VPN client? 
Not sure if this is the appropriate forum in which to post this question, but anyway:
Does anyone know of a GnuPG-based VPN client for Windows?  I suppose even if it isn't GnuPG based I'd be interested in it.  I'm trying to setup a commercial VPN connection to a VPN router w/o purchasing a VPN client such as SSH Sentinel, etc.  Does such a project exist?
