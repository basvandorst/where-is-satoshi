Hash: SHA1
Is it possible to have one masterkey with two subkeys (sbind), one for
encrypt only and one for sign only, and each of them to have different
Additionally, how can I select in enigmail which userID I want to sign
when signing a key with multiple UserIDs? I do not want to sign the
primary one. Enigmail just offers me the ability to 'sign key',
nothing said about UserID, just lets me select either normal signature
or local signature not exportable.
Thanks in advance.

Hash: SHA256
Thank you very much for your reply.
Please see my comments below in the replied text:
Understood. I guess this has to be done via console commands, since
the pour enigmail thundebird addon has very limited options when
creating/editing a GPG key.
I have 2 masterkeys, each with a subkey. Any way I can merge them
together so I would have one primary key and 3 subkeys?
I guess my question was not clear - sorry about it. I can see multiple
flags for the keys: Sign, Encrypt, Certify. I guess the Certify flag
matters when signing another GPG key and Sign is used for signing text?
I have the public key of John Doe  . He has more
UserIDs associated with the same masterkey, as follows:
John Doe John Smith Bob Jones Primary UserID is John Doe I want to sign this key, but just to confirm the UserID John Smith
 and not sign/certify his other UserIDs belonging
to the same key. Is this possible?

I tried to read this guy's blog either but it seams like you have to pay
to read it (buy credits with bitcoin). I don't know who the hell this
guy thinks he is, not even Bruce Schneier asks to pay fees to read his
blog/research papers, but I am just going to keep calm.
So, since I wouldn't give anything more than the bandwidth I am already
consuming to read this guy's blog, I guess I will never read his
'academic research on PGP', but I am really looking forward to see if he
can sign the nonce you've provided with your so-called compromised key.
I doubt this will ever happen. Even he never cracked any PGP keys at
all, the FUD he spread around was a nice way to get some free
advertising. Look, people saying his name on gnupg and enigmail lists,
which are quite popular I believe.
If he can prove he has your key by signing the nonce you've provided, I
hereby confirm that I will subscribe to his 'academic research blog' and
pay for each and every article, regardless I won't read them or have
interest in them.

@_subject: Questions about particular use cases (integrity verification w/o 
Hi list,
Please help me with some information and hints.
1. Is it possible, when transporting a message from Alice to Bob,
without holding any of their private keys, to do the following checks:
- verify the integrity of the message and make sure it is sanitized and
Bob can decrypt it with his private key;
- verify that the message was encrypted for Bob and not for anyone else
(Alice didn't mix recipients by mistake);
2. Is it possible to have just one key (the primary one, no subkey) with
E flag also (S,C,E) -- I know this is not recommended but this is a
particular use case and the risks are acknowledged. I guess gnupg will
not allow you to do this by default, but is there any magic that can be
3. Is it possible to import a secp256k1 private key and use it? For
example a secp256k1 key in the following format:
How could this be imported in gnupg?
4. Is there a way to skip the passphrase entirely and not encrypt the
private key at all?

Thanks for the reply. See inline,
If I have the public key of the recipient, I should be able to tell that
a message was encrypted for that public key, except I am missing the
private key to decrypt it. If I can check the message format I should be
able to check this as well. How would I do this with gnupg?
How? I tried in expert mode but didn't manage.

@_subject: Questions about particular use cases (integrity verification w/o 
Yes, what needs to be checked is dependent on the cipher text. Only if
the message has all the packets and theoretically can be decrypted (if
the recipient has the private key). It does not matter if the cleartext
makes sense to the recipient or not.
"look to see which keyids are given as hints in the outermost layer" --
not sure I understand here. I am trying to do a check that is natively
supported by gnupg.

@_subject: Questions about particular use cases (integrity verification w/o 
Tried both of them, not working. They only produce a single primary key
(8 RSA or 11 ECC) with S,C capabilities (without E).
I have even generated it normally (primary key with capabilities S,C +
subkey with E capability) and tried to edit the key after that, by
deleting the subkey and trying to toggle the capabilities of the primary
key but E is not a valid option to select as capability for the primary key.

It works with a RSA key, but not with ECC. Try with secp256k1 and you'll
only get Sign and Certify capabilities. At least this is what happens on
my side.

It is not a problem at all. Thanks for the feedback and your time,
really appreciate it.
Unfortunately, I do need secp256k1 as the encryption key, this is the
reason I am asking if it can be done or not, if I could use RSA I would
not even ask, I am using RSA for so many years.
The thing is, if I create an ECC (ECDSA) secp256k1 primary key with
Sign, Certify capabilities I can also create a subkey with E capability
which is also a secp256k1 key. So, they can be used for encryption after
all, so why can't I just add E capability to the primary one..

Hi Phil,
Thanks - this is indeed _very_ useful for my use case. I don't think the
second part is a problem since I can particularly request to not set the
`throw-keyids` option, but let's say metadata becomes a problem at a
given point and we decide to use this option, can I tell which recipient
'should' be able to decrypt a message based only on the encrypted
message format if the `throw-keyids` option was used?

@_subject: Questions about particular use cases (integrity verification w/o 
Thanks for this. Ok, now it's clear why the primary key cannot Encrypt.
Here is a key I have just generated:
sec  secp256k1/BF131CA5E1642BE9
     created: 2017-08-29  expires: never       usage: SC
     trust: ultimate      validity: ultimate
ssb  secp256k1/26882EB702DD7D4B
     created: 2017-08-29  expires: never       usage: E
[ultimate] (1). Delete Me I understand that the first one is ECDSA and the second is ECDH, but
can't I use the same secp256k1 key (if I import it) but in different two
representations (ECDSA representation for Sign and Certify and ECDH for
Encrypt)? The subkey might have a different fingerprint because it's a
different representation of course but this is not the concern, the
concern is for both to be computed from the same imported private key.

Hi everyone,
thanks for everyone's very helpful feedback. See inline.
Ok, understood, last thing: at least can I learn just by looking at the
cipher text that `throw-keyids` option was used and choose not to
further transmit that message and at least warn the sender that he
should double check and confirm one more time for safety reasons?
There is a single threat model: I am trying hard to prevent accidental
usage in an app where a message encrypted for a different recipient ends
up to the wrong person, no matter the recipient that actually gets the
ciphertext by mistake has absolutely no real use with it because he
won't be able to decrypt it -- the downside and loss is at sender side
for thinking the message was sent to someone else and further action is

Hello Mario, Robert,
Replying to both inline.
This will do for my use case.
I think I asked in a wrong way. I do not necessarily need for both the
primary key and the secondary key (key with Encryption capability) to be
the same secp256k1 curve / ExDSA key / ECDH key, etc. -- all I need is
for them to be reproductible at any time, any where, based on some seed,
or sha256 hash of a user-generated password, etc. It's irrelevant if
they are totally different keys that work in different ways, the only
feature needed is to be able to reproduce them from scratch any time,
and be able to decrypt the data.
Mario, check this out:
Generate keypair from bitcoin key:
var openpgp = require('openpgp');
var bs58check = require('bs58check');
var wif = 'KyiAchQgMKuXQu89j6k6UVZQj7brK6cM79JfmDvkNXPVW24L1thi';
var buff = bs58check.decode(wif);
var privateKey = buff.slice(1, -1);
privateKey = openpgp.util.bin2str(privateKey);
var options = {
    curve: 'secp256k1',
    userId: 'Hamlet ',
    passphrase: 'To be, or not to be: that is the question',
    material: {
      key: privateKey,
      subkey: privateKey
    }
openpgp.generateKeyPair(options).then(function(keypair) {
    // success
    var privkey = keypair.privateKeyArmored;
    var pubkey = keypair.publicKeyArmored;
}).catch(function(error) {
    // failure
Although I am not sure if how this code solves the primary / secondary
subkey problem, I doubt it can create a primary key with Encryption
capability because ECDSA doesn't work like this, as Robert clearly
explained (thanks again for this).

@_subject: Problem refreshing keys: Server indicated a failure 
One of my notebooks running apparently fails to refresh keys from key
servers for so long time.
- it is running the latest gpg4win bundle (3.1.4);
- there is no firewall preventing gpg's connection to the key server;
- it just says: refreshing keys from hkps:// and hangs for like
10 - 15 minutes, after that ending with: Failed to refresh keys, server
indicated a failure. I have also tried the port 80 ubuntu key server,
but no success got the same error.
If I try to refresh keys via Thunderbird -> Enigmail (which is tied to
the same, system-wide gpg) I get exactly the same result (error) with
any key server I try. I have checked the servers I am trying to connect
via their web interface and they all seam accessible. Also ping and
traceroute to them give positive results.
Any ideas?
Thanks in advance.
