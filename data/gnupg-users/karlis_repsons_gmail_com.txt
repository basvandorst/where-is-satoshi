@_subject: Anyone afraid of quantum computer? 
its more a curiosity for me now, but I remember one university lecturer saying, that successful quantum computer would make public key cryptography useless. Some experiment here:
Opinions on if we are likely to experience it, the public key demise?

@_subject: backup all keys of DSA+ELG pair? 
Hi there,
please, how can I make a keypair of DSA and ELG keys, 4 keys, as I understand, and then export all of them to another machine's gpg? Using --export, --export-secret-keys, --export-secret-subkeys, then --import for each of 3 previous commands failed me... Also the same, if I used key IDs. How to do it?

Ok, but I am still in problem, because, after I did thekey == mail address
Machine 1: gpg --export-secret-keys (thekey) > myfile.gpg
Machine 2: gpg --import myfile.gpg
it says gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
gpg:       secret keys read: 1
gpg:   secret keys imported: 1
However, I had there 3 subkeys today! And after doing import, they all appear through gpg, but no way to use any with kmail!
I also tried thekey == key ID, but it gave equal outputs for all the IDs...
What is wrong?
Actually, I would appreciate, if someone explains me the concept of master and subkeys in gpg - 1) the exclusive/overlapping functions of them
2) does fingerprint change, if subkey is added (or, does that refer to the master key only)?
3) how about the revocation certificates, that are generated for master key, if signing subkey is added afterwards?
Thanks for responses, its nice to be in touch with free software people!

So, its some KMail's strangeness, that it only sees master keys? Just in case you have some idea...

@_subject: the preference of signing keys question 
still I have questions :)
This time: is there some gnupg dictated way of setting preference of which signing/encrypting key to use? For example, I have a long RSA subkey, which I created just in case. I'd like to use DSA now, but my mailer somehow preferred RSA subkey.

This ends up with me willing to assert about the possible combinations:
Three sets from which to combine:
set 1:
--export-secret-subkeys, --export-secret-keys, --export
set 2:
used XXXXXXX, used XXXXXXX!
set 3:
master key, subkey
A] Which normal cases will export only the XXXXXXX subkey keypair (pub+sec)?
Are they
--export-secret-subkeys, XXXXXXX!, subkey?
B] Which normal cases will export all of the subkey pairs? Or master keypair will be included?
Are they
--export-secret-subkeys, XXXXXXX, subkey?
A2] Which normal cases will export only the XXXXXXX master keypair (pub+sec)?
Are they
--export-secret-keys, XXXXXXX!, master key?
B2] Which normal cases will export all of the keypairs?
Are they
--export-secret-keys, XXXXXXX?
C] Does --export works on the particular key ID, if XXXXXXX! is used?
Could you, please, explain a little about how mail clients interact with gpg - they use library, right? Or simply execute the gpg with the proper arguments and options? (I see, my KMail can't accept '!', so I ended up curious about
