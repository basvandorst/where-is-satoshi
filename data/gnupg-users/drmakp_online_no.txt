I'm wondering about encrypting my home-partition.
Is there any nice howto or something like that I should read?
I suppose the way to do it is to mount an encrypted file via
the loopback interface or something like that?
I'm sorry that I haven't searched for any such howtos, but
right now I'm sitting here without web-access. And I hope
to get an URL or something from one of you -- to save some time
when I go online again ... :-)
Keeping my keyring on an encrypted disk should be pretty safe?

Maybe you're nuts, what do I know ... :-) But anyway, you should be
able to accomplish this with Frank Tobin's salias, I think.
I haven't tested this, but Frank will probably tell me if I'm
completely off track here ... :-) I salias is not the answer, writing
a perl wrapper script shouldn't be too hard ...

@_subject: Make groups of keys in GnuPG? 
I have just installed GnuPG and mailcrypt (in Gnus), and it seems to
be working perfectly. I have one question, though:
Earlier on I used PGP in Windows (version 5.5 and later 6). There I
created groups of PGP-keys, so that I could encrypt to an alias
containing lots of people/keys.
That was very handy when I was sending messages to encrypted mailing
How can I do this in GnuPG? Do I have to make a script that runs
gpg -e  -e  ...
Or is there another way.
Or maybe I should put something in my .gnus?

I have installed salias, and it seems to be working ok from the
command prompt, but it does create some trouble for mailcrypt/gnus.
I moved gpg and put this wrapper script in /usr/bin/gpg:
    base=`basename $0`
  salias --context $base /usr/bin/real/$base $@
But it got some problems:
Problems encrypting:
  Encrypting+signing as filip  ...
  Encrypting+signing as filip  ... failed: gpg: \
  Missing argument for option "--passphrase-fd"
Problems decrypting:
On one message I got this error:
  Loading mc-gpg...done
  Decrypting... [2 times]
  SIGPIPE raised on process *GPG*; closed it
On another message I got this message:
  Decrypting... [2 times]
  The message was corrupt.
I tried to remove the shell-script-wrapper and put the gpg back in its
usual location (/usr/bin). An then I set the alias: alias gpg='salias gpg'
But mailcrypt does not seem to recognize or use the alias at all:
  Encrypting+signing as filip  ...
  Encrypting+signing as filip  ... failed: gpg: \
  studie skipped: public key not found gpg: [stdin]:
  sign+encrypt failed: public key not found
I tried to find out how mailcrypt determines the path to gpg, and I
found something interesting in /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/mailcrypt/
"mc-gpg.el" contains this line:
  (defvar mc-gpg-path "gpg" "*The GPG executable.")
And I find some references to the mc-gpg-path variable, but I'm not
able to determine where or when it actually sets the path-variable.
(I'm not very strong in lisp.)

I don't get it to work. I still have the same problem:
  Decrypting... [2 times]
  The message was corrupt.
  Decrypting... [2 times]
  SIGPIPE raised on process *GPG*; closed it
  Auto-saving...
  SIGPIPE raised on process *GPG*; closed it

  Encrypting+signing as filip  ... failed: gpg: \

This is my wrapper-script:
    base=`basename $0`
  salias --context $base /usr/bin/real/$base "$
