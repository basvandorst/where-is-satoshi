@_subject: gpg-agent protocol 
Before I do any coding or trials I would like to clear some GPG4Win
questions. Atsuhiko Yamanaka made an excellent Eclipse SSH agent plugin
( to proxy SSH agents to Eclipse
subsystems. Currently it supports ssh-agent on Linux and Pageant on Windows.
As of GPG4Win 2.2 the gpg-agent.exe can function as an SSH agent for Putty.
It would be just awesome to be able to use gpg-agent.exe in Eclipse. For
that, a connector needs to be developed but first I would like to get
information on how could I "talk to" the gpg-agent.exe? The Pageant
connector uses Win32 shared memory operations. My question might sound
silly, but is there anything that would prevent me writing a connector that
uses the same Win32 shared memory operations based protocol? I also recognized that on Windows an S.gpg-agent.ssh file is created in the
users roaming AppData
(C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\gnupg\S.gpg-agent.ssh), that pretty much
resembles a Unix socket. As far as I know there is no such compatible domain
socket on Windows, but what is this file then?
Thank you for your help.

@_subject: X509 CSR signed with card key 
I was not able to find a solution in the archives, so I post it here.
I need to generate X509 Certificate Signing Requests for one of my GnuPG
subkeys stored on an OpenPGP card. Now I need a mediator tool (openpgp2ssh
from The Monkeysphere Project) to convert my private key to PEM format that
can be used to make CSR with OpenSSL. It is rather tedious and I need to use
a special separated environment to access private keys. Is there any way to create an X509 CSR signed with the private key stored on
the card? Or any means where OpenSSL creates the CSR and asks the card to
sign the request with the card key?
I know these are different worlds, but I need to make them meet somehow.
