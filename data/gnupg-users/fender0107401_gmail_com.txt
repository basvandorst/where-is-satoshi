Hello everyone
I am totally a newcomer for gnupg, and I am reading the "The GNU Privacy
Handbook", the version string is "$Name: v1_1 $".
In the handbook, all command options is begin with one dash, like this
"-gen-key"; but on my system these options begin with two dash, like
this "--gen-key".
So, this is bug or other something?
OS: FreeBSD Release 7.0 p5
