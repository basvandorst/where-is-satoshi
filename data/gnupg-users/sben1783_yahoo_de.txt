@_subject: Is it safe to rename file.gpg to `md5sum 
Yes, I meant to use the MD5 checksum of the original file, not its
 original name. I'm still interested whether this would be "insecure"?
 ( at gnupg.org/msg15110.html)
 He states it's not a problem to hash the files contents, but it seems
 to be thought of no different than "counter and random string" - this
 are completely different things IMHO.
 And, by the way, how could the hash of a filename be used to  reconstruct
 the filename (as atom says "... makes recovery of the db possible ...")
 There is no such thing as inverse-md5sum, is there? You'd still need
 "brute force" to find the original name?
 Thanks
 Ben

Yes, that's exactly what I meant with "insecure". So I learn from your statement to better not use the md5 hashes.
While browsing for recommandations on what algorithm to use, I didn't come across the "vulerability" you mention above. I don't really understand what you're saying, but anyway plan to use AES because it a) seems to be the algorithm "more state of the art" and b) uses MDC by Well I do *not* want to reveal my private paths/filenames in the remote backup location. I won't upload the summary file as plaintext, but maybe encrypted as contents.gpg or the like. So I need another identifier for each file and some sort of mapping. That's why I came up with the md5sum of the files contents in the first place - I already have the mapping table (the summary file). If that's no good idea, I will probably just use a GUID for each file and create a separate mapping table (which also won't get uploaded without encryption:)
If I wanted to have a fallback for loosing the mapping table, would there be a sane way to encrypt the filename with gpg? That way I could decrypt it in case I loose the mapping table (which isn't possible with the GUID solution). I tried
echo '/path/to/original/filename' | gpg --armor -c
but the result contains newlines and slashes which isn't good for use as filenames. There's no option like "--armor-only-alphanumeric"...?
Thank you very much

============================== START ==============================
Hi all,
I'm thinking about a scenario for remote backup with gpg-encrypted files (--symmetric, one by one). In addition to encrypting the files contents, I'd like to hide their names also.
My backup tool can do the gpg-part for me (i.e. encrypt every file when backing it up) and it creates a "summary" file with the source path of every file, some stat() details and (for deduplication purposes), the md5sum of the original file. Now one simple and convenient approach to hide the file names would be a small script that iterates over the summary file and renames each gpg'ed file with it's own (unencrypted) md5sum. That way, I could use the summary file as a lookup table to find an encrypted, md5sum-named file by its original name/path.
Is this a sane way to go? I'm wondering whether the md5sum leaks too much information about the original file contents, so that the encryption (--cipher-algo AES256 would be my current choice) isn't really safe any more?
Thanks in advance

Hi all,
 maybe this question is completely stupid and only shows I didn't  understand anything about encryption, but anyway I'm really curious:
 I want to store some of my private files encrypted on my NAS. Until  now, I'm using --symmetric for encryption with a (think so) strong  password that I can remember. Now I want to make this "process" more  robust and more user-friendly - I don't want to enter my password every  time I'm encrypting a file. I want to sort of store the password in a  short script so that I just type "my_gpg /foo/bar/" and it gets done  without further input from me.
 Yes, I know I shouldn't store my password in a script;-) Acutally I  don't want to store it anywhere. Also I don't want to depend on a  private key that is stored somewhere. What I'd like to do is: create a  public key so that the corresponding private key equals my given  password. I could store that public key in my script and, for  decryption, just enter my remembered password as I do it with the  --symmetric option I'm currently using.
 Does this make any sense? Is it possible or did I miss some other way  to achieve my goal (no password for encryption, no private key for  decryption)?
 Thanks
 Ben
 P.S.: I also don't really want to set up a password agent on every  machine I want to encrypt files on.

I'm ok with asymmetric encryption as this will AFAIK be the only way to get rid of entering the password for every encryption. But as I mentioned I don't want to depend on a private key stored somewhere, but I'd like to use my password as the private key. I would need a keypair where the public key is some I-don't-care-ascii-bulk, but the private key is exactly my password.

Would a key size matching the size of my password (say, 15 characters) be less secure than symmetric encryption with that password?
Another thought would be to just paste the private key (encrypted by my password) to the gpg'd files? Of course my private key would then be sort of "public", but still it is as secure as using symmetric encryption with that password in the first place (but allowing me to use the real public key in my script)? Does gpg by any chance happen to offer some feature like that..?

 Oh, yes that really covers what I wrote... What I actually meant to  write was: couldn't gpg embed the private key into the gpg'd file, like  as a part of the header? That way, no matter what happens to my gpg'd  file in terms of moving around or whatever, the private key is with it  (I personally wouldn't mind some extra bytes with each file). On  decryption, gpg would find the private key in the header and just ask me  for its passphrase like it does with symmetric encryption.
 Maybe this isn't such a common use case, but I think for me it would  perfectly make sense;)

On Fri, 02 Jan 2015 18:07:40 +0100, Peter Lebbing  Thank you Peter for your answers - the nitpick in this case doesn't  really change my conclusions, but I very much appreciate that kind of  precise and complete information. Even if only for the feeling of  "complete comprehension" (if that term makes sense in english).
