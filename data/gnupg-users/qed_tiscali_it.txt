Your keyring would be stored in your personal home dir, if you have
installed XP on a NTFS partition(i.e.: permissions are enabled) ad you
trust that machine there aren't security risks; to decrease a bit your
paranoia level ;-) you could enable windows file encryption(EFS) on you
keyring files/directory.
Only if that machine doesn't have an internet connection. There are
OpenPGP plugins for almost every MUA.
No, since the security issue is not related to the underlying
cryptographic algorithms(e.g.: some time ago ElGamal signatures were
discovered to be weak, so in newer version of GnuPG the generation of
such keys is disabled).
The machine you are using to do crypto stuff must be trusted in any case.

But I believe even the home version has NTFS support, not per-user/group

Only when you encrypt.
Almost correct.
Only when you use public key encryption.
It is called "session key".
Gnupg is aware of different compression algos(bzip2, zlib, zip) and when
encounters such a compressed file disable compression automatically.
1024 RSA/ElGamal is considered semi-weak.
This is because AES doesn't allow this. Stop.
You could read NIST Special Pubblication 800-57 section 5.6.1 about this
gpg --versions shows supported algorithms. Many symmetric ciphers allow
only a fixed length key by desing(IDEA, CAST5, 3DES); others(AES,
TWOFISH, BLOWFISH) can be used with different key sizes, but only AES is
used in such a way in OpenPGP.
You still use a passphrase to protect the secret part of your keyring,
this is the weak link of most cryptosystems.
If you must not publish it, what makes it a public key?
Hmmm, some bells start ringing in my head. Is this a homework assignment?
This is wrong twice. Guess why.
Try yourself.
This is DEFINITELY a homework assignment! Ever heard of Google? It is

I think that we can categorize this task under "Advanced Features", how
many un-skilled users need to compute sha2 digests of files? How many of
them understand the term "command-line"? How many of them search in
documentation before posting to Usenet/ML?
Finding out the right syntax is different from having it under your own
eyes and not seeing it.
Maybe you could try to tell us what version of coreutils do you have
installed and what OS are you using, we don't have a magic ball to ask.
Two of your headers:
so I suppose you are using SuSE Linux, version 10.1 includes Evolution
2.6.0. Incidentally I am using the same version of this nice
distribution, I have coreutils-5.93 here and there is no trace of sha2
support in documentation.
However you should have noticed that this is not a linux mailing list.

This hypothesis has been made on a dated version of OpenPGP standard,
RFC2440bis-draft16 states:
OK, these misterious packets are surely cross certifications. They are
obviously non existent, since there is no reason for their presence in a
public key encrypted message.

I was investigating the possibility to use a RSA master key with SHA256
or SHA512 as certification digest algorithm.
The problem is, as usual, compatibility.
I don't know anything about the diffusion of the various PGP versions
and their capabilities.
I've found a PGP compatibility table, written by Eric L. Howes, where
PGP 8.0 is reported to support none of SHA2 hashes, but it is quite
outdated(latest GnuPG version reported is 1.2.1).
David Shaw in a recent message <20060526161325.GC19437
about DSA2 said:
gpg manpage says about --pgp8 option:
A quick look at the source code confirms that --pgp8 allows SHA256 but
not SHA[224|384|512].
Any definitive response about PGP 8.0 *real* capabilities?
Additional considerations/advices/warnings?

I'm asking about hash functions support in general; if a particular
piece of sw supports HASH-X in DSA it is reasonable to suppose that the
same is with RSA.
That was the point of message. Asserting that with PGP 8 you can use a
larger hash /like/ SHA-256 doesn't necessarily mean that you you are
limited to it, someone could understand "you can use larger hashes, like
sha256, like sha224, sha384, like sha512, so PGP 8 supports them even if
with DSA it uses a truncated result due to the obvious limitations
imposed by q".
However, you have cleared all my doubts.
