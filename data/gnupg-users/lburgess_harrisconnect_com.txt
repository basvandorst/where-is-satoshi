@_subject: Upgrading gpupg 
I am running HP-UX vers 11.11.  I have gpg installed on my system, but when I try to find out the version by doing gpg -version, it core dumps.  I am guessing it's an old version.  Do I need to remove that version before installing the 2.0.22 version?
We are also using PGP currently, and I don't want the install/upgrade/deinstall of GPG to interfere with our current PGP keys and processes.
Please advise.  Thank you very much for your time.
