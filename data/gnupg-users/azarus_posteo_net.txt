@_subject: Signing failed -- "No secret key", even though I have the key 
Hello GPG users,
I have a problem regarding signing data. Whenever I try clear-signing,
this appears:
gpg: writing to stdout
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256
gpg: signing failed: No secret key
gpg: [stdin]: clear-sign failed: No secret key
I invoked clearsign like this:
echo "hello" | gpg --sign-with  --clearsign
This is what gpg -K lists:
sec   rsa4096 2016-12-20 [SC]
uid           [ultimate]  uid           [ultimate]  ssb   rsa4096 2016-12-20 [E]
ssb#  rsa4096 2017-06-23 [SE]
Can somebody explain what I'm doing wrong? This was working a couple of
days ago, I even reset my .gnupg directory from a backup, with  no
Thanks for the help!
All the best,
