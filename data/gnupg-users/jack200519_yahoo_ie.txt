Hi, I am completely new to GnuPG. I have recieved a CD with a file on it I need to decrypt. I have never done this before. If I try to copy the text into the clipboard, it tells me "cannot copy, drag, or cut text containing null characters". If I right click on the file, amd go to GpGEE - decrypt/verify, I get a message box saying no data. Am I doing something wrong?? Hope someone can help!! Send instant messages to your online friends
