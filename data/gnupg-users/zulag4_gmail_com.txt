I have some questions :
1. The GnuPG documentation states that "--export-secret-key" is "a
security risk". Since no passphrase is asked, I imagine the exported
key is not clear text. So why is it a security risk ? Because it would
make it impossible (useless) to change the secret key passphrase later
if the exported encrypted file goes public ?
2. Is it a bad practice to encrypt a file and then "clearsign" the
encrypted file instead of doing directly "-ea" (with which we cannot
check the signature before extracting, if we ever wanted to) ?
thanks by advance for answering

OK, but what exactly are the risks, what to expect to protect from ?
Is it because of the possible password "cracking" and the password
becoming unmodifiable (because people have a copy of the key encrypted
with the password "P" you had when you exported your key, so whatever
stronger password "Q" you set later, they can attack and compromise
your key by finding "P") ?

(first, excuse me for the message not appearing as a reply, I had not
subscribed to the mailing-list when I sent the first message)
(If you want to make tests, you can create a temporary directory, and
set the GNUPGHOME environment variable to that temporary directory.)
You can import the exported private key, but when you cannot sign or
decrypt anything without entering the passphrase. I agree with what
David said :
About my question 2 :
This is not a problem in my situation, so I suppose I can do it if
there are no other problems.
