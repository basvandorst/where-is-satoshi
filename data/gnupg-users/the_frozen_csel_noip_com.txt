@_subject: smtp and gpg-signature? 
Hello guys!
I searched the web for some hours now, but I couldn't find a solution for my problem.. So I ask here...
The problem: I have to write a small MUA-portion, which has to send a gpg-signed mail. I have to use C to do this. My program is already able to send mails, which are multipart and contain the (detached) signature. But the recipient always reports: BAD signature... To make things a bit clearer: An example:
X-Mailer:LOMUA 0.0.1

Thanks! It was that RFC 3156 that helped me out! It's running now!
Thanks to everybody else to!
