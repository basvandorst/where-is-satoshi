We have PCI regulations that mandate certain key storage
procedures. Split keys are one such requirement. What is the experience of this forum with split keys and storage ?

@_subject: Split keys 
We have come across tools like SSSS. Can I use these in Windows ? I am trying to split the public key. We are the encryptors. Does that make sense ?
Looks like according to PCI, GPG is not compliant because there is no mechanism to split keys using GPG. Is there a way ?

@_subject: AES key management 
I have been trying to set up AES key management because the
AES encryption/decryption keys are stored in the Java code. I came
across split key technology but we are not able to get any idea because
we don't use any hardware for this.
Is there any way to store a AES key in a GPG keyring securely and
retrieve it securely ? I also know that there is always a password
involved and it will be soon be a chicke-and-egg situation.
Are there any ideas about this ?

@_subject: Encrypting for multiple users 
We have several public keys and we use all of them to encrypt
files. Each recipient then decrypts the file using his or her own secret
key. Now some recipients lose their keys and replace them. Some new
encrypting keys get added. So we have several old files that the new users
cannot read.
Can a single user generate several sub secret keys and distribute to the
other recipients ? Does this solve the old file re-encryption problem
somehow by still retaining individual keys ?
Our policy does not allow sharing of keys. So it looks like the subkeys have
the same problem because all of them originate from a common key ?

I am encrypting for multiple recipients.
gpg -r  -r  -r   -r  --encrypt file.txt 3 users are able to decrypt the files. The 4th user though is getting this messsage.
I am using GPG. All users use PGP to decrypt. Shouldn't make a difference ?
"It is not possible to decrypt this message because your keyring does not
 contain usable private key(s) corresponding to any of the above public key(s)."
It looks like the 4 th user is doing something wrong ?

@_subject: Split key 
I came across a reference to paperkey in this forum which seems
to be splitting a public key into two parts. Does this procedure look like a sensible thing to do ?
1. Generate key pair in keyring.
2. Encrypt symmetric key using this public key.
3. Remove public key from keyring. Is this possible
4. Separate a part of the public key and give it to a custodian.
1. Reconstruct it and import into the keyring.
2. Decrypt symmetric key using this public key.
3. Use decrypted symmetric key to encrypt whatever I want.
I am just looking at a way to ensure that a key can be resconstructed
from custody. The GPG keyring password can also be encrypted using the
same public key. Just that there is a way to split and ensure that
everything is not in one place so that security is enhanced.

@_subject: Storing password in keyring 
Question 1 :
          Is there any way to store a password in a keyring ? I don't
have a database for this. I was just thinking that I can hash a password
and use a keyring to store it to avoid the need for a database.
Question 2 :
         Can I split a private(decrypting) key and rejoin it using GPG ?
The split keys are given by two different people and rejoined.
I want to use the bouncy castle GPG API.

@_subject: Find correct key id's 
I have some questions about matching key id's.
1. I am trying to find the key id of the key that encrypted a file so
that I can use the corresponding decrypting key.
2. I am trying to use the correct decrypting key from the keyring using
the code shown here to decrypt.
Appreciate any advice ?
                PGPSecretKey    prk = ( PGPSecretKey )keyIt.next();
                PGPPublicKey    puk = prk.getPublicKey();
                        sb.append(  "Private [" + prk.getKeyID() + "]
Public [" + puk.getKeyID() + "]\n" );
                        for( Iterator it = puk.getUserIDs() ;
it.hasNext() ;  ){
                              sb.append( "User ID [" + it.next() + "]\n"
                        }

@_subject: Find correct key id's 
I think as a newbie I was confused because --list-packets and BC
API printed two different ID's. Correct me if I am wrong.
It looks like when I use a user id like this and encrypt
gpg --output readme.gpg --recipient test123 at test.co.in --encrypt
CHANGE.txt     the output from "--list-packets readme.gpg" is 2048-bit RSA key, ID
6540BD43, created 2010-02-11 (main key ID 202AAEDC)
but when I use code like this to get a key for encrption
            while ( rings.hasNext()) {
            	PGPPublicKeyRing ring = (PGPPublicKeyRing) rings.next();
               	key = ring.getPublicKey();
    				if( null == key ){
    					throw new
    				}
    	        	for( Iterator userIds = key.getUserIDs() ;
userIds.hasNext() ; ){
    	    			userId = ( String )userIds.next();
    	        	}
            }
The output from --list-packets is 2048-bit RSA key, ID 202AAEDC, created
So it looks like in the first instance it shows the sub-key but in the
second case it seems to be showing the main key.

You only need a passphrase when signing or decrypting unless your using
symmetric encryption.
The man page documents the following options:
       --passphrase-fd n
                 Read  the  passphrase from file descriptor n.  Only the
                 line will be read from file descriptor n.  If you use
0  for
                 n,  the passphrase will be read from stdin.  This can
only be
                 used if only one passphrase is supplied.
       --passphrase-file file
                 Read the passphrase from file file.  Only the first
line will
                 be  read  from  file file.  This can only be used if
only one
                 passphrase is supplied.  Obviously, a passphrase stored
in  a
                 file is of questionable security if other users can
read this
                 file.  Don't use this option if you can avoid it.
       --passphrase string
                 Use string as the passphrase.  This can only be used if
                 one passphrase is supplied.  Obviously, this is of very
                 tionable security on a multi-user  system.   Don't  use
                 option if you can avoid it.
