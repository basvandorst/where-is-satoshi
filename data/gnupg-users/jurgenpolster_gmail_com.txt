@_subject: ENISA Recommendation for Crypto processes 
Heise security news published an article "ENISA-Empfehlungen zu
Krypto-Verfahren" (ENISA Recommendation for Crypto processes). The
article is in German language and can be found under
 It holds a summary of the latest
recommendations of ENISA, the European Union Agency for Network and
Information Security (
For those not reading German the "summary" of the summary report is:
Symmetric 80 bit keys are accepted for transaction data and existing
systems to be replaced in the next 5 -10 years. Symmetric keys of 128
bit are OK for mid-term and 256 bit for long-term use.
* Cryptographic Primitives *
Block Cipher -> AES 128, long-term AES 256 bit
Hash Function -> SHA-256, long-term SHA-512 (Camellia, SHA-3 and
Whirlpool are discussed)
Stream Ciphers -> Rabbit + Snow 3G (RC4 to be removed)
* Public Keys*
Elliptic Curve Cryptography is recommended: Transactions -> 160 bit,
mid-term storage -> 256 bit, long-term storage -> 512 bit
RSA still can be used, recommendations are: legacy systems only -> key
size smaller than 3072, mid-term storage -> minimum 3072 (!), long-term
storage -> 15360 (corresponds to 256 bit key symmetric encryption)
* Protocols *
Some detailed recommendations are made for protocols as TLS
(Camellia_128_GCM_SHA256, AES_128_GCM_SHA256), SSH (inter alia
aes128-ctr with hmac-sha2-256) Kerberos and IPSEC.

PS: I send this twice as it seems that the first one did not make it. In case it comes double I already apologize :-)

You could use oPenGP under IOS. Due to the constraints of IOS, the
integration is rather limited, but it works. Another candidate would
be iPGMail.

One of the options for IOS user is oPenGp, which interacts nicely. But to
answer correctly: no.

@_subject: How to use a the same generated keypair on enigmail/thunderbird 
As said by Fabian, IOS natively only supports S/ MIME keys. This works rather seamlessly. You nearly do not notice it. However to exchange or DELETE outdated S/MIME certificates of others is a real pain and made me stop working with it.
The IOS apps for working with openpg encryption are iPGMail and oPenGP. Both interact with mail by cut and paste of content and you can transfer your private keys and public keys by help of the iTunes App and a cable from your windows or Mac PC. It works but due to the cut and paste workflow use is rather inconvenient.
Kind regards
