Hello all,
I've been a windoze pgp user for a while and am in the process of converting
over to unix/gpg. For the time being, however, I need to be able to use both
GPG and PGP. I've created my keys using GPG and am trying to import them to
PGP, but with limited success. I've done:
gpg --export-secret-keys --armor
to get the secret, which I've copied to the clipboard and then done 'Add key
from clipboard' (from pgptray). I can do this with the public key, but get a
read error when I do it for the private. If I do it to a file:
gpg --export-secret-keys -o somefile.asc
gpg --export-secret-keys --armor -o somefile.asc
and then try to import them with PGPkeys I get errors about not containing
any valid PGP keys.
There's probably a fairly logical explaination for this... perhaps I should
be doing it the other way around? ie creating under PGP and importing to
I'm not on the list so copy me in when you reply please.

Hello all,
Thanks to those who responded - especially those who replied within minutes!
It appears the simplest way around the problem (the problem being I want to
use PGP in Windoze and GPG in Unix for now) is to generate my keys in PGP
and import them into GPG.
This is apparantly because GPG stores its keys using Blowfish. I would have
thought it could have been more friendly than that, but I suspect it is more
PGP being broken than GPG :)
Hash: SHA1
The problem I would guess, is that the default symmetric algorithm used to
encrypt GnuPG secret keys is Blowfish, which is not supported by PGP.
I don't know how you could go about resolving this issue; that is, I don't
know how you could get GnuPG to change the algorithm used to encrypt an
already-created secret key.  There is an option "s2k-cipher-algo", but
according to the documentation in the manpage, is not clear that this may
have any effect while not generating a key.
