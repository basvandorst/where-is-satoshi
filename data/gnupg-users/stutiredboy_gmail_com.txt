@_subject: How can i get the fingerprint from the gnupg public file 
I have a gnupg public key file withe content:
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (GNU/Linux)
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
The question is how can i get the fingerprint from the gnugp public file
without import it?
I can get it from gpg --list-keys --fingerprint after i import it
but, i can not import it first, how can i do ?
thanks all*
