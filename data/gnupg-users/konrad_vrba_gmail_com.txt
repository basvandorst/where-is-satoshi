@_subject: gpg: NOTE: trustdb not writable 
I am using gpg on a system, which is mounted read-only. When I do the
echo "hello" | gpg --lock-never --no-verbose -e -s -a -r user at example.com
I get an error:
gpg: NOTE: trustdb not writable
I don't understand why gpg should need write access inside user home,  for
normal operation.
Is thre a way to stop this error message?
