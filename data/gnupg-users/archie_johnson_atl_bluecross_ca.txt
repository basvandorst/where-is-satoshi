@_subject: Win32 - export keys 
Using gnupg win32, I could not create a valid exported key file using redirected
stdout.  I found that using the --output option, however, worked fine.
In other words:
gpg --export user1 > user1.key    (created a corrupted file)
gpg -o user1.key --export user1  (created a valid file)
I did further analysis on the corrupted files:
When I tried to import an unarmoured file, I'd get:
gpg: mpi too large (51968 bits)
gpg: mpi too large (41167 bits)
gpg: Ohhhh jeeee: mpi crosses packet bordersecmem usage: 0/0 bytes in 0/0 blocks
 of pool 0/16384
abnormal program termination
When I tried to import an armoured file I'd get this:
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: Total number processed: 0
By examining the armoured exported keyfiles from both a stdout redirect and a
--output specified file, I found that the redirected file had an extra carriage
return at the end of line ( x'0D0D0A') where as the --output file had just
x'0D0A' end of lines.
Just thought you would like to know.  I tried searching the mailing lists and
Readme.W32 doc, but couldn't find anything a mention of this.
Thanks, Archie
When I tried to search the mail list archives... I got the following:
ht://Dig error
htsearch detected an error. Please report this to the webmaster of this site.
The error message is:
Unable to read word database file '/opt/db/db.words.db'
Did you run htmerge?

@_subject: HPUX 10.20 compile notes 
Here's some notes of my experience compiling Gnupg 1.0.2  (If memory serves me
1. Downloaded and installed depots (packages) for binutils 2.9.1, gcc 2.95.2,
make 3.79.
2. Added /opt/gcc/bin, /opt/binutils/bin, and /opt/make/bin to the beginning of
my path
3. Created a symlink from /opt/gcc/bin/cc to /opt/gcc/bin/gcc
4. ./configure
5. gmake
6. gmake install
This was done on a bare-bones test box with the brain dead cc compiler that
comes by default with hpux.
I did step 3 to get around a problem with the config.guess script that was using
the brain dead cc compiler and resulted in the system type not being identified
I had run step 5 as root which caused a problem during the 'checking' processes
after compile.  The error was "Bad System Call" which had been discussed in an
earlier posting somewhere.  Apparently you can't run this version of gpg as root
under hpux... something about memory locking.  There was an untested patch
posted in either the users or devel mailing list for this problem.  As this was
untested I did not bother to install it.  You should probably run this step as
non-root (as well as any other time you run gpg (or any make for that matter)).
I also remember seeing some other posting on setting a configure switch
--enable-static-rnd=egd (entropy gathering daemon), but did not do this although
it probably should.
Safeharbor Statement... I'm neither a sysadmin, programmer, nor a gpg expert.  I
just wanted to share my solutions / experiences with anyone who may be
interested.  Please give this all the consideration you feel it is worth.
Thanks, Archie
