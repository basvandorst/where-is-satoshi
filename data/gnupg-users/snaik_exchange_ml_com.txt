@_subject: Usage of gnupg to automatically decrypt messages. 
I need to automatically decrypt messages. I don't want to pass in the passphrase in the options as it will then be highly visible to everybody.
Can there be a way just as we register the public key of using the secret key with the user name. So, it is as if we run the decrypt command and specify a keyId or name of the user and the registered
secret key gets picked up and the decryption takes place. Thereby I don't need to write down the passphrase.
Thanks in advance, Sachin Naik

@_subject: Getting the gpg to work with a different user. 
I created the keys with my local user. Now I want to deploy on another user. I do not want to have any dependency with the local user. If I try to use gpg, it gives me an error that it could not
create the keyring and could not open the pubring.pgp(keyblock resource). I need to keep the two users independent. Does this mean that I will have to create a new set of keys for the other user. That
means every user will have to have this setup :-((. Any ideas on how I can avoid this and reuse the keys created by local user for all users.

@_subject: FW: Getting the gpg to work with a different user. 
I started using gpg as a separate user. Now if I change the user and run the gpg command, it gives me an error that "could not open the pubring.pgp as it is a keyblock resource and could not create
keyring" as stated in the mail below. How can I proceed even to import new keys in other users.
