@_subject: Problem with pgp... 
I have recently installed gnupg in my Mandrake 8.0 Linux instalation.
i have created keys, but forgot the passphrase (i know.. i know..), so had to delete the keys. I used the comand line option: gnupg --delete-key.
After that i have created a new pair of keys. But when i run: gnupg --edit-keys  it loops with the following message:
secret key available...
gpg: waiting for lock (hold by 4781 - probably dead) ...
(same message....looping)
i may have boobed something.. but i am not familiar with the program.
I tried to reboot the machine so to clean any lock files.. but nothing, my guess is that this has to be with memory pages.. well..
Could someone help me?
Thanking your attention,
André Esteves

--delete-secret-and-pubkic-key is unavailable in my version.
Besides now, after deleting the secret key, when deleting the public key it
loops again with the message:
gpg: waiting for lock (hold by 1743 - probably dead) ...
and now?
Thanking for your time,
