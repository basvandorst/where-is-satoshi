I am no longer able to verify signatures, or even list my keyring. I
suspect that a key as been (automatically) imported which uses SHA224
which gpg does not support. Can anyone advise what I can do to a) Fix
the keyring and b) Stop it getting borked in future?

For individuals I think that too much importance is placed on identity
based on name. For companies it is different, it is useful to know that
the email/web site etc that purports to be from example.com is actually
from the company Example Ltd. For individuals, it is much more useful to
treat the certificate/gpg key as identity so that it can be said (as
long as the sender is careful with not allowing others access to the
private key) that the email signed by John Doe's key/certificate is from
the same person calling himself John Doe that you have previously
received email.
