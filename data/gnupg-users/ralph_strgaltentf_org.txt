Well, 0xAF351431 can only be used for signing and certification. The key
you encrypt to is your subkey 0xE3889A13, which expired yesterday:
pub  1024D/AF351431  created: 2002-02-04 expires: 2012-02-04 trust: -/-
sub  4096g/E3889A13  created: 2002-02-03 expires: 2004-02-03
This might be the reason you cannot encrypt to it :)
But maybe gpg should throw an error showing *why* the key is unusable.

@_subject: PGP/Mime and Outlook (was: gpgme and signature comments) 
Forget about OE or Outlook users and sign with PGP/MIME. How would you
sign Attachments otherwise? Separately outside of your MUA? How would
you sign non ASCII text inline? So much for compatibility, using *only*
ASCII characters would break the language I normally write in.
There are tools for Users of OE or Outlook, which enable them to read
and sign with PGP/MIME (gpgrelay would come to mind, I don't know, if
any of the other plugins are still in active development).
My 2 cents, YMMV, but I do not want to be compatible with MUAs breaking
ever second existing standard.

@_subject: retrieving keys over a proxy 
At least my ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf tells me to do so :)
