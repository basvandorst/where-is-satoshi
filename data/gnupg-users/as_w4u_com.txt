My apache server encrypts succesfully form_data I want to send to our
customer via email. The problem is: sending the encrypted text via
perl mail pipe command does not generate the mail headers necessary
for the mailer (mutt etc.) to recognize that the text is encrypted
and automatically decrypt it. The message can be decrypted on command
line without problem. But I want the mailer to do it for our customers.
Any ideas?

I feel sorry but not responsible for my mail to appear in the
list so many times. It´s due to the following:
        Date: Tue, 28 Sep 1999 21:37:00 +0200
        From: "EMSMSM.EMSMSM(POSTMASTER)" (POSTMASTER
        Subject: Mail failure
        To: as
        X-Mailer: Novell GroupWise 4.1
        FROM: EMSMSM/EMSMSM/POSTMASTER
        TO: as                                       DATE: 09-28-99
                                                               TIME: 21:37
        SUBJECT: Mail failure
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        [005] Mail retry count exceeded sending to:
          3CORD     /HILVERSUM
which returned my message as often as I sent it. So I know now to ignore that.
Yes, this sounds interesting. Where did you get it?
It seems it is something I am looking for. I need to try it out, really.
Thanks for interest!
