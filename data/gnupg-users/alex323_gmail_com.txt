@_subject: Problem with keys imported via DNS CERT 
Hey everyone. I am using gnupg 2.0.8 and libgcrypt 1.4.0. I just added
a DNS CERT record to my zone file and tried importing the key into my keyring
to test to make sure everything is working properly. When I attempt it
though, I get a warning that says there is no assurance that my key
belongs to me. See below:
$> gpg2 --auto-key-locate cert --recipient email at address.com --encrypt -a
gpg: key 09BBC7F2: public key "My Name " imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
gpg: automatically retrieved `email at address.com' via DNS CERT
gpg: AF19F7E3: There is no assurance this key belongs to the named user
It is NOT certain that the key belongs to the person named
in the user ID.  If you *really* know what you are doing,
you may answer the next question with yes.
Use this key anyway? (y/N) gpg: [stdin]: encryption failed: Unusable public key
I've read that this is caused by unsigned public keys. However, both my DSA
and RSA keys appear to be signed:
pub   3072D/XXX 2008-01-23
uid                          My Name sig 3        XXX 2008-01-23 never       My Name sub   4096R/XXX 2008-01-23 [expires: 2008-06-21]
sig          XXX 2008-01-23 never       My Name Is there something I am doing wrong? Thank you.

No, I am starting out with a clean ~/.gnupg folder.

If a key is marked as trusted then it is already in my keyring and
never needs to be imported in the first place.
I imported a friend's key from a keyserver and it never gave me that
warning. The key was not marked as trusted because I never had it in
the first place. :/

Based on what everyone is saying, the following warning,
"There is no assurance this key belongs to the named user"
should appear for _every_ key I import if the key is not in the keyring.

@_subject: CERT fails with LDAP URL 
Hi, when I try to locate a key with CERT it fails with this message:
$ gpg2 --auto-key-locate cert -r email at address --encrypt
gpgkeys: key 0000000000000000 not found on keyserver
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: Total number processed: 0
gpg: automatically retrieved `email at address' via DNS CERT
gpg: email at address: skipped: No public key
gpg: [stdin]: encryption failed: No public key
$ gpg2 --version
gpg (GnuPG) 2.0.9
Used libraries: gcrypt(1.4.1)
I generated the CERT record using the make-dns-cert tool and set the
url to "ldap://keyserver.pgp.com". My key is definitely listed on the
keyserver, and GPG is correctly connecting to the keyserver using ldap.
It seems that gpg is asking the ldap server for the wrong key (all 0's) I checked the RR with `host' and it is indeed correct.
If anyone wants to actually see this in action please send me an email
off the list and I will give you the relevant information.
