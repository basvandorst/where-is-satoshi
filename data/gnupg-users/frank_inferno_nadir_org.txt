@_subject: Using PGP 2.6.3i keys 
hi there,
with GnuPG version 0.9.6 (+ compiled cipher modules rsa and idea in
extracted the public key from pgp and imported it to gnupg. Then I encrypted a
file with that imported key (gpg --encrypt --recipient frank --rfc1991
--load-extension rsa --load-extension idea file.gpg), but when I tried to
decrypt it, pgp 263ia reports an "unsupported packet format" error. The same
thing the other way round. What am I doing wrong or is gnupg not supposed to be
able to en-/decrypt to/from pgp 263ia users at this point?
thanks for answer,
                                                      Infonetzwerk Norderstedt

@_subject: Problems importing GnuPG pubkey with PGP 6.5.8 
Someone I know sent a GnuPG 1.0.1 generated key to a PGP 6.5.8 user, but this
user failed to import the key into his key ring. As far as I can see from this
mailing list, this should be no problem. Unfortunately, I don't know the
exact error message PGP gave.
The key was created with standard configuration and a simple 'gpg --gen-key'
and was exported with 'gpg --armor --export'.
Can someone give me a hint? And if there's a problem with PGP, are there similar
problems known with other versions (5.x - 7.x)?
Thanks in advance,
