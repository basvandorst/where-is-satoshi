@_subject: GnuPG, mailcrypt and XEmacs on win32 
whenever trying to encrypt a mail with the mailcrypt-package (3.5.5)
in XEmacs/Gnus on win32, an insidious error occurs
in the minibuffer:
Removing old name: No such file or directory, c:\gnupg\mailcrypt-gpg-stderr-JYj9er
neither *mc debug* nor *mailcrypt*-buffer contain usefull information,
(they're empty indeed).
XEmacs/Gnus/gpg with the same .emacs, .gnus, .gnupg, even the same computer
- but run under linux - work fine.
Does anyone know what the problem is and how to solve?
