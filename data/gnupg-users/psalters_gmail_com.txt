@_subject: Problem with libgcrypt 
I am using libcurl to develop an appilication to do xml requests.
These requests are using HTTPS so the libgnutls and libgcrypt is used.
It uses multiple threads to do requests. Most of the time it runes
fine but sometimes I get the following error:
"ath.c:193: _gcry_ath_mutex_lock: Assertion '*lock == ((ath_mutex_t)"
What causes this?
I have read the documentation about thread safety and I have the
following lines in my code.
gcry_control (GCRYCTL_SET_THREAD_CBS, &gcry_threads_pthread);
Appreciate your help!
