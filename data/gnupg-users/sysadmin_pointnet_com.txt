I'm running into quite a bit of problems getting gpg to encode a file
when called from my web server, as a cgi script, as opposed to being
called by the SAME user on the shell, I've tried to use --batch, --yes
and --no-tty with no success, I've prepared a passwordless key just for
this purpose, does anyone have suggestions on how I can bypass this
