@_subject: Moving keyrings to a different box 
I recently had to move my account from one Linux box to another.  I
built gnupg on the new system and just copied my .gnupg directory from
one to the other.  I now have problems decrypting messages encrypted
using my public key.  However, if I encrypt a message to myelf on the
new box, it decrypts fine.
Should I have done something differently here?

I should probably add that the original keys were made with GPG 1.0.3
and the new box is running 1.0.4.  And a little more detail would
probably be in order:
I generally use mutt.  I first noticed the problem when it would start
showing messages like this (note the blank message):
[-- PGP output follows (current time: Tue Oct 24 17:28:02 2000) --]             gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!                                            [-- End of PGP output --]                                                       [-- BEGIN PGP MESSAGE --]                                                       [-- END PGP MESSAGE --] Pasting the message into gpg manually causes GPG causes it to fail
transparently, without any error messages.  It prompts me to "Go ahead
and type your message ..." and I paste it in.  It then says:
You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: "Ben Beuchler (MAILER-DAEMON) "
1024-bit ELG-E key, ID 480FBF79, created 2000-09-20 (main key ID AFED231A)
Enter passphrase:
After I type my passphrase and hit enter, it immediately drops me back
to the shell without any error messages.  I am not passing any options
to gpg on the commmand line and I even renamed my options file to
prevent any conflicts there.
I tried using the --debug-all flag but that did not return anything that
made sense to me.  I would be happy to stick it up on a website if that
would be of help.  It was a bit large to attach here... ;-)

When I try to obtain a key from search.keyserver.net, I get nasty
petra:~$ gpg --keyserver search.keyserver.net --recv-keys 0x6456D367
gpg: requesting key 6456D367 from search.keyserver.net ...
gpg: [fd 4]: read error: Connection reset by peer
gpg: Total number processed: 0
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
Am I doing something wrong or is search.keyserver.net broken?  I was
able to submit my key via the command line just fine...
