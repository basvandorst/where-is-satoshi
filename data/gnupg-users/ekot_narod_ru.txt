@_subject: Compile GnuPG 1.4 under cygwin? 
These files just are not in base cygwin package where most of the include files are. With them and with the patch to passphrase.c it builds fine.
PS. for those who are interested they are in minires-devel package

@_subject: Scripts for importing data from PGP to GnuPG 
If anyone is interested I made two WSH scripts for importing some
data from PGP to GnuPG. First one is for importing ownertrust values. It is analog of lspgpot mentioned in FAQ, but it doesn't require bash and awk. Second is for importing groups, it requires commandline PGP to run. Both scripts require WSH version 5.6 to run. It is available by default in Windows XP and higher. For previous Windows versions update is available at Microsoft site.
File is here
SHA1 hash for it is
