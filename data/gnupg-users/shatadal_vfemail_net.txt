@_subject: Bad Signature (was Re: [Announce] Updated GnuPG 1.4.0 Windows 
It seems that your message was not signed correctly. I am using enigmail
with mozilla thunderbird and it prompts me to import public keys
required to verify signed messages. When I import your key however
enigmail complains of a bad signature. I have imported your key from
keyserver.kjsl.com and random.sks.keyserver.penguin.de and got the key
for wk with key id 0x5B0358A2. Interestingly enigmail asks for
key ID 0x010A57ED initially to verify the signature. Maybe the problem
is with enigmail. Could you help?

@_subject: Broken signatures with Thunderbird/Enigmail since 1.4.0? 
I use Enigmail 0.89.5.0 on Thunderbird version 1.0 (20041206) on Windows XP and gnupg 1.2.5
The command line used is
gpg.exe --batch --no-tty --status-fd2 --verify

@_subject: Implications of using insecure memory 
I am a new user of gnupg. I use gnupg on my windows laptop and linux desktop.
Thie first time I tried to run gpg on linux as a user I got the insecure memory
"gpg: WARNING: using insecure memory!"
On reading the faq I read
"On some systems (e.g., Windows) GnuPG does not lock memory pages and older
GnuPG versions (<=1.0.4) issue the warning:
gpg: Please note that you don't have secure memory
This warning can't be switched off by the above option because it was thought to
be too serious an issue. However, it confused users too much, so the warning
was eventually removed"
As a new user I want to know what are the implications of using gpg with
insecure memory in windows and linux, how serious are they and what steps can I
take to improve security? Does insecure memory mean that I should not use gpg
on sych systems?

Quoting Atom 'Smasher' :
I use windows. Does that mean that I should not use gpg on windows? Or should I
install some utility to wipe the disc swap space and use it every time after I
have used gpg? Could you point me to any program which does this?

Quoting "Shawn K. Quinn" :
Another poster also talked about getting rid of windows. However I do need to
run windows from time to time. Also I do not have root access on my linux
machine (it is used at work). So does that mean that gpg is not for me? Or is
there anything available which could erase the swap space anytime I want? I
just looked around in the M$ knowledgebase and it has a workaround to clear the
pagefile at shutdown. Is that a useful compromise?

@_subject: GnuPG and registry keys 
I got interested in this issue when I was trying out the
PortableThunderbird-Enigmail project
( When I started
it up I got the following message
"PortableThunderbird has detected the GNUPG key in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
PortableThunderbird writes values to the GNUPG key in HKEY_CURRENT_USER,
this allows non-admin users to use Portable Thunderbird with Enigmail/GPG.
Having the GNUPG key in both HKLM and HKCU may cause undesired behaviour.
Delete HKLM\Software\GNU\GNUPG and continue?"
When I checked my registry I saw that I do have both the keys. Could
this cause any problems in using GnuPG? I use GnuPG from a
non-administrator account.
