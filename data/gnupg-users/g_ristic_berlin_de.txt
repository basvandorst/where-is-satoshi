@_subject: keyservers and mutt 
I'm using gpg 1.0.1 in combination with the MUA mutt 1.0.1i.
AFAIK there can be specified keyservers in the .gnupg/options-file.
When I receive a signed mail, gpg tries to get the key from a server I
don't know. In fact this keyserver isn't configured in the
The keyserver gpg wants to request is  Where can I change this to one of the keyservers I specified?

@_subject: two keys - delete one 
During my tests with pgp/gpg I imported my old pgp-key.
gpg --list-keys shows me the list of known keys - inclusive the one I
want to remove. My problem is, I can't access the second one and
delete it.
The only possibility I found is to delete first my secret key, then
the public key, then the pgp-key.
After that I reimported my public key and the backup of my
secring.gpg. The pgp-key was removed, but I don't think this is the
right way to do ?-)

@_subject: cant import pgp secret keyring 
Hash: SHA1
I tried to import my old pgp key to my secret-keyring.
How can I do this?
The option  --secret-keyring secring.skr  doesn't seem to work. It causes me to type a message, not doing anything else.
Is there anything I forgot?
I'd like to use this old key, just for decripting old Mails.
Thanks.

Hi Jerome!
I already did (if you mean the handbook).
Sorry for causing traffic. It works now. Thanks!
