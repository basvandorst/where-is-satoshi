I'm trying to work with a correspondent's key (apparently generated by the
CryptoEx package) but it seems... weird.
It's on the keyservers under the ID 3A546EC2, but the ID actually appears to
be 7EDB7A47. However, the UIDs on that key are signed with 3A546EC2, a key
that apparently doesn't exist. In short, I'm confused. ;-)
I don't really know enough about the structure of keys to understand exactly
what's going on here, so I'd appreciate any explanation?
Kind regards,

I don't think it's a keyserver bug, as the same problem occurs if the key is
exported directly from the software and emailed to me.
As far as he's aware, his keyid is 3A546EC2. Certainly messages he sends out
are signed on 3A546EC2; but importing the key exported by his software and
available on keyservers as 3A546EC2 actually gets you 7EDB7A47, so the
signature is unverifiable.
