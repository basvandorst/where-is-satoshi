@_subject: gnupg on AIX 5.2 mpih-div.c:453: Can't find a register in class ` 
Rookie user here, quickly sinking in the quagmire of a go-live project.
While trying to do the Make of gnupg-1.2.6 I receive the following error
along with several other similar just different numbers:
mpih-div.c:453: Can't find a register in class `MQ_REGS' while reloading
Found a blurb on the web referring to AIX 4.3 telling me "Perhaps
--disable-asm would help.", but as a rookie, I don't know how to do this.  I
would also appreciate if you can help with this, you respond directly in
addition to the users list as I am not sure my subscription is set and that
I get the related emails.
