@_subject: import key to smart cards 
Hello eyeryone,
I?ve got a special question concerning GnuPG and smart card
My question is: How can I import a (sec-pub-)key which was
generated on a crypto stick (containing an integrated smart card)
into another crypto stick? A crypto stick like:
Normaly it should work by using the keytocard-command:
But in my case (and I guess I?m not the only one) the process can?t
conclude. See my example here:
office:~ home$ gpg2 --edit-key F4C8....

gpg: WARNING: such a key has already been stored on the card!
Replace existing key? (y/N) y
gpg: secret key is already stored on a card
The problem seems to be either that GnuPG blocks importing the key
because the key is already stored on another card. Or GnuPG ?things?
the key is already stored on the card on which I want to import the key.
Is there a way to work with a trick in order to ?persuade? GnuPG to do
that nevertheless (to allow the key-import). Does anyone know the trick?
A big thanks in advance
