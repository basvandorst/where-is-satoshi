@_subject: pinentry fails with gpg-agent for ssh, but works for gpg 
One option could be to add that snippet of code...
  gpg-connect-agent updatestartuptty /bye
to your /.bashrc/ (or equivalent) file. At the very least it might reduce the
number of times you would have to enter it manually.
Another option could be to create a script which calls gpg-connect-agent first
then calls SSH. Something like this:
$cat ~/bin/ssh
 bash
gpg-connect-agent updatestartuptty /bye &>/dev/null
