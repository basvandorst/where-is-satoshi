thnx, for your advice, the page is really good. now, I got one more
question - regarding the public key algorithms.
the web page is little bit outdated and also I didn't really get it. I
got the impression, that they favour DSS/DH [which is, I hope, the
same as the DSA in the gnupg]. but on the other hand, it's possible to
use only 1024bit [or when combined with the ElGamal - 2048bit] key.
for the RSA the key-lenght goes up to 16384bit.
is 1024[2048] future-proof? [comparing to a RSA4096 for example]
thnx for any advice

@_subject: Cipher in public key 
I'm playing around a little bit with gpgshell 2.60 and gnupg 1.2.1-1
[under win2k]
I've found something that is confusing me.
in Gpgshell, i use as cipher-algo - 3DES.
when creating the keys,,, I'm not asked about the cipher-algorithm.
however, if I take a look, at my public key in PGP 8.0, it refers to
my key as type: DH/DSS, which is right and then: cipher - AES-128.
how is the cipher-algorithm related to the key? [I thought it's
independent from the key]
why is it showing AES-128? is there a way to put there something else?
any hints appreciated.

@_subject: advapi32.dll 
hello gnupg-users,
after unpacking, the gnupg 1.2.1 on a win2k box into the
c:\program files\gnupg directory, the gpg.exe is:
gpg.exe - unable to locate dll
the dynamic link library ADVAPI32 could not be found in the specified
path bla bla bla
i'm not sure whether this is a gnugp problem, but can someone help me
with this?
path to gpg is set.
so is the path 2 advapi32.dll, as it's in the winnt\system32
it doesn't work even when the .dll is copied over to the gpg dir.
thnx in advance,,

@_subject: cypher algorithm - which one? 
are there any recommendations for any specific cypher algorithm?
can one make any assumption about they security? which one is safe,
which one is safer?
which one would u recommend? [encryption speed doesn't play any role].
any links to comparisons?
thnx in forward,
