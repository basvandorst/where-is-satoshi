@_subject: depreciated algorithm question 
Hello:  I downloaded gnupg 1.0.4 along with security patch1.diff.  I ran an
encryption and signature on a file and this message came up:
gpg: this cipher algorithm is depreciated; please use a more standard one!

P.S.  Just joined as I am sending this, so, be patient with me, and know I'll
run a search on the archives here real soon, as well.  :-)
