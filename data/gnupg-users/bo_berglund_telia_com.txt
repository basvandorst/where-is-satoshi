@_subject: gpg4win-1.0.4, possible to have multiple keys per user??? 
When trying out gpg4win-1.0.4 I tried to add my old keyring from my
use of PGP 7.0.3 to the GnuPG keyring. It seemed to work but when I
sent email to someone for whom I also have the new GnuPG key there is
an encryption error talking about not finding the key to the
recipient. But that is clearly wrong, the rescipient (and myself) have
multiple public keys on my keyring at this moment and GnuPG fails to
identify a single one of them...
After removing again the PGP 7.0.3 keys from the GnuPG keyring only
keeping the GnuPG keys I was able to send the message out.
I was working from within Outlook 2003 using the plugin that came with
Is there a setting in the keyring manager to allow multiple keys for
single email addresses such that the encryption adds *all* of them to
the message???
Also when some are old PGP 7.0.3 keys?

@_subject: [gpgol] plugin hides visibility of internet headers? 
I just installed gpg4win-1.0.4 with the gpgol plugin.
Now I wanted to check a message with the Outlook 2003 function "view
options" where I usually see the trace of the message transfer.
But now the options bottom pane is always empty also for non-encrypted
Is this caused by GPGOL or something else? I just noticed it after I
installed the gpg4win system....

@_subject: [gpgol] how to check if a message is encrypted or not? 
If I open a message in Outlook (using the GPGOL plugin) and I see the
PGP block then I can use the decrypt button to see the decrypted
message. I am requested to enter my passphrase first.
But when I then look at the next message it is automatically decrypted
for me without entering the passphrase and I don't see the PGP block
So how can I look through a number of messages to see which ones are
encrypted and which are not? As soon as the passphrase has been
entered once it seems completely transparent, all messages look alike
even those I *know* are encrypted!

@_subject: [gpgol] Swedish characters are mangled or disappear... 
I have now discovered a new problem with the OL plug-in...
It seems to not handle umlauted characters in the mail body very well.
I installed GPGOL from gpg4win-1.0.4 and I also have (on my laptop)
installed gpg4win-1.0.4 plus the enigmail plugin to Thunderbird.
Now for my tests concerning Swedish characters:
1. Written as html mail in Outlook2003
- When received by myself the ?????? characters display just fine.
- When received by another person with basically the same setup but
with the Windows locale set to US-English the Swedish characters are
replaced with jumbled characters (2 or 3, I don't recall).
2. Written as plaintext in Thunderbird
- When received in Thunderbird all looks good.
- When received with my own Outlook 2003 the Swedish characters are
simply gone (disappeared)
- I have no response from the US person yet....

You are right! When I explicitly set Thunderbird to encode UTF-8 then
the characters do not get mangled! Thanks :-)
By default Thunderbird seems to encode Western ISO 8859-1.
I have to look in the settings to see if I can set UTF-8 as the
default in Thunderbird.
I will also need to know where to set the character encoding default
in Outlook 2003 of course (probably a lot harder to circumvent
Microsofts Intelli(non)sense....)

Tried to find somewhere to set the default encoding in Thunderbird but
no matter what I do it still uses Western on a new message so I have
to remember always to manually set it to UTF-8.
What a drag!
Is there anyone here who knows Thunderbird on the Windows platform and
can tell me how to change the default encoding to UTF-8???

@_subject: [gpgol] Plugin handling of messages.... 
I am using the GPGol plugin from gpg4win-1.0.4.
While testing GPGol I have noticed a few strange phenomena as follows:
Message saved decrypted
As a variation to the above I did this:
1-2-3 as above
4) Now with decrypted message visible I hit the Reply button
5) I see my own cleartext mail signature and the message I am replying
to in a PGP block.
6) The encryption button is depressed indicating that the message will
be encrypted.
7) I add a bit of text and send the message out.
8) When I look at the message in my sent items folder it is *not*
encrypted, i.e. the original PGP block is there but the text I added
is not encrypted. The person I sent to also see my added text as
cleartext and his own original text as a PGP block.
It really looks like the existence of a PGP block *within* a larger
message that precedes the block with cleartext inhibits the encryption
on send. Maybe the plugin checks if the message is already encrypted
by checking for the existence of a PGP block?
Recipient with unknown public key causes Outlook crash
I tried to send a message for testing the reply issue where I included
one of my email addresses as recipient even though I have not
associated a public key to that address. I did this to really see what
was being sent.
But what happened was that when I clicked the send button GPGol popped
up a dialog where it told me that one recipient was not found
(expected). When I clicked OK it said that I should select a recipient
key first. So I did this but it still came back to the same message
(obviously there was no matching key). So I clicked cancel instead,
but this brought up a dioalogue telling me that if I cancel then the
message will be sent *unencrypted*!!!!
So now I could not use the OK button because of the missing key and
not use Cancel because the least I want is to send the message
So I used the X button in the upper right corner of the dialog
instead. This produced a message saying something like "bad
passphrase" and when I clicked OK on that Outlook2003 crashed and
offered to send a debug message to Microsoft!!!
Why did this happen?
The message should be encrypted and there are at least two keys to use
(the recipient and my own key). The fact that the Cc address was not
associated with a valid key is no excuse for not encrypting the
message, and there should *never* be a fallback to sending the message
in cleartext. :-(
Are there settings somewhere that I have missed for this?
I found the GPGol settings in the Outlok Tools/Options/GnuPG and I
have made sure that all the checkboxes are unchecked.
- Decryption of messages seem permanent at least for certain types
- Replies do not encrypt even though the encrypt button is activated
- Unacceptable handling when a recipient key is not known

@_subject: What does key properties validity and trust 'None' mean??? 
We are new to GPG and we have used gpg4win 1.0.5 to install the
programs on Windows XP Pro PC:s. Some years ago we used PGP 7, but now
it turns out that we cannot get it to work on our XP-Pro PC:s so we
are trying GPG instead.
But we are facing a problem when we keys and export our public keys.
When we import the resulting ASC file from others into WinPT by
drag-drop it looks like it succeeds, but when the key has reached the
window we see that the validity and trust columns show up as None!
What can we do to change this? Our own keys are Ultimate both in trust
and validity, yet the public keys seem to lose this, why?
In one case I have validity=Full but trust=None and I don't know why
this happened....
Can someone please explain what we are doing wrong here?
Is there another step after generating a key pair or after exporting
the public key to make it valid and trusted?
Or is this done by the other side (the one importing the public key)?

No, I was referring to PGP7 just to indicate that I have been using
encryption before even though I am new to GnuPG. The old PGP keys are
not the issue (yet).
But your answer cleared the handling for me. In short these are the
1. Create a key pair in GPG
2. Export your public key to an asc file
3. Hand this over to a person you want to communicate with
4. He imports the key into WinPT by drag-drop
   Now both Validity and Trust are 'None'
5. Next he selects the key and uses Key/Sign to sign the key
   At this stage the Validity switches to 'Full' but Trust is None
6. Finally he opens the key properties and changes "Ownertrust"
   This can be changedto something like Ultimate or Full
Now the key is fully trusted and valid, I guess.
PGP7 compatibility
I was already able to import my old PGP keys into GnuPG (WinRT) so I
could read my old encrypted emails from a few years back through
I found one strange glitch though, old emails containing Swedish
characters decrypt to cleartext but are missing the Swedish chars. So
the words look really strange when there are supposed to be one of
?????? there, these are simply gone....

We can't do this since the licensing for freeware states it is for
non-commercial use and we want to use it also for the company.
Actually 7.0.3 also had this license condition so we could not use
that either. And Microsoft has put in stops on installing PGP 7.0.3 in
the Windows XP-Pro operating system, I believe from SP2...
Last fall I managed to install 7.0.3 on my XP-Pro PC after tricking
the WinXP detection of the setup.exe files it won't accept.
It worked just fine but then I did not use it for a while. Meanwhile
there were a bunch of Windows updates installed and finally when I was
going to test it again recently it caused Outlook2003 to just bomb out
with a message talking about notifying Microsoft of the error. :-(
So I guess Microsoft has put in more stops on the use of PGP 7.0.3 in
Windows XP-Pro. And due to the licensing we decided to look for other
solutions. That's how we found GnuPG.
I have done this and it works. But that was not the gist of my
problem, it deals with adding public keys from persons who just
installed GnuPG and created new key pairs.
I learned here now that we have to:
- Import the key into WinPT (Trust and Validity is now None)
- Sign the key (Validity is now Full)
- Change ownertrust to Full (only possible for a signed key)
We did not know about the two last steps and this is the reason for my

On Fri, 25 Aug 2006 02:50:15 -0500, John Clizbe In order to get GPG to work I had to sign the received keys myself.
Now I am wondering if maybe the procedure is wrong, maybe we should
sign our own public keys when they have been stored in the ASC file
instead? Will WinPT recognize this and set the Validity flag?

I have a number of encrypted files, which I need to decrypt. I have
installed GPG 1.4.9 on my Windows XP-Pro SP3 PC. I have the necessary
keyrings and they work with Thunderbird and Enigmail.
But as I said I need to decrypt files that are on my hard disk, not in
an email....
I tried this command in a command window:
 gpg -d I got a prompt for my passphrase and as soon as I entered this the
window filled with large amounts of strange characters and the PC
speaker started to beep and never would stop.
I finally had to use ProcessExplorer and kill the cmd process to get
silence. :-(
What is the correct procedure to decrypt a file thta has been
encrypted with my public key?
And is there no way to use some kind of GUI tool to do this so the
masses of option codes are automatically used?

This worked but is not mentioned in the help (gpg -h) at all even
though it seems to be the most important command one needs in order to
use GPG... (hint, hint)
I tried installing gpg4win last week on my PC but had to uninstall it
afterwards because it invaded my Outlook 2003 to such an extent that
it became unusable for normal email use. :-(
So I had to revert to installing GPG instead and then I don't have any
integration with Outlook anymore so I have to start using Thunderbird
for encrypted correspondence (with Enigmail). Sigh....
Funnily I only found GPG 1.4.9 on the GnuPG site even though Gpg4Win
came with some version 2.0.x, why is this?
And might my problems with Gpg4Win stem from its use of a GPG ver 2
Several years ago I had installed a Gpg4Win on a PC, which integrated
OK with Outlook, not at all like the one I found last week.
I also seem to recall that back a few years there was a piece of
software that after installation offered a rightclick menu item in
Windows Explorer for encrypting/decrypting a file depending on the
file type clicked on. If it was an ASC file it offered decrypt and
otherwise encrypt.
But I have failed to find such software now. Maybe I am only dreaming
or possibly it was part of PGP7, which I used at one time?

I found GPGShell and tried it but it did not offer a context menu in
Windows Explorer just a rather strange regular program window which is
not intuitive to use for a Windows user at least. It starts up with a
list of the keyring, which is of little use, and no file browser.
Not what I was looking for...
But I finally found it, it is called GPGee and it gives me a Windows
Explorer pop-up menu entry for Verify/Decrypt if I click on an ASC
file and Sign/Encrypt alternatives if I click another file type.
Just what I remembered!
The problem here is that the top Google result for gpgee is softpedia
and their download link is broken. But I got it from here:

@_subject: How do I use gpg to decrypt encrypted files???? (0/1) 
On Thu, 10 Sep 2009 01:08:18 -0400, Faramir So I have installed both GPGShell and GPGee and all I see in my
Windows Explorer shell is GPGee.
How can I make GPGShell appear?
And how does it look like?
I attach two screenshots showing my context menu when selecting an ASC
file and a regular file. Can't see GPGShell....
