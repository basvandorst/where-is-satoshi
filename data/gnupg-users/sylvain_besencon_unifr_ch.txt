@_subject: anthropological research on OpenPGP 
Dear Daniel Kahn Gillmor,
My name is Sylvain Besen?on, I am an anthropologist from the university
of Fribourg, Switzerland, and I am doing a research for my PhD on the
maintenance work of OpenPGP implementations, not from a technical point
of view but rather from a socio-historical perspective. My objectives
are, on the one hand, to collect information about the history of
OpenPGP (from the very early days up to now), and on the second hand, to
document the maintenance work that is done to keep the protocol and its
implementations secure. However, my interest for OpenPGP goes beyond my
sole academic papers: I love crypto, I love open source and I love
easy-to-use privacy enhancing technologies. This is why I would love to
be able to modestly contribute to this by bringing what I can do, namely
socio-anthropological analyses to document the community effort to
securely deploy such technologies.
I have seen that you are quite active on the mailing list of GnuPG-users
which is where I had your email address, and I was wondering if you
would agree to help me in my research by answering a few questions
during an interview (per video con, phone call or merely email).
I also saw that you participate at the IETF and I was wondering if you
will go to Montreal for the 150th IETF meeting in a few weeks? I might
also be able to come and that would be fantastic to meet you in person
I look forward to hearing from you,
Kind regards,

Oh no!! I'm terrible, I have just discovered that I have sent this mail
to the whole mailing list. Sorry to all of you for the inconvenience...
However, this might also be an opportunity for me to send my call to the
whole community.

Anyone interested to help me doing this research are of course more than
welcome! I would be definitely very happy if you would have time to
share your experience and ideas with me, specially on the history of
OpenPGP, the maintenance work that you do to maintain it secure, and
some important controversies. Please, write me in private so that we do
not disturb more the mailing list!...
Again, sorry for having sent this email to everybody...

In the FAQ, it is written:
So, I guess the key size is not the only criteria to evaluate the strength of a cipher and ECC still provides better results despite shorter keys.
However, I would be interested to know which ECC cipher would you recommend to replace RSA. I am not a cryptographer and I don't find any information (or more honestly: information that I can understand) about Curve 25519, NIST P-256 (and greater), Brainpool, or secp256k1.
Thanks for the feedback,

Thank you all for your quick answers, it is very useful!
RJH's answer sounds like a good piece of advice, but still, at the end, we HAVE to to choose which algorithm to use when creating new key pairs. This doesn't prevent me to (try to) be cautious about the general health of my system.
Grzegorz's points convince me to give a try to Curve 25519. I have another though:
I am not sure to fully grasp the consequences of this... Does that mean that, if I use Curve 25519, some people won't be able to use my public key to encrypt stuff? Or does that mean that some people won't be able to read or verify stuff that I encrypt and signs?
Would it be because they use older versions or because some software programs don't implement Curve 25519?
I guess that Curve 25519 is mentioned in the IETF standard, isn't it?
Many thanks,

Thanks for the demonstration!
At least, I will now know what I am doing when I'll use the defaults! :)

Thanks a lot for all these explanations. It's very useful and instructive. I appreciate your patience towards my dummy questions..! :)
