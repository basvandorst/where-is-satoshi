I can confirm the exact same problem when running under Mac 10.6.7.

It may also be worthwhile listing it on Biglumber.com.
When I see the state of the entries on big lumber (I've contacted
everyone whose in London , and 75% of the email addresses didn't work) -
I'm pretty sure it won't help.
Biglumber has been essentially abandoned by its developer and has been completely unmaintained for several years. It was a wonderful service when it was maintained. Now I think it would be better for it to be removed, but the developer stopped responding to inquiries long ago.
