@_subject: GnuPG Win Patch File Installation Help 
I'm a new user to GnuPG. I just installed GnuPG 1.4.9. I see there is also a Patch File 'gnupg-1.4.8-1.4.9.diff.bz2' with this release that needs to be installed but I cannot find any information on how to do this.
Can someone provide the correct procedures to install this Patch File?
Thanks in advance!

As a new user to GnuPG 1.4.9 I'm not having a good day with the?product. When importing a key, I receive a 'Permission denied' during the pubring renaming process. Log follows.
Any help would be appreciated.
Thank you.
