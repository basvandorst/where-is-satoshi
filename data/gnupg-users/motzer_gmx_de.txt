@_subject: encryption to multiple recipients 
I strongly miss an option for gpg (version 1.2.1) to encrypt to several
recipients using key-IDs. I spend some time trying to figure it out,
done some testing, but I'm left clueless.
I'm using Mutt to take part in an encrypted mailing list. But because
there's no master key for the list, each member has his own key. So I decided to use the simplest way, applying this keyword to .muttrc
pgp-hook encrypted "keyID1 keyID2 keyID3"
but it does not work. Any hints or ideas, how I could solve the problem?

well, the problem was that i found exactly nothing about a group command in my docs.
where the heck is that command explained??
in the meantime i got it working via --options the contents of :
remote-user keyID1
remote-user keyID2
