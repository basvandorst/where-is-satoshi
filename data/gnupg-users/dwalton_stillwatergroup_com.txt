@_subject: Permissions Issue Executing .bat file to Encrypt File 
I have created a VB script to encrypt a file using a recipient key.  The
file encrypts, when I can execute the VB script manually as Administrator
but when scheduling the execution of the VB script (via .bat file) as
Administrator, using Scheduled Tasks, the encryption does not occur. Any insight would be appreciated!

Hello All,
I was able to get the scheduled process to work but only as Administrator.
This needs to be run as a different user.  I know it must be a permissions
Thanks in advance.
