regarding to 5.5) Why is PGP 5.x not able to verify my messages?
PGP 5.x does not accept V4 signatures for data material but OpenPGP
requires generation of V4 signatures for all kind of data. Use the
option "--force-v3-sigs" to generate V3 signatures for data.
i've had the same problem today (incompatibility of pgp 7.0.2 and gnupg 1.0.5) and solved it this way. so it seems that the fault is not on your side (as you are using v3 signatures). just tell the other company to use the '--force-v3-sigs' or put 'force-v3-sigs' in their option-file.

yes, on the gpg-side, as this side is 'more advanced' ;-)

already mentioned above
hope this helps

@_subject: no connection to keyservers 
i'm using gpg 1.0.5 on win2k behind a gateway (running winroute).
everytime i try 'gpg --keyserver search.keyserver.net --send-key [any uid]' i get:
 > gpg: write failed: ec=87
 > gpg: can't connect to 'search.keyserver.net': No error
the same with '--recv-key':
 > gpg: requesting key [any uid] from search.keyserver.net ...
 > gpg: write failed: ec=87
 > gpg: can't get key from keyserver: No error
i've already tried this with several other keyservers and always have got the same response.
there isn't any problem with the internet connection as i can ping 'searchkeyserver.net' and all other internet-clients are working properly.
does anyone know, what 'ec=87' means? i didn't find any information anywhere.
