@_subject: Import *.p12 Keys into GnuPG fails 
I am trying to use GnuPG with my signed keypair. This I have only   in the P12-format.
The call
   gpg --import file.p12
results in an error message:
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: Total number processed: 0
How can I convert the P12-format into OpenPGP?
Thank you very much for your help.
