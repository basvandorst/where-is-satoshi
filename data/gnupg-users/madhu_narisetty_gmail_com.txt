@_subject: GPG 2.1.0 Compatibility Metrix(Solaris/Linux/HP Unix) and Installation 
Hello Team,
Can someone let me know the GPG 2.1.0 compatibility Metrix for
Unix(Solaris/Linux/HP Unix).
Also, I would require installation binaries and steps on Solaris / Linux
and HP UX systems.
Any kind of help would be appreciated.
Venu Madhav
