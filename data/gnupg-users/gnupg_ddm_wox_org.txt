@_subject: Problem exporting secret keys 
It can't find the key on your secret ring with the information you've
used (my_name).  Possible reasons include a) typo in {my_name} b) you
don't have the secret key c) the --secret-keyring option is set wrong.
I'd recommend doing "gpg --list-secret-keys", that will verify that
GnuPG is finding the secret keyring.  I'd then use the appropriate keyid
from that list as the argument to --export-secret-keys.  I find it best
to specify keys by keyid for such commands to avoid possible issues with
non-unique user names (I have a couple older keys with the same e-mail
address and name).
Alternatively you can use --export-secret-keys without arguments to
export the entire secret keyring.

@_subject: Automatic resyncing of keys? 
As seen in the archives this is my prefered method which has many
advantages over the above suggestion:
gpg --with-colons --fast-list-mode --list-keys \
 awk -F: '$1=3D=3D"pub" {print $5}' \
 sort -u | xargs -n 20 gpg --recv-keys
