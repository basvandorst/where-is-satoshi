I'm interested in this also. I've got Borland C++ Builder 5.5 under Windows XP.

Any idea when someone will post a pre-compiled 1.0.7 win32 binary on the website?

Thanks for the info. I'll wait for stable 1.2, if you think that'll have win32
binaries also. Or, i could bite the bullet, dedicate a saturday, and compile
1.0.7 myself :-)

Just curious, but what's the entire idea behind Cygwin? Can you compile unix apps inside its environment then use them externally in windows like any other program? Or is it a fully self-contained environment and the programs you compile you have to run inside Cygwin?

I'm trying to get a public key from a server, and here's the output I
get. What's going on?
gpg: requesting key 56E226B8 from  ...
gpg: write failed: ec=87
gpg: can't get key from keyserver: No such file or directory

@_subject: Win32 Binaries 
Hash: SHA1
On gnupg.org, I see that the latest version to offer a win32 binary is
1.0.6. On nullify.org, however, they offer win32 binaries for 1.0.7 and
1.1.9.0. Are these official releases? Can I install these and still be
confident I got "true" gnupg? What is 1.1.9.0 if 1.0.7 is latest?
Thanks for the help.
