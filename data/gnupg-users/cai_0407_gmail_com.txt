I have already tested APG 1.0.8 with Android 2.1 on Xperia SO-01B (X10
family in Japan).
1. can import keys with subkeys.
2. can not verify email signed by my self-signed key with
3. ignores the encoding (always uses iso-8859-1).
4. does not support CAMELLIA.
5. has no integration with gmail app on 2.1.

I think that the situation of Camellia in Japan is similar to that of AES in US
or SEED in North Korea.
Camellia is developed by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone and Mitsubishi Electric
(both are Japanese companies), and included in "Japan e-Government Recommended
Ciphers List" by CRYPTREC (Cryptography Research and Evaluation Committees, Japan).
Of course, Japanese people can use AES and any other ciphers, however, Japan
Government and some Japanese people may prefer Camellia than AES (as I set key
pref to "CAMELLIA256 AES256 CAMELLIA192 AES192 CAMELLIA128 AES CAST5").
Camellia is also recommended by NESSIE in EU, and supported by TLS/SSL (RFC
4132, 5932, 6367), S/MIME (RFC 3657), IPSec (RFC 4132, 5529), etc.

Hi Will,
Which version of GnuPG (ligcrypt) and OS are you using?
As far as I know, only GnuPG 2.0.x on x86 environments supports AES-NI.
1. GnuPG 1.4.x or lower does not support AES-NI at all.
2. GnuPG 2.0.x with ligcrypt 1.5.0 and above supports AES-NI on x86 environments.
3. GnuPG 2.0.x on x86-64
Ligcrypt 1.5 branch does not support AES-NI yet on x86-64 environments.
Support of AES-NI on x86-64 has been implemented to ligcrypt master[1], but not
backported to current 1.5 branch[2].

@_subject: Fwd: [Enigmail] [ANN] Enigmail v1.7 available 
Thunderbird 3.1.20 was released in March 2012. There are more than 200
security vulnerabilities fixed after release of 3.1.20...
The last version compatible with Thunderbird 3.1.20 is Enigmail 1.1.2,
released in June 2010.
Current Enigmail 1.7 supports only Thunderbird 31 and 24.
I strongly recommend you to upgrade at least to Thunderbird 24.7.0 and
Enigmail 1.7.

There are mailing lists and support forums in English and German.
Eniglish ones are more active than German ones.

Same issue with gpg 2.1.22 on Win7 x64.
I've tried search, send-keys and recv-keys commands but all failed with
"Resource temporarily unavailable" messages.
gpg 2.1.21 works fine.
