I have a key that will be imported into a system with no real-time clock.  On that machine, the system time gets set to the Epoch at startup, thus the key always looks as though it was created "1169836499 seconds in the future".
Is there a way to tell gpg on the target system to ignore the future time concerns with the key?  I keep getting this:
# gpg --verify --quiet --ignore-time-conflict --ignore-valid-from --batch --no-tty foo.gpg > foo
gpg: Signature made Sun Jan 28 05:07:57 2007 UTC using DSA key ID A7E0150C
gpg: key A7E0150C was created 1169836499 seconds in the future (time warp or clock problem)
gpg: key A7E0150C was created 1169836499 seconds in the future (time warp or clock problem)

gpg: key A7E0150C was created 1169836496 seconds in the future (time warp or clock problem)
gpg: key A7E0150C was created 1169836496 seconds in the future (time warp or clock problem)

gpg: Good signature from "Bill Gatliff "
Here's the output from --list-keys:

A lot of Googling and reading the manpage seems to suggest that the two --ignore- parameters should get me what I'm after, but it doesn't seem to be the case.  In particular, I don't want to have to press a key when the warnings are emitted, because this will be an unattended operation.
What am I missing?

Agreed.  The key was generated on a machine that does have a clock.  The signature is done on a machine with a clock.  The machine without the clock just has to verify.
Ok.  Then I _really_ don't understand why it pauses and waits for a
