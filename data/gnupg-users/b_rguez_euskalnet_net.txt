@_subject: problems on WINxp 
I have benn working with gpg on win 98 and winXP without problems
until yesterday. I have reinstalled the winXP and now the gpg donesn0t
This is the error message:
"gpg.exe is not know like an internal or external command, programme
or executable bat file." (this is a traslation from spanish)
I supose that is a problem with the enviroment variable or the
registry but I have checked these two and nothing seems to be wrong.
Any idea??
