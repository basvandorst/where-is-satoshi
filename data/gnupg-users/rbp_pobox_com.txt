@_subject: New UK crypto law and an idea on how to defeat it 
(I'm not familiar with UK crypto laws, except for what I read on the
        Does the bill state that it won't be used against the average person
on the street, but only for organised crima and pedophile? If it does, it
requires proof of the crime before it can be used, which would make it less
than necessary (useful, maybe, in some cases).
        If it doesn't (which I believe is the case), then how can we
possibly know? We can trust law enforcement, at the most. But that's not
something I imagine "crypto-aware" people would do in good will...
        In short, that's what they say, not necessarily what they'll do. We
shouldn't depend on that when divising means to protect our privacy.

Hi, Sean :)
        Educating people is a very subjective measure. People in power may
never be educated. They may be and still use their power to their own
accord. In any case, I'm not willing to take a chance. Unless they're not
legally and objectively restricted as to what they can demand from me, I
don't trust they'll take the right attitude.
        Definetely, so would I. Unless "showing I have nothing to hide"
includes invading my privacy (or, in this case, giving my private encryption
keys away). That's my point: law enforcement officials should have their
rights very well defined. Any officer can come up with a "suspicion of
ilegal activities". Do you like Monty Python?
        - There's a paper bag I have found on the premises! I must
confiscate it and take it for clinical examination!
        - Wait a minute! You just took that out of your pocket!
        Get the idea?
        If they want to have the right to demand encryption private keys
(whici I oppose to, for the very reason that moves our discussion on this
subject), the same law should clearly state the cases where this applies. It
shouldn't be left for future consideration. I have seen too many cases of
police abuse not to distrust the people with the badge...

Duct tape is like the Force: it has a dark side and a light side,
and it holds the Universe together.
