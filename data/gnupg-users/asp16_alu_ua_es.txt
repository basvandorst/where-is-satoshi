    FYI you are sending mail with charset=X-UNKNOWN and users of other
    charsets other than ISO-8859-1 will see ?sch\366n? instead of
    ?sch?n?.
    Cheers.

    I have myself Aegypten working on Debian, and I know for sure many
    other people do too. While some packages are already in official
    Debian repositories (libgcrypt, libgpgme, cryptplug), others are
    still "on the way". For these, I know at least one repository in
    which they can be found, and sure there'll be others. This is from a
    Spanish LUG member:
        deb  ./
    However, and IIRC, they are compiled for sid, so if you use woody
    you'll have to search for another repo.
    HTH.

    Yes, I've been told that the University in which the machine is
    hosted currently has its network down. Surely, it'll be fixed ASAP.
    It's a very active LUG too!
