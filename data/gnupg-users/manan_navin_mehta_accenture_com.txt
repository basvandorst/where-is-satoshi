Additional details on the trail mail....kindly look into the same.
It errors out even when creating a key :

Hi Werner/GnuPG Team,
Need your expert advice/suggestions..!!
After upgrading the Compiler and having all the required Lib files, it seems that GnuPG has been installed, PFB excerpt from the log which we got after triggering below command:
Also, PFA "config.log" which automatically gets generated and "GnuPG_log" which has logs copied from screen after running below command.
Request you to look into it and check whether GnuPG has been installed correctly or not and kindly also let us know if any post steps are required..
Command used: ./configure; make; make install
        GnuPG v2.0.27 has been configured as follows:
        Revision:  8d47e6e  (36167)

        Smartcard: yes (without internal CCID driver)
        Gpgtar:    no

Hi Werner,
Thanks for your reply.
Sure, we will check with our Unix team for the availability of the C compiler and get it installed.
Request you to address one more query:
? As you have mentioned in the trail mail that "You need to have a compiler and all related tools (the toolchain) to build software" , can you please give more details on "toolchain" ?
What all other tools will be required (other than installing C compiler) for successful installation of GnuPG software.
Thanks again :)

@_subject: Facing issue while installing GnuPG 2.0.27 on AIX 7.1 
Hi Team,
We are trying to install GnuPG 2.0.27 in our SAP ECC systems.
Below are the OS level details:
[cid:image006.png at 01D09EBE.3BD6EBA0]
We have downloaded the GnuPG 2.0.27 software and started with the installation with root user.
Initially we fired below command and got below output:
./configure; make; make install
[cid:image001.png at 01D09EBC.C8081EC0]
After getting above output we tried with the below command:
./configure CC=c99 CFLAGS=-g LIBS=-lposix
[cid:image002.png at 01D09EBC.C8081EC0]
But still we are facing Error as C compiler cannot create executables
Checked the Integrity:
[cid:image004.png at 01D09EBD.1D8000C0]
Also, we tried to check C compiler in our system with below command:
[cid:image005.png at 01D09EBD.7E992E40]
Kindly let us know the path forward.
Herewith I am attaching "config.log" for your ready reference.
Please let us know if you need any further details.
If you have 24X7 support help line number then kindly share the details.
