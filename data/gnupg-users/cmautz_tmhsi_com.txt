Hello all,
I have a question.  We upgraded from PGP 7.0.1 to GnuPG 1.2.2, and have been
experiencing a problem.
In PGP, we'd execute the command:
c:\pgp -o file file.pgp
And receive the following:
Where PGP would decrypt 3 files, and increment their filenames
automatically.  GPG 1.2.2 decrypts the first file and then fails on a bad packet error.  So
when we execute:
c:\gpg -o file file.pgp
we get:
and miss file1 and file2.
I've searched the docs but don't see a switch for decrypting multiple files
from a single PGP encrypted file.  The only difference b/w the PGP and GnuPG
that I'm doing is that I removed the passphrase from GPG, which wasn't
really required (as far as I knew).  It was only required by that version of
PGP that we were using.
Single PGP encrypted files decrypt with both products all the time, without
Can anybody point me in the right direction?  Everybody is pointing to the
fact that we're using an opensource product instead of a commercial PGP
product, but I don't buy that.  There's got to be a way to do this.
