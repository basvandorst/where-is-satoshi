@_subject: Scute and SmartCard insertion/removal in Firefox 
If you have a web server *and* a client where you can control the
session cache and initiate a re-negotiation, Firefox will try to look
at your token again.
At least this was the case a while ago.

@_subject: emulating smartcard with Nexus 5 
You need to emulate an OpenPGP via Host Card Emulation.
You can get necessary parts from here:
1. OpenPGP applet. Try this: or This: 2. Emulator for running the applet code in Android:
I have some code that did exactly that but was not published because
of some technical limitation not related to possible software only
OpenPGP: If you are capable of creating Android software with a GUI, I could
help with the non-Android-GUI issues.

@_subject: Please remove MacGPG from gnupg.org due to serious security 
Not sure about overall GnuPG affection with Apple or other closed
source software, but the PC/SC layer in Yosemite is broken (again):
Generally speaking, I think the GPGTools folks care about "usage for
dumbusers" which means making stuff Work(tm) for the not-so-powerusers
on a not-so-great platform. It is the users's choice to use OSX (not
Linux), the same way it is their choice to use Mail.app (not Enigmail)
the same way it is their choice to use a simple to use binary
installer with crappy build machinery instead of verifying the
checksums of every download.
GnuPG just got a huge sum of money, I'm sure arrangements can be made
to allocate some of that for a easy to use and *free* OSX version with
an integrated GUI ?
Because that site is run by Tender and if you connect to the https
version, you get their site? Probably makes sense to bug Tender with
So, generally speaking: if the upstream has not catered to the OSX
folks and somebody on the internet has, I would not blame GPGTools
guys for doing it. Yes, it would be nice if one at least tried to
contribute back to upstream and to work in an open manner, but at
least they DO something, for what there is apparent need.
