@_subject: Looking for a decrypting script 
I'm fairly new to gpg, but I would like to be able to append to a file, encrypted
messages, like so:
 I can generate the files without much problem, but don't know how to decrypt it.
Encrypted File would look like something like this:
I would like some type of script where I could read this file in and output each record
that was encrypted, the decryption will be in a secure place, but I don't know of anyway
to accomplish this. I would like to write the output to a file or stdout for final
Anyone have any suggestions on how this could be done, or is it even feasible?

Thanks for the replies, I've got all the modules downloaded and installed, the
pgpenvelope_decrypt works great. But for the life of me I can't figure out how
to pass the passphrase in, I'm prompted for the passphrase at every encrypted
Any help would be appreciated, even if it's embedded in the program would be
ok for now, I would really like to enter it for the first time and it be
remembered from that point on, but either way would be ok for now. Sorry I'm
such a dunce, but believe me I have tried, but it's just not working for me.
