Hushmail started out being a "roaming service" for encrypting and decrypting e-mail, meaning that you could use it from any PC that could run the hushmail Java applet (via a browser for
instance).  You didn't need to carry your key with you (in a smart card or a diskette) since you could always download it from their server (the key is encrypted with a key derived
from a passphrase the user chooses).
This is the unique feature they have to offer (the roaming), I guess they are just continuing in the same vein.

It is standard practice in cryptography engineering to sign before you
and not do the opposite (encrypt before you sign).  This "principal" should
followed especially if you want the property of non-repudiation.
The thing is that if Alice first encrypts the message under Bob's public
Alice has no control over how Bob's public key was created, and Bob could
later on change his public key in a way that the ciphertext Alice signed
to a different message, thus if Alice signs the ciphertext you cannot assume
that Alice has any knowledge of the data she actually signed.
See principal number 1 of Ross Anderson's paper "Robustness principles
for public key protocols"

@_subject: ZLIB vulnerability 
Hi all,
this has maybe already been discussed here, but I haven't seen any mention
of it on A colleague of mine pointed out to me that there is a security vulnerability
with zlib version < 1.1.4.
GnuPG 1.0.6 uses zlib version 1.1.3, so there is a security risk.
They suggested replacing older versions of zlib with zlib version 1.1.4,
I would suggest a new version of GnuPG that comes with zlib v 1.1.4.

I happen to compile GnuPG under Windows (using Cygwin) where
I don't have a system zlib, so it uses the one that comes with gnupg.
The latest version of gnupg, 1.0.6, comes with zlib version 1.1.3
(which has the vulnerability).  So I replaced the zlib library with
zlib version 1.1.4 and recompiled my gnupg.
