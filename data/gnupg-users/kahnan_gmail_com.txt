yes sir it is LISP S-expressions....it's a canonical formate. open pgp has
it's own formate of keys and message and I want to convert this to sexp
format which is supported by libgcrypt protocol ..
any way apart from this if you know any auther solution for key management +
cryptolib then please explore.

Hi every one,
Do any one know about this problam:
GPG-ME crash after 246 data decryption, There is no problem in encryption.
the error is : no data
I am feeling that there is some memory issue which gpgme could not handle.
