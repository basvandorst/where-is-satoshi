Apologies if this has already been asked.  Honestly, I did my homework and
looked in the archives!
I am wanting to setup up users to use GnuPG for encrypting email, mainly for
internal e-mail.
Unfortunately, the "powers-that-be" want everyone that encrypts an email to
also encrypt it to the "corporate secret key".  Their reasoning is that if a
person leaves, they want to have access to the old emails in case there is a
"business critical" email in there.
Is there a way to "force" users to encrypt to a corporate key, in addition
to the receipient's key?

I guess what we are wanting is for every mail user to have their own
public/private key.  This way they can encrypt their own email on the
corporate system.
In addition, every email would also be encrypted using the "corporate key"
that would be in the hands of a select few (supposedly).
For example, the sales force can send encrypted mail to each other, but when
a salesperson leaves the company, the Email Admin can retreive and decrypt
the email so that the salesperson's replacement can pick up their accounts
without too much disruption.
Looks like this is ADK.  Is there any way to do this on gpg?
