the NEWS file: "Twofish and MDC enhanced encryption is now used.  PGP 7
supports this.  Older versions of GnuPG don't support it, so they should
be upgraded to at least 1.0.2"
this was mentioned a few times bewfore on the list -> search the archive;
as far as I recall either you upgrade all GnuPGs or you don't use the
Twofish algorithm (per gnupg options)

I don't know very much about PGP, but what I know is that you encrypt a
message with *their* public key. That's why they have no problem
decrypting it (with their private key).
But you do sign your message with your private key and your
correspondents check it with your public key. So something is wrong with
either your public key/private key/signing method or their checking
I have seen this before. A friend emailed me his public key (using Mutt
1.0pre3i) and signed it (the email). After importing his key gnupg said
the self-sigs of the key are good but then my Mutt (1.0.1i) said the
signature of the mail is BAD.
The emails he has send me since all have a good signature. I can't
figure out what the problem is with that mail.
Maybe someone else has an idea?
I have exactly the same.
p.s. I'm using gnupg for 5 days now so please forgive and correct any
mistakes I made.

describes how to patch te kernel and use an encrypted filesystem
I have Linux kernel 2.2.18 and everything works well for me (there ARE
problems, but I don't use the stuff that's not working... :-)
if it is mounted all the time, there will be no difference...

@_subject: Beginner's Q: How to change the location of my keyrings? 
* Thus spake shang [2001-03-01]:
Either change the Home Directory:
--homedir directory
  Set  the name of the home directory to directory If this option is not
  used it defaults to "~/.gnupg".  It does not make sense to use this in
  a options file. This also overrides the envi- ronment variable
  "GNUPGHOME".
or do other things:
--keyring file
  Add file to  the  list  of  keyrings.   If  file begins with a tilde
  and a slash, these are replaced by the HOME directory. If the filename
  does not contain a slash, it is assumed to be in the home-directory
  ("~/.gnupg" if --homedir is not used).  The filename may be prefixed
  with a scheme:
  "gnupg-ring:" is the default one.
  "gnupg-gdbm:" may be used for a GDBM ring.  Note that GDBM is
  experimental and likely to be removed in future versions.
  It might make sense  to  use  it  together  with --no-default-keyring.
--secret-keyring file
  Same as --keyring but for the secaret keyrings.
That stuff is taken out of the man page for gpg under linux. The Windows
port of GnuPG should have a doc somewhere with the same stuff in it.

Try "mkdir /home/username/.gnupg", GnuPG 1.0.4 does not automatically
make that directory.

@_subject: procmail recipe wanted: clearsigned -> detached signed mail 
a while ago (a year or so, maybe even on another ML, I'd be sorry for
that :), in one of those clearsigned vs. detached/MIME-signed e-mail
discussions, I read about a procmail recipe that rewrote a clearsigned
e-mail in a MIME-message with a detached signature. At the time, I
did not have the possibility to use procmail, but now..
Did I just dream of this, or is there really something like it? Can
somebody point me somewhere?
