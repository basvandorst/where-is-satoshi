Hello Andrew Glinwood,
The security tab located in 'Options' is for S/MIME only. To use GnuPG
with Outlook, I believe you will have to use either GPGShell/GPGTray or

@_subject: Why you should not use PGP 
Hello Per Tunedal,
You cannot be serious in suggesting that GPGRelay is a better GUI for
Windows than PGPTray. I realise that you like to bash PGP on this List,
but suggesting GPGRelay is superior to PGPTray is utter nonsense.

Hello karthikn,
No, I can't see that as a passphrase problem at all. When you exported
from PGP, did you make sure and check the "Include Private Key" box in
PGPKeys? What are you using for a front-end to GPG?

Daniel Monjar,
Clueless newbies???  Good heaven's man!! Go grab a cup of coffee or
something. It's people like yourself that make it difficult to attract
new Users to GPG/PGP. Statements like that do more harm to this movement
than anything else I can think of.

@_subject: v4 Signature Clarification Needed 
Could someone kindly comment on the following:
"OpenPGP states that an implementation should generate v4 signatures,
but PGP 5.x recognizes v4 signatures only on key material. This option
forces v3 signatures on data as well."
Specifically, I'm having trouble grasping the concept of 'data' versus
'key material'. Are they saying that PGP 5.x recognises a v4 signature
on a Key for instance, but will not recognise that same signature if
used to clearsign a message? Can someone provide an example of each so I
can better understand the difference between a v3 and v4 signature?
Thanks for your help.

@_subject: Error Message: Encrypted Session Key is Bad ?? 
A friend and I had been exchanging a few encrypted messages the other day,
and he was unable to decrypt one of the first messages I had sent,
receiving the error message that the "Encrypted Session Key is Bad". So,
I re-sent the message a couple of times, changing my preferred Algorithm
from AES-256 to AES-128 and 3DES, and with both messages he had no
problem decrypting.
Why should it matter what Symmetric Algorithm of choice I have listed,
because when you encrypt _to_ someone, that encryption should use
whatever Algorithm the _Recipient_ has listed as their preferred
Algorithm, should it not?  Is not the Session Key itself encrypted using El-Gamal because the
Public Key I was encrypting to was a DH/DSS Key? Why or how is GPG
encrypting the Session Key such that he is unable to decrypt it and thus
 receiving that error message? FYI, I am using a Key Pair generated
using PGP and imported into my GPG Key Ring.

@_subject: Editing Public Key 
Hello Mike Watson,
You could do either, but I would suggest simply adding a new User ID
containing your new address. OTOH, if your old address is null and void
and your Key isn't that widely distributed, you may well want to generate
a brand new Key. How you do that depends on what you are using as a
Front-end for GPG. I personally suggest GPGTray, but there is also WinPT
and both greatly simplify the procedure.

No, that is not true. He can use GPGShell and perform all Key

@_subject: --encrypt does not return to command prompt 
I am just curious, but if you are using GPG with Win2000, why are you
needlessly saddling yourself with the commandline, when you can install
GPGShell and enjoy the ease of use of GPG through GPGTray, and encrypt
your files using GPGTools?
