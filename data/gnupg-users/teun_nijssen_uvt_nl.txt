@_subject: [Fwd:] Public Keyserver with LDAP 
When SURFnet moved the cname pgp.surfnet.nl from the very old
horowitz.surfnet.nl to the overpowered minsky.surfnet.nl, the ldap
server was stopped. SURFnet now only runs an SKS server. On August 29th
2005 I almost became lyric about it:
LDAP server:
2005		  Jul     Aug     Sep     Oct     Nov     Dec
ADD key ok       2146    6053     Good old horowitz,
ADD double       1495     547     a SPARC machine from the
                                  era of 150 Mhz processors,
Search/get ok 1870413  748012     but with incredibly solid
Srch timelim     6848    4312     reliability, was finally
Srch sizelim      698     514     shutdown on 29 august 2005.
Srch not fnd   607223  354194     Its first boot was in 1996.
MODify ok         705   10807     But minsky lives;
IPsources       23122   14231     go minsky, go, and do as well
                                  as good old horowitz
certd down         1h       1h    fine machine.....
SUN/net down        0       0
Actually, minsky is a good box. Apart from spending 99.3% of its time on
GIMPS (currently Iteration 19000000 / 35046623) it reports:
