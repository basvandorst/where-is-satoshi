This makes so much common sense to me that I must write in support of it

@_subject: additional uids? 
Upon signing a key, though, there is an option to sign all UIDs or
selected ones, correct?  I think that makes a difference to the non-
openPGP keyservers out there.

@_subject: CryptChat, a little off topic, so please don't kill me.   :-) 
The Jabber IM specs support "signed" presence and encrypted p2p messaging.
Gabber, a GNOME client, in particular, supports GPG for all that.  Still
a work in progress, but being actively developed.

Is that Gnus along with MailCrypt?  Nice package for emaxen.

@_subject: Split private Key 
Why not encrypt the Certificate key, prior to splitting it,
with a public RSA or DSS key that you do not publish?  Then any holder
would have to have the associated private key AND all the other parts to
do any damage.

@_subject: Split private Key 
I wrote a bit more than THAT -- I said to use a separate public key
to encrypt (protect) the Certificate key.  Beats using a bloody XOR.
Then, when they get together to merge their Certificate pieces, they
put them together and decrypt using the separate private key.
