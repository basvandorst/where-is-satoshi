@_subject: Changing default digest algo 
I generated some new keys in Sept and would like to convert the digest
from SHA1 to SHA512.
I added the following to gpg.conf:
personal-digest-preferences SHA512
cert-digest-algo SHA512
default-preference-list SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 SHA224 AES256 AES192 AES
CAST5 ZLIB BZIP2 ZIP Uncompressed
I changed the preferences:
gpg> setpref SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 SHA224 AES256 AES192 AES CAST5 ZLIB
BZIP2 ZIP Uncompressed
And verified:
gpg> showpref
[ultimate] (1). Charles F. Peters II (Chuck)      Cipher: AES256, AES192, AES, CAST5, 3DES
     Digest: SHA512, SHA384, SHA256, SHA224, SHA1
     Compression: ZLIB, BZIP2, ZIP, Uncompressed
     Features: MDC, Keyserver no-modify
When I check the keys, it still shows SHA1:
$ gpg --export-options export-minimal --export 23E9EB24 | gpg
--list-packets |grep -A 2 signature|grep 'digest algo 2,'
        digest algo 2, begin of digest a3 6e
        digest algo 2, begin of digest 3b 34
        digest algo 2, begin of digest f2 3e
        digest algo 2, begin of digest ae 58
        digest algo 2, begin of digest 67 fa
        digest algo 2, begin of digest e6 39
I tried a few things like changing the passphrase, signing my key and
gpg --s2k-digest-algo SHA512 --edit-key 23E9EB24 and nothing seems to
work.  How do I change the digest to SHA512?

@_subject: Best Practice, subkeys and subkey cross-certification. 
I attended a small key signing party Saturday after generating a new key with multiple subkeys with the notion of having a email signing keys on less secure systems like my VPS (using mutt) and a separate subkey for each computer or device.
 says "The really useful part of subkeys is that they can be revoked independently of the master keys, and also stored separately from them." ?So I can keep my primary key off the network and use it only for signing other peoples keys. ?
Another sensible precaution is to have different passphrases for each of these subkeys. ?However when working with the full key set when I attempted to change the passphrase for a subkey, it also changed the passphrase for the main key. ?I'm assuming at this point when I separate the keys, I can change the passphrase as planned... ?Is this a bug? ?Should I file a bug report? ?? Then I decided I should do some more reading and get a better understanding of subkeys and of the more recent documentation and blogs I found the following:?    OK, the FAQ is the first I heard about?subkey cross-certification. ?Is that info current and correct? ?What is recommended?
Does anyone have some pointers on personal or organizational Policy and Best Practices documents under a copyright or license terms that allow

Potential instructors: please explain subkeys and how it might be best to primarily use subkeys on your computer, tablet etc...
 USE IT WELL
ACT SWIFTLY IF SOMEONE GETS YOUR PRIVATE KEY
If you lose your private key or someone else gets ahold of it (say, by stealing or cracking your computer), it's important to revoke it immediately before someone else uses it to read your encrypted email. This guide doesn't cover how to revoke a key, but you can follow the instructions on the GnuPG site. After you're done revoking, send an email to everyone with whom you usually use your key to make sure they know.
The text links to If I were to use the instructions and followed the link, I would say, what are subkeys?  And have no clue about keeping which keys or subkeys where...
Proper training should include the processes to recover a loss of a private subkey without losing all your key signings.
The best HowTo on subkeys I have seen, but not really noob-friendly if you want to avoid the command line:

How about storing keys in a more distributed manner, DNS, in addition to some other method of authentication, DNSSEC and DANE?
Paul Wouters and others are working on it:
Using DANE to Associate OpenPGP public keys with email addresses
Paul recently gave a presentation about it at an ICANN meeting:
Video, via Adobe Connect starts about 4:49:00 and goes to about 5:08:00:
Slide 1 of the presentation shows, not including the title slide, how you can obtain Paul's key with dig and slide 2 shows the easier method using hash-slinger:
openpgpkey --fetch email_address
Slide 5 shows how to create the DNS record:
openpgpkey --create email_address --output rfc
Slide 9 Paul talks about openpgpkey-milter which is a postfix and sendmail plugin to auto-encrypt email. Note it is not recommended for production use yet.
And to make mail servers less NSA friendly we should be setting up DANE and requiring starttls with forward secrecy anyway!  It's on my TODO list!
