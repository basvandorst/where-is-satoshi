@_subject: fsfe smartcard help 
Good Evening,
Today I've received my fsfe smartcard and I've set it up at my work under arch linux with the following guide:  Now I am at home, using ubuntu 10.04 and I would like to be able to sign my mail using my fsfe card. (I use cone). I've tried to follow the guide again using the backups of my secring/pubring. While my key gets imported it does not ask for my smartcard pin, but for my secret key passphrase. (Smartcardreader in my Dell keyboard). The contents of the card can be read with gpg --card-edit. remy at janedoe:~$ gpg --help
gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.10
remy at janedoe:~$ gpg --card-edit
gpg: detected reader `Dell smart card reader keyboard 00 00'

Is there a way that I can use the card on other PC's then the one I;ve set it up? Remy van Elst
