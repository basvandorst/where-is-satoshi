@_subject: GPG for XP? 
I do and i hadn´t expirienced any problems.
Not if you are using the GPG Version from  but with the
version from  i also had some trouble under Win2000
WinPT and GPGshell also function under WinXP and with both of them you
are able to en-/decrypt the current window, so you don´t have to save
the text to a file.
