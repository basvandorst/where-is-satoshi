I've just installed GnuPG 1.2.0 on Windows 2000. I can sign files
without any problems through the command-line. But if I try to
sign a message in my mail-program "The Bat! 1.60" I get the
following message:
gpg: no default secret key: secret key not available
gpg: [stdin]: clearsign failed: secret key not available
How can I select a default secret key? What's wrong here?
Best regards, Benjamin

But there isn't such a file gpg.conf!
I've unzipped the file gnupg-w32cli-1.2.1-1.zip to c:\gnupg. Then
I opened the command-line and type gpg --gen-key with the
corresponding values.
The files pubring.gpg, secring.gpg, random_seed and trustdb.gpg
were created but no gpg.conf.
How can I create this file? Is this necessary?

I solved the problem: GnuPG has some problems with the german
character 'ö' (oe). I generated another key-pair without the ö.
Now it works fine!
Thank you all for your help!
Best regards, Benjamin.

Is it possible to use the german character 'ö'?
