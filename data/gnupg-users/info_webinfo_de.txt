@_subject: JADE-S, secure communication with DF? 
Hi folks,
   supposed all features of JADE-S are activated - is it possible to encrypt
   and sign messages adressed to the DF like DFService.register requests?
   Best regards, Bjorn

@_subject: signing an verifying data without the need of files 
Hi,
  I would like to sign text without first having to create a file where I  have to write the text into.
  --> is it possible to hand the text directly from the standard input?
  As well I would like to obtain the signature without having to open the  created ".asc" file.
  --> is it possible to redirect the file output to the standard output?
  Of course, the same questions do occure concerning verification!
  Currently, I'm writing a Java API for a project of mine and would like to  speed up the performance
  by avoiding slow file operations...
  Best regards,
   Bjorn

@_subject: signing an verifying data without the need of files 
Hi John,
  thanks for your reply!! The problem is, that this tool is written in C and
  is using the GPGME library. I want to write a method for my JavaGPG class
  and thus would like to know, how this can be done just by using a shell.
  The reason is, that my Java API simulates shell commands and retrieves
  the results via redirecting the standard output into particular file
  descriptors. From here, I can access the results in Java.
  But anyway, thanks for your reply, in deed it is a pretty nifty utility    Bjorn

Hi Sven,
  damn it, I actually didn't know that a Java library accessing GnuPG does
  exist! Thanks a lot for this hint!
  I continued trying to make it work with the --clearsign and --texmode
  command, but I seem to be too stupid! Do you already have some
  experiences? The command generating a signature for the string "hello"
  would be more than great!!!
  Cu, Bj?rn

@_subject: payload in GenericMessage 
Hi,
  I was just asking me the following question:
  An ACLMessage is sent within a GenericMessage. Also, an envelope as well  as a payload are stored within this GenericMessage. Supposed the  ACLMessage contains sensitive data - can this data (even if partially) be  reconstructed simply with the help of the payload or the envelope, too?  What kind of information is stored within this payload? I'm just  considering security issues and thus would like to know if it would be  enough to encrypt only the ACLMessage but not the payload...
  I'm thankfull for every single hint,
    Bjorn
