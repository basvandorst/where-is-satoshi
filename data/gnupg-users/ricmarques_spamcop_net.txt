@_subject: Sending key to keyserver dies silently (Windows 98) 
Hi all,
(I have sent this same message about 6 hours ago, using my Yahoo.com mail address. According to the mail that confirms the subscriptions to this mailing list, a copy is sent by default to the sender. I did NOT get that copy, so I assume there was some connectivity problem between Yahoo.com and the Gnupg.org server. I am sending this again, using my spamcop.net account. Well, let's get now to my problem then...)
I am using GNUpg 1.0.2 in Windows 98.
I generated successfully a key (for a different email address that I am using now) by entering the following commands in a DOS Prompt:
  C:\gnupg> gpg --gen-key
( I entered Real Name, comment and email address. Then I entered the passphrase and confirm it and got the message that the key pairs were generated successfully).
Then, following the instructions in The GNU Privacy Handbook at  I tried to send the public key to a keyserver by entering:
C:\GNUPG> gpg --keyserver certserver.pgp.com --send-key But, I only got the usual message of insecure memory that says:
gpg: Please note that you don't have secure memory on this system
I used PGP to lookup the key in certserver.pgp.com just to check if it was uploaded. It was NOT. I also tried uploading it to keyserver.net in various ways, always without success:
C:\GNUPG> gpg --keyserver search.keyserver.net --send-key C:\GNUPG> gpg --keyserver search.keyserver.net:11371 --send-key C:\GNUPG> gpg --keyserver  --send-key C:\GNUPG> gpg --keyserver  --send-key Can anyone help me here... please?
Thanks in advance.
Best wishes,
Ricardo Dias Marques

Hallo Graham,
First of all, my best compliments for having created that text document. I do think that such a text could be really helpful to others, and so perhaps it is a good idea to include it in the official documentation.
Maybe you could send a copy to Werner Koch and ask him if it would be OK to:
1) Include it in the Documentation section of the GnuPG site at  2) Include it in the README file (or other file) of the Windows distribution
What do you think ?
Best wishes,
Ricardo Dias Marques

Hi Nils,
Great idea! :)
Maybe you would like to check the following page, which lists mail
client programs (for Unix, Windows and Macintosh) that support PGP (and
points if the PGP support is native or available from plugin). Then, you
could check, for those programs, which would either natively support GPG
or require a plugin or - alas - do not work with GPG at all.
The page is at:

@_subject: Windows version 
Hi John Kodak,
First of all, think carefully if you do want to install GnuPG on Windows. If you are expecting a Graphical Client (GUI) in which you basically point-and-click, then I suggest that you get PGP instead. GnuPG, in its Windows version, is a (MS-DOS) Command Line program.
If you _do_ want to install GnuPG anyway, then great!  :)
1) Extract the contents of the ZIP file into C:\GNUPG using a program like WinZip
2) Read the Friendly Manual that John Saylor talked about. It is called "The GNU Privacy Handbook (English)" and it is available at  3) The commands available at the Privacy Handbook listed above are for Unix (Linux and others), but they work the same in Windows. Basically, you open an MS-DOS Prompt and type the commands that are listed there. So, to generate a key, for example, you'd go to the GNUPG directory, in the DOS shell, like this:
and then you'd type:
gpg --gen-key
Don't try to use the keyserver commands, though - they don't work (yet) in the Windows version.
Good luck!  :)

@_subject: AW: GnuPG with PHP 
Yes, according to the info available at:  PHP had a dual license: one of them was GPL; and PHP4 hasn't any
longer the GPL license.
gpg code.
Well, in that same page, it is written that:
" (...) Essentially, the PHP license gives you the right to use,
distribute and modify PHP as much as you want, for both commercial and
non-commercial use. You just have to make it clear to the user that
what you have distributed contains PHP.  (...) You are free to
distribute PHP source code you write freely or commercially, without
any concern about the PHP or Zend licenses. (...) You may also package
PHP as a whole with your commercial applications as much as you want.
You just can't build commercial applications that use the Zend
scriping engine library directly."
And then it goes like this:
"[1] You should be aware of the Zend license in two cases. First, if
you publish patches to the Zend scriping engine library. The Zend
license allows Zend Technologies, Ltd. to use those patches
royalty-free (see the license for exact details)".
"[2] Second, the license prevents commercial use of the Zend scriping
engine library to build commercial applications. "
I think these two are acceptable for gnuPG, since gnuPG is
non-commercial software. Am I right?  This is NOT intended as a flame:
I am just trying to gain some understanding of the reasons that avoid
gnuPG to link code to PHP4.
By the way, I am _not_ affiliated with PHP / Zend / gnuPG /whatever...
I am just a happy developer of PHP scripts (_not_ PHP source code
itself, possibly written in C) and I also am a happy user of gnuPG  :)
Best wishes,
Ricardo Marques
