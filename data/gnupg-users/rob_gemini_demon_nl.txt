Hi Toxik,
the 'options' file should be in the GnuPG home directory ; normally
c:\gnupg ...
look in the GnuPG docs, like

@_subject: Geheimnis ? 
Hi all,
i want to install Geheimnis on a Mandrake 8.0 system ...
got the RPM from their site ( but
installing it i get some errors about missing QT and KDE libs ; now on the
site it says that for version 1.01 you need QT 1.4x and KDE 1.x libraries,
but Mandrake 8.0 comes with newer versions of those libs (and headers) ...
i hope that i do not have to install older versions ?!?!
what's the trick ?

Hi Malte,
MS> To me, 2.x isn't older than 1.x :)
No, but i never thought that Geheimnis 1.95 would be called version 2.
and i'm a newbie, so i downloaded the RPM for Mandrake, easier to install
than a tar-ball ... ;-)

hi Richard,
which mail-client are you using ?
how did you set the default key ; by editing the 'options' file ?
that is what you get when you run 'gpg' without any commands/options.
you would have to set the key in your e-mail program or do it yourself in the 'options'
it depends on your mail-program, i guess. i'm setting it up with KMail (running Linux
Mandrake 8.0) - only since yesterday evening, i've been using it for some time now in
Windows but still a LINUX newbie ;-) you could save the message as a text-file and then run 'gpg --import ' to see if
that works.
see  for all the gpg-options or do a 'man gpg'.

Hi Micha,
can Mutt handle multiple accounts all with their own settings, like SMTP &
POP3 servers ??
i'm now using TheBat! and it's one of the reasons i'm still doing e-mail in
Windows and not in Linux .... ;-)

there must be ; i installed GnuPG 1.0.6 using Mandrake's software/package manager ... it lists all available/installable packages on the server you select from the list, you
mark the packages you want and that's it.

Hi Sheriy,
You need an e-mail program that supports GnuPG directly (thru a plug-in) or
a shell like GnuPGShell ( ...
Sending/signing messages by using GnuPG from the command-line gets boring
pretty quick, i guess  ;-)

how 'standard' is PGP/MIME ?
in Linux i use Sylpheed, which by default signs messages with it, but the
signature (an .att attachment) is not recognized in my Windows mailer
(TheBat!) ... ?
i have to set Sylpheed to use 'clearsign' in order to get readable sigs.

@_subject: GnuPG & TheBat! v.2 
Hello all,
hope someone here can help me ...
despite the announcement that TB2 offers better support for GnuPG here :
[+] GnuPG passphrase caching. The user now can select from various signing keys available.
i am having nothing but problems with GnuPG in v.2 ...  :-(
I have several accounts, each with their own e-mail address and servers.
For 2 of those addresses i created signing-keys ...
When writing a message and signing it, i get a popup for the passphrase for
the key corresponding to the e-mail address for the account i'm working in,
no choice/selection, just a passphrase prompt.
When signing a message in an account with an e-mail address for which i did
not create a signing-key, i even get prompted for the passphrase for a
signing-key (ie. e-mail address) that does not even exist ?!?
Also, passphrase caching does not work ...
Where did i go wrong ?? I found a post in the TBBETA archive about a 'GnuPG
plugin', is that what i'm missing ?
