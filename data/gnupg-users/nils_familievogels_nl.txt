@_subject: Hybrid keysigning party, your opinion? 
Hey Peter, I've submitted a keysigning party at sha2017 earlier,  so we should have a slot to try something out.
I'll read up on this thread from the archives,  but I'm exploring possibilities to enhance the FOSDEM format with the use of QR for on-the-spot signing for those who want to and don't mind having signatures submitted by signers to keyservers.

The keysigning party has been scheduled for monday 7/8/17, and I'm drafting the wiki pages with instructions as we speak, using a slightly modernized Sassaman-Efficient protocol, and see where we go from there.
Feel free to check out  and  and offcourse, join in! :)
