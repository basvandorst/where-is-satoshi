@_subject: Verifying GnuPG-signed documents with PGP 5.0i 
I have tried to verify GnuPG-signed documents with PGP 5.0i,
(the newest available international version of PGP for unix
computers), with the following results:
- I could import my GnuPG-generated public-key block into PGP
  with no problem.
- When I clearsign the document, PGP verifies the signature
  with no problem.
- However, when I merely do 'gpg -s' or 'gpg -a -s', then PGP
  dies with signal 11 (segmentation violation).
Of course, part of the blame must be placed on PGP 5.0i (even
with incorrect data the program should not segfault), but
since GnuPG claims to be compatible with PGP, it appears to
me that GnuPG needs some more work in this area also.
Here is a message which PGP 5.0i segfaults on
and here is the public key corresponding to the signature of that
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: GnuPG v0.9.7 (GNU/Linux)
Comment: For info see -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
norbert > pgpv pgptest1.asc
Received signal 11.
May blessings from the eternal God surprise and overtake you!

You are so right. I'm very glad that GnuPG is available now!!!
Many thanks for this explanation!
However I'm wondering why don't you make algo 1 the default algorithm,
for better compatibility with PGP?
I have now put
compress-algo 1
in my ~/.gnupg/options file; however I'm wondering whether this might
have the undesired side-effect of using algo 1 also when encrypting
to a recipient who is known to use software that can handle algo 2 also.

What I'm looking for is an option (or improved defaults) that would
allow me to use algo 1 when signing only, but which would not affect
the strategy for determining the compression algo when encrypting.
BTW, it's not just a matter of some people not being able to verify
signatures.... if their software is not able to uncompress the
data I'm giving them, they can't get at the signed data at all.

Hmm... I'd expect it to be pretty expensive to hire a criminal with
sufficient computer skills for this. It would be much cheaper to equip
an ordinary burglar with an external tape drive and a diskette which
contains a simple program to dump the entire hard disk contents onto the
tape drive. The burglar's intructions would simply be "plug in tape
drive, insert diskette, switch power on, then wait until computer beeps
twice, then deliver the tape drive (leaving the office exactly like it
was before). The burglar wouldn't even need to switch the monitor on
(reducing his risk of being noticed).
The kind of set-up which Rich Derr suggested (encrypted filesystems for
all filesystems with the exception of swap partitions, and making
sure that no sensitive data ever goes to the swap area) seems pretty
good to me, in the sense that it would significantly increase the cost
of getting at the secret files. Any trojan horse installed (e.g. by
tampering with the boot loader) without breaking the encryption key used
for those encrypted filesystems would be easy to detect. Hence the
attacker would need to use a TEMPEST attack or a keyboard bug in order
to obtain the filesystem encryption key.

There is special data recovery hardware that allows to reliably
recover data from magnetic media even after it has been
overwritten several times. It is therefore much better to avoid
writing sensitive data to disk in the first place.
