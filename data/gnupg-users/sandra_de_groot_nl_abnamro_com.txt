@_subject: compatible between GnuPG 1.4.7 and PGP 6.5.2 
Good afternoon,
I am having a question is the GnuPG 1.4.7 version working with PGP 6.5.2?
One of our customers is using  GnuPG 1.4.7 and we are using PGP 6.5.2 and
now we got problems with decrypting the message?
Could you please tell me if both versions are working with each other?
Thank you very much,
Sandra de Groot
