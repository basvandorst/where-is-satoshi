I'm using both GNU PGP and NAI PGP on a Win2K machine. I encrypted &
signed a message using GPG. The message decrypted OK with PGP but the

Why does everyone say my GPG signature is bad while their PGP signature shows good? I did a decrypt/verify of one of my GPG messages with PGP and it gives a bad signature also. So far, I don't see anything wrong with my GPG
