@_subject: Cygwin and 1.9 branch 
Anybody compiled succesfully current 1.9 CVS branch using Cygwin on
I'd give it a try but I'd like to know before if I'm bound to try
something imposible given the current status of the source, or if
somebody knows it's perfectly posible.
I'm sure that using Cygwin I won't be able to get smartcard support
and I guess I can live with that unless also somebody tells me that
smartcard support is the only reason for trying 1.9 branch.
Any comments welcome.
Cordially, Ismael

I store my private keyring and a public keyring containing only my
public key on a pendrive, then in your gpg.conf:
keyring /path/to/pendrive/pubring.gpg
secret-keyring /path/to/pendrive/secring.gpg
Using several different computers it works like a charm.

Sure! I use the key stored in the drive only on computers at work. At
home I store a copy of the key in the hard drive. Moreover yes, I have
a revocation certificate.
I am a smartcard programmer. Sure an OpenPGP card is just a standard
smartcard with special elementary files in its filesystem. Could I
make my own OpenPGP card from a common smartcard given I know its
administrative codes?
If applets are involved probably it could also be loaded in any card
supporting Java.

A smartcard is very convenient as far as it's a multi application
device, so you can store much other info apart from GnuPG keys,
i.e. Mozilla passwords or such.

Bo Berglund escribe:
I use Cygwin's gnupg so gpg.conf is at ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf just as usual
on a UNIX computer.
Below my gpg.conf, these are lines used on both Linux and Windows:
default-cert-check-level 3
keyserver pgp.rediris.es
keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve include-revoked include-subkeys
keyring /path/to/pubring.gpg
secret-keyring /path/to/secring.gpg
default-key 0xDE721AF4
encrypt-to 0xDE721AF4
And below code needed on Windows to make enigmail work with Cygwin's
exec-path /bin:/usr/sbin/gnupg
Sure it can be improved so any suggestions are welcome.

AFAIK some of them also include hardware accelerators for RSA.
