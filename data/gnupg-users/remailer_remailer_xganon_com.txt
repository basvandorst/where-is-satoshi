@_subject: GnuPG and PGP 2.6: unusable public key 
I have put together a short cheat sheet for GnuPG <-> PGP 2.6 interoperation.
It is assumed here that you have compiled and enabled the IDEA module
for GnuPG and that you work on a unix-like OS. Here it is:
Add your PGP-2 public key to your public gpg keyring (don't use -a)
Add your PGP-2 secret key to your secret gpg keyring (don't use -a)
Now you can open PGP-2 signed/encrypted/signed+encrypted messages
Conventional (symmetric) PGP-2 compatible encryption:
        --set-filesize `find $file_to_encrypt -printf '%s'` $file_to_encrypt
Conventional (symmetric) PGP-2 compatible decryption:
Encrypting mail with their PGP-2 key:
Signing mail with your PGP-2 key:
Signing + encrypting mail with your PGP-2 key and their PGP-2 key:
