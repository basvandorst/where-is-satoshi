@_subject: wierd error message 
I am using mutt 1.4 w/ gnupg 1.07. I have mutt and gnupg setup to
automatically retrieve keys. I am getting the following error for this
particular key :

Previously I would get a Bad Signature for this key, so I deleted the key
from my pubring and re-retrieved the key with the following result.

I have upgraded to 1.0.7 from 1.0.6. I built it from source on a redhat 7.1
machine. I used to use it with mutt but now I get these errors.:
I have already run gpg --rebuild-keydb-cache and gpg --check-trustdb w/
the following results.

@_subject: automatically downloading public keys no longer works. 
I am using mutt 1.4i w/ gnupg 1.0.7. Previously I could automatically
download the public key of the author of the mail if it was not already in
my public ring. I am unable to do this since upgrading to gnupg 1.0.7. I
have a basically stock install of both mutt as well as gnupg w/ no major
changes made to any conf/rc files. This is the output of gnupg now:
