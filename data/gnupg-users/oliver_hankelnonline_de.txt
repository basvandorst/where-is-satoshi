@_subject: Double encryption ?? 
a friend of mine and me were just starting using GPG.
He encrypted a text for me an sent it to me. I was able to decrypt it.
BUT: He was also able to decrypt the encrypted message with his own secret key.
The only reason why this could happen as seen by us is that the text has been encrypted twice  - with my and with his public key.
We just want to be sure we didn´t make any mistakes. Is our assumption
