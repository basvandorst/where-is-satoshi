@_subject: Checking Integrity of GPG4Windows 
Not sure if this is the right place or if I will get a reply or if I will
have to check the mailing list for replies but I'm going to give it a try.
I am trying to install GPG4Windows and want to check the integrity of GPG
but am struggling to follow the instructions at the site:
I am trying to follow the instructions for not having an old version of GPG
installed, however where do I enter the following code they suggest and how
do I modify it for my GPG4Windows executable file? What program do I use?
Keep in mind I don't have an old version of GPG installed.
sha1sum gnupg-2.0.30.tar.bz2
To be clear I do not have an old version of GPG installed.
