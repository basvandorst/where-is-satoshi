I am trying to upgrade my old GnuPG (version 2.0.14) in order to
use Enigmail with my current Thunderbird.
My system:

I tried installing libgpg-error-1.28 but i am not sure it installed
[root at llappari libgpg-error-1.28]# ./configure |tee mylog.txt
ended as:
config.status: creating po/POTFILES
config.status: creating po/Makefile
        libgpg-error v1.28 has been configured as follows:
        Revision: e323423  (58147)
        Platform: i686-pc-linux-gnu
[root at llappari libgpg-error-1.28]#
[root at llappari libgpg-error-1.28]# make |tee -a mylog.txt
ended as:
make[3]: Nothing to be done for `all-am'.
make[3]: Leaving directory
make[2]: Leaving directory
make[2]: Entering directory
make[2]: Leaving directory
make[1]: Leaving directory
[root at llappari libgpg-error-1.28]# make |tee -a mylog.txt
There are 4 "Nothing to be done"-messages in all. Is that normal?
[root at llappari libgpg-error-1.28]# make install|tee -a mylog.txt
ended as:
make[3]: Entering directory
make[3]: Nothing to be done for `install-data-hook'.
make[3]: Leaving directory
make[2]: Leaving directory
make[1]: Leaving directory
[root at llappari libgpg-error-1.28]#
That makes now 13 "Nothing to be done"-messages in all.
I get errors from the second phase when i try to install
[root at llappari libgcrypt-1.8.2]# ./configure |tee -a mylog.txt
Ends with following message:
checking whether a -O flag munging is requested... yes
checking whether to enable AMD64 as(1) feature detection... yes
checking for gpg-error-config... no
checking for GPG Error - version >= 1.25... no
configure: error: libgpg-error is needed.
                See ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgpg-error/ .
[root at llappari libgcrypt-1.8.2]#
What should i do?
Any help is appreciated.
I am not an expert.
Kind Regards,

Thank you for your time.
Linux Centos 6.9 Final, 32b (quite old, i know).
I tried to find more current rpm-file but i could not find any. That's
the reason i tried to install it myself.
Anyways, the updated Enigmail made the problem go away. I was impatient.
I am also soon upgrading my Linux version soon...
