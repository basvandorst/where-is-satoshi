@_subject: Problems with gpg on HPUX 10.20 
I'm having a bit of trouble building GnuPG on my HP, and
I wondered if someone on this list can help. I ran configure
with --enable-static-rnd=egd (I have egd-0.7 abd it seems to
be working OK), --with-included-zlib --disable-nls, and
--disable-asm, since my machine is a C3000 with a PA-8500
in it and is thus PA2.0, maybe incompatible with PA1.1 stuff.
I don't know.  When I did a 'make check', gpg basically failed
almost all the tests.  Here's the beginning of the run:
gmake[2]: Entering directory `/home/jmm/Admin/Build/gnupg-1.0.1/checks'
gpg (GnuPG) 1.0.1

Does anyone have a clue what I can do to fix this?  Thanks for any help.
Could you CC any reply to me, and also please advise how to join the list - I couldn't find any instructions on the website or in the
distribution.  Thanks again.
