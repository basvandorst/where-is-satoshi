I'd like to present a user with information about a signature.  The
--list-packets option will show the essential information, KEYID and
creation date.  Is there a way to emit this information in a way that
is machine parseable?

Is this the message returned when the signature is verified?  I'm
looking for a method that parses the signature packet, only.
