@_subject: Chipdrive SPR 532 and OpenPGP Card with 4096Bit RSA Keys 
I bought a Chipdrive SPR 532 (aka Pinpad Pro) to read and write my PGP
RSA Keys on the OpenPGP smartcard V2. The reader is connected to a PC
running Ubuntu Linux 13.10. I passed all that gpg-agent vs.
gnome-keyring manager stuff successfully.
The problem is that I cannot authenticate an SSH login using a smartcard
that I previously wrote the key to (with another smartcard reader). It
fails after I entered the PIN. The next try write my PGP key to the card also presented an "operation
failed" error. Does this smartcard reader not work in combination with
4096Bit RSA keys?
I already tried to update the firmware on the device (currently 4.51 or
so) to 5.10 but the update program also fails with an error message
saying nothing about the reason.
Has anyone this combination up and running and could point me into the
right direction to get this working?
Any help is appreciated. Thanks for reading.

Hi all,
I got this working as well. The problem oviously indeed lies with the
firware version of the smartcard reader. I managed to update the
firwamre to 5.10 using a physical serial RS-232 port to connect the
reader. The former tries with the USB interface on a VirtualBox machine
did not work.
But concerning the keys I got another question:  How can I tell gnupg to
use keys that are already stored on the card? I do have my private key
on the card already and want to use this card on another computer? Do I
have to import my keypair again and then "keytocard"?
Or can I tell gnupg somehow to use the key already existing on the card?

Hi I got one further question regarding the Chipdrive. This device is one
with a pinpad. But currently the PIN is asked on the monitor and to be
entered with the keyboard rather than the pinpad. Can that be associated
with running just "gpg2 --card-status"?
How does GnuPG decide wether to ask for the Pin on screen or to let it
be entered on the pinpad? I had that working when I ran "keytocard" but
I cannot return to this state ...

@_subject: GPG V2.0 Smartcard and Nautilus SFTP Sessions 
Hi maybe a little off topic, but I wonder how to get nautilus as a file
manager to authenticate a SFTP connection with a smartcard. Has anyone a
working setup on this?
I replaced the gnome-keyring daemons with gpg-agent in order to get that
working on the console. File encryption in nautilus works and correctly
asks for the smartcard PIN.
But when I try to connect to my SFTP server it throws some error message
saying that I do not have the correct permissions to access that location.
Any help greatly appreciated.
Best regards
   Florian
