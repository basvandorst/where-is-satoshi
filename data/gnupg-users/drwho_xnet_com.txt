First, please note that I'm not currently subscribed to the list, so please
CC replies to "drwho  Thanks
On Solaris 2.7 (SunOS sun.segfault.lan 5.7 Generic_106541-02 sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-4), gpg was compiled with the following options:
   ./configure --enable-m-guard --with-included-gettext
The compiler was gcc 2.8.1.
Almost any action with gpg results in a bus error:
 gpg --list-keys
 gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
 /home/drwho/.gnupg/pubring.gpg
 ------------------------------
 Bus Error
First, I'd just like to know if there's something I'm missing (I only noticed a brief reference to Solaris in the docs, regarding gethrtime(),
and I tried that fix, but no luck).
Second, if I'm not missing anything, please consider this a formal bug
