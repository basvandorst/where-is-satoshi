@_subject: Help Solicited to implement a new pgp key server 
I have  been asked  to support PGP for a application. the most likely
scenario would be to implement a key server that would allow customers to
manage their keys. This will of course come with some complications, in
terms of interface, provisioning and management.
Could anybody please help me out in knowing how can i write a server using
unix c/C++.
If there is any document available on internet which can be helpful. It
would be great if you could please let me know.
Thanks in advance

Hi all,
Thanks for your suggestion that helped me lot.
one question i would like to test:
I created a key ( using gpg --gen-key from gnupg-1.0.6 ) after that
i exported that key as
gpg --output customer.asc --armor --export   #  used
now i took that customer key where my gnupg-1.4.9 running. and inport that key and also signed that using --edit-key.
now i was able to encrypt the file ( for example test.txt ) using that key
id ( which i have imported )
but there is some problem that i am facing while decryping the same message.
gpg: WARNING: using insecure memory!
gpg: please see  for more information
gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit ELG-E key, ID 8BF79D26, created 2009-02-05
      "rahul_kaushik (user1.0.6) "

Hi all,
I have an issue which is described below:
earlier i was using Gnupg-1.0.6 for my appliaction. Now i have replaced it
with Gnupg-1.4.9.
I am facing some issue related to keyrings. As per my application. I need to perform following application.
I did finally get these encrypt/decrypt procedures to work:
        gpg (1.4.9) for encryption followed by gpg (1.0.6) for decryption
as for Gnupg-1.4.9 ~.gnupg/gpg.conf and ~.gnupg/options are default options
I am having some trouble understanding why keys created (--gen-key) using
the 'gpg'
of Gnupg-1.4.9 can't be exported to the Gnupg-1.0.6 key ring properly.
The gpge(2.0) followed by gpgd(1.2) fails in ths case... I'm puzzled, for
Could anyone please help me ASAP in sorting out this problem so that my
application could work properly.
Thanks in advance.

Hi All,
Thanks for your attention towards my problem.
One thing that i still would like to know about gpg is
Is it possible for me to use keyring and trustdb of Gnupg-1.4.9  while using
Gnupg-1.0.6. can keyring generated ( using --gen-key ) by Gnupg-1.4.9 be used with gnupg-1.0.6.
What i think, it may not be possible to convert keyring or trustdb from
upper version ( 1.4.9 )  to keyring of lower version ( 1.0.6 ).
Please correct me if i am wrong.
Thanks & Regards,
Rahul Kaushik
