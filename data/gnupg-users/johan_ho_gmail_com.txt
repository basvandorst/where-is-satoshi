@_subject: cryptnet.net (which hosts "GnuPG Keysigning Party HOWTO") down? 
I tried to look up the "keysigning party howto" on the GnuPG website ( but apparently  is down (ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED) so most of the language links there don't work.
I tried a few days ago and today, but it still doesn't work.
Anyone know the status of that server and whether it might get fixed?
