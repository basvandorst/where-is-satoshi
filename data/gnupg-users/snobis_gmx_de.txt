@_subject: PGP does not accept session key 
I have a problem, sending encrypted mails to a PGP user. All mails i
send can't be decryptet by PGP (V 6.0.2). It bails an error message,
which says that the session key is bad. I used GPG 0.9.5 on Linux
I found a statement in the docs, but i don't understand it:
     * PGP 5.0 rejects an encrypted session key if the keylength
       differs from the S2K symmetric algorithm. This is a bug in its
       validation function.
What does this mean?

Funny, but i now changed to the new version 0.9.8 of GnuPG and it
seems to work (just doing some last test to be sure). I still don't
know, why this don't work with version 0.9.5.
