Don't shoot me - I looked closer and can plainly see that encryption
also failed. At least that makes more sense to me.
Sorry for the obvious oversite.

This is "perhaps" a typo in the doc.
You can copy/paste these lines into a file named "GnuPG.reg"
-------------- cut here ------------
----- file ends with line above ----------
Once you save this, double-click the icon and you will
have set up GPG to reference its HomeDir as "D:\GnuPG"
Of course, you'll have to change the values to suit your needs.

@_subject: use of --passphrase-fd in batch symmetric encryption 
Following Frank's advice, I did the following from my Windoze NT machine:
and it complains that I need 'make'. I know all about 'make' and its powers
from my Unix background, but I don't have 'make' for my NT machine.
Anyone know how I can grab hold of 'make' for NT?

@_subject: Win32 passphrase proposal 
How true, but it really is no different than storing it
in some file and passing it via the commandline arg '--passphrase-fd'.
FWIW, the 'pgp' commandline interface supports the same type
of thing via either an environment variable PASSPHRASEFD (for file
or PASSPHRASE (as the string itself).
Perhaps a better scenario is for the passphrase to be stored in a 'mangled'
state so it would not be as easily figured out.

@_subject: Win32 passphrase proposal 
I should have stated this up front, but the only
reason that I (or any one else AFAIK) would use '--passphrase-fd'
is for automation.  As such, all of this is under the context of '--batch'.
This was talking about what 'pgp' command-line does.
In no way was a level of security implied.
How true, but it would NOT be in its bare-bones state
for nobody to have to anything but look (like a neon sign).
As was mentioned, "it would not be as easy".

     gpg --batch --yes --passprhase-fd 0 -se -r $recipient \

Note: This assumes the variables 'theDir' and 'recipient'
are set to what you want. Obviously, you'll need to modify
the path to your passphrase. It also assumes that your
'options' file is setup appropriately.
Warning: Anyone at your site who can read a script will
know what your passphrase is using this method.

@_subject: Precompiled Binaries for UNIX 
Does anyone know of a FTP site where one can download precompiled binaries
for the different flavors of UNIX?
Specifically, I need:
    Digital Unix 4.0F
    IBM Unix - AIX 4.3
This is a desperate attempt to get gpg working in my environment, as using
gcc 2.9.1 and gmake 3.79 have not succeeded for me - and I have asked this
forum for assistance, but no thoughts have surfaced as of yet.

Thanks for the tip.
After downloading, I tried to setup my keys and am (unfortunately) seeing
similar results as to when I compiled on my own.
Specifically, I see:

For precompiled AIX binaries there is always

I was blowing up in the 'f' directory.
And, since I am not going to be using fortran in my environment, I simply
disabled 'f'.
All works according to plan now :-)
Thanks for the offer,

 What problems do you have under DU? It compiles just fine here (gcc
 and make check appears to go nicely, too (using egd).
 If you tell me which configure options you want, I can compile a DU 4.0F
 binary for you.
