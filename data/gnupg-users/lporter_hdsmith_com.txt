@_subject: Will GNUPG run on the IBM AS400 running V5R2? 
There are no AS400 ports for GPG, I've looked. You can figure out a way
to compile it, because the AS400 does have some type of POSIX

Wow. Thanks. I've searched high and low for this.

FWIW, here's how someone did it.

Wow that's one incredible work around to get GPG working on an AS/400.
But I don't have access to an AIX box, so it's not much use. It does
give me some more insights. Thanks. -----Original Message-----

The GPG plugin for Outlook G-Data is perfect for this then. It is what I
currently use at work.

i don't want them to be bothered by cutting-n-pasting... they'll be
receiving PGP stuff, but probably not sending it. when a PGP email comes
in, i'd like to have a little box come up and ask them for their secret
pass-phrase, and then they can read the message in outlook...

@_subject: Programatic execution of GPG 
Is VB Script acceptable? I automated our company's GPG using it.

I'm looking for a way to programmatically execute GPG commands.  My
company is steering away from DOS Batch execution so my existing
automation will no longer be acceptable.  Does an API  or code wrapper
exist or has anyone tackled this issue?

@_subject: Output file to specific directory? 
I might be misunderstanding what you mean, but this worked for me.
I encrypted a file with my own public key and put the encrypted file in
a different folder:
C:\Inetpub\ftproot\bankchecks\gnupgp>gpg -o C:\test.gpg -e -r
my_public_key lowell.txt
I then decrypted the file and put the decrypted file in an entirely new
C:\>gpg -q -o C:\test\lowell.txt --yes --decrypt test.gpg
It shouldn't be too difficult to do this with VB Script. (or VB for that
matter) ... I've used VB script to create the command line for GPG.

Unfortunately, that doesn't work.  It still decrypts the file to the
directory the original is located in rather than the current working
directory.  Seems strange to me, but I guess that's the way it's
designed.  Is this by design or is that a bug?
I might be wrong, but how about doing something like:
  Find the current directory.
  Find absolute path of file.
  Cd to output directory.
  Invoke gpg command on file with absolute path.
  Cd to previous directory.
Would that work?

@_subject: GPG problem Urgent please 
Here's some VB script code that decrypts data that I use for my MS
      GpgCmd2 = "gpg -q -o bankstmts.txt --yes --decrypt "& s
      Set WshShell = WScript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
      retcode = WshShell.Run(GpgCmd2, 1, True)
It doesn't use a passphrase so you'll have to modify the following batch
file code (that's been posted previously) to work with VB Script.
 Watch it! - on Windows do NOT include space between %1 and the pipe
(|) - will get bad
 passphrase error
echo %1| gpg --homedir %2 --batch --yes --passphrase-fd 0 --always-trust
--sign --recipient %3 --encrypt %4

does anyone know what makes a digital signature legally binding (or not)
under US law?
