@_subject: Unkown Error Message 
Whenever I start gnupg I always receive the same error message - for
Using gnupgp-1.0.1 on a Sun Ultra 10 running Solaris 8,  Sun Sparc 1000
running Solaris2.6 & x86 running Solaris 7 - It doens't matter if it is on a
Sparc or intel box I get the same error message  - the program seems to run
ok though.
The program was compiled using gcc2.9 and gnumake.
Can you tell me what is happening and if there is a resolution.
Please CC me as I am not on the mailing list

@_subject: Install Errors 
I am installing gnupgp-1.0.1 on a Sun Ultra 10 running Solaris 2.6.  I am
also using gnumake.
The ./configure and gmake commands appear to execute with no problems, but
when I run gmake install this is the error I receive:

While trying to generate a new key I am unable to create a "Real Name":
Here is the output:

Real name: "Jeff Rudichuk (Sys Admin) "
Invalid character in name
Real name:  I have tried to enter the name a varity of ways and always get the "Invalid

for some unkown reason I now get this error.
