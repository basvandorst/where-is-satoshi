@_subject: converting between detached undetached signatures? 
Another user has created a digital signature. I do not have
the secret key. I want to convert it's form. There are two
1) It is a detached signature, I want to convert it to
a regular undetached signature. (I have the file that
was signed.)
2) It is a regular not detached signature and
I want to convert it to a detached signature.
Can this be done with some obscure gpg command?
If no, perhaps someone has written a utility that
can do this work?
Thank You
