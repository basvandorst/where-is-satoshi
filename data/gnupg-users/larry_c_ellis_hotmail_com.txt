Ok, then I'd best not put pgp2 in my options file.  This still leaves open
one question:  why would 3des be chosen as the default cipher for a legacy
RSA key?   1.06 used RSA/IDEA as I recall, while as opposed to 1.07's
RSA/3DES (at least this is happening for me).
Is this a change in behavior, or a possible bug?

Well, primarily, I'm just trying to make sure that I have maximum
interoperability between versions, and that I understand any quirks in
getting things to work.
It's clear that changes within GPG are not geared towards improving the ease
of choosing RSA/IDEA.  That's fine; it's not a great choice for new users.
I know how to force the use of IDEA, if I foolishly choose to do so.  My
only outstanding question was why 3des is being chosen for encryption, by
default, *in combination with* RSA, even when IDEA is available.  I thought
GPG automatically chose IDEA in such cases (at least that's the way it
worked on 1.06).
Perhaps I have misconfigured something somewhere, but I know that I have not
specified a cipher override, either on the command line, or in the options

All of my issues on this question are now resolved.  Thanks to all who
As for the ATM issue, as I understand it, there are new standards mandating
the use of 3DES, which should make use of phone lines a non-issue (once
fully implemented, of course).  Anyhow,  there are much simpler ways to scam
ATM machines than trying to trap and decipher the communications.   You can
buy those machines from EBAY, and, once you've got one...well, I think we
all figure where it goes from there...

Well, though there are a number of nice new features in 1.07, my vote is
that the upgrade is not necessary *if* 1.06 is already doing everything you
You might want to review the documentation for what's changed.  Unless
there's something there you need, there seems no point in upgrading.  Others
may have a different vote....
I tried to build 1.07 on FreeBSD, and ran into some compatibility issues for
some prerequisites (libiconv).  Couldn't get them resolved without playing
around quite a bit, so I gave up on it.  So, upgrading might not be quite as
simple as you might imagine, unless you can find prebuilt binaries.
If you do install 1.07, I'd suggest you back up everything first, especially
your keyrings.  If you try to revert back to 1.06,  and you've done any
keyring maintenance, you may run into some backward compatibility problems.

I see that David T-G has responded to this, and I basically agree with his
answers.  It's not that IDEA is a bad algorithm, it's just that it has
patent encumbrances which means it cannot be used freely (for commercial
Forcing IDEA would be foolish (for me), simply because a lot of recipients
would not be able to decipher the message.  Of course, RSA legacy key
holders would, and that is about the only reason I can see that anyone would
force IDEA: when the recipient is an RSA key holder (who, might also be a
pgp2.6 user).  Of course, with 1.07, this is dealt with by simply
specifying --pgp2.
Personally, I want to use the algorithm which causes me the least
interoperability problems AND which is safe.  That probably means 3DES for
me.  It's quite a bit slower than other ciphers, but I really don't care
about that;  others may.  But I can't use 3DES for legacy PGP 2 recipients;
it doesn't support it.
