@_subject: GNUpg Version 1.4.8 on Solaris 10 (Sparc) 
We have just installed gnupg-1.4.8 on Sparc/Solaris 10. Is it possible to use
gpg to encrypt a file using private key and passphrase (under program
control) and send it to a remote user ? The remote user should be able to
decrypt the file with the public key sent by us.
Will appreciate clarification on this.
