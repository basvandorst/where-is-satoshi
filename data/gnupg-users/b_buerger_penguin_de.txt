@_subject: Problem with GnuPG 1.2.1 generated Key (Broken Key or Keyserver Problem) 
I recently generated a new sign-only Key, 2048bit RSA with gpg 1.2.1
gpg (GnuPG) 1.2.1
Pubkey: RSA, RSA-E, RSA-S, ELG-E, DSA, ELG
Cipher: 3DES, CAST5, BLOWFISH, AES, AES192, AES256, TWOFISH
Hash: MD5, SHA1, RIPEMD160
Compress: Uncompressed, ZIP, ZLIB
but after uploading this key to pgp.mit.edu, strange things happened.
- The Key ID was altered in way I don't really understand
  (You must request 0x818F8F41 on some servers to get 0x8838FD94)
 =20
- People can sign this key, send it to the Key-server (all with the
  "old" Key ID), but they told me they could only receive the Key=20
  from the Server via that strange new ID. On their System, the=20
  Key-ID was the old one again 8-[
I'd like to know: Is the Key invalid / broken and should be revoked,=20
or is it up to the Keyserver Network  ?
The Key (as I see it on my System):
bb gpg --list-sigs S1

The Output of the wwwkeys.pgp.net Keyserver Webinterface was something
like this:

What's that supposed to be ?

So, 212.55.198.213 and 64.71.163.210 seem to have problems with this
key. But why ?
Any suggestions or RTMF/FAQ appreciated.

If they are not able to set up a simple keyserver,

Yes, many people do so. But this is a very bad solution.

Sorry, the latter is down at the moment. But you can
try hkp://random.sks.keyserver.penguin.de instead,
which is a collection of public sks keyservers. All
of them treat subkeys in a safe way.

@_subject: Can't propagate key through public keyservers 
The that server has always been a good choice,
since it is maintained by Germany`s National
Research and Education Network and their people
are payed to keep the Service running ;-)
So I would second that recommendation for users
in Germany - especially those in the DFN. But
John is right. Putting only one single server into
the configuration will cause problems. Today, tomorrow
or maybe in a few years. Servers vanish into thin air,
DNS entries change or don't get updates.
But I should clarify the situation with
*.keyserver.penguin.de, since there might
be a misunderstanding. sks.keyserver.penguin.de
is a single keyserver located on a private machine.
The only reason for this server is this:
At the time I set up the machine there was no
subkey-safe server accessible, even blackhole.pca.dfn.de
was running broken software and most of the public
announced servers in *.pgp.net and *.keyserver.net
where just inaccessible or did not sync their keys correctly.
However, there was the sks keyserver project with
two or three servers and I installed one on my own
machine to get "my very own" Keyserver which was
accessible all the time I needed it. The sks synchronisation
proved to be absolutely stable since all new keys
where also exchanged via mail-sync to the "old"
keyserver network, sks users got the best of both
worlds. And I was a student, which means: Compared
to my situation today I had plenty of time for
this stuff ;-)
random.sks.keyserver.penguin.de has always been a
private experiment. The main Problem with the existing
wwwkeys.pgp.net was the missing continous maintenance
of this RR-Alias. And when I started the experiment,
most of the Keyservers in the pgp.net RR Aliases where
broken, not subkey-safe or just not there.
Since I had a cron job running, which updated the
SKS Keyserver Gossip map (based on the status pages
of all known SKS Servers), I feeded that information
into my very own RR Alias: random.sks.keyserver.penguin.de.
John is absolutely right. As I said before, the penguin.de
aliases are only experimental and it is a private project.
I have never had any problems with other people using this
service, since it was the most only functional solution for
some time. And I had the ressources to provide the service
to anyone who wanted it.
a) Nowadays there are plenty of SKS Servers out there
b) I am no longer a student and my time for this stuff
   is very limited. I will reaktivate sks.keyserver.penguin.de
   sometime, but at the moment the hardware is broken and it
   is just a hobby...
c) random.sks.keyserver.penguin.de is on hold at the moment,
   since the mapping script was runnning on the keyserver.
d) Even if I would setup a new Server for all of this,
   I couldn't handle the Traffic. This was no problem
   in the past, since I had an agreement with my university
   (which was interested in such a service).
e) Things change.
f) I have provided this service for many years now,
   time for someone else to step in ;-)
Yes. I would like to see a keyserver-system where each provider offers
their own local keyserver just like they do with DNS, smtp, etc.
Each Server should sync with two or three other Servers via
the SKS synchronisation mechanism which has proven to be very good.
Yes. But as I stated before, it is a private experiment and may also
vanish some time. And at the moment the update is on hold. I would like
to see such a service on the servers of some public organisation,
e.g. the DFN or pgp.net. Maybe we have to change to status pages of
SKS (or introduce a new machnism just for those RR-Aliases) to support
some kind of "Type" for a Keyserver. E.g. most of the Keyservers in the
random.sks.keyserver.penguin.de rotation provide services on the
hkp standard port. But not all of them provide a Webserver on port 80
with a keyservr-request form as known by the wwwkeys.pgp.net servers.
Other Servers provide hkp-service on port 80 for people behind firewalls...
I would like to see different RR-Aliases like
I think you get the picture. Each Server Admin could add his
server to one or more of these groups and the automatic
update mechnism would take care of the rest.
If you would implement this via something like the SKS Status
Pages (and add a compatible status page to all other keyserver
variants, everyone could just use the pgp.net alias or create
his own RR-Alias in another domain from that information. There
wouldn't be a single point of failure.
Just my 2? :-)
