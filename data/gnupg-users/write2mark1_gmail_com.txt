Since its release, Canary Mail is probably your best option, since it support OpenPGP out-of-the-box.
If you rather prefer to keep using iOS Mail, you?ll have to resort to the much less than user friendly options oPenGP and iPGMail (as others have mentioned). They work, but the user experience is really not pleasant if you receive a lot of encrypted messages. Also I don?t think they support verification of PGP/MIME messages (due to restrictions imposed by iOS).
