* Stormer's Cgi-Archive  [090513 02:51]:
A procmail list would probably be a better place to get this
information. I don't use procmail, but this seems more like a
client setting to me. Folder-hooks, etc.
I don't understand what you are trying to do from the
description. Is there a singular public key for the account or
multiple? Are you setting this up on a private mailserver? My
email client, mutt, picks the right key for the right account
based on the key information.

What is the best way to let people know you use gpg in an email signature? Any pitfalls to be concerned with?

I've recieved enough replies of  "can't open the attachment you sent"
that made me stop signing all my emails. I'm looking for best policy to
say "hey, see this gpg stuff? You should look into it so we assure some
degree of privacy on the internet."
Thanks for the help everyone.
