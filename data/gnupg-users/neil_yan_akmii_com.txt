@_subject: Question of using GNUPG on Win OS 
Currently i have a project need some data from PGP encrypted files. I need
to decrypt these files by program. I think GNUPG should be a greate tool for
my requirement. But I am really confused by the GNUPG version and usage
since I don't have many experience of Linux OS. My project will be executed
on Win OS. So, I have following questions need your help. Really appriciated
for any helps.
1. Where can I download a windows version of GNUPG? The files on GNUPG
download ftp site seems all are Linux version.
2. How can I decrypt files by using GNUPG programmatic? Using some DLL API
or call the command?
3. Are there any guid or documents for GNUPG windows version?

Thanks for you reply. I mean are there any guide or documents for GNUPG
windows version? I am sorry for the typo.
Here I have one more question.
If I want to use one key on multiple machine, or i want to save the private
key in some removable device. Is that possible? I cannot find any command
used to backup private key.
