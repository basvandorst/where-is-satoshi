@_subject: Using GPG to encrypt tape backups 
Yeah, I guess that would work.  Missed it in the man page.
Regardless, I am still not getting proper backups to the tape.  I
get this error at the end of the backup:
gpg: /dev/nst0: write error: Invalid argument
gpg: iobuf_flush failed on close: file write error
I get this regardless of whether I use -o /dev/nst0 or whether I redirect stdout to /dev/nst0.  When trying to verify the backup I get this:
gpg: block_filter 0x80e2a28: read error (size=12118,a->size=12118)
gpg: block_filter: pending bytes!
It appears that GPG can't close the output file descriptor properly when it's a tape device.  Shouldn't I be able to use GPG as a pipe filter
in this manner?
