@_subject: Encrypting an e-mail to a Hushmail user 
Hi gang,
  Yesterday I tried valiantly to get a Hushmail user to install GPG or PGP (6.5.8...still free and a good version) on his M$ system, but he said it was too hard to work and Hushmail was nice and easy.
  Anyway, after a few tries of trying to upload my public key to the Hush server, I figured out I had to upload without my picture...finally it took my   Now that I have my friends key on my keyring and have signed it, I find I get an 'error' every time I try to encrypt a message to him. I have a feeling it's because I'm using my key and it still has the photo, but I can't figure out how to sign the e-mail to him *without* using the photo/attribute(s) in my key.
  Anyone care to give me a quick hand with this? It'd sure be appreciated. (Now if I can just get him to use GPG for Windows thing would be great!)

My apologies, it completely skipped my mind to do that. It was a small popup window that literally read 'Error, cannot encrypt'...that was all I saw.
  Today though, I made another key without a phot and sent it to the hushmail server and sent 3 different test e-mails to my friend, and all 3 of my keys are working now. Very strange, since I did nothing to the other two that weren't working before (I use Kmail).
  Anyway, thanks to all who answered my call and again I apologize for the lack of information in my original post. Now that everything seems to be working, I'm not gonna mess with anything, heh.
  Take care,
  John B.

@_subject: Hushmail troubles...again 
Hi all,
  I've tried over the past week to send encrypted e-mails to a friend with a Hushmail address from Kmail on SuSE 9.3 . I've got his key on my keyring and when I hit the 'send' button, it brings up the gpg window showing the key I'm using and all that and I enter my passphrase and it sends away as if there's no problem.
  The problem is, it always ends up at the Hushmail place as an attachment and no way to open it or read it. I even made a Hushmail account for myself and tried it and it did the same thing for me...it came to the Hushmail as an attachment with no way to open it.
  Is there something I'm doing wrong? Is it something Hushmail is doing wrong? Does anyone have any idea what it could possibly be, because using the Hushmail thing online is extremely slow for a dial-up user and a PITA when I have Kmail and gpg on my own system.
  Thanks for any ideas to try to fix this dilemma.
  JB

I just tried this to 'my' hushmail account, and it worked fine, but my friend still can't decrypt mine for anything. I've uploaded *all* my public keys to the hushmail server and tried all my addresses and still no go for anyone but my own account.
  Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?

Got it figured out. I was encrypting with 'my' keys instead of encrypting with 'his' key . Thanks for the help!

Kgpg has this editor built in. Just cut and paste the message into the editor and decrypt it using your passphrase.

@_subject: Second problem...gpg or kgpg? 
Hi again,
  Out of the blue, it seems kgpg doesn't see my .gnupg directory. I opened it up the other day just to check something, and it showed no keys at all. I went into the settings and all it allows is to see my /home/me directory which has a couple of .asc keys(?) in it but had no gpg.conf file until I imported the .asc keys.
  Is there a way to fix what's going on? Has this happened to anyone else? I did absolutely nothing with gpg or kgpg...no updates (other than the SuSE security update 2 or 3 months ago IIRR) to either of them. Still with 1.4.1 I think it is and was working fine until I happened to see it the other day.
  Sorry I'm not too good at explaining myself, but if there's any more info needed, it's easier if someone asks me and then I'll know better what needs to be said about my problem.

@_subject: Un-revoking a key pair 
Hi gang,
  Somehow the other night I accidently imported a revoking thing for my main secret and public key pair when I was using kgpg. Kgpg tells me I need to un-revoke it in the manual editor, so, could someone tell me a quick and easy way to do so, please? Is it possible to un-revoke?

@_subject: Un-revoking a key pair 
Thanks to David, Peter, and Adam for the info on doing this. It looks like the easiest thing to do is go ahead and send out the revoked key info to keyservers and just make a new key though, especially since kgpg is acting up so badly and not seeing /home/me/.gnupg for some reason. Maybe I'll be able to figure it out before I create a new keypair though.
  Thanks again.

SuSE 9.3 and Kgpg 1.2.1.
  I've never had a problem with kgpg before, in almost 4 years now, but if I can't figure out what's wrong all of a sudden with it like this, I'm going to look hard into that Seahorse, heh.

@_subject: Having trouble building rpm of 1.4.7 
Hi gang,
  I figured I'd try to upgrade and build an rpm myself in krpmbuilder. I've done it before with a few apps, so it's not 'too hard' for me, but with gnupg 1.4.7 I keep getting the error(s) at the end that read thus:
RPM build errors:
    File not found: /var/tmp/build-root-gnupg/opt/kde3/share/man/man1/gpg.1.gz
    File not found: /var/tmp/build-root-gnupg/opt/kde3/share/man/man1/gpgv.1.gz
    File not found: /var/tmp/build-root-gnupg/opt/kde3/share/man/man1/gpg.ru.1.gz
    File not found: /var/tmp/build-root-gnupg/opt/kde3/share/man/man7/gnupg.7.gz
  This is on a SuSE 9.3 system. I don't know where to look or what to do to try and fix this problem. Anyone have any ideas that are simple for me to try as a simpleton?

A: Wrong, it's *never* correct, it leads only to someone, *again*, trying to argue that somehow it's okay, and still discombobulates everything. If they don't do it writing letters or in books, it shouldn't be anywhere else. It isn't even done in Hebrew.

That's what the subject line is for. After that, it should be all reading as if one is reading a book and seeing things in the logical order and way people were taught to read and respond.
  I can't help there, sorry.

A 'Post It' note, on the outside of a paper, envelope, folder, what-have-you, is *not* the same as writing some introductory message *into* said paper. It doesn't interrupt the flow of said paper when the paper itself is being read, because the Post It note is removed or out of the way once its been looked at. Besides, as I said, that note serves as the 'subject line' to whatever it is that's going to be read.

Hiya gang,
  Sorry for being redundant, but what are some good keyservers to use? The ones that are on a stock Kgpg setup don't seem to work too well.

Then they need to learn it. It's not necessary to learn *how* it works completely, or know as much as someone who designs it - just enough to know how to use it correctly. It's not hard, it's simply laziness for the most
