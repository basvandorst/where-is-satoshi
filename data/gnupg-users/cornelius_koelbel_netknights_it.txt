@_subject: several GPG smartcards connected at the same time 
I am wondering if it is possible to have several GnuPG Smartcards
connected. Let's assume I have several smartcards, one has a PGP key of identy1 at example.com, the other of
identity2 at example.com.
If I now try to decrypt something which is encrypted for
identity2 at example.com would the gpg-agent/scdaemon be smart enough to
ask the correct smartcard with the right identity/private key?
Thanks a lot

Hash: SHA512
Hello Everyone,
I'm wanting to solidify my key security and I'm just not comfortable
with having my OpenPGP key on my computer all the time. So I'd like to
move to a smartcard solution.
I've gone to the kernelconcepts.de page and tried to contact them but
it looks like the domain simply isn't accepting mail and the site
might just be a zombie. So I decided to come here and ask as well.
Can anyone recommend a solid OpenPGP smartcard solution that meets the
following criteria:
1) Supports up to 4096 bit RSA keys
2) Generates keys completely on the card
3) Can sign, encrypt, decrypt
4) Preferably has some tamper resistence
5) Can import an existing RSA key
Also, since I'm pretty new to smartcard solutions, I'm also in the
market for a reader. If you have any suggestions for one of those, I'd
appreciate it too. If it makes a difference, I'm in the USA.
