and got a reply that:
"Merging of secret keys has never been not supported.  GnuPG 2.1 has a

hi Jack!
i think i'm struggling with the same issue.
i've done this before a couple of years ago and it worked as expected... but
this time i get the same results as described before me in this thread.
to the best of my knowledge the secret subkeys get exported into the file
properly, but import seems to ignore them.
i've made sure that the public keys are there in the receiving keyring, but
that wasn't the problem.
any luck since then? or anything i could try?

i can confirm this.
i've deleted the entire secret key from my less protected keychain,
including the previous expired subkeys, and after that gpg --import imported
the subkeys i wanted (all of them that got exported with
--export-secret-subkeys from the more protected keyring).

me, too.
if gpg printed something like: "secret key already exists, aborting." then i
would have tried your suggested method of deleting the entire secret key
block on my own.
shall i/we record a bug in the gpg bug tracker for this?
