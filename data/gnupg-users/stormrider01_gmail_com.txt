I'm attempting to encrypt a file on a remote server, both machines are
win2k3 server, using this command:
gpg --homedir c:\gnupg ---batch --trust-model always --output
\\server\backups\archive1.7z.gpg -e -r user
And I'm getting this error:
gpg: can't open `\\\\server\\backups\\archive1.7z': No such file or directory
gpg: \\\\\\server\\backups\\archive1.7z: encryption failed: file open error
I've checked and the file (archive1.7z) isn't in use. Any ideas what's going on?

Thanks guys. Double Quoting the the files didn't work, but replacing
the back slashes with forward slashes did.
