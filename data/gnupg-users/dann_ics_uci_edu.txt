@_subject: tcsh command line completion for gpg 
Here is some code to do command line completion for gpg when using
tcsh. The goal is to save you some typing when using gpg.
gpg -[TAB] will complete with all the the option names that start with a -
gpg --[TAB]
will complete with all the options that start with --
gpg --digest-algo[TAB] will complete with all the digest algorithms names. You should change the gpg_keyservers variable to contain the
keyservers that you use...
I could add completion for the --recipient option, but I don't know
how to get that information (it can be done with a shell command)...
If people find this usefull, it could be added to the gpg
Add the following to your .cshrc  and try it.
if ($?tcsh) then
set noglob
set gpg_keyservers = (wwwkeys.pgp.net ANOTHER_KEYSERVER)
complete gpg c/--/"(sign clearsign detach-sign encrypt symmetric        \
unset noglob
