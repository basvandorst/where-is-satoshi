I'm not sure "XYZ" qualifies as a URL, but I think that the actual
problem might be that you have something in your gpg.conf that says
"produce v3 signatures."

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

One could argue that large parts of this thread have been off topic for
this list, however I'm firmly of the opinion that the type of political
rhetoric about licenses that you've stated here is definitely off topic,
and personally I'd appreciate it if it was just skipped altogether.
I'm not sure this is accurate either, or at least I think you're being
too specific by mentioning OpenPGP. It would be safer to say that PGP
integration in general has not been a goal for the Pine development
team, and that it's handled fairly well by a variety of third party
In regards to the MIME issue, Pine doesn't give the user the ability to
manipulate attachments at all, so you can't create PGP MIME messages.
(You can of course attach files to e-mail, you just can't script the
attachment process like you can other things, like message creation.)
It's not specifically a PGP issue. I do have a filter for Pine that will
allow you to verify properly formatted PGP MIME messages in Pine though.
As for the "mutt is better, so you should use it" argument, I think that
"better" is a very relative term, and that MUA choices in general are a
topic of great emotion. :)  The one perspective that I don't have any
sympathy for though is that of, "Well, those people who use $MUA are
losers, so you shouldn't care if you can't communicate with them
securely." Some of us actually NEED to be able to communicate with those
people, have absolutely no chance of convincing them to change, and
therefore need to find valid solutions. If you are not in that group,
lucky you, but telling those of us who are that our concerns are
pointless isn't really useful.
Speaking only for myself,

Um, ok, thanks for that. My point is simply that arguing about whether
Pine's license is "Free" or not, in my opinion, is not on topic here. As
a member of the list I'm simply making a request, which you are of
course free to disregard.
Well I'm biased, but you can find mine at
 I think that "well" is a
relative term here, and I'm sure that you will find things in that
package that you won't like. :)
Personally I don't miss it, but YMMV.
Sorry I wasn't clear. I was referring here to the thread in general, not
replying directly to you.
I agree, I find that rhetoric inappropriate and pretty much non-useful.
The topic of in line signatures was discussed on the list recently, so I
won't rehash that here.

Hash: SHA1
Another way to approach this is to sign the key, then encrypt it with
itself and mail it to the address specified in the identity. This
accomplishes verification that the e-mail address is valid, verification
that the person at the other end has control of the secret key, and puts
the responsibility of uploading the signed key on them.
This method gets a little cumbersome if the person has multiple
identities on the same key, but in that situation I generally just sign
each identity individually and mail that version of the signed key to
that e-mail address.

Errr, it's slow, but it works for me:
Also, I found a windows version of gnupg 1.2.4 (which you'll need to get
enigmail working in windows) here:
When I have to boot windows, I use that combination without any
problems. I like mozilla mail + enigmail both because of the feature
set, and the cross platform capability.
That said, I generally prefer not using MIME signatures, since good old
ascii armor works in a wider variety of circumstances, but the
capability is there, and it works quite well.

I'm interested in that actually. I keep hearing "deprecated," but no
clear explanation as to why. Do you have some documentation I could take
a look at?
Meanwhile, the version of signature you're using is not parsable by
netscape mail + enigmail, and I can't get it to work with the filter I
wrote to parse mime signatures with pine either. I'm going to work on
the latter when I get a chance, but meanwhile I thought you might want
to know.

It wasn't, but thanks for the info. I've actually been considering
moving to mozilla, in part because the enigmail folks aren't real
enthusiastic about rolling new versions that work with "plain old"
netscape. But, that's just one more thing on my to-do list, as I'm sure
you can appreciate. :)

This is very much a matter of preference, and I've heard good arguments
on both sides of the issue.
The good news for you is that the mailman software that this list runs
on supports the feature you want (namely one and only one copy of the
post). Just go to and you can sort it out for yourself. :)
The rest of your post was very interesting, and illuminated the issue
for me quite clearly, thanks. I agree that your use of the word
"deprecated" in this context is perhaps not accurate.
As for switching to mutt, its IMAP support is not yet at a level that
suits my needs, so that's not a possibility at this time. It is a topic
that I reexamine from time to time however, so  I'll give it another
pass at some point in the future.
Thanks again,

That depends on your goal. I was quite clear when I said that if your
goal is to get one and only one copy of the e-mail, mailman can do that
for you. I suggest that you check it out for yourself.
If your goal is to get people to stop cc'ing you on replies to list
mail, not only can I not help you with that goal, but (to be brutally
honest), I think it's a foolish waste of time. However, I also think
that this subject is off topic for the list, so I'll drop it there.

FYI, I compiled 1.3.5 on a recent FreeBSD 5-current system. It compiles
cleanly, and 'make check' passes all 25 tests. I haven't had much of a
chance to play with it yet, but at your request I wanted to at least let
you know that it compiles and runs on FreeBSD 5.
If you think it's worthwhile, I can talk to the gnupg port maintainer
(ports are similar to linux rpm's) about creating a gnupg-devel port so
that this code can be used and tested more widely in the FreeBSD community.

Personally, I've been using the netscape/mozilla mail client in windows
and FreeBSD for a long time ... several years at least. For me, it's
definitely the best GUI mail client in the unix world. And since (as you
mentioned) having a consistent UI between platforms is useful, I've been
using it in windows for the same time period. It has excellent IMAP
support as well.
In the last six months or so, enigmail has also gotten very user
friendly. The only thing in there that I don't like right now is the
fact that a key that has really long name and/or comment fields will
cause my window to resize, and enigmail doesn't handle that gracefully.
IMO it would be better to wrap the text to fit the existing window, but
if I'm understanding how it's adding that status line, that probably
wouldn't be easy to do. In any case, this is a minor annoyance ... the
functionality is excellent, and it handles a wide variety of pgp
situations with great ease.
Hope this helps,

@_subject: Preventing temporary files? 
In my past life as a systems programmer in a Unix environment I did a lot of research on this for a project I had that needed to run across a variety of systems, including NFS mounts where the status of the system locking was unknown. It turned out that the most effective way to handle this was actually to create a lock directory rather than a lock file. The main reason this was a better solution is that (as I understand it) directory creation is specified by POSIX to be an atomic operation, and therefore isn't susceptible to race or locking issues in the same way that file creation is. (Note, nothing was put in the directories, their successful creation was the threshold operation for locking.)
I'm not suggesting here that gnupg change anything, I just wanted to point this issue out in case at some point down the road a solution is necessary for weird issues that file based locking doesn't solve.
Hope this helps,

He didn't say e-mail address, he said name. :) I just checked this for
myself, and if I type in "Doug Barton" I get the key that is tied to this
e-mail address, but not the other key that I have uploaded to that server.
This actually explains a common complaint that I hear from PGP users about
not being able to find that other key. So, this turns out to be very useful
information, as I now know to tell them to search for my other key by e-mail
address (which works, btw).
I can see a lot of value in the model you described David, and I agree that
at least having a key where the e-mail address has been verified, on a
server where users actually have the ability to remove keys, is a good
thing. On the other hand, I can see that every other "Doug Barton" in the
world is at a significant disadvantage here, since I got there first. :)

Um, until you actually get appointed ruler of the universe, you don't get to make that decision for everyone else. :) Seriously though, I interact with a lot of people that get their keys from the GD (their choice, and I'm not in a position to argue), so I need to have my key there, and it needs to be signed by the GD system. You can argue whether what pgp.com is doing is wrong all day long, but it is what it is, and therefore I need to be compatible with it. Thus, I really like the clean options, and have the following in my gpg.conf which works splendidly:
import-options import-clean-sigs import-clean-uids
export-options export-clean-sigs export-clean-uids
keyserver-options import-clean-sigs import-clean-uids export-clean-sigs I don't know what you mean about "release version of GPG," but the above works fine with 1.4.2 on both Windows and FreeBSD.
