@_subject: gnupg-1.0.6 Win32 Source 
I have just downloaded the gnupg-w32-1.0.6.zip which has
the gpg.exe utility.  I also wish to incorporate the ability to decrypt
files using gnupg 1.0.6 into a win32 app. Can someone tell me were the win32 source is?  I have
looked and can only find unix build source. Do I have
to convert the Unix build? I would prefer to do a native win32 build, I will use cygwin if all else fails.
