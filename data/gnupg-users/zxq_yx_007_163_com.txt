@_subject: how can i generate a keypair without reading anwsers from stdin? 
Hi there:
I want to generate a keypair . But i dont want to type "gpg --gen-key"
and then answer questions.
I want to write all the answers in a file and then let gpg read the
answer from the file in batch mode.
What the format of the file should be? Any help?
