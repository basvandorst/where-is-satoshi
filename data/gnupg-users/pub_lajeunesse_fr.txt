Hello all,
I'm a mac user, and I think that Ubuntu would approach much. I have a
concern to expose yourself ... I hope to be in the right place ...
I have a Macbook Pro and an iMac, with identical configurations (snow
leopard) ... I installed GnuPG and GPGMail and I have a bunch identical on
both machines.
When I sign / encrypt a message in the IMAC, my recipient receives an email
like this:
----- BEGIN PGP MESSAGE -----
Version: GnuPG/MacGPG2 v2.0.14 (Darwin)
sYORV2D4R0x + rQnDhRAUI5kTD01NF
When I do the same thing with the Macbook, my recipient receives an email
with two attachments:
mail and file attachment pgp.asc
Do you know how to make my recipients can receive as IMAC sending ...
Thank you all for your help ....
Excuse me, i'm french
