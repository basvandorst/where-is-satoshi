@_subject: editing User ID 
This will not affect your ability to decrypt existing files.  If you
have published the key to a keyserver, the only options are to revoke
the user id and add a new one or revoke the entire key, and generate a
new key.  However, you will still require the old key to decrypt
previously encrypted files.

Generally speaking, yes.  But if the user has not yet published his
key, there is no harm in just removing it.

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the

generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

The simplest way to do this is to run this in the top level directory:
  find . -name *.sig -print0 | xargs -n1 -0 gpg --verify -v
The first part grabs a list of .sig files and the second part runs GPG
on each sequentially.  The -v forces GPG to list is assumption on the
file to be verified and as a result, you can see the signature following
the name.  More complex variants on this may be possible.

@_subject: Encryption keys in the OpenPGP spec 
I am trying to understand the differences in key types and looking at
encryption keys in particular.  RFC 4880 has this to say on the matter
of key flags:
       0x04 - This key may be used to encrypt communications.
       0x08 - This key may be used to encrypt storage.
So, my first question is why is there a distinction between the two
types of encryption?
Also, looking in GnuPG 1.4.9, I see this in g10/keygen.c:
    if (use & PUBKEY_USAGE_ENC)
        buf[0] |= 0x04 | 0x08;
Which suggests, quite strongly, that the distinction is irrelevant.  Why
GnuPG ignore the different encryption key types?
Thank you, James

I noticed this, too.  But since I also do not claim any special wisdom
on the issue, I was hoping someone would.  Since we all seem to agree
that communication and storage is difficult to distinguish, can someone
suggest why different keys may be desired in different circumstances?

Under DOS, redirecting from the standard output of A to the standard

Windows still doesn't do that when running those at the command line.

This leads indirectly to another question:  Why can't I sign someone

primary key and use it to sign others?

It's worth noting that I have, more or less, dropped off of PGPNET
because of the key management issue.  They are nontrivial and it is a
pain.  GSWoT, however, does share information using a key where the
private key parts are shared among all members.
I wonder if the key management issue would be simpler if there were a
master key, group members were an ADK, and GnuPGP supported ADK.

My Crypto Stick arrived in the mail yesterday (Maryland, United

One thing I am confused about, it suggests it accepts RSA keys up to
3072 bits.  However, when I tried to copy my existing 2048-bit RSA keys,
GPG reponds with:
  Command> keytocard
  Signature key ....: [none]
  Encryption key....: [none]
  Authentication key: [none]
  You may only store a 1024 bit RSA key on the card
I take it I am missing something obvious in this?
