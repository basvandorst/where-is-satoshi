directly related to GnuPG (an OpenPGP implementation). There are IPSec implementation for GNU/Linux (in user space and kernel space) check out on freshmeat.

@_subject: Algorithm support - patch for Elliptic Curve available ? 
Hello all,
I'm looking for a support in GnuPG of Elliptic Curve and Elliptic Curve DSA. Is there somebody working on that ?

@_subject: usage experience of USB / CFS storage for keyring 
Dear All,
Is there somebody using an USB storage (or any external storage) for their
keyring ? Some experiences ? or bad experiences of a using a method like that ? (directory linking ? .gnupg as mount point ? ...)

"experimental/research" patch for ECC (and/or) ECC DSA. This is not an issue. The patent is also applicable in Europe ? for encapsulating ECC data : ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-dnsext-ecc-key-02.txt ;-)

@_subject: Point of view regarding LISA 2002 
Do you plan to publish the presentation afterwards ?   I agree  with you but this  is a real  issue for a vast  majority of
  Free  Software  project  and  technical issue  in  general.  Digital
  signature for example is also a real issue to explain clearly to the
  "average" computer user. (For  example, the FINID initiative is also
  difficult but  they are  discussions to put  this in real  and large
  use)
  The problem  is real  but maybe  for OpenPGP but  also for  the vast
  majority of concept around cryptography.   Yes, that's  true but this is  not a general failure  of the OpenPGP
  initiative  but a  general failure  of the  promotion of  the basics
  around Security.   Don't hesitate to provide  an electronic version of the presentation
  after LISA to gnupg-user.   Thanks a lot for the respond and your time.

@_subject: GnuPG server to make remote OpenPGP message 
I was wondering  if somebody has already made a  GnuPG server to sign,
encrypt message via the network. My  classical issue is not to have my
private  keyring with  me.  Is there  somebody  who has  made this  or
something like that before ? There  are  some  security  issue  with  that  but  in  some  specific
environnement this could be useful to have a remote GnuPG server. Thanks.

@_subject: GnuPG server to make remote OpenPGP message 
Yes and no. Yes, this is a solution for SMTP. No, I  was more thinking about  something like a  gnupg application as
server.  When  you can  pass command to  it via  a secure way.   A mix
between the  "emacs-server" like  solution, an OCSP  server and  a pks
server. Here is an example : [application]-> [SPECIFIC-PROTOCOL] -> [GnuPG-server] This could be also seen as a GPGME via remote. I just  want to know if  the idea is fully  crazy or if  could be done
without major security issue. Thanks for any feedback.

I have seen that :
"The Promise of Privacy
Len Sassaman, Consultant
More than ten years have passed since the release of the controversial
encryption program  PGP, which  proclaimed itself "encryption  for the
masses".  In this  presentation,  I  will discuss  how  PGP and  other
privacy-enhancing technologies  have failed  in their mission.  I will
examine   the   different   problems  that   companies,   governments,
implementers,  and individuals  face  when attempting  to harness  the
benefits of  privacy-enhancing technologies, using PGP  as the primary
example of these failures. Among  the  issues:  the  importance of  usability,  reliability,  and
interoperability,  the  role of  government  interference, and  public
misconceptions." Did you know the presentation ? the speaker ? I  don't think  that  GnuPG have  failed  in their  mission. GnuPG  is
usable,   there   is   more   and  more   user-interface   integration
with GnuPG/OpenPGP and the use is increasing quite well. (Just see the
message signing in mailing-list and so on...) What is  your opinion about  that ? or  just another hype  summary for
a talk ?

@_subject: OpenPGP smartcard, how vulnerable is it? 
It's more than a theoretical attack, the Sykipot Malware is proxying
access to the smartcard reader. And by so the attacker is able to
use the functionality of the card without requiring to tamper the card
For a complete analysis of the malware:
I hope this helps.
