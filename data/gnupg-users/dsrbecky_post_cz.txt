@_subject: Save signature in mail headers 
I would like to sign all my mail, but I do not want to annoy people that
have incompatible e-mail clients with extra attachment file or signature
in the text of the message.
Is it possible to send the signature in mail headers?

@_subject: Proof of email ownership 
I just installed GnuPG to Thunderbird, created a key pair and uploaded it to a keyserver. I have expected to receive some mail designed to verify that I really own the email address (similar to the one that just received to subscribe to this list), but I did not receive any.
How can people know that I own the address if GnuPG did not check it?
My next idea was that GnuPG is multipurpose cryptographic software and I need to get some special signature verifying that I own specific mail. I was looking for a way to accomplish that, but I have not found any.
Are there any servers/bots that can verify that I own mail and then sign my key to certify that?

Enigmail is great, but I find that public key import is very repetitive
and unnecessary action. Could Enigmail just try to import public keys
automatically for incoming mail?

Related to: Save signature in mail headers
Ok, I got other solution:
I think it is safe to assume that if user has public key than he has
compatible MUA or at least he will not mind being send signatures.
What I want is option to try import recipients public key and sign the
message only if one is found.

Related to: Proof of email ownership
There are a few robots that verify that user owns the e-mail.
There are a many more UNTRUSTED IDs than TRUSTED in my list. If enigmail
could specify whether the ID has been signed by robot, it would provide
significantly more information.
PS: A configurable list of trusted robots in the options panel may be
