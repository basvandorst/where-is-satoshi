@_subject: Commercial support? 
Hello GPG Users,
My client has several Solaris 8 servers running PGP 7.1.1 and they have been
very happy with this setup.  Now the time has come to renew their
license/support with NAI and the prices seem ridiculous.  I have been tasked
with looking into GPG as a cost effective replacement and it looks very
promising.  The only thing I cannot find any information about is third
party commercial support.  This is a must have for them.  Are there any
vendors who will support this product?
