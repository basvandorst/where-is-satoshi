key-pair.  When I try to encrypt a file to myself I get the following: [caleb caleb]$ gpg --armor --recipient bokonon --encrypt layout.inc
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
gpg: this cipher algorithm is depreciated; please use a more standard one!
encrypt a message to a friend of mine (who is using the newest version
of PGP) I don't get such a messgae.  Running this command does
produce an encrypted file which I am able to decrypt.

encrypt and sign it, and I tried doing:

newest version of freeware PGP, and sent him a file which I encrypted
and signed, and all went well.  It both decrypted and the signature
checked out okay.
fairly new to this stuff, so I don't understand it too well.
I try to decrypt files sent by him to me:

The file decrypts fine, but I have no idea what the error (warning or
neither?) message means.
