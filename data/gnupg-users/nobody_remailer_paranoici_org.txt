@_subject: key length for smart card key generation 
Thanks for the information.
So I should be able to import the key...but not use it unless it is 3072 bits or less?
I run gpg2 --card-status, and I get a lot of information, but I don't
see an entry "OpenPGP version."  What I do see is a field "Version:"
which says "11.11".

@_subject: how to decrypt messages to hidden recipient 
I would like to decrypt messages stored in a folder:
1 2 3 4 5...n
All messages are encrypted to hidden recipients.  I have only one key
which I want to be trying to use.  How can I try to decrypt all the files in the folder trying my
specified secret key?
For instance
for each file in folder

@_subject: is there a way to modify the date when signing? 
This is not working on my gnupg 2.0.20 or 2.0.19.  invalid option error.
I don't know what version I should be using, because the man page
option --try-secret-key also gives an error.  It does show the option
in my man page.
