@_subject: decrypting pgp with gpg 
Hi ev'ryone!
This might be a FAQ, but I haven't found a suitable answer yet.
My problem:
I want to exchange encrypted documents. I'm using gpg-1.0.2 for some
real unix and my partner on the other side of the tapped channel is
using pgp-6.5.1i. We've exchanged public keys and he can decrypt the messages that i've
encrypted using his pubkey. But I cannot decrypt his mesgs
This is what gpg says:
You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: [some name]
1024-bit ELG-E key, ID 4200E2E2, created 2000-09-14 (main key ID 6D274C63)
gpg: cipher algorithm 1 is unknown or disabled
gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit ELG-E key, ID 4200E2E2, created 2000-09-14
      [same name]
gpg: public key decryption failed: unknown cipher algorithm
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
i've created my key pair using the defaults. is there anyone who has experienced something similar?
creating a new keypair is not really a problem since this key is not
distributed so far...
