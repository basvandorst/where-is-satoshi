@_subject: Problem when decrypting PGP messages 
Every time I receive a message from a customer. I get :
OpenPGP Security Info
gpg command line and output:
C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU\GnuPG\pub\gpg.exe
gpg: invalid armor header: gpg: invalid radix64 character 2E skipped
gpg: invalid radix64 character 2E skipped
gpg: CRC error; 8C9731 - CA3995
gpg: packet(3) with unknown version 41
Also, the workaround I found is to forward the message to myself, removing :
Version: PGP Desktop 10.1.2 (Build 9) - not licensed for commercial use:
Charset: utf-8
which is just after -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----
and just before the crypted message
Is there a way to ingnore these 'headers' by default ?
Thanks and regards
