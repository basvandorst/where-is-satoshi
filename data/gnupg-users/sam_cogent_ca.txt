The help command does not list all the options, did you actually try the command?

The options are parsed  AFTER the first secure memory is allocated,
which makes it a fairly useless option. I asked for this to be
changed. It seemed to me that there was no particular reason to
allocate the memory so early, and moving the allocation to after
the options parsing would be safe.
I think this option doesn't get any use, because most people just
make gpg setuid root to fix this, but that doesn't work everywhere.
What do you think Werner? Should I resubmit a patch against the
latest, or has it been fixed since 1.0.1?
