@_subject: No-modify flag 
I've noticed (using the new PGPdump interface) that the no-modify flag of subpacket 23 (keyserver prefs) is set on all keys generated by GnuPG. I realize that no server implements these flags, but I still do not like the flag being set automatically on my key when I generate it. Is this going to be fixed?

@_subject: Curiosity with RSA sign/encrypt keys 
PGP will generate v4 keys with algo 1 and keyflags (subpacket 27?) that
prohibit usage of each key or subkey for anything but signing or
encrypting, respectively. This is why you are having this issue.
These types are deprecated and IIRC, SHOULD NOT be used. Key flags
provide a much better alternative. The only reason anyone still uses
type 16 (ELG-E) for subkeys on D/g keys is because of PGP 5, 6, and 7,
which ignore type 20 (ELG), even with keyflags. The standard specifies
this somewhere around sec 9-12.
gpg has done the Right Thing according to the standard, if the key has
been generated with PGP. Anything else would be a violation of

At the command prompt, type "set HTTP_PROXY= where  is the name of your proxy. Set mutt to use gpg for signing, verifying, encrypting, etc. The Mutt HOWTO is here: . It was written for Linux, but it's pretty much the same for all platforms.
*If and only if your keyserver still doesn't work*, try a line like "keyserver x-broken-hkp://horowitz.surfnet.nl:11371/". You must have the port and the "x-broken-hkp://". This tells gpg that you probably have a broken I'd just suggest using gpg. If you want compatibility with PGP, set the force-v3-sigs and escape-from-lines options and unset the openpgp option in your options file. These disable full OpenPGP compatibility, however.

@_subject: problem with PGP 7 public key 
You're correct about all but one of the options. rfc1991 turns off most compatibility with PGP versions of 5.x or above. You should turn it off. gpg will do the Right Thing when it encounters a v3 key, but this is a v4 RSA key, and it works fine on 1.0.6 without rfc1991 and with openpgp. I don't think openpgp is required, though.

@_subject: Multiple Signatures 
I have found that when using the options local-user and default-user with the same parameter, gpg will ask for a passphrase only once, but will create two signatures. This is bad. Maybe gpg shouldn't allow them both? Anyone else have this problem?

@_subject: Kmail and gpg freeze 
Whenever I read my mail with Kmail, if there is an unknown key used to sign a message, it will be fetched with gpg. Kmail freezes while gpg executes and I must kill gpg in order to make kmail work again. The command line used for gpg is "gpg --batch --set-filename stdin --decrypt". Is there a flaw in this command line for gpg 1.0.5-1? Is the "--set-filename stdin" even necessary, and is it breaking it?

@_subject: gpg key server 
There is the pks-0.9.4 server (known as the Horowitz server, after its creator). It is under the old BSD license, the one with the advertising clause. It is a free software license, but is incompatible with the GPL. If you can deal with that, you can use it. It is the most common keyserver, it requires no backend like pgp or gpg, but it has a few quirks. If a key with more than one subkey is imported, all subkeys are totally messed up. If you want a GPL'd keyserver (which is in alpha), talk to V. Alex Brennan
