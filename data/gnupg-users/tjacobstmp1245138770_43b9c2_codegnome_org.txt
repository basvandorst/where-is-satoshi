@_subject: Primary uid not honored in 1.4.9 
I've attempted (several times, in fact) to create a key pair with three
UIDs: one primary and two others. Whether using Seahorse or the command
line, I will manually set one of the UIDs as primary.
This *appears* to work locally, but if I export the keypair and then
import it into another gnupg keyring on a different box (still running
1.4.9, though) the primary UID defaults to whichever UID was created
last rather than the one selected as primary.
While I know that different implementations of PGP aren't required to
honor the primary UID, shouldn't gnupg honor its own? Why isn't the
primary UID being exported, and what can I do about it?
