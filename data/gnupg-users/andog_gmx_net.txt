Hash: SHA1
does anybody know if the Microsystems SCM SCR 201 PCMCIA cardreader is
supported on Linux with the standard-approach?
found at ebay for example with the id 160211050548.
Or does anybody know how to get working the Texas Instruments PCIxx12
GemCore based SmartCard controller of a HPNC6400?
My system is Ubuntu Gutsy and I own a fsfe-card.
thanks a lot

I had the same problem here. Uninstalling seahorse solved my issue. I
run Ubuntu 7.10, gpg 1.4.6 and thunderbird 2.0.12 with enigmail 0.95.6.
In thunderbird it didn't work to do anything regarding the CryptoCard,
$ gpg --card-status
gave me the usual info to the card. I didn't perform further tests, but
could do it if relevant.
