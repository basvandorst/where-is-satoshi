@_subject: [gpgme+gpg-agent] How to use gpg-agent in daemon 
I am working on a Linux daemon which will be using gpgme for crypto purposes and I need to use gpg-agent in my program. But when I start my daemon it detaches itself from the current console therefore I can not use gpg-agent. How can I make gpg-agent system wide for all users.
Thanks in advance
