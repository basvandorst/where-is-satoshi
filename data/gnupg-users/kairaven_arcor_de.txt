Hi David,
mmh, the gpgkeys_* helpers are in /usr/libexec, but I have set
exec-path /usr/libexec and all is working fine :)

@_subject: secret- and public-key crypto 
i have one question about the new symmetric and public-key encryption.
Is the same session key used or a separate one for each encryption?

@_subject: Broken signatures with Thunderbird/Enigmail since 1.4.0? 
Hi David,
Are file signatures affected the same way?
Today, i downloaded the new spamassassin, checked the signature an got
a bad signature. I wrote to the spamassassin folks and Theo Van Dinter
Interestingly, I decided to upgrade to 1.4.0 and try again:
$ gpg --verify Mail-SpamAssassin-3.0.2.tar.gz.asc
gpg: Signature made Wed 15 Dec 2004 10:57:53 PM EST using DSA key ID 265FA05B
gpg: BAD signature from "SpamAssassin Signing Key "
exact same files as I had previously tested with 1.2.4...  Going to 1.2.6 (may
as well go to the latest 1.2 release):
gpg: Signature made Wed 15 Dec 2004 10:57:53 PM EST using DSA key ID 265FA05B
gpg: Good signature from "SpamAssassin Signing Key "

@_subject: What does `sig!3' mean in the output of `gpg --check-sigs'? 
Hi Eric,
I think it means a correct certificate with check-level 3: (3) I have done very careful checking.

Hello David,
Compiles and runs without problems under Fedora Core 2

@_subject: Symmetric encryption and mdc 
Hi Per,
compatibility problems with PGP versions < 8? Because pgp2, pgp6 and
pgp7 disable mdc.
personal-cipher-preferences name1
the first named cipher will be used for symmetric encryption too
s2k-cipher-algo name
Use name as the cipher algorithm used to protect secret keys. The
default cipher is CAST5. This cipher is also used for conventional
encryption if --personal-cipher-preferences and --cipher-algo is not

@_subject: Symmetric encryption and mdc 
Hi Per,
Yes you are right :(
I have teated it with my Windows vmware installation.
I have in my WinPT GnuPG preferences for the config file path
If i change the option
personal-cipher-preferences S10 S9 S8 S7 S2 S4 S3
personal-cipher-preferences S9 S8 S7 S2 S4 S3 S10
and have s2k-cipher-algo AES256
WinPT still uses CAST5

Hi Servie,
No, David Shaw or Werner Koch from the GnuPG Team made the announcments
You can compile and install as with version 1.2.6, the new install
overwrites all binary files and man pages from 1.2.6.
If you prefer RPMs, you can try a rpmbuild -tb gnupg-1.3.91.tar.bz2,
because a spec file is included. It is a "developer" version but imo stable to use it with FC2 :)

Hi Timo,
1.0rc2 with WinPT Tray 0.9.12 from
I see & understandable :)
Mmh, i think cipher-ago is not a good idea, because it is not so
flexible as the first mentioned ID in personal-cipher-preferences or
secondary the name with s2k-cipher-algo. I mean, if somebody uses GnuPG
for public key crypto without WinPT...

@_subject: No sig-notation with 1.3.91? 
i tried to test sig-notation with GnuPG 1.3.91 together with a new DSA
key and had added
sig-notation signotation Notation Test"
in the gpg.conf.
GnuPG complains with:
"notations cannot be inscribed on a v3 (PGP2.x-like) key"

@_subject: sig-keyserver-url with 1.3.91 
added sig-keyserver-url hkp://sks.keyserver.penguin.de
in gpg.conf.
Is it right, that i have to add no-force-v3-sigs too, but than no PGP 5
- 7 user can verify my signatures?
Because without no-force-v3-sigs, GnuPG complains
"can't put a preferred keyserver URL into v3 signatures."
With no-force-v3-sigs, the option sig-notation works too, but the
notation doesn't appear with gpg --verify --list-options

@_subject: Creating a ssl socket using OpenPGP keys 
Hi Eduardo,
Perhaps, one of the Jabber clients with OpenPGP/GPG support like Kopete,
SIM, Gabber, Ayttm, Tkabber or Psi is something for you. The channels to
the Jabber servers are secured with SSL/TLS links and the communication
is additionally encrypted with GnuPG keys.
I personally prefer Psi :)

@_subject: PGPnotes 
i'm not a Notes user, but i'm interested in what you are thinking about
PGPnotes, a Notes Plugin for GnuPG/WinPT?
Perhaps here is a Notes user, who can write something about his experiences with
PGPnotes? :)

@_subject: [PGP-USERS] PGP Desktop Home - Cost of upgrade 
Hi Erpo,
From the PGP 8 license:
"What You Cannot Do. Under this license you do not have the right to, and you
may not:
use executable code versions of PGP software programs created by compiling
these source code files for any purpose or reason other than verifying that
there are no unknown vulnerabilities
No. Today, they can use two shells under Windows with extensions for
the explorer, a lot of gui's exist for other plattforms. GnuPG is well
integrated in a lot of mail clients and in some instant messengers or they can
use their own scripts for the console. They can get get help from a lot of
manuals, howto's and so on...
