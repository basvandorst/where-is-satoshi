Yes, for some reason these keys have been working fine. After decrypting
different file types and rebooting the computer several times, the keys
still work. After this, I have A LOT of backup copies :-) I'm not sure how
it worked either.

Can you actually use those keys? If you described the original problem
accurately, this should have required you to use your backup copies. I'm
not sure how this worked.
You do have backup copies don't you?  ;-)
