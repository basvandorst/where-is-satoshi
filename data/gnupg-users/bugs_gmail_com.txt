@_subject: Where to put "export-pka" output in DNS? 
I want to make use of PKA, I saw a few blogs [1] where they did this in TXT
DNS records. However, this seems to not work anymore. When I issue `gpg2
--export-options export-pka --export $keyid` I get an output. But it's
unclear where I should put this output in DNS. A TXT record? Or a CERT
record [2]? Something else? I would like to hear some comments about this.
The TXT record method has my preference since I do not have CERT records at
my registrar. Is there some official documentation about this?
[1] [2] Kind regards,
