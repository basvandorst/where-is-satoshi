"shred" on debian unstable works fine, i have no problems deleting
files +100MB... since months ...
that's the only way i know (if you are not using an hex-edit) to
really delete your files.
with gpg it has - in my eyes - nothing to do ...

I tried to compile my version (1.3.6) with this "how-to" [1] but it
didn't work out, or better, it doesn't show bzip2 (or sth similar) on
the version output (of the win32 version) ...
mybe i can compile 1.2.4 (or the 1.2.5rc2) it with bzip(2) support, if
it works ... dont really know
