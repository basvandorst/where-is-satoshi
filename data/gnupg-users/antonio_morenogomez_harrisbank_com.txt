This is a question or trouble report when using gnupg.
When using the following command:   this is for gnupg1.06
gpg -r mykey --yes --always-trust --encrypt myfile
when myfile is                this is the output file
abc.txt                       abc.gpg
abc                     abc.gpg
abc.stu.txt             abc.stu.txt.gpg
abc.xyz.exe.txt               abc.xyz.exe.txt.gpg
when abc.txt is used as the input file the expected file would had been
abc.txt.gpg but instead I get abc.gpg,  which is the same as the output for
encrypting abc
Is this a bug or is this the way this software was designed?    Assuming
this is wrong is there any fix for that or any detour?
When using regular pgp  trying to encrypt abc.txt  the output file is
abc.txt.pgp which is different from  the pair abc ----> abc.pgp
thank you.
