Apache runs with a different user than you tested before.
It has got to have access to that key and know where it can find it.

What is the additional gain to having an unencrypted /boot partition on
the same device? As I see it, only "boring" data gets ever written in
cleartext to the harddrive then.
And if the customs clone my harddrive, they can just try to bruteforce the
passphrase, whether the boot partition is encrypted or not.
Ah, wait, they can ask me to decrypt the data, so we have to upload those
sensitive documents to Google Docs (!) [1]...

Hi all,

The kernelconcept cards at least can also be used with a key "backup".
If you store that backup safely, you can still use your key when you put
your smart card into washing mashine AND dryer (or it breaks for
whatever reason) but you don't risk it being stolen with your laptop.

Hello Jonathan,
People can only help you if you provide all the necessary details.
Most important:
- Used Operating System (and version)
- GPA/Kleopatra version (from where did you get it?)
Best wishes

Hi Stefan,
You know that you use snake oil then?
These services decrypt your e-mails to "protect you against viruses" [0].

Hi all,
Did anyone open a bug with Debian (best with proposing a fix)?

Hi Teemu,
I'd consider it a bug if updating a package does not trigger reloading all
necessary services.

Hi all,
You might try exporting your keys and importing them into a completely new pubring.

Hi Matthias,
This makes your setup depend on a suid binary.
There have been some security issues about that, so maybe it's wise to revise that decision?
For example:

Hi Daniel,
The setuid binary is called xserver-xorg-legacy and can be installed in
buster (new installs don't get it afaik, but I'm not sure about upgrading):
Matthias explicitly mentioned he used startx so I think this is

Hi all,
If you can identify someone by data, it IS personal data.
As many email addresses are firstname.lastname@ they are already directly
