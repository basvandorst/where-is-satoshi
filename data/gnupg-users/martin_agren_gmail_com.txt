@_subject: New results against SHA-1 
2009/5/1 Atom Smasher :
No, not bigger, but better. :) SHA-2 should be better, but since it's
conceptually quite similar to SHA-1, one could be somewhat worried...
SHA-3, on the other hand, will be very well-studied when it becomes a
standard, so we should in a way be able to trust it as much as we
trust AES. Google "SHA-3 competition" for more information.
Take care!
