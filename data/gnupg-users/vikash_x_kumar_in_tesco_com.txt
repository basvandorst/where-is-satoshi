@_subject: Encrypting File with passphrase 
Hi Team,
Could you please help me to understand the following query.
We are using gpg encryption method for encryption and decryption in our application. We have generated the keypairs on server A and public key is imported on server B also a passphrase say "Strange" was provided while generating the key.
Now I am trying to encrypt the file on server B using this public key, I am able to do so without any matter I pass the passphrase or not.
So my ask is, if a key pair is generated with passphrase it won't restrict the encryption incase incorrect passphrase or no passphrase is passed? Also I was able to encrypt the file on server B by providing any random passphrase, but decryption is possible with correct passphrase only.
Many Thanks for your help.
Vikash Kumar
