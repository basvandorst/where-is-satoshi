Isn't bzip2 compression supported any longer?
Because with 1.1.2 i get:
gpg --version
gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.7
Komprimierung: nicht komprimiert (Z0), ZIP (Z1), ZLIB (Z2)
gpg2 --version
gpg (GnuPG) 2.0.6
Komprimierung: nicht komprimiert (Z0), ZIP (Z1), ZLIB (Z2)
And i miss Z3. With
personal-compress-preferences Z3 Z2 Z1
default-preference-list ...Z3 Z2 Z1
gpg complained after the first start.

What? From gpg4win 1.0.9/GnuPG 1.4.7:
Compression: Uncompressed (Z0), ZIP (Z1), ZLIB (Z2), BZIP2 (Z3)
I have used Z3 all the time with former versions.

@_subject: Error with keyring 
today, i got error messages, i've never seen before
gpg: packet(1) with unknown version 8
gpg: keyring_get_keyblock: read error: invalid packet
gpg: keydb_get_keyblock failed: invalid keyring
and haven't found something about them in the web.
Key operations aren't possible any longer (complete --list-keys, delete a key,
encrypt with Enigmail and Thunderbird...)
GnuPG version: 1.4.6 under Windows XP
Is the whole keyring corrupted or can i do something?
Because i have backups of my keys, it's not a problem to use new keyrings ;)
