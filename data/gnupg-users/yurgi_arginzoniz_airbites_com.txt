@_subject: Compiling gnupg for mipsel 
Hello there
I'd be very pleased if anyone could help me with this issue. I'll explain
my situation:
- I have a Linksys WRT54G with openWRT on it: that is, a wireless router
with linux on it.
- I need gpg for it: it has a mipsel processor.
- I have successfuly compiled gpg, but it amazingly takes 3,8MB of disk
- I only have 580KB free space on my box's flash memory.
I've tried compiling it with everything disabled (--disable-[all de
variations]) and finally reduce it to 3,6MB. When I look at the size of
the x86 linux binaries, I see they only use 600KB aprox.
Why is it? Can I reduce the size of it? Does anyone already have a
compiled version for mips archiecture??
Any help is very appreciated.
If possible, post it to both the mailing list and my address:

Hello Neil
First of all I really apreciate your help, I look forward to trying it.
But I've taken a look at 'man strip' and read that 'strip --help' would
give me information about the architectures it accepts, and I can't see
mips; does it mean I can't strip mipsel objects?
This is probably because I'm cross-compiling the gpg from a x386-debian
box to mipsel, and so, the strip I have is for x386?
Is the stripping need to be done in all the object (.o) files of the gnupg
or in one precise file?
Thank you very much again

from source, it's usually left to you because if you are developing
code, you need
go from
preparing the package.
