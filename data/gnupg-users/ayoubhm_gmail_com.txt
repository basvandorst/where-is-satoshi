Thanks. This exposes to me how little I know and it will take me time to absorb it. None of this information is in anything I read. Nothing comes close. I will not come to grips with it with the kind of reading material I have. Can you please suggest some good tutorial and reference material preferably free (probably mutually exclusive requirements) that will bring me up to your level or close to it please.
The material I come across is just like silly preschool stuff with 1/4 truth which keeps you ill informed and miss informed and throws you off track. They over simplify and drain education out of you making you zombie.

Sorry for going off list and messing everybody up. Now I disserve punishment. Sorry for the html too.

My current intended usage is in non-interactive mode, completely.
I can remove them from the gpg.conf but I would have to issue them
every time. My understanding is that non-interactive mode requires
those commands.
I selected "expert" mode because I am using ED2599 incrpytion that is
available only in this mode (I know, I am newbie)
All the config lines I showed are in my user config.
A few days ago, my set up, which is still in development phase,
worked until my short lived gpg keys expired. I fell in deep ***** when
I created new keys. It all worked, with the passphrase-file option and before I fell. Can you pull this dumb newbie out?

I have probably put my gpg environment/program in a state it cannot come out of. I want to do what cowards do. I want to uninstall gpg and start all over again, escaping from the mess I put my self into somehow. With the advice you gave me I should do better next the time, and hopefully? stay out of trouble.
I have not given anybody any of the IDs yet. And besides, the intended application is non interactive and also does not communicate anything. It hides everything and itself from ever body and ever thing, let alone the keys (or at least that is the intention if a manage to keep me out of trouble.

I understand it can be frustrating, especially if nobody has a deciding vote or Vito power or moderator power. Someone should have have veto power and anybody with other ideas can always fork and do his own thing. That way it may probably work. A tyrant can stay on course and others fork and be their own tyrant and are free to produce something better.
The moderators on this list (I do not know who they are) have been tyrannical excluding some of my posts; I am not bitter or resentful. I have to live up to standard and my posts have to be kind and gentle so as not to burden those trying to help me for free; and amenable to support by helping whoever is helping me. If there was no tyrant I could have caused nuisance. Documentation needs a tyrant too.

Sorry for seeming to be "spreading unjustified accusations". What I said was meant to encourage that sort of "benign tyranny", I was not complaining; or at least that was not my intention.

The same thing happens when I give the option --no-batch on the command The problem seems to have gone away when I moved the config option inentry-mode loopback
to the $HOME/.gnupg/gpg.conf from the $HOME/.ngupg/gpg-agent.conf
In the final version when development ends, I am going to have "no-batch" in the config because the final version works
non-interactively (and through the API.) That is why I have it in the config now.
Thanks guys,

@_subject: Why is there no secret key? 
With API I mean something like GPGME.
This is what came across to me:
1) It is preferable to have "--batch" on command line even in unattended operation; and not in the gpg.conf file?
2) --pinentry-mode when needed goes in gpg.conf
3) --allow-loopback-pinentry when needed goes in gpg-agent.conf
New related question:
Is it true that command line parameters only go to gpg and gpg-agent?

A human environment went insane and uncontrollable. The system is intended to bring sanity back and maintain it.
Client programs access server(s) for real-time encryption or decryption. Network of servers that may be located at different geographic locations. Each server would need keys that need to be protected. The servers are in a hierarchy communicating with each other securely as needed. Horrible environment to protect.
Server design may need to be specialized with immunity to tampering and abuse. Operator and admin may need to be on constant monitoring/surveillance with biometric ID. Equipment may need to be identifiable and be under constant monitoring and surveillance.
Grateful for all suggestions. Keep them coming. I have a lot to learn.

I understand. I do not expect to to solve these problems over here, but I am getting useful suggestions and yours is one of them. It may seem a little to you but I find the responses enlightening. You are probably concerned that I may not get adequate returns for the time I spend here: I appreciate that. That is a mark of a good character you have.
Although it has not been my intention to advertise, I got a few good responses off list as a side effect. I will engage people formally as you suggest when the time comes for it.
Before that happens. I am coding a prototype right now that is not going to be inadequate; but all this will help me arrive at a better understanding, help demonstrate basic ideas and hopefully prepare me and others for the production of a better specifications, better action and better product.
I apologize if I am encroaching.

You are absolutely right. I am naive; but I am learning. A time will come
when I will involve experts formally, and what I am learning here will help
me talk and plan more intelligently.
You are also right on another account. I have not defined the problem for
you sufficiently.
Even though I have stated on the list that internal threat is probably than external threat, most of the responses seem to me to address external
I will find a way of giving you more information, preserving confidentiality
where necessazry.
