@_subject: Obtaining different script results than via command line 
============================== START ==============================
I am using gpg on a Linux system.
When I am using the following command line to create an encrypted output
I get a compatible output file.
gpg --armor --recipient "AFG_PROD"  --output file.txt.pgp --always-trust
--encrypt test.txt
When I use the same command line plus a -batch element in a script, the
output file is slightly larger than the command line version and my
recipient can't decode it.
gpg --armor --batch --recipient "AFG_PROD"  --output file.txt.pgp
--always-trust --encrypt file.txt
(also tried without the - -batch)  gpg --armor  --recipient "AFG_PROD"
--output file.txt.pgp --always-trust --encrypt file.txt
All other aspects remain the same:
*	User
*	Directory
*	Input file
I have searched extensively and can find no reason for it to do this.
Does anyone have any recommendations as to what I am overlooking?
