I've installed gpg 1.0.6 on a FreeBSD box, but I'm having key problems.
It seems to be mangling public keys. I import a public key (for example, one generated with PGP on an NT box) into gpg, then export it from gpg, and then compare the two: they are different. The first half of the key seems correct, but then it goes completely different.
I don't know if the keys are being imported incorrectly or what, but I do know that when I encrypt something with a public key that was created using PGP on an NT box, the recipient cannot decrypt it.
Any ideas, suggestions, etc are welcome! Thanks... --- Eric
