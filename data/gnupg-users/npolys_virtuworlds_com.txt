@_subject: problem in keyring setup 
hello all,
I am having a difficult time trying to find info on this project.
where are the maillist archives please? when trying to import and delete keys to the gpg keyring,
I get this repeated message:
"gpg: waiting for lock (hold by 27748 - probably dead) "...
I am not able to clear my keyring and import a PGP public one onto it...
ALSO: what is the the unique userID?
the key number, the text comment, the email address?

@_subject: embedding gpg for pgp compliant mail 
Howdy all,
does this sound familiar?
web Form -> encryption ->email -> pgp mail front end (mac/pc)
  I am trying to write gpg encrypted data into a mail message for a pgp
It is using a PGP generated public key which is imported and signed.
I am using a public key which encrypts fine when working with local files.
I've come up with a perl script that works similarly to PGPMail/formail:
I open a couple of filehandles and print the temp file's contents into the
body of the mail.
the problem is, even with the same parameter calls, it is ending up writing
in strange characters that are not recognized by pgp or similar to the local
file encryption.
I wonder if i am omitting any body headers or something?
can anyone help?
"|/gpg/location/gpg --output $gpgtmp --cipher-algo
3des --quiet --textmode --recipient $CONFIG{'pgpuserid'} --encrypt
options file (compiled from clemen's thread):
disable-pubkey-algo ELG
disable-cipher-algo blowfish
s2k-cipher-algo cast5
digest-algo sha1
compress-algo 1
thanks and hippy holidays!
all the best,
