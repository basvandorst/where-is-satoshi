@_subject: GPGCOM or alternative 
I'm looking for a way to support GPG in my Windows application but the gpgcom source code doesn't compile with Visual Studio.  Can anyone tell me where to download the binary?  (Or mail it to me directly.)
If GPGCOM is no longer supported, what alternatives are there for the Windows platform besides the command line executable?
I'm a GPG newbie, so any help is appreciated.
Thanks in advance,
