Hash: SHA1
I am looking for a mail server who can en-decrypt pgp messages.
I want to use it in a lan. Send mails with smtp clear to this
mailserver. And the mailserver checks keyserves for reciepients
key encrypts the message and send it to the destination.
Incoming Mails are being decryptet with the privat key and sent
to the internal destination.
Does someone know a way to do this. Mayby on win32 environment?
But Linux also.

@_subject: Option 
Is it possible to set a default encryption key (additional to the used)
I would like to make:
gpg -e -a -r Test
Now it should encrypt to Test AND with my key.
ok, i can use:
gpg -e -a -r Test -r  Original
is it possible to add
recipient Original  to my gpg.conf file.. or could  there be some errors w=
hit this settings?
