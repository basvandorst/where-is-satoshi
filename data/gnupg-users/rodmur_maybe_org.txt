@_subject: What are fingerprints? 
There is no way to guarantee they are unique.  Once they are significantly larger than the key ID, then there is less chance that there will be a duplicate fingerprint (I don't know what the probabilities are, but I imagine that they are relatively small).  Only the whole key is unique (unless
someone uses your id and pass phrase to make another).  The fingerprint is a convenience, it is simpler for the user to check a whole key.  If meet someone or are talking to them on the phone, and you are fairly confident who are talking to is who they say they are, then if you have them read their fingerprint, you can have a relatively high degree of confidence that you are using the correct key.  Obviously if there is a fingerprint match, or you
want to be absolutely sure, then you'll want to check the entire key.

@_subject: secondary name or id 
So how do we create a secondary name or id on our GPG key?  For example
with PGP 2.6.2, I had a key like:
pub  1024/E26EC5FD 1997/01/14 Dale A. Harris           Key fingerprint =  E0 82 E6 09 3B E5 07 E9  01 8F A8 17 F1 B8 53 4F                               SCA Webmaster                               SCA Webmaster                               Dale Harris Several different id's.  Is it possible to do that in GnuPG?

Well, it'd probably be best burned to a CD and stored in a very safe
place.  Printing it out on paper wouldn't necessarily be a bad idea,
think of it was a backup, of course keep it somewhere like a safe deposit box
or safe.

Check your path, maybe there is a gpg in /usr/bin
Do a:
type gpg
or whereis gpg

So what... "gay" doesn't exactly mean the same thing as it did 40 years ago, either.  Things change, words are co-opted, get over it, grow up,

Sorry Tony, in haphazard style, I didn't read all of your original post.  I was aiming at the wrong target.  Again, my apologizes (and I'll
shut up now).

You'll probably have better luck with gcc.  So you might want to try
compiling that up first.  Especially since it does appear that you are
using the optional, non-free HPUX ANSI C compiler.
