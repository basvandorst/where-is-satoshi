@_subject: Secret key Questions regarding expiration and backing up 
Hi there - pretty new with GPG, but have been getting going with it
without much issue. I'm just curious about a few best practices and so on.
1) Should you set an expiration on your secret key? Or do most people just
secure it appropriately (with no expiration)?
2) If you do have the secret key expire, and I have a backup of it (file
format) - And for some reason I forget to extend it before expiration -
can I still extend it?
I did a few tests exporting a secret key before and after extending the
expiration date - and obviously the file contents changed. I just want to
be sure that I have a good backup of it, however follow best practices.
Thank you.

So for clarification then:
If there are no expiry dates on secret keys, what does this output mean then?
 --list-secret-keys
sec   2048R/xxxxxxxx 2014-10-30 [expires: 2017-10-31]
And my next question is then... When I exported my secret key and moved it
to another machine - why did the contents of the export to file change
between the extension of the expiration date? (I exported before and after
to test).
Thanks in advance!

When I run the command:
gpg --list-secret-keys
sec   2048R/XXXXXXXXX 2014-10-30 [expires: 2016-10-29]
It shows the expiration date as: [expires: 2016-10-2.
But then when I edit the key with:
gpg --edit-key XXXXXXXXX

pub  2048R/XXXXXXXXX  created: 2014-10-30  expires: 2017-10-31  usage: SC
                               trust: ultimate      validity: ultimate
sub  2048R/XXXXXXXXX  created: 2014-10-30  expires: 2017-10-31  usage: E
The keys show: expires: 2017-10-31 (which is what I expected).
I had done to extend:
# extend the expiration date on your key (Be sure to review sub keys).
$ gpg --edit-key gpg> expire
gpg> save
# extend the expiration date on your sub key
$ gpg --edit-key gpg> key gpg> expire
gpg> save
I just want to be safe that my key expiration was updated properly.
Thank you in advance.
