@_subject: Verifying GnuPG-signed documents with PGP 5.0i 
5.0i is very old and very buggy. Hmmm, it is nearly 2 years old.
Did you keep the --force-v3-sigs in your options file?
Well, it does not claim to be compatible with PGP 5 or whatever but
to be an OpenPGP implementaion.  PGP 5.x is far away to be in
compliance with RFC2440 and 6 has still some problems with OpenPGP.
Your message uses compression algorithm 2 which pgp 5 does not understand,
if you would have encrypted to someone elses key (created by pgp5.0), gpg
would have use algorithm 1 because algo 2 is probably not listed in the
recipients compress algo preferences.  But if you don't encrypt, gpg
uses a default algorithm.  Compress algorithm yields better compression
rates than 1.  You can override this with the option --compress-algo 1 or don't use
compression at all (-z 0)

Maybe I can do this if a file gets only signed.  The problem with
algorithm 1 is, that it is not documented and there is only a
undocumented feature in zlib to allow this old algorithm.  Algorithm 2
is well defined in RFC195{0,1}

GnuPG will ask for it when there is not valid.

Thanks for the tar file.  I have anylzed it and it turns out to be BUG
 - I have now tracked it down:
Here is what PGP 2.6.3in hashes:
MDfile0_len:  43 6F 6E 74 65 6E 74 2D 54 72 61 6E 73 66 65 72

MD_addbuffer: 01 37 40 08 27
This is what GnuPG hashes:
As you can see, PGP first tries the same as GnuPG but then it
hashes an extra CR which yields a valid signature.
It is not easy to implement this strange behaviour with GnuPG because
we can't rewind the input data.  The solution I can see is to add
an extra hash context so that both versions get hashed.  I can't make a promise to implement that.

you read the end of the line.  You can't do this if there is a miy of
tabs and spaces.  I applied a couple of patches to detect pgp2 generated clearsigs and
to emit such bogus clearsig  if either all recipient keys are old v3
RSA keys or option --rfc1991 is used.
