@_subject: secret key not available 
hI,
I'm new to this GPG usage. I dont need any internals. I am running a shell
script in which following line causes error :
gpg --yes --sign message.txt
It shows the following error:
gpg: no default secret key: secret key not available
gpg: signing failed: secret key not available
How can I solve this error, without modifying the command? (do I need to
change any settings). I am using gpg version (GnuPG) 1.4.16
is giving the output
I Tried with --default-key Still it dint work!!
Any suggestion to get past this error will be greatly helpful.
Thank you
