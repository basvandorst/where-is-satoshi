@_subject: Theoretical and maybe stupid questions about security 
I wonder how easily my private key(s) ('secgring.gpg') can be cracked
once somebody get access to it.
Q: Is the number of 2.8 billions password tries per day from the FAQs
Q: Is the password stored as an hash and can it be cracked using Rainbow
Tables? Is it maybe salted?
