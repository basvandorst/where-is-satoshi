hi all,
i do not clearly understand the difference between .asc , .gpg , .sign ,
.sig , cert and do not know the official_usage & conventions.
i made my own research before but ... unsuccessfully.
i built my curve keys using these commands_options (added a sign subkey
and gnupg auto-signed it), armor my public one then export it as file :
$ gpg --expert --full-gen-key
$ gpg --quick-add-key fpr ed25519 sign
$ gpg --list-sigs
$ gpg --output public.key --armor --export fpr
$ gpg --armor --export you at example.com
key is also a certificate if i understood well what i read.
it looks like :
--- is it not the same ?
i do not clearly understand the difference between .cert .asc , .gpg ,
.sign , .sig and do not know the official_usage & conventions.
- could i rename the public.* as .sign and what is the difference using
.sig ?
- could i export the public.key on the hkps-server or must i use the
public.asc ?
- could i rename public.asc in public.gpg2 ?
... and the same questions come in my mind about the *SUMS files.
... and the same confusion about user-id , fpr , e-mail :
--- is it not the same ?
if there are strict conventions/rules it should be a better idea to
clarify & compartment the usage no ?
have you a link where all these embarrassing questions are clearly
explained ?
OFF-TOPIC : could gnupg add a special option in his settings/option :
quantum resistant ?
I mean an embedded version of codecrypt.
