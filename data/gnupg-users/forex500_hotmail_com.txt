@_subject: Open or Decrypt an SEF file ? 
Hello sir,
I have a file that compressed in an .SEF format, I was wondering if you know how to open an SEF file or maybe
you can direct me to someone who can ? It contains trading indicators
but without open source code they can't be used and I can't see the
source code without opening this file. Thank you for taking time to
read this, please get back to me... You can E-mail me at
forex500 at hotmail.com Hotmail? has ever-growing storage! Don?t worry about storage limits.
