@_subject: Trouble with keyservers 
Hi.  I generated my key with the assistance of an experimental program called 'gnupg-pkcs11-scd' and my Aladdin eToken and I think the key that was generated is somehow messed up.  When I exchange my public key with friends manually, they can encrypt to me just fine.  But when they grab from a keyserver they can't.
Can someone here help me determine what's wrong with the key that comes from the keyserver, and help me narrow down the issue to the keyservers, gnupg, or Here's what I see: (I try the same command twice.  One after using the keyserver, one after importing an armored ascii key)

It is NOT certain that the key belongs to the person named
in the user ID.  If you *really* know what you are doing,
you may answer the next question with yes.
Use this key anyway? (y/N) y
