@_subject: Change comments? 
I recently created a key but would like to change the data I included in the comments, I believe we can use the "updpref" command to change the preferences, any idea how to change the comment field?

@_subject: key history on keyservers 
In an attempt to change the comment (which can not be removed) for my key, I did the following:
1- Removed existing signatures from my key so it would be as it was 2- Added a new address to the key using the adduid command
3- Made this address the primary address
4- removed the address which included the comments I wanted to removed
Locally I could view the signature on the key and everything looked great exactly as it should have been.  I then re-added another address and it also is fine when I look at the key locally on my machine.
Next I uploaded the key to a key server to update the new "version", to my surprise the key kept its history.  Now it appears very messy (still usable) as it includes all the changes I made to it.  I am somewhat surprised by this behavior as it seem we can remove addresses and signatures from a key but the key server appears to keep the history.
Any idea why it is set up this way?
Hope this makes sense..
