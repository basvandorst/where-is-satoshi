@_subject: SIGEXPIRED question 
Under what circumstances is a SIGEXPIRED status line emitted? The
DETAILS file in the GnuPG distribution says the following:
     SIGEXPIRED
            The signature key has expired.  No arguments yet.
However, I find that even if the signature key has not expired,
SIGEXPIRED is emitted if there is another expired key in the key ring
with the same user id as the signature key. Is this the correct

Enigmail, a GnuPG "plugin" for Mozilla which has been under development for some time, has now reached a state of practical usability with the Mozilla 0.9.9 release. It allows you to send or receive encrypted mail using the Mozilla mailer and GPG. Enigmail is open source and dually licensed under GPL/MPL. You can download and install the software from the website Enigmail is cross-platform like Mozilla, although binaries are supplied only for the Win32 and Linux-x86 platforms on the website.At the moment there is no version of Enigmail available for Netscape 6.2 or earlier, which are based on much older versions of Mozilla.There will be a version available for the next Netscape release, which is expected to be based on Mozilla 1.0.
You may post enigmail-specific comments to the Enigmail newsgroup/mailing list at mozdev.org
