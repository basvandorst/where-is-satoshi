hello all , i'm trying to import my belgium eID card but it only imports the belgium Root CA
this is the output i get

if have the following gpg-agent.conf

# GPGConf edited this configuration file.
# It will disable options before this marked block, but it will
# never change anything below these lines.
but for some reason it doesn't trust the root and citizen CA. I also didn't got a question to trust the
CA certificates ?
How can i fix this ?
Also , the current scdaemon fails most of the time with my acr38 card reader. i'm using the pcsc driver
but most of the time i get Card errors. The card works fine with firefox and thunderbird which uses the belgium pkcs11 library

@_subject: Can't read belgium eID card using gpgsm 
I'm in the process of trying out my new belgium eID card with different tools under linux.
It works fine with my browser (some government sites use the new card) , the linux tools provided by the government  , i can use the pkcs15 tools from opensc to read the card but gpgsm cant read the card :-(
i upgraded all tooling to following versions :
opensc = 0.11.0
pcsc-lite = 1.3.1
libksba = 0.9.15-3
gnupg = 1.9.22
run gpgsm --learn-card , i get errors reading the card.
trying to use scdaemon manually i get following error :
luc scdaemon --server

hello werner ,
I tried your suggestion and it didn't help. My card reader is a ACR38 USB Reader .
I noticed that when is stop the pcscd , the active led keep flashing the same way as when there is no card inserted.
When is run without pcscd i get follow loggin :
scdaemon -v --server --debug-ccid-drive --debug-all --log-file ~/sc.log    2006-09-06 20:54:13 scdaemon[23241] handler for fd -1 started

I have the impression that the internal ccid driver is not recognising my USB card reader ( idVendor=072f, idProduct=9000 )
when i do the same with pcscd running  , i get
2006-09-06 20:57:32 scdaemon[23314] handler for fd -1 started

when i execute the LEARN command , i see some activity on the reader but this ends with this failure. you can see this in the logging where the error appears around 3 seconds after the learn command
Is it possible to use gpg2sm with the pcscd stack for reading the card ?

@_subject: Can't read belgium eID card using gpgsm 
while trying the ccid driver , i noticed that the ACR38 has 2 kind of readers , a ccid reader and one using the pcsc driver. mine was not a ccid (ACR38U) so a couldn't use this one.
i than update mu pcsc driver but still no success this one is given for "free" by our goverment to children on the age of 12/13  so my daughter got one when she got here eID card.
I would not expect "high" quality but this one will be used allot here in while testing with the beidgui ( a gui to read the Eid card) i could read the card a few seconds after using this gui ???
after some testing , i disabled the beidbelgium.be-beidpcscd daemon. Don't ask me what it is or do but it seems to block exclusive access to the card after this step , gpgsm --learn-card worked. I tested it to sign a file and used KMail to send mail that where signed by the Eid card. :-)
 thanks for the support
