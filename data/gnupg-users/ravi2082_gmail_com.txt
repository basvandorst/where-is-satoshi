@_subject: Decrypting 2 files which were merged into 1 
Hi All,
We have been using gnupg to decrypt files pulled from a customer FTP
server. On the customer side, the software used is some financial
gateway software which sets flags for each of the files.
Based on those flags we are given permission to pull those and
decrypt. Sometimes there are 2 encrypted files placed on the customer
side with the same name, not sure how thats possible on that financial
gateway.So we have 2 encrypted files at their end with same name, say
suppose one of 2 MB and the other 3 MB, when we fetch those at one go
using FTP we are getting a combined encrypted file of 5 MB.
This 5 MB file is then decrypted using our gnupg key to get the data
out of it. Now when we decrypt, we are only seeing one set of data and
other 3 MB data of the second file is lost.
We are using the following command to decrypt
echo "password" | gpg --verbose --no-tty --no-secmem-warning
--passphrase-fd 0 "$fpgp"
And we get the following trace
stderr> gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=42)
Though we get data of 1 file out of it correctly.
Is there a way to decrypt the merged file correctly and extract entire
data of both encrypted files within it correctly using gnupg?

Sorry for asking this again.
We have an automated job which pulls the file from the client machine.
Once the file has been fetched, we get the merged file(if there are 2
files present with same name on the client machine) directly. How can
we separate the 2 encrypted files from the merged file? Is there a way
to specifically extract 1 encrypted file out of that merged file and
the other separately again? I mean some params,commands etc?
Thanks in advance
