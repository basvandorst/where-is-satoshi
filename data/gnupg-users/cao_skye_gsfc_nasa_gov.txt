Dear Sir/Madam:
   We currently use Portland C and Fortran compiler (pgcc/pgf77 pgf90) to
compile our codes. We want to use GNU C and Fortran compiler (gcc) to
compile the same codes. But the codes can not be compiled successfully.
Can you tell us why and how we fix some problems? Should we buy some thing
from you GNU?
   MY office number is: 301-8672177
   Sincerely,
   Degui Cao
