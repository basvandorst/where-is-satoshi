@_subject: ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64 error when running 
Hi all,
I am trying to update GPG 2.2.3 to 2.2.4 and I get the error below
when I run the make command. I have no knowledge in coding, so the
error makes no sense to me.
Can anyone make sense of it and explain how I can fix the error? I
tried to Google the error with no results relating to GPG. Let me know
if you need any additional information from me.
I'm using a Mac running High Sierra 10.13.2, Xcode 9.2 is installed
with the command line tools. I had no problem installing GPG 2.2.3.
