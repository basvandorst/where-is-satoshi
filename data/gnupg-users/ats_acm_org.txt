And likewise, when said software calls GPG to verify the license key,
the user can substitute a modified version which returns what the
program wants to hear.

I see only one functional benefit you would get over using MIME,
signing and encrypting headers in a natural way.  Other than that,
everything you mentioned can be done _now_.  It's just done in a more
verbose way.
So, what else would you gain from this?  You'd suddenly need to add an
XML parser to every program which touched email.  And I don't know how
many OSes come with an XML parsing library, so you'd end up having
multiple ones being installed and in memory on any given computer.
Sounds like a terrible cost if you aren't going to get much out of it.

Ah, TM....
Before doing anything with TM, I'd suggest checking on SEMI-gnus (or
one of the varients thereof).  TM has been dead for a long time, and
SEMI is its descendant.  It may be capable of using gpg.

You don't quite have the equivalence.  It's not needing crypto
signatures on cron output.  It's storing a decryption key where people
can get at it.
You want to have gpg sign things automatically, without any
interaction, right?  To do this, you think that you need to have a key
protected by a passphrase, and that somehow (say, by getting it from a
file), your cron job will give the passphrase to gpg.  Werner's saying
that's absolutely no more protection than having a key without a
What's protecting the file you keep your password in from being
viewed?  Probably, unix file permissions, difficulty in logging into
the machine, etc.  What's protecting a key without a passphrase from
being stolen?  Exactly the same thing.  So you aren't losing any
security by just getting rid of the passphrase.
A passphrase normally provides protection for a key because if you get
the key, you don't get the passphrase.  It's in someone's head
somewhere.  If someone breaks into my computer and gets my secret
keyring, they can't use it because they'd have to come to my cube and
rough me up a bit.  But if the passphrase is stored on the same
machine as the key, there's nothing stopping them.
The analogy to DVDs is that they have a Content Scrambling System (or
whatever it's called)... but the key is stored on the DVD itself.
That's why it's been broken.

How about, just because most people use things other than FreeBSD,
where this is possible?
Every Unix I've ever worked on lets you see other people's command
line arguments.  Apparently, this is no longer the case on recent
FreeBSDs, but what other Unices restrict this info as well?
I suppose you could add a configure option to allow passing the
passphrase in on the command line.  Making it a hassle to enable would
make it more likely that the programmer would think about the risks
involved.  But allowing it willy-nilly would probably result in a lot
of usage by people who didn't realize that anyone could see it.
