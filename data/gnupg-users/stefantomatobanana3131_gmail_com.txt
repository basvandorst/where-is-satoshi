Hi All,
I've installed GnuPG on Win XP with the GPG4Win package. Seems to be mostly
working. But I've found that the DirMngr service fails to run. The System
Event Log shows:
"The DirMngr service hung on starting."
"The DirMngr service terminated unexpectedly."
I have no further info so far. A google of the error found one other user
posting the problem, but no answers to date. Anyone know how I would proceed
to track down this problem?
