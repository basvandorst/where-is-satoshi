@_subject: good practices when using gpg --symmetric? 
Dear all
Every few months I use GPG to encrypt a bunch of files which I keep as a
backup on other people's computers yet wish to keep private. From reading
the GPG manual, I understand that using GPG the single most important
consideration is a good passphrase.
But I have also been thinking how the following factors affect the security
of my files:
- number and size of files: is there a difference (security-wise) between
encrypting 10,000 small files or encrypting a single, larger archive
containing all of them?
- file formats: should I be concerned about an attacker knowing which format
a particular file is in? Files in a certain format typically have a magic
number in the beginning or have other predefined content.
Are there any other issues one should keep in mind to safely use gpg in
--symmetric mode?
I wish I knew more about cryptography, and sorry to bother you with such
simple questions!

Dear Robert, David,
Thank you both for your advice.
Not really, but I wonder why you're using --symmetric rather than the
It is very possible that I have been using --symmetric for no good reason. I
thought of this choice as 'being able to access my files by having access to
the encrypted files and knowing the passphrase' vs 'additionally needing
another piece of data which must be kept separately from the encrypted
files'. The second option might be more secure, but also increases the risk
of me not being able to access my stuff when need arises.
Does this make sense or should I be using a key pair isntead of --symmetric?
