@_subject: decrypt problem 
I have encrypted a large file (280MB) with gpg v1.4.2 on suse 10.0.
By decrypting the file I get the following error message:
gpg: Problem reading source (10429120 bytes remaining)
gpg: handle plaintext failed: Dateilesefehler
gpg: Warnung: Verschl?sselte Botschaft ist manipuliert worden!
The last line is in German, basically it says that the text may be manipulated by a 3rd party.
Can I handle such huge files with gpg at all?
If so, what is the cause of this error because I am quite sure that the file had not been manipulated in the meantime.
Any help is very much appreciated because this is a backup file.
