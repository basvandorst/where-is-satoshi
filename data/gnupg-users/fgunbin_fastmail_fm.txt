Some things which can be fixed:
- page url is  , while
  it's certainly not "cvs" now.  Or was "vcs" meant?
- A little typo: "You must run ./autogen.sh before running the
  ./configure in the way suggested by the putput of autogen.sh."
                                          ^^^^^^
- libgpg-error seems to be hosted at
  git://git.gnupg.org/libgpg-error.git, but it's not mentioned in "Other
  Hosted Projects"

Sorry for this, these are my local problems with toolchain (binutils vs
macOS command line tools).

Which version of GnuPG are you using?  I have 2.2.17 and it works with
empty gpg-agent.conf and just this line in .emacs:
(setq epg-pinentry-mode 'loopback)

Hm, I see this in NEWS for 27.1 (unreleased master):
*** 'epa-pinentry-mode' is renamed to 'epg-pinentry-mode'.
It now applies to epg functions as well as epa functions.
So maybe try

Sorry, previous message went unfinished.
I see this in NEWS for Emacs 27.1 (unreleased master).

So maybe try epa-pinentry-mode instead?
