@_subject: importing mac pubkey into gpg??? 
I've received a PGP 2.x key that was generated on a macintosh, which I'm
trying to import to GPG 1.2.1-2 on debian (x86).
I don't know anything about mac file formats, but what I do see is that
the file isn't ascii-armoured.
Can someone please tell me - what steps do i need to take to import this
key? What macintosh file conversion commands and arguments do i need to
run first?
Thanks for your help
