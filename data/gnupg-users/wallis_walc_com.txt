@_subject: gpg and apacheSSL problem 
I'm running gpg 1.0.6 on Linux with Apache SSL 1.3.6. I'm trying to
set up secure email from the server to my clinet via Gnupg and
pgpmail. However, on this system, the secure server is set to run as a
userid other than my own, with the end result that gpg can't get the
keyrings. Here's the output from gpg:
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
gpg: loaded digest 2
gpg: using secondary key E9E9B0EB instead of primary key 9AA75E9D
gpg: E9E9B0EB: no info to calculate a trust probability
gpg: no valid addressees
gpg: [stdin]: encryption failed: no such user id
This configuration works fine from the non-secure server, which runs
as my userid.
Is there a way to configure gpg to run as one id, but use the keyring
of another for sending encrypted email? Or am I missing something
painfully obvious?
Thanks in advance!
