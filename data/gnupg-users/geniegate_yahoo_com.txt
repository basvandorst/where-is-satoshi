You'll probably want to learn a bit about the shell and the directory structure of unix-ish based systems before going too far into gpg. (if you're using linux, the shell is most likely called bash)
What you're attempting to do is execute a directory as if it were a command, what you may want to do is:
echo $PATH
There should be a bunch of pathnames delimited by colons, something like: /bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin the directories listed in your PATH environment variable specify where the various programs are, so you can do a directory listing in each one if you wish to find out about the
available commands.
This isn't really a PGP question, and I'm thankful you asked it because I don't get many chances to answer peoples PGP questions, given that I don't really know much about PGP :-)
Have fun with Linux, and be sure to check out FreeBSD too! ;-)

 Hello everybody, very
 new to linux, and pretty unfamiliar with gnupg still, only
 used a few times. Yesterday i was able to open an actual
 window of Gnupg through my terminal with a command similar
 to ~/.gnupg??? now when i enter this it tells me this is
 a directory and wont do anything with it, any help?

@_subject: Question about signing keys and trust. 
It's been a few years since I've messed with gpg, but I have an application that needs something kind of like distributed groups.
Lets say I have: "key group" (which is owned by who-cares, it's a public key only that represents a group of people)
I have a person, lets say William Smith who has his key signed by who-cares
William Smith then signs Betty Boop with his key.
So William Smith and Betty Boop are sort of like members of "key group" because Betty Boop has a signature by someone who has their key signed by
the key group, and if Betty Boop signs someone, up to n-depth, then those people become members of "key group". No one has authority to add or
remove people, except other members of the same group.
... fast forward ..
In the application, lets say it's a spam fighting tool, a Betty Boop marks a message as spam.
I trust members of "key group" to mark spam, but I don't trust them with everything, just marking spam, so the spam message is deleted.
Popeye, who is a member of "alien group" marks something as spam too, but since popeye doesn't have a key signed by someone in "key group", I do not trust him to flag messages as spam, so I just ignore it.
Basically, I'm trying to implement something akin to a distributed group system where members of a group can (to a configurable point) include others and I had thought perhaps I could coax GPG into doing this, since I'll also need to do a lot of other stuff with GPG, it just makes sense to try and use the key system for it if I can.
Problem is I can't see how! Is there a way I can look at someones public key and (without importing anything into my personal key files) list in a kind of chain fashion how many other signers there were? In the above, I'll have access to the public keys of Betty Boop, Popeye, William Smith and "key group".
I admit, GPG probably wasn't designed for this, and I don't really get the whole trust level thing.. and if it's impossible or impractical I'll find another way, but it would be convenient.
Any pointers on where I should look? Much appreciated!

@_subject: Key Storage Abstraction? 
I've been looking for a way to provide GNUPGP with a custom implementation of a key ring, as I gather there is such a thing as WKS, but I cannot find any documentation on how I can implement this myself.
What I need from GPG is a tool that does this:
1.) Sign Messages with a private key (of my choosing)
2.) Encrypt messages with a public key (of my choosing)
  - ideally to multiple recipients.
3.) Verify a message was signed by whoever owns a public key I have.
  - I don't care about GPG's "Trust levels" and would like to disregard them.
4.) Decrypt messages using a private key that I specify.
If things go the way I'd like, there may be several of these operations taking place in parallel.
There may be thousands, or even millions of keys in my own database, I don't want to (and indeed, I would have to scrap the open source project) import anything into GPG's keyring. I don't particularly want to implement WKS, and if I did it would be read-only, I don't ever want PGP to "upload" anything or change the system in any way. The idea is, this application manages the keys (it needs to for other reasons not really related to GPG)
So, I'm looking for a way to just feed GPG the keys it needs when it needs them. It'd be nice if I could just give it a shell script that takes an argument (whatever key it's looking for) and GPG reads the key on its standard input, but that doesn't seem possible.
Any ideas? and any pointers on where I might look if I had to implement a subset of WKS?
Unrelated: This is in python, I see some GPG libraries, they all seem overly complicated, I'd like to actually access GPG *as* a library, but all the tools I see seem to invoke GPG as a program and then operate on its standard output. Is there a recommended python library that, perhaps, uses GPG in a way that's more efficient? Maybe as a server mode or something? (I'd like it if there were capable of processing, mostly "verify", dozens of messages pr. second, ideally)
