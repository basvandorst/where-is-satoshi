@_subject: Moving key rings? 
I have installed GPG on a development machine and used this configuration to generate a key pair. I have also imported public keys from others.
I now need to copy the key rings being used to a production machine.
Do I have to export my secret key and import it on the production machine (along with the other public keys)? Can't I just copy the entire GnuPG directory to the new machine and expect everything to work fine?
Using Windows XP 2000 and GPG 1.4.0
