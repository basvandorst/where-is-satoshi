Hash: SHA1
I'm trying, on a Windows system to do encryption of a file and logging
the output to a log file, that will be used by the user, and later
administrators or auditors to verify the process.  Something like this.
gpg -e -v -r joe.blow -o foo.pgp %1 > foo.log
I need to make the output be .pgp extention, this part works just fine.
The log file is the issue, it creates foo.log, but the output of the
gpg command isn't there.
