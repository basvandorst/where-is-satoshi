@_subject: make data available for a certain amount of time

What I've seen once was a self-extracting archive built with bash. It
was basically a bash-script with some binary data attached to it.
It was created with something like:
cat script.sh archive.tar >  archive.sh
The script did something like
tail -n 30 archive.sh | tar x
That way you could all sorts of things like contacting a server,
checking the date and so forth. Of course, things get a bit ugly as
soon as it has to run on Windows. In that case I'd use Java and put the
data and the script into a jar.
Of course, that way you can't lock the file completely (at least, not
so easy) but you can warn the user that it's outdated.

@_subject: Single Sign On and PAM 
Hi list!
I'd like to use my login password to automatically decrypt my gpg-keys.
With PAM and gpg-agent all pieces should already exist for such a task,
someone just have to put the pieces together. Do you know a simple solution for this problem? I've stumbled upon  and according to its
man-page, gpg-agent can emulate ssh-agent with "--enable-ssh-support".
However, I don't know if they work together all that well and I don't
want to waste my time on that matter until someone with more experience
tells me that this is the way to go.
Thanks in advance!

You could create an encrypted partition/lvm volume/loopback device and
put the key on it in plaintext. On boot-up, the DBA enters the password
to unlock and mount the partition. After this, the key is protected by
filesystem permissions.
If someone walks out with the harddisk, all he has is an encrypted

I hope you people realize that you just produced 7 times as much spam

his single notification.
Couldn't you have sent him a single, private mail telling him that you
find his behavior wrong instead of talking about telling it someone else?

Take a look at `openssl enc`. It seems to be what you want but I have
not tried it. The man-page is found under `man ssl-enc`

Better don't do that. If xargs receives too many arguments, it will call
tar multiple times. I don't think you can append tar files like that,
can you?
Better approach (in bash, at least):
tar --create --null --files-from=<(find ... -print0) | gpg ...
This also has the advantage that it works correctly if no matches are
found, i.e. it creates an empty archive instead of showing an error.
Alternatively use cpio which was explicitly built around the concept of
being used with find.
I would also get rid of the z option as gpg compresses, too.
