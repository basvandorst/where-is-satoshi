@_subject: Permissions Warning 
GPG is working well for me, but I always get the following warning:
gpg: WARNING: unsafe permissions on configuration file "/home/dave/.gnupg/options"
gpg: WARNING: unsafe enclosing directory permissions on configuration file
Obviously, my permissions are not set exclusively to root and I am definitely
not going to run gpg as root.
Could someone please explain:
a) How do I switch this warning off ?
b) Why does gpg expect files in a user's home directory to be for the
exclusive use of root ?

@_subject: Remove Address From Key? 
I have recently dropped one of my email addresses (eg.bmcs
and I want to remove this address from my key:
~> gpg --list-keys bmcs
pub  1024D/9ABF6F14 2002-11-11 Dave Barton uid                            Dave Barton sub  1024g/0B78C259 2002-11-11
Is there a way of removing this address, without deleting my entire key.
