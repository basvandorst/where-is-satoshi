@_subject: non root users 
All, I am running version 1.2.1 and I want to allow non-root users to be able to list the keys and encrypt for support issues.   In my options file I have stated - -no-secmem-warning,  but as a test user I still receive that messages about the memory.
When I run gpg --list-keys as a test user I get nothing back...???   I have placed them in the proper group and have sgid'ed.
thank you!

I was decrypting a file and I had to put my paraphrase in.  Is there a way to bypass this or automate the paraphrase being passed via a parameter w/out revealing the paraphrase?

@_subject: multiple files for version below 1.2.5 
I am trying to decrypt 2 files on a UNIX machine with:
p='- -passphrase-fd-0'
outp='- -output'
de='- -decrypt'
for i in $var
      cat $file |gpg $p $de $outp $dec.$$ $i
      sleep 1
and the error I get is
Sorry no terminal at all requested - cat get input.
I looked in the archives and saw the - -multifile option but I am on
version 1.2.1 for AIX 5.2
here is my conf file
Any ideas?

@_subject: multiple files for version below 1.2.5 
I am trying to decrypt more than one file if ls -la |wc -l /dir is -gt one.
Thanks for the tips, but my $var variable actually contains both file names
like so:
      for i in $var
      do
            echo $i
      done
so I am ok there, but when I placed the echo infront of the gpg string I
found that the same PID is being used.
gpg --passphrase-fd 0 --decrypt --output
gpg --passphrase-fd 0 --decrypt --output
Finally, in the decryption process you need two uniq filenames b/c there
are two decryption processes which is why I used $$.
      gpg $p $de $outp $dec.$$ $i
Anyone more ideas?  thank you,

Hint 1: Use echo to help you debug - i.e.
    echo cat $file
    echo gpg ......
  That way you can see what your script is _trying_ to do, not what
  you want it to do.
  What are you trying to do?  Decrypt all the files in the directory
  "/data/files" ?  This script won't do that.  You are passing
  "/data/files" to GnuPG, not a list of the files IN that directory.
  (You will see this when you use the echo hint above.)
  If you want all of the files inside /data/files, set
  var=/data/files/* and that should work.
Hint 2: I find it useful (others will disagree) to put brackets around
  my variables to let the shell be sure what I want it to do...
  So the line:
    for i in $var
  would become
    for i in ${var}
  Then there is no confusion when you want to do something like
    ${var}stuff
  However that is an aside.

Never mind I got it to work.
Since I need two unique decrypted file names I said:
count=`ls -la /data/files|wc -l`
if count -gt 1
      until x -eq count
      do
            for i in $/data/files
            do
                  encryption with my output file with a suffix of .$x
                  sleep 1
                  let  x+=1
            done
      done
      encrypt one file

@_subject: question on multiple public keys 
Is there a way that we can add a second key to my file for gpg encryption?
Our DBA in the Import Team needs to have this done so that he can open our
file as well.  When this person is out of the office, no one else is able
to access your file unless they can access his computer.  We would like to
add another user to the keyring  so that he can access your data as well.
please advise!
THANK YOU,
I looked through some emails I saved and found this:
Yes, this is possible.  In each user's gpg.conf file, add a line
  keyring /path/to/the/shared/keyring.gpg
Note that when importing a key, each user will import to their own
local keyring unless they specifically state they want to import to
the shared keyring.  Likely you don't want the shared keyring to be
imported to by random users, so making it read-only is appropriate.

I am running AIX 5.2 and gpg version 1.2.1.  When I encrypt a file and a
vendor decrypts it,  this person is saying that the file does not have
carriage returns in it, in other words it is a file with a bunch of
continuous lines.
The particular version of the vendor is pgp 8.
Is there a parameter to help with this such as - -pgp8 or - -utf8-strings?
Should I upgrade to a newer version?  Which one?

Another solution would be to make sure that you encrypt the file to all
the users who should be able to decrypt that file. You can have
multiple "--recipient" entries on the command line. Check out the
"group" functions as well to simplify this process.

@_subject: question on multiple public keys 
I tried
gpg --group hs=`echo ${foo[0]} ${foo[1]] `
foo0 and foo1 are elements of my array and contain two different key values
with a space in between.
when I run this it states gpg: cannot open  1111111
1111111 is the second key.
I then tried hs="XXXXXX YYYYY"
gpg --group hs=$hs
with the same error.
please help!

Yes, there is a --group command.  Stick in your gpg.conf file:
group name_you_want_to_use = keyid1 keyid2 keyid3 keyid4
I tried this and the error I am getting is:
gpg: no = sign found in group definition "HlthStream"
my conf file is
group HlthStream = keyid1 keyid2
Any ideas?
thank you,

home directory of that test user. As the test user, do:
$ cd ~
$ ls -a
Probably an easier way is to import the keyring into the .gnupg folder,
that'll allow you to set options in the conf file (which is also reset per
user). The warning about secmem should be solvable - I'm sure others here
will help with that but you would be best providing more information on
exactly how you have used chmod.
If the keyring is < 500 keys, it's not a problem to have duplicate keyrings
one for each user. You can either add the --refresh-keys to the lexicon
by ordinary users or leave the keyrings alone if the keys don't change
It's not usual for everyone to need the same keys, that's why GnuPG runs
a lot of configuration and all keyrings dictated by that user alone.
not much for root to do, once installation is complete.

Well maybe it ia a version isue then b/c I am running 1.2.1 on AIX 5.2.
What is the latest for AIX 5.2 and do I need to just replace the binary
with a newer one for an upgrade, or recompile everything all over again?

That command doesn't mean anything.  The options mean, in order,
encrypt, textmode, ascii armor, decrypt.  You have to pick either
encrypt or decrypt as doing both would result in nothing happening.
Also, --group doesn't go on the command line.  You use the group name
as a recipient (-r HlthStream).

If you do not get a resultion within gpg, then you could "split" the file,
using split on the command line.
This will divide the file in 2.

The file size is 4.5 GB. The first part (with some gpg files only 500
MB, with others 2 GB) is decrypted correctly.
Decrypting smaller files works fine.
Is there a size limit for creating gpg files?
