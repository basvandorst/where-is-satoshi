Here's the deal. Windows GUI apps, at least the basic things like Notepad

Windows command line apps perform the translation before displaying. I can't
be sure though, but they seem to handle this fine.

Hi Folks.
Today I installed PGP on a windows system which uses Outlookexpress as the
mail agent.
All encrypted  messages I send using GnuPG are displayed as a single line,
with heavy vertical lines where the line ends should be.
I asked for advice from the PGP users list, and was informed that this is a
GnuPG Bug.
I set up OE5 on my windows partition and carried out a few tests...GnuPG
messages are displayed as described above. PGP 6.5.2 command line displays
as it should be.
Has anyone else noticed this?
Brian

@_subject: Export public and secret keys to the same file 
Hi all,
I was happy to find I could export multiple keys to the same file but I
can't seem to figure out a clean way to export public and secret keys to the
same file. When I use --export, I get only the public keys for the ids I
specify. Is there a single command (as opposed to --export and
--export-secret-keys) to export key pairs to a file or is there some way I
can have it add to an existing file instead of overwriting? Or is there some
way I can merge two files containing exported keys?
Thanks in advance.

Anything wrong with "gpg --export-keys > foo ; gpg --export-secret-keys >>
Aha! Therein lies a tale. I must confess that I have this problem with a
Windows version. gpg itself works fine on my NT box but I think the shell is
doing wierd things when I try to cat files.
gpg --export --output foo works fine but gpg --export > foo doesn't. The
same goes for appending the export output to a file or appending a file to
another. From minimal research, what I think is happening is that cmd seems
to be replacing all 0xa characters with the 0xd 0xa sequence.
Its not a problem really as long as I don't depend on cmd to do the
appending for me. But I was just wondering if there was already a way to
export both kinds of keys to the same file.
