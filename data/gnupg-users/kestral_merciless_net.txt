@_subject: GPG Key Import 
Hopefully, the following question is not a duplicate.
Does anyone know if 'gpg --import' will import a 2048 bit RSA PGP
public/private key pair in Armor ASCII format from Windows PGP Freeware
Here's the scenario:
A W2K machine w/ PGP Freeware 7.0.3 configured to dual boot Red Hat 8, with
a 2048 bit RSA PGP public/private key pair generated by W32 PGP Freeware
7.0.3 which was then exported to an Armor ASCII format file to be imported
into GPG.
