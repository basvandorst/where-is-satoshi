@_subject: Trying to create auth key on GPF CryptoStick 
I got a GPF CryptoStick 1.2 yesterday and have successfully added my
new signing and encrypting subkeys to the card using GPG 2.0.18 and
using it without trouble so far for those purposes. However, when I
tried to create an authentication key it gives this error twice:
gpg: key generation failed: Card error
gpg: Key generation failed: Card error
To get there, I ran "gpg --edit-key ", then "addcardkey"
command, chose Authentication key, 4096 keysize, enter the requested
PINs and passphrase, but it results in the error above.
It is likely I'm doing something wrong, but am not sure what... if
someone has any clues, it is appreciated if you can point me in the
right direction.

Hi Martin,
Crypto-Stick website states that it supported 4096-bit keys when using
gnupg 2.0.18, and my signing and encryption subkeys on the card are in
fact already 4096 bits, but they were created with gnupg on my PC and
then transferred to the card, whereas the auth key creation is
happening on the card itself, so maybe it has different limitations in
this scenario (card-generated vs PC-generated). As far as I can tell,
creation of the auth key outside of the smartcard is not supported.
I just tried 3072 bits and it worked. Thanks!
