@_subject: Using gpg in an automated environememt 
Hi all,
I've been unsuccessfully trying for a while now to have gpg working in an
automated environment.  I've been following the point 8.20 int the gnupg faq
and I get an error at the gpg -homedir command (see screenshot below)
I'm rather new with gpg in particular and pki in general, and would greatly
appreciate any help that can be sent my way.
Looking forward to hearing from you,

@_subject: setting up decryption in an automated environment 
Hi all
I'm rather new with gpg, and would like to setup and automated decryption of
incoming files into a specific directory.
In the previous version the parameter -passphrase did the trick (although
not the most secured) but it isn't working anymore.
I've ha a try with the 8.20 in the tuto with no more success.
Please help ..
