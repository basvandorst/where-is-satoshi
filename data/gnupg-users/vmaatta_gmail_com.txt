Quite. Who are the "Mac guys" and what did they fork?

Yeah. Ok. Assuming the Mac guys / fork referred to here are GPGTools / MacGPG2 I can see a couple bigger issues there than just patching in support for bigger keys.
1. The package and gnupg2 version used has not been updated since October 2013 (2013.10.22). If I?m not completely mistaken the version is still 2.0.22. As discussed on the list, one of the more important things would be timely updates. [1]
2. They have a default skeleton gpg.conf with incompatible digest algo etc. (as discussed many times on the list). I don?t think they patch an existing gpg.conf but they are meant to be the easy-to-use packaged installer for first-time users use case. [2]

I just went through the process of switching to brew provided gpg2. Anyone not interested in the particular Mac workflow can skip this one.
So, removing GPG Suite, installed gnupg2 via brew, re-installing GPG Suite without MacGPG2 (i.e. the Mail.app helpers etc.). There is a bit of work involved in making a launchd script for gpg-agent and getting a working pinentry-mac but if gpg-agent is not a requirement, one can just go with the brew version.
Here?s a quick-n-dirty walk-through:
1. Remove GPG Suite using the uninstalled provided with the installer.
2. brew install gnupg2 (installs gpg-agent as a dependency).
3. Install GPG Suite, choose Customize ?> Leave out MacGPG2
4. Install pinentry-mac, either binary [1] or source [2]. The pinentry with brew didn?t work for me. I went for the binary seeing as the build started requiring a bit too much dependencies I didn?t want to install right now. Latest binary worked for me.
5. Add pinentry-mac location to gpg-agent.conf, e.g. /usr/local/MacGPG2/libexec/pinentry-mac.app/Contents/MacOS/pinentry-mac (I just copied the binary to where MacGPG2 installs it.)
6. Add a ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ruriat.gpgagent.plist [3] Run gpg-agent at login.
** END [3] com.ruriat.gpgagent.plist **
[4] START (file ~/.bash_profile)
export GPG_TTY
# GPG Agent for SSH support
if [ -f "${HOME}/.gpg-agent-info" ]; then
    . "${HOME}/.gpg-agent-info"
    export GPG_AGENT_INFO
    export SSH_AUTH_SOCK
    export SSH_AGENT_PID

Maybe a little off topic, but then again we are talking about keeping gnupg up to date.
TL;DR: I think either MacPorts or Homebrew can be used and one or the other is quite necessary. I do most of my work on the command line / Vim, etc. and using either is just as convenient as apt-get / yum etc. in Linux.
Current gnupg2 versions as of 20.8.2014:
Homebrew: 2.0.26, also 1.4.18 (gnupg)
MacPorts: 2.0.25, also 1.4.18 (gnupg) and 1.2.8 (gnupg12)
Rudix: none (only 1.4.18)
And the rest is way off topic :).
I first looked into Mac package managers in 2006 when Fink was the incumbent and MacPorts more of a challenger. It?s been called a successor to Fink, has the unofficial support of Apple and became pretty much the de-facto package manager around that time. I went with MacPorts then and was quite happy for a few years. Then came along Homebrew as the challenger and I?ve been using it for a few years now. I?ll probably give MacPorts a try again on the next new system.
They?re both similar and I think either is good. They have differences which might be important case-by-case but nothing worth some of the heated blogs and forums posts there are.
- Neither one replaces any system binaries and both are quite easy to get rid off. And they could co-exists if necessary.
- Homebrew tries to avoid duplicates of things included in not only OS X, but also anything that available from language-specific package managers like 'pip', ?gem', ?clan?. Installs via MacPorts easily pull in stuff that could be provided by the system. This can be good or bad either way. I rarely have any trouble finding what I need from Homebrew but then I also do use virtualenv and pip, RVM and gem etc. depending on the project.
- If one is interested in developing / maintaining a port / brew: MacPorts is modeled on BSD Ports and uses SVN. Homebrew formulas are Ruby scripts in Git, usually in Github I suppose.
I didn?t know Fink was still going strong. Good for them. I?ve never used Fink and can?t comment but it is the venerable grey beard project in this bunch. This was the first time I heard about Rudix. I don?t know anything of it and don?t really feel the need to find out :).

I?d actually like to know why the pinentry / pinentry-curses that come from homebrew don?t seem to work at all. I am now using pinentry-mac but I wouldn?t mind getting the normal pinentry working. All I get is "Agent admitted failure to sign using the key.? without any PIN queries. I can see the card is read but it?s not querying for PIN. Pointing gpg-agent to pinentry-mac resolves this for now.

I'm using the FSFE card [1] with SCR3500 [2]. Ok yeah sure, that?s a fellowship card but I actually also wanted to point out the SCR3500 which is a nice similar form factor option for a reader.

So, when was the last time you were offered a parachute on flight? :), sorry I just had to.
I have to say I agree with Doug on StartSSL, I think they?re doing a more of a service to the community by offering affordable certs and the revocation fee is understandable. And reasonable. And sometimes wavered. They did for us the first time when we were adding domains to a wildcard cert, but a bit later this mess of a bug hit and we revoked again, this time they charged the fee. Shit happens.
I do also understand the point why revocation shouldn?t cost money. Why it would lead to certs not being revoked and instead new ones being created [1]. It?s a valid point and something StartSSL should, maybe do, think about.
Like so often, there is no one easy solution, it?s a matter of compromising and weighing different needs. On the whole I like what StartSSL are doing and I?m not quite ready to stop using their certs based on this affair.

Hi? any other problems with GPG Tools version?
I was using the brew -installed gpg first, had some issues with getting it to recognise OpenPGP card, I switched to GPG Tools version and it?s been ok. Now I?m having trouble getting non-card based keys to work with SSH through gpg-agent. I.e. they don?t, I need to run ssh-agent on any terminal session I want to use local keys. I?m thinking whether it?s worth the effort of trying the brew version again on that?
PS. The issue I have with gpg-agent has been on the list some years back in some form, but no real solutions? I?m waiting to debug my setup some more first and I?ll send some more info on the list later.
