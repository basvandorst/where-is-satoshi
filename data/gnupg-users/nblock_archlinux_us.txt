You could use vim with the gnupg.vim [1] plugin. It turns off swapfiles
and viminfo by default and handles filenames with a ".gpg", ".pgp" or
".asc" suffix.

Yes it does (default). But you can configure it to use pipes instead:
If set to 1, use pipes instead of temporary files when interacting with
gnupg.  When set to 1, this can cause terminal-based gpg agents to not
display correctly when prompting for passwords.  Defaults to 0.

useful for you.
