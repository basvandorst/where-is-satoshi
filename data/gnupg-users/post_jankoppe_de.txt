Hello Will,
somewhat off-topic, but..
You can use a google query like this:

I hope this message will be attached to the right thread. If not, please
excuse me.
Also: Hi, I'm new to the list, and pretty new to GnuPG in general!
I've stumbled upon this error as well - decrypting in parallel fails for
me, with the same error messages. I'm using the packages as provided by
my distribution (Arch Linux), no modifications at all.
Output of the suggested commands:
$ LANG=C gpg2 --version
gpg (GnuPG) 2.1.19
libgcrypt 1.7.6

Any help is greatly appreciated. If I can provide some more output or
run further tests let me know.
