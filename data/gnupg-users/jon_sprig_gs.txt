@_subject: Scripting GPG without retaining keys 
Hi all,
I'm trying to write a script which encrypts against keys retrieved
from a keyserver but doesn't cache them.
I've got the following:
gpg --no-options --trust-model always --no-default-keyring --keyserver
ldap://keyserver.example.com --keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve
--recipient user at example.com --encrypt a_file.txt
I keep getting "gpg: user at example.com: skipped: No public key"
However, if I replace --recipient and --encrypt with --search-keys
user at example.com I get the key back.
Is this a failure in my understanding of the gpg command line, or have
I missed some fundamental part of the documentation somewhere?
Thanks in advance!
Jon "The Nice Guy" Spriggs
