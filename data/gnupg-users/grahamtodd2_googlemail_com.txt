I agree!
At the risk of upsetting some people, at this time of year, I celebrate
the Feast Of Saturnalia (which got hi-jacked from the Romans) as the
mid-winter feasting and celebration for our good fortune.
So Happy Saturnalia (as my Christmas cards say) and also "Bah Humbug!"
And support freedom with the FSF!

Thank you Werner for that most informative annoucement.
Certainly, kudos to all those hackers who gave us a FREE (as in
freedom) privacy tool, and thanks to them all - from Phil Zimmerman
onwards - who risked personal freedom to ensure we had liberty.
However, as many philosophers have observed, "liberty is not licence";
just because you CAN do something, it doesn't mean you necessarily
SHOULD be allowed to do it under all circumstances.  Apart from not
being able to find anyone to use encryption using PGP or GnuPG outside
of our very small community, we are faced with the use of these very
strong encryption tools by those who would attack the very heart of our
way of life.  We need to take a step back and consider how GnuPG should
be used in the future.
We need a debate at the widest level in the internet community.

The link points to the page you are looking at (ch02s03.html) and not
to the file gnupg-ccid.
Thus the instructions on the page will not work.  Could somebody change

John, I respect your point of view and I shall defend to the death your
ability to say it.  However, whether the US Navy uses slang of this
kind doesn't make it part of the English language, nor whether these
things can be found in the histories of the CIA and NSA is irrelevant
to me as a Brit (except as an academic exercise).
I use the English language (maybe not always the correct Queens
English) and if I might be so bold as to say, not a version of it for
American usage.  But both our versions of English have to be
understandable to people in other countries who use the internet
without it being their first tongue, and its well not to muddy the
waters with cultural and linguistic allusions that might not be
generally accepted nor understood in the same way by those people.
I think this is what Vedaal meant in his OP.  Its not a matter of
"political correctness", but of using the English language in a way
that's not misunderstood or which causes offence.  In speaking to
people in the US I have found that the phrase "political correctness"
means different things to those of us in the UK, and in any case
"politics" by itself often means different things and conjures up
different images. So its best not to use the phrase.
Can I ask that people think before they write and realise that the
internet has lots of different people, from differing cultures and
backgrounds, and which can be easily offended by things which you find
innocuous in your culture.

Probably the best place to help you is the PGP-Basics yahoogroup.  It
also deals with GnuPG, though this does mean joining another group :-)

Yes, and regularly given to this list - forget by whom as I've just
cleared a lot of emails.

When you get a URL such as this (or an IP number), add them at the
bottom of yours hosts file in /etc/hosts and have the IP referencer as
Computers don't actually look up URLs as such, they route them through
DNS servers who gives the computer the IP number and then it connects
with that.  The hosts file cuts this down by making your computer
connect with the IP number listed in the hosts file for a given URL.
By convention, the IP address which your computer recognises as itself
is 127.0.0.1, and if this were listed in /etc/hosts as the reference
for a "bad" URL, in trying to connect to the URL, your computer would
simply be trying to connect with itself - which kills the attempt to
A good hosts file is a good second line of defence and you can get one

The webpage explains it all.  Add it to the bottom of the

in which the mvps.org file says:
