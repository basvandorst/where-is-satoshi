Hash: SHA1
Hi everyone I'm back.
I have two questions.
First I read from this page that after I generated a new key with gpg --gen-key command I should
follow it with gpg --gen-revoke command to generate a revocation
certificate. But I only saw from my command prompt after typing it in:
usage: gpg [options] --gen-revoke user-id
What should I do now? I hope it's not too late to generate a revocation
certificate now that the key has already been created and sent to keyserver.
I shall be back with new email address bearing my exact name.

Hello. I have a beginner question, I hope you guys don't mind.
I'd like to know why it is that when the key server website is in the hkp
protocol, I can never access it through my web browser. For example, if I
type the url hkp://random.sks.keyserver.penguine.de into my Firefox browser,
it will say: Firefox doesn't know how to open this address because it's not
associated with any program. I similarly can never export my public key
through my GPA if the key server is in the hkp protocol. Can anyone
enlighten me as to the reason for this? How can I access hkp sites?

Thanks John. My next question is then: why is it that when I tried to
send my public key to a key server (whether it starts with hkp or http)
using my GPA, the popup said: "there is no plugin available for this
protocol". What plugin am I missing?
(Excuse me for the PGP signature. I'm using Enigmail/Thunderbird and I
don't feel like turning off the signature now.)

Hi John, thanks so much for the thorough reply. I wasn't able to
implement your direction at all, though. You said:

When I did that, the popup appeared:
"sending of keys failed

gpg: sending key -------- to hkp server keyserver.pramberger.at

gpg: keyserver send failed: file read error"
This happened with every keyserver I chose, so I don't think it is a
problem with keyserver, but with me. What exactly am I missing here? Do
you know?
And when I opened up my command prompt and typed in the command you
suggested, I got the reply that "pgp is not a valid internal or external
command". Is there some configuration of environment variable or
something like that which I need to do beforehand?
Thanks John for your time.

Hi John, I really want to thank you for all your thorough explanations.
Yes, I did upgrade, and I have successfully sent in my public key to
keyservers using OpenPGP key management in my Enigmail, although I still
couldn't export the key to keyservers using my gpg4win GPA (getting the
same message: "no plugin available for this protocol") -- but you don't
care about the GPA -- nor using the command line. I really don't know
why. If someone else can explain why the latter two mechanisms don't
work, please do. Thanks.
Thank you John for your patience with my beginner frustration. (And I
wasn't trying to hide my keyID, but just too lazy to type it.)

Well, John, why is it then that when I sent an encrypted and signed

clicked on Privacy Tray's "clickboard" -> "decrypt/verify", the message
is both decrypted and verified as with good signature? If the message is
altered through the webmail system so that its signature can't be
verified, why is it that when it's encrypted it can both be decrypted
and verified?
Thanks, John, for the earlier reply.

When I looked at the listing of John's public key from a public key

other people's names listed with him, like Anthony Jones or Tony Jones
or Robot CAs. I suppose these are the people or robots that have signed
his key? Is this the so called web of trust? How do you get people to

Hi everyone, I want to propose something. Kara has been very patiently
helping me with my questions on the board about how to use GnuPG and
Enigmail, as is here. However, on two occasions she used sensitive words
in her examples as in the "extreme example" here. It didn't just keep me
scared all night and day due to my weak nervous system, but it has
bothered me for over a whole week for another reason. I want to propose
that we all use absolutely untainted clean language when we send
encrypted emails (like this one is encrypted) so that we wouldn't give
authority a reason to take away this privilege of ours to use
encryption. It should be part of our ethic in using encryption.

I certainly agree with John that no one should send me private messages.
 I'm sorry to have failed to observed Netiquette, but I was just too
afraid. I have been reported before to law enforcement as saying things
which in fact others said to me and got into trouble for that. Law
enforcement would treat any words in my box as my product, "but others
said it" is no defense. So I'm very paranoid about, not just what I said
to others, but precisely what others said to me. So I always insist on
others' using clean language when talking to me -- unfair as this may sound.
But in any case, not observing Netiquette is my fault, and all this is
unheroic on my part, so I'd be quiet from now on around here.

Hi, finally have a little time today to come back to the mailing list.
It's me, Lawrence, previously with that dummie kurtc1972 gmail

gpg communication as I'm getting serious with playing with this
enigmail. Just saying hi and introducing myself using this new email
bearing my full name etc for gpg use.
Well, while here, I might as well ask a question, though it's more
Enigmail-related. On the OpenPGP Options (OpenPGP security under my
account settings), I see the two options:
*use email address of this identity to identify OpenPGP key
*use specific OpenPGP key ID
I checked the second. But what's the difference between the two?

@_subject: signing documents and others 
Hash: SHA1
Hi everyone,
After being too busy, I'm back with questions and questions....
I'm using openoffice.org writer. I don't know how many of you are
familiar with it. My first question is:
(1) I notice that openoffice writer allows you to digitally sign the
document created. But I already noticed that I can sign and encrypt any
document I have created with GPGEE's context menu. Are the two really
the same thing?
(2) In the "help" file of openoffice.org, it says:
"When you receive a signed document, and the software reports that the
signature is valid, this does not mean that you can be absolutely sure
that the document is the same [as] that [which] the sender has sent.
Signing documents with software certificates is not a perfectly secure
method. Numerous ways are possible to circumvent the security features.
Example: Think about someone [who] wants to camouflage his identity to
be a sender from your bank. He can easily get a certificate using a
false name, then send you any signed e-mail pretending he is working for
your bank. You will get that e-mail, and the e-mail or the document
within has the "valid signed" icon. Do not trust the icon. Inspect and
verify the certificates. On Windows operating systems, the Windows
features of validating a signature are used. On Solaris and Linux
systems, files that are supplied by Thunderbird, Mozilla or Firefox are
used. You must ensure that the files that are in use within your system
are really the original files that were supplied by the original
developers. For malevolent intruders, there are numerous ways to replace
original files with other files that they supply."
I have very little idea even til now as to what exactly certificate
does. I suppose I get a certificate with CaCert to validate my identity
and then get them to sign my keys? But what's the "Windows system of
validating a signature"? (I use Vista and IE) On the "Certificates"
windows in the "internet options" in my IE 7 browser, I saw that there
are a lot of certificates of big companies listed in "trusted root
certificate authorities" and "intermediate certification authorities",
but none in "other people" and "personal". I suppose if I can get a
x.509 through CaCert, then I would put that x.509 in "personal"? Is that
I got more questions.
(3) To tell you guys the truth, I don't even know where my private keys
and my key ring are stored in my computer. Do you guys know the possible
file names and path?
(4) And -- I know this question must have been asked 100 times already
here, but I want to ask instead of spending the next 3 hours doing
research -- how exactly to save my private keys onto like a USB drive or
a CD?
(5) How to add an additional UID to my kurt c key on the keyserver? I
want to add my real name to it.
Thanks for helping out an idiot here.

@_subject: backing up keys etc 
Hash: SHA1
Okay, thanks for the excellent help, Faramir and Kara. Let me see if I
got this right.
(1) It turns out that I got a revocation certificate made long time ago
for the current key I'm using (8e758d5f) with the file name
"kurtc1972 at gmail.com (0x8e758d5f) rev.asc" and saved on a CD. So, if I
need to revoke this public key in the future, I just upload it to the
(2) So I used OpenPGP key management, "file" -> "export key to file" to
export both the public and secret part of all my 4 keys to the same CD.
When I opened the asc file of each of these 4 keys, I can see that each
file consists of a public key block and a private key block. Now, if my
computer ever crushes and I have to start everything over again, like
downloading GNUPG and Enigmail again, do I just upload these 4 asc files
and thus regain my keys again? Is this what is known as "back up"?
(3) So I generated a revocation certificate for the older, first
experimental key for this kurtc account of mine, which I never seemed to
have uploaded to a keyserver. Here is the log:
