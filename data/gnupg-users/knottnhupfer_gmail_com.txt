@_subject: verifying secret key while import 
I'm trying to import secret keys from a file and at the same time I
would like to verify if the user has the passphrases for the secret
Is there a way to check the key ID before importing the secret key?
Then I could first ask for the secret keys ID in the exported file,
next send to the user a request for the passphrase for each secret key
and finally import and verify all secret keys.
Unfortunately the --dry-run flag doesn't show the ID ...
thx in advance
