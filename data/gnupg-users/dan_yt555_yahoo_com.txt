@_subject: Available and default options 
I have a question about how GPG assigns default
preferences to a key. When I check the version I get a
list of supported ciphers, digests, etc:
Cipher: 3DES, CAST5, BLOWFISH, AES, AES192, AES256,
Hash: MD5, SHA1, RIPEMD160, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512
Compression: Uncompressed, ZIP, ZLIB, BZIP2
But then when I create a key with the default settings
& do a showpref, the key doesn't include all supported
Cipher: AES256, AES192, AES, CAST5, 3DES
Digest: SHA1, RIPEMD160
Compression: ZLIB, ZIP, Uncompressed
It seems to me that the key should include all the
options it is capable of using.
I know I can add all of these options but why aren't
they there by default?
