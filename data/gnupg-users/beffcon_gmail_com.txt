@_subject: why cissp says this about PGP/GnuPG? 
Hi, list!
    I'm reading a book named "ALL-in-One CISSP Certification Exam
Guide" by Shon Harris, 3ed.  And in "Chapter 8 Cryptography", I came
across a paragraph like this:
"How strong of a protection mechanism is required depends on the
sensitivity of the data being protected. It is not necessary to
encrypt information about a friend's Saturday barbeque with a
top-secret encryption algorithm; conversely, it is not a good idea to
send intercepted spy information using PGP. Each type of encryption
mechanism has its place and purpose."
   I wonder why PGP is not good enough to encrypt spy information?
   thanks in advance!
