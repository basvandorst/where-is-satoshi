@_subject: PGP-GPG Compatibility 
Hello everybody,
i'm pretty new to this list so please be patient if my question has been answered several times before but i didn't find it in the archieves.
My current problem could be describe as follows:
I write any text, encrypt the text (or mail) with my public key using PGP 7.0.4. When trying to decrypt it everything works fine by using PGP for decryption.
When using GPG it says "No secret Key available", but i ensured the right key is in the ring.
Does anybody know about this problem ?
Thank you,

Thank you for all the hints, i'll try them asap.
In the meantime i figured out, that GPG returns a different key ID than the original one, you also referred in your mail. Is it possible that PGP/GPG changes the ID of a key ?

Hello everybody,
due to the results of my questions yesterday, i did some additional tests with the same result:
A file, encrypted by PGP could not be decrypted by GPG. Maybe i did something wrong so i will describe the process a little more detailed:
First i generated a new Key with PGP (7.0.4). Key Properties:
ID: 0x60AA7092
Type: DH/DSS
Size: 2048/1024
Cipher: IDEA
Expires: Never
Then i encrypted a short text file with GPG (using the windows gui for this and every following step) and decrypted it. Up to here everything worked well.
Then i tried the other way, encrypting with PGP and selecting the public key of the new key pair as recipient. I didn't choose any of the options in the Key selection dialog (Text Output, Wipe Original aso) and encryption works. As a result i get the textfile.txt.pgp . Then i select the file manager from GPG Tray and open the encrypted file, shown status is ENCRYPTED.
Then i select the file in the window of the file manager and say decrypt. Now i get the result "encryption failed". Maybe it's useful for you to know that i use the precompiled binary version 1.0.6
Where is my mistake ?
Thanks a lot,

i just would like to say thank you for solving my compatibility problem. In the end it was that my key had IDEA as preferred algorithm.
