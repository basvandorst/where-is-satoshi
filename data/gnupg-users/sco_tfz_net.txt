@_subject: problem with gpa-0.6.0 
Hi all,
 :
i'm already subscribed to the list since 01/10/2003, but have set my preferences to not receive mail because of low disk space. My previous mail never appeared in the html interface, i hope this one will.
After seeking for those error messages on discussion groups, I still don't know what to do, i have compiled latest version of freetype  2.1.3 and installed it sucessfully , but when querying the rpm database here is what i found installed :
freetype2-devel 2.0.9-3mdk
freetype 1.3.1-17mdk
freetype2 2.1.2-3tex
the problem remains the same, should i remove my current version of pango, and pango-devel? and only let freetype-2.1.3 and remove other

@_subject: newbie problem about signing 
i was using pgp 6.5.8 ckt in my windows box, i exported my keys including private ones and imported them using gnupgp in my linux. now each time i sign a message i have warning, for example with kmail :
"Message was signed by myname  (Key ID: 0xxxxxxxxx).
The signature is valid, but the key's validity is unknown.
message here
End of signed message"
and with enigmail in mozilla messenger, each time i sign a message and then click on the decrypt /verify icon :
a pop up window appears  :
 " OpenPGP security info
Error - signature verification failed
gpg command line and output :
gpg: Signature made sat 11 Jan 2003 02:55:59 AM CET using DSA key ID gpg: BAD signature from "myname "
so i checked the help and found about lsign and sign :
1/ what is the difference between signing a key locally and signing?
2/ when i try both i have each time to cancel because at the end of process :
[t t]$ gpg --nrlsign-key xxxxxxxx
pub  1024D/xxxxxxxx  created: 2002-04-06 expires: never      trust: -/-
sub  2048g/xxxxxxxx  created: 2002-04-06 expires: never
(1).myname pub  1024D/xxxxxxx  created: 2002-04-06 expires: never      trust: -/-
 Primary key fingerprint: *********************************************
    myname How carefully have you verified the key you are about to sign actually to the person named above?  If you don't know what to answer, enter "0".
   (0) I will not answer. (default)
   (1) I have not checked at all.
   (2) I have done casual checking.
   (3) I have done very careful checking.
Your selection? 3
Are you really sure that you want to sign this key
with your key: "my nym name "
The signature will be marked as non-exportable.
The signature will be marked as non-revocable.
I have checked this key very carefully.
Really sign? y
gpg: protection algorithm 1 (IDEA) is not supported
gpg: the IDEA cipher plugin is not present
gpg: please see  for more information
gpg: signing failed: unknown cipher algorithm
my problem is why is my nym email adress used by default to sign my keys? i cannot use my nym since a nym adress must have no relation with the real owner, with his real email. it is used to hide real email address.
so, how can i make myemail the defaut id used to sign my keys?
3/ and do i have to add idea support for gupg?
4/ is signing the method to be used to make those warning messages disappear in both kmail and mozilla messenger?
any help appreciated
