@_subject: decrypting input, not a file... 
I finally figured out the proper syntax to decrypt a file from command line passing the passphrase as
echo '$passphrase' | gpg -v --batch --no-secmem-warning --passphrase-fd 0 --decrypt $file
However, in a particular case... I would like to decrypt a 'string' but don't want to necessarily write the 'string' to a file.
I know I can encrypt a 'string' passed on the command line... but how can I get gpg to read a varialbe instead of passing a file name?
Sorry, fairly new to scripting with bash etc...
Please CC me on reply's, I haven't subscribed to the list yet....
Thanks in advance for any help/advice.

Thanks for the feedback,
If anyone is interested... here is the resulting PHP script that will encrypt/decrypt data using this hack..
\n code: $code \n ";
   // echo "encrypted: " . array_tunnel($encrypted);
if($passphrase && $code) {
   // decrypt the code...
   $command="echo '$passphrase\n$code' | gpg -v --batch --no-secmem-warning --passphrase-fd 0 --decrypt";
   exec($command, $encrypted, $errorcode);
   // echo "command: $command \n";
   // echo "\n errorcode: $errorcode \n code: $code \n ";
   // echo "encrypted: " . array_tunnel($encrypted);
   echo "your secret message was: ";
   while(list($key,$val) = each ($encrypted)) {
     echo "$val\n";
   }

This I know.
but, if you are dealing with cycling through a database of encrypted bits of information, needing to decrypt on the fly.. short of writing everything to files (performance issue?) is there a better way?
The code above is not bullet proof, but if you do not allow shell accounts on your server... well, it's 'mostly' secure ;_)
