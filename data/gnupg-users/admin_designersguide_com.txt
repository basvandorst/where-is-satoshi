I am currently using gpg-agent to hold both my gpg and ssh keys. I use two ssh keys, which means that when I log in I have to give up to four passphrases to unlock all of my keys. Given that gpg-agent is primarily a labor-saving device, I am wondering if it would be possible to configure it to accept just one passphrase and unlock all of my keys.
I believe I can do this using gnome-keyring, but at the moment gnome-keyring does not work with gpg on Fedora 18 for me because some incompatibility between the two programs. And frankly, I'd like to avoid the use of gnome-keyring if I can. So my question, is it possible to configure gpg-agent so that one passphrase can unlock all of my keys?
