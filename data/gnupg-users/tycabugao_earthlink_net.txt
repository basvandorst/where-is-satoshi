Are you getting this message even though enigmail has not prompted you
for a password? If so, make sure the "No passphrase for user" is
unchecked in your Enimail settings.

I might also add that Mozilla also has a Calendar module you can download at  It's sweet! And it follows the ical standard.
So, basically, you can have all the contacts, calendar, and email features that you like in Outlook!

I checked two of my Win2k machines, both with IE 6.0. I never have changed the "defaults" for the settings above (and I am the only user for these machines), but they are different from your "defaults". In fact, they're even different from each other. They have the same security patches and service packs... Anybody know why is this so?
Note: I believe everyone should use the OS of they are comfortable with when it comes to the balance between security and usability. I have recently started using Linux not because I hate MS. I have switched to Linux out of curiousity with the Linux/Unix world, and out of principle--I don't think I should have to ask permission to re-install my OS just because I decided to wipe my PC clean. I paid for it, damnit!...
Now, if I could just win the lottery and get me those PowerMac G5's!...

@_subject: Upgrade from 1.0.7-6 to 1.2.2 in RedHat 8.0 
I am trying to upgrade my GnuPG from 1.0.7-6 to 1.2.2. I am running RedHat 8.0. I follow the instructions completely (./configure, make, make install), and everything seems to go through smoothly. But once I check out the version of my gpg, it is still 1.0.7-6. Am I doing anything wrong?
I attempted to rpm -e the old version, but RH tells me that it is needed by up2date. I attempted to uninstall up2date, and RH tells me that it is needed by up2date-genome, firstboot, and that /usr/share/rhn/RHNS-CA-CERT is needed by (installed) rhn-applet. So I erased all those packages, including the 1.0.7-6 version.
I attempted to install 1.2.2, and it went through the whole installation just fine. At least, it looked like it did. Because when I checked to see what version of gpg I have, it is now showing that I do not have any installed!
Any suggestions?

The old executable is probably in /usr/bin while the new one is  likely in and you should be fine.

Yup! Just as Todd described here:
"There is a spec file in the gnupg tarball (which I haven't used) and you might well be able to just type
something like 'rpmbuild -tb /path/to/gnupg-1.2.2.tar.gz' to produce a
binary gnupg rpm."
It worked like a charm!

This may be an enigmail issue, but I am posting this anyway since there seems to be a lot of people here who are able to make this work with gnupg...
I am running Redhat 8.0, with Mozilla v. 1.3 installed. I went to the enigmail.mozdev.org site and installed the enigmail xpi's. Everything looks okay, except that when I attempt to use sign/encrypt or verify/decrypt any emails, I get a "Failed to initialize Enigmail" message. I have checked my enigmail preferences and everything looked okay. Am I missing something?

You got the wrong version of enigmail for the version of mozilla you
have.  which 1.3 do you have? the one built with gcc3.2 or the one build
with the earlier version of gcc?

I got it working! I uninstalled enigmail and installed the xpi for Linux (not the one for RedHat). Thanks, CL!

@_subject: Front End Recommendations 
I would like to get some recommendations on a good, graphical gpg front end. I'm looking for more than just a GUI that organizes/manages the keys, but one that would encrypt/sign/decrypt/verify the clipboard. If it would also do the same with an active window (ala PGP in Windows and Mac), that would be superb! I got enigmail going with my Mozilla mail, but I need the features above for my newsreader, Pan...
Oh, yeah, I am running RedHat 8.0. GnuPG v. 1.2.2
