I'm trying to run some Scripts to Encrypt and Decrypt files automatically..
now the questions are:
How can I delete the *.ZIP files after this command is executed without
errors ?
gpg --batch --encrypt-files -r "KEY" c:\test2\*.zip
Same case here:
How can I delete the *.gpg files after this command is executed without
errors and Successfully?
gpg --passphrase-fd 0 --batch --decrypt-files *.gpg

Thanks Hardeep,
I think I found a very simple solution.... if the Command ends successfully then the ERRORLEVEL will be ZERO (0)
REM Encrypt
gpg --batch --encrypt-files -r "KEY" *.zip
echo.ERROR LEVEL: %ERRORLEVEL%
IF %ERRORLEVEL% ==0 GOTO ZERO
IF %ERRORLEVEL% ==2 GOTO TWO
IF %ERRORLEVEL% ==1 GOTO ONE
GOTO END
ECHO ENCRYPTION_OKAY !!!!!
del *.zip
GOTO END
ECHO PROCESS FAIL
SEND MAIL
GOTO END
ECHO PROCESS FAIL
SEND MAIL
