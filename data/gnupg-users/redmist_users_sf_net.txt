Move the mouse around, hit random keys on the keyboard, start reading and writing data to the disk.  This increases the entropy in the entropy pool.

Another relevant couple of questions would be:
- How fast is your machine (CPU speed, memory, etc)?
- What size key are you generating?
I had to be quite patient on my dual Celeron 366Mhz->533Mhz, 128MB @ 96Mhz generating a 4096 bit key.  This is normal (although it shouldn't take 54 minutes).
