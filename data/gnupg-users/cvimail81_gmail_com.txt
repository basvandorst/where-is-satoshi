@_subject: Symmetric encrypt many files (batch mode) 
Hi All!
I want to symmetrically encrypt many hundreds of files under Linux, the files stored in many subdirectories. I am looking for a shell script which can do it for me. What is the simplest way to do it?
Best regards, Egon

@_subject: GNUPG symmetric encryption compatibility question 
Hi All,
If I symmetric encrypt many files with the recent version of GNUPG 1.4.19, will I able to decrypt these files with the modern versions of GPG in the far future?
Does GNUPG 1.4.19 has a known compatibility problem with this operation even when I do not want to use the default cipher and compression algorithms and I want to ASCII-armor some files?
I do not want to use other features, only encrypt files...
Will I able to decrypt with the actual recent modern version in the future when GNUPG 1.4.x will disappear?
Best Regards, Egon

@_subject: PGP 2.6.3 IDEA encryption 
I have some files which was encrypted with PGP 2.6.3. The encryption algorithm was IDEA.
I forgotten the password. Can most modern technology give me a possibility to decrypt the files?

@_subject: Ascii-armor in paper - question 
Hi All,
I have an encrypted GPG Ascii-armored document which I want to print it to paper in short form (if it is possible).
Does ascii-armor format redundant or redundancy it true only for GPG keys?
What can I do to print it in "shorter form"? (if available, convert it to some standardized format which produce shorter text).
I want to find a method which help me to reconstruct the printed ascii-armor file from paper more easily (if possible).
Paperkey - I think - working only with GPG keys.
Best regards: Egon
