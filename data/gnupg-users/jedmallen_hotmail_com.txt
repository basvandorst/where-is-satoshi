bit like pgp 6.x? The feature I'm referring to is that during key
generation, pgp doesn't print the random characters you type on the
keyboard but instead shows how the percentage of how much more random
bytes are needed. I find it neat.
algorithms and hashes in gpg?  Specifically their relative strengths
against current cryptanalysis attacks. Can you publish them along
with your gnupg distributions to let the users know their features
and what cryptanalysis attacks they have gone through or when they
were created, etc.
secure delete secure enough? (I've included a uuencoded tarball below
in case you've never come across this program).
the screen (just like pgp -m option)? Like, how can I pipe it to the
"more" utility without writing the plaintext to a file/hardrive?
adding them to your keys? Like, gpg first asks you if you want to add
"Heine" to your keyring, instead of the default add-them-all during
gpg --import pubkeys.asc.
useful in non-unix OSes (Windows most especially), which does not
have any privilege levels concerning its directories. So a user's
secring.gpg cannot be copied so easily by anyone. Symmetrically
encrypts a secring. You have to decrypt it symmetrically first before
you can be able to use it. Or probably just do it yourself via a
batch file, it's all there. I don't know. I'm musing. Scrap this
idea. Just use free unixes.
