Many of the messages going to this mailing list also have digital
signatures.  I have no problem verifying the signatures that are clear
signed; however, those messages with an attached signature always fail
the verification.  Can someone tell me the procedure to verify a
signature for an email message when it is in an attachment?

Thanks for the response.  Unfortunately ditching MS Outlook isn't an
option for me.  I will look at the possibility of routing a message
received by Outlook into another application, but I am looking for an
Outlook/ Windows solution if one exists.
When I save the body of the message into a text file and use the
gpg --verify option, the signature still fails.  Perhaps it has
something to do with the way Windows handles line breaks as opposed to

G'day Don,
* Don Ferguson  [041207 17:43]:
  You need to get a real email program.  Ditch the Microsoft and get
  something that recognises PGP/MIME.
Basically signatures in the attachments are generated by emailers that
are able to use RFC 2015 (I think - Google for "pgp signature rfc")
which effectively specifies that the (Open)PGP signature of an email
should be an attachment.  The old style signatures are frowned upon
(in some circles) and the argument is that "application/pgp is not
really suited to a world with MIME, non-textual body parts and similar
things"  (from the mutt web page).  Translation - MIME good.
As for verifying the messages...  Um, can you save both the text of
the email and the attached signature and then gpg --verify them?  I
don't really know, mutt (my mail program) does it all automatically
for me!  :-)  As another alternative try one of the many other
programs (thunderbird, ...) that will be suggested by the other
replies I expect you will receive.

In this case it happens to be the corporate version of Outlook with
Exchange server.  That's also why using other email clients really isn't
an option.  So as things stand for now, I may need to accept that I
won't be able to verify PGP/MIME signatures attached to the messages.
While it would be nice to be able to do this with Outlook, I can live
without it for now.
Thanks for the response and the great application that GnuPG is.

I doubt that the proprietary PGP handles PGP/MIME with Outlook.  There
is no documented or known way on how to send arbitrary MIME encoded
messages using Outlook (i.e. using MAPI). We have figured out a way to
decrypt/verify _most_ PGP/MIME messages but no way to create them.
Thus we have not started to implement something.
There are possible hacks of course but they would be really bad.  If
you are running a standalone Outlook you should try gpg-relay.

Yes, using Thunderbird from home is an option.  Using Thunderbird at
work would also be an option if it could directly communicate with the
Exchange servers the same way Outlook does. -----Original Message-----

Why not post from home?
But old-style inline signatures are deprecated for very good reasons.
PGP/MIME is the future of GnuPG/PGP signatures. You really ought to use a
different email client. It isn't impossible, no matter what the corporate
mentality, you could use Mozilla Thunderbird - on a USB stick if necessary.

It looks like Thuderbird works nicely.  I guess the best way to go is to use a combination of Thunderbird and Outlook.

I am just using POP3 against the Exchange server with login credentials.  Please note that POP3 will need to be enabled in Exchange.  While I find it convenient to use Thunderbird for handling OpenPGP activities,  it is not a suitable replacement for Outlook for my normal daily corporate email and scheduling activity.  Since I don't want my messages deleted out of my exchange inbox or automatically marked as read by Thunderbird, I also enabled the following options under
Account Settings --> Server Settings:
Fetch headers only
Leave messages on the server
(Other settings may be configured to suite you personal tastes.)
So when I need perform encryption or signature activity, or respond to this email thread, I just manually open Thunderbird, manually retrieve the message headers, and manually download the message I want to respond to.
I realize that this is a bit of a kludge, but so far it's my best option.

IMAP should work as well although I haven't tried it yet.  Again IMAP would need to be enabled at the Exchange server.

Exchange Server supports SMTP, POP3, and IMAP.  As to whether or not your Exchange Server is configured to allow you to use these services is something you will need to take up with your mail administrator.  For SMTP you can bounce your messages off any server that has the SMTP service running on it provide it is unrestricted.

After a few hours of troubleshooting I was able to get this to work with
Outlook 2003.  It seams that G-DATA only works properly if the message
is sent in plain text mode.  After testing in with plain text, it seams
that all works well.
Is the source code to this modification available?
