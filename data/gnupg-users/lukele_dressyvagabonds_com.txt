We?ve noticed that the hang occurs in pcsc_get_status_change. Instead of receiving a timeout, it simply hangs forever, due to a bug in Yosemite?s PCSC implementation.
In order to work around the hang, we?re running this call in a separate thread now, and if it doesn?t return within a few seconds (5 at the moment), it sends a timeout to the scdaemon.
That fixed the issues for a lot of users, but there?s still one running into problems, yet it?s not entirely clear if that user?s problem is the same as this one.

Pinentry-mac is one project we?ve ?revived? and thus only added stuff on top of the old code instead of refactoring it.
We?ve been planning to do that for a long time now though, so we?ll definitely look into that and check out how other UIs do it, like GTK.

I?m not sure if my last emails made it through the list.

Hi Jonathan,
yes, we've created a quick prototype today which is only a start at looking how it ould best be done. We pushed it to github only, so that our other team members could have a look at it.
After we decide how to go forward from hear, we'll split up the commits with proper comments.
Thanks for the comments, we'll have a look and incorporate those as we continue.
