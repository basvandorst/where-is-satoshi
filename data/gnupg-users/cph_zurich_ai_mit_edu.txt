I recently upgraded to GnuPG 1.0.6 (from 1.0.4), and now whenever I
use gpg I get the message "no subkey for key signature packet".  For
an example, see below.
I'm assuming that this means that my keyring is broken, but I am not
sure this is true.  I'm also unsure what to do to fix it.
Any suggestions or help would be appreciated.

   The keyserver messed up your key.  This is a known problem with the
   pksd servers.  1.0.6 has some more verbose error messages.
What should I do to fix it?  Is there anything easier than exporting
my keys, deleting keyrings, and importing them back?
