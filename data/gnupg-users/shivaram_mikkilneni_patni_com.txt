@_subject: Migrating PGP 6.0.2  to GPG 
Hi Guys ,
I want to know how to migrate the existing accounts and PGP (Version: PGP
6.0.2) keys into a GPG environment.
My thought is that we should isolate the GPG stuff under one directory path
directory1 and the temporary work area in /tmp/gpg.
The GPG application binaries and end-user application code (cron jobs)
should be stored under different directory2 paths.
I want know how to move PGP keys to a GPG keyring.
These keyrings contain our private and public encryption keys and the public
keys from our vendors.I also want to know the command line usage for PGP/GPG
in order to script a solution for migrating the keys.
Your help in this regard is highly appreciated.
