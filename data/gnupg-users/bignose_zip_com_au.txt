@_subject: OpenPGP vs inline PGP 
What simple problem has been made complex, in your view?
OpenPGP is an attempt to use a flexible, common attachment method,
instead of the domain-specific, inflexible attachment method of inline
signatures.  This seems like a simplification, not a complication.
I don't see a good reason to reject them.  Your choice, of course.
A signed PGP message isn't "plain text"; it has an attached signature.
Whether tha signature is attached by the MIME attachment standard or by
the PGP-specific attachment method, it's still an attachment.
If it's attached by MIME, any MIME processing software can recognise
that, and can even determine what type of attachment it is, without
needing to know anything about PGP or GPG.  The plain text can be
extracted by any MIME-aware program, without needing to know anything
but MIME.
If it's attached by PGP's own method, it isn't recognised by anything
that hasn't been specifically told about PGP's way of attaching
signatures.  This means the plain text cannot be extracted without this
domain-specific knowledge.
You can choose to reject MIME signature attachments and allow only PGP
signature attachments, but by doing so you'll miss a growing segment of
the crypto-using community: those attempting to conform to mail

I've made the investment of a USB stick with 128MiB flash memory.  This
stores my SSH keys, GPG keys, and tools to use them on various OSen.
Most places I go will have a USB port available on some machine
somewhere; I just plug in my memory stick and fire up the SSH client.
This is not appropriate in all circumstances, but it greatly increases
the number of places from which I can access my accounts without using
password authentication.
