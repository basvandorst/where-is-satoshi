@_subject: how to verify that the file is from same sender using return value 
I'm using gpg from an application and verifying files by checking the
return value.
How can I verify that a file is from a certain sender by using gpg's
return value only.
this doesn't seem to work:
gpg --verify "filename.asc" --local-user "name"
