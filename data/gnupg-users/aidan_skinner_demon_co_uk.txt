@_subject: PGP swap to disk? 
I don't understand why GPG needs to be suid, but it might be due to the
particular kernel call it's making. If the bit of memory that holds the private key or password is swaped to
disk, then it might stay there when Eve (an agent of ) gets your HD and can recover it. This is Bad.
