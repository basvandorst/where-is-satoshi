IDEA is patented, that is why default distributions and build of GnuPG
do not include it. But it can be recompiled and built-in and
successfully used. GnuPG supports many other various ciphers such as
CAMELIA, Blowfish, Twofish, AES. You should recompile it with the needed

@_subject: RSA padding scheme 
Greetings everyone!
As I understand, such asymmetric ciphers as RSA and/or ElGamal requires
strong padding applied before "message" is encrypted. Message is of
course the one-time session key, used to encipher the actual data.
There are different versions of PKCS NESSIE, OAEP and other schemes
exist. How can I get which one is used? Trivial grep-ing through the
1.4.10 source code (which one I am using) does not help me much.
Moreover I did not find the way padding can be changed/specified for
example for RSA.
I will be glad to understand what I am missing.

Ah! I see. Thank you! Now I understand.
Hmm, I see. However does it really won't provide much higher security?
Just theoretically very interested in all of that. According to
Wikipedia, there are several kind of attacks against plain RSA (just
some of them):
* sending ciphertext with the same "e" to several recipients
* no randomness
* problems with the product of two ciphertexts
So, padding should close all of those problems. As I can see, PKCS 1.5 just adds random pad to satisfy length requirements. Is those
randomness sufficient to solve above three issues? OAEP, comparing to
PKCS  1.5, is much more "mature" and looks really cool with dependent
on each other X and Y.
If PKCS  1.5 is sufficient, then OAEP just brings "all-or-nothing"
additionally? Or because of RSA's ciphertext "payload" is always pretty
random data (symmetric keys), then (probably) bad padding won't deal any

Hmm, true. Seems really pretty secure in PGP context.
Yeah, agreed.
I see. Well, thank you very much for the explanation and information!

@_subject: Should always add myself as recipient when ecrypting? 
*** Paolo Bolzoni  [Mon, 21 Mar 2016 10:44:06 +0100]:
Without yourself adding to the recipient: only remote party's key
compromising will lead to message decryption. With yourself added: at
least two keys can be compromised for message decryption. Higher risks.
Question of trust. Some people are accurate in context of security and
key management, others are absent-minded and because of them, as one of
recipients, your messages under higher risk.

For me "gpg --export --export-options export-pka KEYID" works fine.
