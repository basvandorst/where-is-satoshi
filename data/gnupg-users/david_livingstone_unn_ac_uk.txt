@_subject: Dignature verification problem 
I am currently trying out GPG 1.0.6, by enacting the role of two dummyusers.
Having encrypted and signed a message (using --sign and --encrypt), I can
decrypt the message and verify the signature using the --decrypt command.
However if I use the --verify command just to verify the signature, it fails
with the error message "verify signatures failed : unexpected data".  Why is
this ?
For information :
*	It makes no difference whether I use --sign before --encrypt or vice
versa when I create the message whose signature is to be verified.
*	Memory is not locked, so I get 'using insecure memory' messages
*	Everything relating to trust has been ignored, so there is no valid
trust path to the key; a fingerprint is generated by --decrypt.

@_subject: Sub Keys versus Session Keys 
The textbooks (e.g. William Stalling's Cryptography & Network Security, 2nded, page 359) refer to PGP using one-time session keys to encrypt messages.
GnuPG seems to use subkeys to encrypt messages instead (see GNU Privacy
Handbook, page 23).
Is this a difference between PGP and GnuPG, or due to using ElGamal instead
of RSA, or what ?

@_subject: Which keyring for Public Keys ? 
In various documents I have come across the 2 following conflictingstatements :
The private keyring stores corresponding private & public keys; the public
keyring stores (other peoples') public keys.
The private keyring stores only private keys; the public keyring stores ones
own and other peoples' public keys.
Which is correct in GnuPG ?
