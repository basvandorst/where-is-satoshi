I am getting the following error on MAKE for gpg1.4.2.2
make[2]: *** No rule to make target `../cipher/libcipher.a', needed by
`gpgsplit'.  Stop.
This is a solaris9 box...was able to successfully install previously on
another solaris9 box.
Anybody have a suggestion?

@_subject: Two servers...one KeyPair 
I am trying to get around the problem of creating one key-pair and using it
on two different servers (TEST and PROD).  Is this possible?  I am using gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.2.2
Thank You.

A vendor encrypts data with our public key.  We receive the file and we
attempt to decrypt it.  Although the file does get decrypted we receive
the warning below.  How do we avoid the warning..we think it is messing
up our automated integration software we use to encrypt/exchange/decrypt
Thank you!

@_subject: Keypair is expiring. 
Back in 2005 when I created my private/public key pair I never believed
the universe would still exist today..hence I set an expiration date of
2010.  Since it's expiringin the next couple of months and I am not sure
what my options are?
Can I change the expiration date of my key pair to not expire...without
having to re-issue another public key to all my encryption partners?
Or do I have to re-issue?

@_subject: gnupg 1.4.7 vs. pgp 6.5.3 
Company 1 is using gnupg 1.4.7 on SunOS.  Company2 is using PGP 6.5.3 on
Company1 encrypts using Company2's public key and ftp's file in ascii
mode to Company2.
Company2 tries to decrypt file and receives error : "bad session keys" or "1 unknown key(s)"
To encrypt we are using command:  gpg -r Charlie.Camut at company.com
--output TEST.txt.pgp --encrypt OUTFILE.go
Is this incompatibility issue between gnupg and pgp or a bonehead
