@_subject: Key import - time warp or clock problem 
After badgering one of my cohorts for over a year, I finally managed to get him to start using GPG - Mac OS X. I spent the better part of the day today getting everything together for him - so he would have an easy time installing GPG. He is quite the newbie and gives up VERY easy... so all it would take would be one "type this in the terminal" and he would give up on the whole process. Just the facts - I have no control. He is in a remote location so I can't help him locally.
Anyway - I created a nice little shell script to get him up and running, help him generate his key, send it to the keyserver, then retrieve my key from the server. All went well with the script (I tested it several times and have over 10+ years of PGP/GPG experience). So I go and retrieve his key from the keyserver, and first of all it won't import. I keep getting this error:
key XXXXXXX has been created 4133 seconds in future (time warp or clock After messing with it a bit I managed to get it imported. Then I started looking at the key and noticed he has no subkey. This is what I get if I do a --list-keys
gpg: key XXXXXXXX has been created 4133 seconds in future (time warp or clock problem)
pub  1024D/XXXXXXXX 2003-09-01 Mr. Name Thats it - no subkey listed!
So what now... how do I get him out of this mess with the least amount of trouble on his end?
What needs to be done to his key?

Thx for the info guys! The problem resolved itself after an hour or so. My clock is set fine so it must be his clock. Even the proper sub-id showed up fine after XX time.
- thx
