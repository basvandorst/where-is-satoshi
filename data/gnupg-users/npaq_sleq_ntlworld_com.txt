@_subject: GPG (MingW32) defaults to revoked key/uid 
Forgive me if this is a terribly common problem/issue, but I've had a lengthy search both of this list and the web generally (as well as trawling at great length through the GPG man) and have found nothing on it.
Being a recent convert to PGP/GPG I have been playing around a bit to get used to it before really deploying it in active use. I recently revoked my first key, and created another, for reasons of convenience I won't go into. By accident I rendered this second key unusable and ended up with a third, did something similar to that one and am now on a fourth (which I will hopefully treat much more sensibly!).
Because of this I have three revoked keys (all have been successfully revoked) and one non-
revoked key, all with at least one uid identical.
Now, when I use gpg to look up a key by any part of a uid (for example when using --edit-
key), it automatically selects the first-created _revoked_ key, not the sole non-revoked one. I have tried revoking and deleting specific uids from the revoked keys, but this makes no Obviously this causes grave problems as maybe encrypting and signing will also default to a revoked key - though I haven't tested really yet - but at very least it's annoying as I have to do --edit-key etc for the newest, active key via the hexadecimal identifier rather than uid.
Any help on sorting out this issue would be much appreciated.
Using GPG 1.4.11 (MingW32), Win XP SP3.
