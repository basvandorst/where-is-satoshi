Hello all,
Following on from this, in my experience, studying the output of the `?list-packets` option has been one of the most effective ways of learning how GnuPG works.

I feel that I've missed a memo too.
I've never liked public keyservers either.  Or, rather, the way they are
normally used.
I especially dislike how beginners' tutorials encourage their users to
upload just-made keys to public keyservers before they (the users) have
even learned how to use GPG with any degree of fluency... or even
confirmed that their new keys are appropriately made or configured.
Can somebody please point me to a more authoritative source of this
keyserver news?  Did Werner himself write anything about this?  If it's
true, then I welcome it too.
On a highly related topic...
My subkeys expired on Monday, 10/12/2018.  I've updated my subkeys with
a new expiration date (in one year).  I'm considering NOT uploading the
new public keys to the keyservers.  Rather, I will distribute them using
other channels, such as downloading from my personal website or sneakernet.
Should I issue and publish a revocation certificate?  Will this cause
problems considering that I'm still using the same master key?
Kind regards,

Yes, they are still safe.  On thinking about it, issuing a revocation
certificate could be overkill.  It might even cause more confusion than
it is meant to solve.
Indeed, so would I.  But then there's also a pretty good chance that the
same person might write to me and ask, "Hey, what's up with your OpenPGP
keys?"  Then I could explain and point them to the right place.  Or, by
then, my website or my email signature might have enough information to
point them in the right direction before it even becomes an issue.
I am coincidentally currently in the process of provisioning an Apache
server with HTTPS/443 enabled.  Not even HTTP/80 will be open, so HTTP
to HTTPS redirection won't be implemented either.
I've looked up Web Key Directory and had a quick browse, and this is
exactly the kind of thing I need.  Thank you!!
Kind regards,

Hey Arthur, what makes you think that Yubikey is trustworthy?
Is it because you have assessed your threat model and you disbelieve
that any potential attacks via Yubikey would be not used against you?
Or have you done an independent audit of the Yubikey and satisfied
yourself that it's safe enough for your reasons?
Or is it a bit of both?
Or is it something completely different?
I'd love something as convenient as Yubikey but given how strictly I've
set up my workflow; and given that I want to make a habit best practices
wherever possible; I cannot use it because it will introduce a weak
link.  I saw a few different devices that look auditable and like I
might be able to trust them more.  I'll find them in my notes and make a
post later.

@_subject: Most secure GPG combination for Mac OSX 
Please excuse any previous attempt at posting this, which was sent
"From: " the wrong address.
Mail.app, and as a result they've sometimes been slower to patch things
than Enigmail.  Enigmail has excellent relations with Thunderbird, which
really helps when there's a serious bug which needs addressing.
So I may confirm my understanding...
-   Enigmail and GPGTools are orthogonal components re: Thunderbird.
Enigmail is something like the interface to the underlying GPG
implementation.  In many cases on Mac OS X, including mine, this
underlying implementation is indeed GPGTools (which I use not only for
Thunderbird but for most/all OpenPGP operations).
-   Also, you are not suggesting that the choice is Enigmail vs
GPGTools.  But rather that they have different levels of specificity re:
and integration into Thunderbird.
Are these notions correct?  Thanks!!
Kind regards,

@_subject: Utilizing facts of homedir organization (was: Exact definition of 
This raises interesting questions regarding subkeys.
For example, earlier this month there was a short thread with "Subject:
Subkeys" where OP was asking about generating subkeys.  The advice was
to consult  .  That page contains the
following instructions:
where `KEYGRIP` is the "keygrip" of the master key which can be found by
running `gpg2 --with-keygrip --list-key YOURMASTERKEYID.`"
All other sources of information for generating subkeys that I have seen
contain similar instructions.
This is using the contents of `~/.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d/` as an API.
If this is *not* part of the API, then what *is* the official
recommendation for generating subkeys?
