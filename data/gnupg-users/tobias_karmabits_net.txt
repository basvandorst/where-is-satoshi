@_subject: Multiple self signatures 
============================== START ==============================
I have multiple self signatures within my key and I haven't
found a reason yet. I usually don't self-sign my key several
times (well, at least I'm not aware of it). :)
How can I prevent this?
I'd really appreciate any hints.
