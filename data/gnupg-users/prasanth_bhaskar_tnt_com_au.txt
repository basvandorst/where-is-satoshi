@_subject: GnuPG Compilation problem on HPUX 10.20 
I am trying to compile GnuPG ver 1.0.3 on one of our HPUX boxes running on 10.20. I am using gcc version 2.95.2. It comes out with following    gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I.. -I../include -I../intl    -g -O2 -Wall -c iobuf.c
iobuf.c: In function `iobuf_open':

I am not quite sure what to do. Does anyone have any idea about this problem? Your suggestions would be greatly helpful for me.

This works fine. Thank you.
Now I am struck with another one... Compilation proceeds further ahead and comes out with another error as follows.
Making all in checks
No suffix list.
        ../g10/gpg --no-options --quiet --yes --dearmor -o ./pubring.gpg ./pubring.asc
*** Termination signal 12
*** Error exit code 1
*** Error exit code 1
Anyone seen this error??... I can't see a file pubring.pgp in  checks at all. Do I need to get this file from anywhere else?
Please help
