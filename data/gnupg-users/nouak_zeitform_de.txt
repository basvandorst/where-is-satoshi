@_subject: Error on initial call under Darwin 
I'm running Mac OS X 10.3.5 (Darwin 7.5.0) and compiled with tiger, new-tiger and sha512. This worked like a charm.
However, if I invoke gpg as a user for the very first time these error messages would appear:
gpg: failed to create temporary file `/Users//.gnupg/. Permission gpg: keyblock resource `/Users//.gnupg/secring.gpg': Allgemeiner gpg: failed to create temporary file `/Users//.gnupg/. Permission gpg: keyblock resource `/Users//.gnupg/pubring.gpg': Allgemeiner "Allgemeiner Fehler" should be translated as "common error" which doesn't mean very much, does it?
This happend on two different machines with various users not having a ~/.gnupg directory already.
Does anybody know what I possibly could have done wrong? I aim to provide binaries for Mac OS X users so I should be able to compile a version which does not provoke those errors.
I appreciate your help.

Hi Werner,

Thanks for your reply.
The point is: I get this error message as a new user who doesn't have any .gnupg dir yet. Unlike previous versions gnupg 1.2.6 needs a present .gnupg dir to create some of the necessary files to run gnupg If you create the .gnupg dir yourself and invoke gpg then, pubring.gpg and secring.gpg are created but the gpg.conf is missing :-((((
This behaviour is not limited to Darwin but happens under Linux as well.
So it seems to be another bug introduced with 1.2.6.
For the Mac installer this is not very serious since we are working on a script which creates the files if not already present for all existing users. Furthermore we also add .gnupg with its files inside the user template.
However, this seems to be a nasty bug for all users new to gnupg creating their keyfiles for the very first time.

Mac OS X is another one.
After installing readline (not present on Darwin by default!) and running configure like you suggested will in gnupg with readline support on Darwin.
However, if you can wait some more days Mac GPG Project will offer binaries with readline support.

first of all I would like to thank Gordon for bringing this project into being, early enough, so that it could develop as Mac OS X developped. His ambitious administration brought this project to a very good state and it will be difficult to proceed at a similar level.
I will try my very best.
However, please bear with me while I try to get an overview of what needs to be done and how we can continue the good work. I have to admit that I am not a programmer at all. I'm just an ambitious user, interested in privacy and willing to help to find easy ways for Mac users to protect their privacy as well. This was the reason why I was contributing to the Mac GPG Project to the best of my abilities and I will continue to do so even harder now.
If you have any ideas on how we should proceed in this project do not hesitate to tell me. Any help is appreciated.
Gordon, I wish you all the best for whatever you will be doing in the future. However, stay tuned with us :-)

this is IMHO a serious bug I reported weeks ago but never got confirmation from the developers whether They see this as a bug and whether or not they are working on a fix.
Meanwhile you need to create the ~/.gnupg directory yourself. Then change to the directory of the source and copy g10/options.skel to You might want to delete the first three lines of the gpg.conf, so open the file in a text editor and remove them.
Now you're done. At the next start of gpg the necessary keyfiles should be created.

It is correct that you can compile gnupg on any Mac OS X >= 10.2 with  its appropriate Developer Tools installed. To compile it on an Intel  Mac or to receive Universal Binaries you will however need to use gcc  4.0.1 or later which you may find with XCode 2.21 or in the Developer  Tools for Mac OS X 10.4
