@_subject: Delete key from a keyserver 
Hi, maybe it is a dumb question, but I saw a few publick keys of mine on a
keyserver which aren't being used...
I have read the GnuPG manual how to revoke a key (--gen-revoke) but I don't
have the secret keys anymore.... Is is possible to erase them from the key-
server ???

following operating systems:
as usual, for non-commercial use it is for free otherwise you will have to
pay for it.
Have fun with, it
