@_subject: Extracting the session key using gpme? 
I need to make many existing documents available to a new recipient by
revealing the session key to them (in an encrypted message, of course). I
can figure out how to do that with the gpg command line tool, but not with
gpgme. The documentation does not even appear to have the phrase "session
key" in it.
The man page for the gpg command line tool comes with a stern warning about
key escrow, but that doesn't sound at all like what I'm doing, so I take it
I can safely ignore it.
Thanks in advance!

Hi Werner,
Thanks for your reply!
No worries, I'm not demanding anything, just trying to figure out if what I
want to do is appropriate, and, if so, what the best way to do it is :)
So, to be clear, the reason this isn't in GPGME isn't because what I'm
doing is fundamentally wrong, it's just that the gpgme equivalent of the
way you'd currently do it using the gpg command line tool can be used for
things gpg doesn't intend to support (specifically, key escrow).
Or, perhaps more specifically: what I want isn't wrong, but the only way to
accomplish it is using the gpg command line tool, there are good reasons
for this, and I should just use the gpg command line tool? :)

Okay, great; I just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing anything. Command
line tool it is.
Thanks again,
