Have any of you found an easy way to integrate GPG with Novell  GroupWise's Win client? There is an old project floating around which  worked with PGP and former versions of GW, but I can't find anything  recent. My institution uses GroupWoes for their email, and I have  quite a few co-workers who would use GPG if they could use it  relatively seamlessly, but are stuck on using the Win Novell client.  Any help would be appreciated, as I'm at a double disadvantage here:  I refuse to use any Novell client, and I'm a Mac/Linux guy anyway.
