@_subject: Need IDEA-Plugin, please help 
Hello gnupg-users,
I'm searching for the IDEA-extension-file for my gnupg(1.2.4) to include the algo into it. I found these links:
"ftp://ftp.gnupg.dk/pub/contrib-dk/idea.c.gz"  -or-
But I was only able to receive the "*.sig-files". While trying to get the other files, connection closed/timed out. I tried again, but nothing... Can someone help me to get these files and the sig-files from another location as the one above?
Thank you and have a nice evening.
