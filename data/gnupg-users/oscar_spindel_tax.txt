@_subject: New keyserver at keys.openpgp.org - what's your take? 
I'm generally curious on your opinions on the latest new keyserver, this time running a new software than the normal keyservers.
They seem to have a different model which minimize the amount of information available, to be compliant with GDPR and friends. Do you think there are any downsides to this?

Yes, of course it would be. But then, why would they even bother to
hash it?
This entire conversation is...interesting. If ProtonMail was
interested in selling our data then they chose a very small usergroup
to target, and honestly, that usergroup is too small to prove any real
value of any kind. And they claim they use end to end encryption, so
selling our data would be limited to phone numbers and email
addresses, data which is readily available elsewhere. (given that you
trust their end to end encryption claim)
I'm not a PM user but have been, and I liked their service due to
usability, being able to use sieve filtering and so forth. Had I been
truly paranoid I'd use something else.
