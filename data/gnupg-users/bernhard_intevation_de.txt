@_subject: gpgpgsm merging public kbx / exporting all keys 
having two machines I would want to merge my public x509 certificates
from one to the other. Another use case would be backup purposes.
What is the recommended way doing this?
I found one and I believe this should be better documented.
gpgsm --export >exported-x509-keys
does not work.
gpgsm: exporting more than one certificate is not possible in binary mode
Oka so
    gpgsm --armor --export >exported-x509-keys
and gpgsm --import exported-x509-keys works.
While doing so I looked up the documentation "export [PATTERN]"
and searching for PATTERN did not result into the section that
explains how to select a user id. I suggest to add a sentence which contains "PATTERN" to this section.
Also with gpg you can just
gpg --import pubring.gpg which makes merging a lot easier.
For the gpg trust-list there are command line options for exporting
and importing. So I would suggest to add least add the example
of the recommended way to the manual and textinfo documentation.
I searched way to long to find this way.

Wonderful, thanks for the change!
I also suggest to change the how-to-specify-a-user-id:: section to include
the string "PATTERN" so that string searching would also produce that section.
Okay, I did not know. :)
Well as long as it works, it is quite handy, I suggest to add
something in the documentation to not rely on this for anything automated
because there will be no consideration of backwards compatibility.
There is a) How to migrate a secret key
b) How to merge public keys with trustlist, e.g. for backups or
   several machines.

Moin Hauke,
thanks for caring and sharing.
A few random thoughts:
* I'm not quite sure what the aim of your gui is. To create a nice and usable gui (which then automatically means it has to be understandable and as simple as possible) we need to know what it should do. In my point of view most of the "crypto" problem should be done in the application that needs the crypto operations. So End-to-End Email -> Email application. File Encryption/Decryption -> File manager. Managing "contacts", your PIM or Email application. So what tasks are still left?
* Gnupg can do CMS for S/MIME and OpenPGP for PGP/MIME,  there have been long discussions over the Gpg4win compendium that led to the suggestion to call
the "public key part" _certificate_. Thjs could improve your gui's wording.
* The hard part, IMO is to build, maintain and somehow display the trust path and its level to the communication partners. Your draft does not address this part. E.g. your gui is used to find a certificate for "Hauke Laging", now you can import it, but how does the user know its you?

I've commented the article under the LWN news about GnuPG 2.1.0 release
 as following:
"If Sm?ri's thoughts on GnuPG reveal something, it is that we need to spread more knowledge about how GnuPG works. In the post, the supported API of GnuPG, GPGME is miss-spelled and the current python libaries for interacting with it were not identified.  shows that pyme has moved to a new location with 0.9 published on May 2014 and the alternative pygpgme's 0.3 is from 2012. There is example code which is nice to work with.
Of course the command line interface is not the best stable interface to program GnuPG, it is because it is used as an interface to humans using the command line. GPGME is much better, of course it can be improved further.
Yes, Werner and his company g10code need your support, see  . (Full disclosure: My company Intevation is a business partner of g10code.)"

True, Werner went a long way to keep it stable.
Still it is a bit of a pain to keep it this way and a better interface is called for anyway, because this has limitations to build good interface. This is whey we have gpgme for more than 10 years, Werner also did a very good job there.  Gpgme needs to get more popular, probably improved along the way,
but it also would help to make the crypto-experience with GnuPG a lot better for developers and users alike.

thanks for working on Free Software and for discussing questions like this in the open!
The short answer (from someone that was in the project team of S/MIME implementations for mutt and kmail and support for PGP/MIME for Kontact Mail and the Outlook plugin for Gpg4win (my roles did include technical coordination, analysis and testing.):
I am on the PGP/MIME side of things, I recommend it as default for sending out emails. See also  .
a) for encrypted emails, there is no drawback. Every email client just have to be able to deal with message/rfc822 mime-parts anyway.
b) for signatures,  lists the drawback that some transport agents will modify attachments. In the past I've published a number of patches and problem reports to Mailman, so I know this issue quite a bit. It is due to a missdesign of the python email package and it should be fixed. (And it is fixable by a reasonable effort).
Another drawback is that some proprietary email clients (like outlook) do not enable someone to influence the mime-structre. This is the bigger issue of On the other hand, the advantages are clear and PGP/MIME seems the best design
given current standards and practure of SMTP and MIME. And given a reasonable mime library, the implementation for creation is much easier as for parsing and should not pose a major problem.

Bernhard

@_subject: Pros and cons of PGP/MIME for outgoing e-mail? 
Hi Bjarni,
you are welcome! I know that some people sound a little but grumpy, but this mostly is the case, because they feel like they are reiterating well known arguments. This is partly true. Still I believe that we all feel some pressure
to make the situation better for users. So we may need to rethink the solutions radically again, to see if we come to the same answer.
You are saying that "most mail" clients cannot handle PGP/MIME encrypted email. And you say that is especially true for web based email clients.
My argument starts at: almost all MUAs (mail user clients) can deal with MIME.
So they must have a working MIME parser.
For them to implement PGP/MIME for decryption is very easy:
Just decrypt the contents and put it through the parser they already have.
If someone aims for implementing this, it can be done easily.
In this case of course they might also lack the standard tools to unzip
the archive in your first ad-hoc strategy. So it will be better to fall back
on an attachment (that includes an archive file) that people can decrypt.
Oh, what about the idea to just ship a MIME parser with GnuPG. >;)
If more people implement the good standard PGP/MIME, more clients will implement it as well.
So I see that sending PGP/MIME as default is good,
with an option that the user can fall back to a zipped and encrypted (gpg-zip/gpg-tar compatible format) attachment,  The email standard library assumed that whitespace and header lines are insignificant (last time I've looked, I think I even filed an issue with mailman and with python, but it was a long while ago). So they completely disassemble them to put the together again when they are needed. In this process they strip whitespaces, headerlines and reformat linebreaks.
So there is a designed loss of information in the library. To me that is a design issue of the library. And I believe most other MIME libraries will not share it.
From the security point of view I think it is good that PGP/MIME enforces
that mime(sub)parts will not be modified, because if you allow changes there, which are to be assumed identical, you may introduce an attack surface because some clients may display the contents slight differently. A clever attacker may exploit this to play tricks on the user.
There is one criteria added to the design of MIME libraries:
If I save a mime object -- let us say an message/rfc822 -- I can get it out the same way I have put it in. I'd say that this would be good design anyway.
Again, the problem is only really there for signatures verification
or email forwarding or so.
For encryption, you are writing your own mime-parts so it is easy to not create strange headers or double whitespaces in them. For decryption you just decrypt the blob and then have a regular MIME structure.
There are some rules about whitespace to not have it getting in the way,
but in general conceptually I see no other way, if you want to make sure that
an email has not been tampered with.
If you want some indication about what the communication is about before opening it, the indication has to be on the "envelope" and thus cannot be encrypted. Once opened, there can be a different contents. I can think of coming up with something where there is a second message/rfc822 within the message and the subject: line in there should be displayed instead of the envelope subject by email clients that have already done the complete decryption (though then you have the interface problem where to display the envelope subject). In total I would say that having an envelope subject is good anyway and that most email clients would continue to display it, because
it could contain important information still.
I'd say you are slightly unlucky with pythons "email" library.
(It is really hard to say from the little I know.)
There is always (some) interest, but it is hard work. Some of your assumptions do not seem to be shared in full by others.

This would be best asked on The answer is: no - the situation is similiar to earlier reports.
GnuPG and Gpg4win development needs serious funding to be able to larger necessary steps like an overhaul of the user interface or an PGP/MIME GpgOL.
There are some ideas to try to get some funding for GnuPG, which Werner can best report on. He improved his system for volunteer payment (some call it donations) for instance. In Germany there were some political statements aming to support funding GnuPG or Gpg4win, but no tangible plans that g10code or Intevation have been approached with. Right now our best and most reliable source of funding is single "donations".
Though they can only support Gpg4win/GnuPG development on a very low level,
we are very grateful for each single one. Thanks!

Hi Eva,
which gpgme python wrapper are you using? pyme or pygpgme?
You probably should use one of them, see Can you decrypt on the command line?
Note that there must be a way your private certificate is unlocked,
the standard procedure may be to use an empty passphrase.

Just wanted to point out that the release announcement left me confused at a few points. If it confused me (as a long time GnuPG User/Contributor) I assume it will confuse many others as well.
To restate, I was confused about
* What the items in section "What's New in GnuPG-2.1" actually meant,
  it were the differencen 2.1.1 to 2.1.2 as I could figure out, but this   wasn't clear from the text.
* "This version fixes a lot of bugs found after the release of 2.1.0"
  which probably should have been "2.1.1". Overall I believe the announcement as too much text that stays the same
for each release. It would benefit from being focussed on the key differences
and let the rest be a standard "doc" part.

I believe the main thing that Werner is mentioning here is that
analysis of an unwanted situation and a fix are two different things.
Having a reproducable problem report is very valuable and may be easier to agree on as first step. Then there are always several ways to improve the situation.
And naturally this may lead to a discussion about what is the best way
to take.
So if anyone find a problem with GnuPG - may it be a defect or a behaviour that should be different - best is to get a reproducable behaviour reported and get people to agree that it is a problem.

Hi all,
 It takes more than 10? to do this.
Gpg4win already signs the installer with an authenticode certificate
(which costs a few hundered ?s). For services like wald or wiki.gnupg.de, experts have a trustpath
via ca.intevation.de. However we believe it is useful to secure some services with TLS.
Yes. Background is that Gpg4win traditionally shares some services with some other Free Software initatives, so in comparision to a fresh setup we need to detangle and migrate some services. This needs some time and planning from
those that run the services. (And for some years now Gpg4win does not have
the same level of funding that GnuPG has recently aquired. So there are some
old structure to modernise.)
Thomas (in cc) is one of our system administrators, he will steer the process
from our side and respond to your question (on gpg4win-users-en at wald.intevation.org I guess, but this is up to him. :) ).

Hi Dashamir,
I like the goal of making gpg2 more accessible.
However I am not sure that you are actually reaching the goal
by using sh wrappers. When looking at the man pages, it seems
that they are already long with a number of phrases to learn.
Most of these commands are not much easier than the direct gpg2
commands they are aiming to replace.
Drawbacks I see with your approach:
* people will have to learn a slightly different set of commands
  with egpg and gpg2 and sooner or later will use the gpg2 commands
  and then they will be confused or have extra learning efforts.
* shell scripts will not work on plattforms without a shell
  (e.g. Windows)
* I haven't looked into the .epgp directory, but it may have some configs
  and then the behaviour of other applications will depend on whoch config
  they use.
* BTW: There is a potential name clash with Ideas for improvements:
* I you must, write wrappers code it in something more plattform indepentent,   e.g. in python3 (using pyme or pygpgme where appropriate)
* Suggest and improve the original gpg2 command line interface, so that
  usage is easier and the more esotheric options will not be seen or used
  by default.
* Write a beginners man page for the original gpg2, which covers only the main
  use cases.

Hi Dashamir,
you are welcome! I appreciate all efforts to make GnuPG more accessible,
this is why I am taking a little bit of time to write up some feedback.
Just like Peter wrote I think that a user would usually not
encounter all bells and wistles. You can get along with just a few commands. This is why I suggest of trying to approach this from
the documentation angle and for the remaining options that are still too hard: Suggest improvements directly to gpg2.
Just like Peter I do not fully understand the rationale behind those
choices and would probably choose different ones.
A good path forward would be to try to measure this with groups of users in a usability test. This is a lot of effort I guess,
so instead we could try to develop a few personas (example user types)
and try to argu from their point of view.
Using Cygwin is not a good approach because it is lik a second operating system within windows. Windows users would prefer a more windows like Any cross plattform approach would work. Python has the advantage
that the source code can be changed by an editor an immedeately run
and that it works fairly well cross-plattform.
What is even more important is that you should use the official API to
GnuPG which is Gpgme. The goals of out EasyGpg206 are different: We will add some new trust and cert distribution methods to GnuPG and some selected email applications. Users shall never needs to go to the command line.

= Much easier Email crypto, by fetching pubkey via HTTPS == How does it work?
As an email user, you just select the recipient(s) and can see that the email will be encrypted.
If you and your peers use email-providers offering this "web key service", it works by the first email. Otherwise encryption will start after you have exchanged some emails.
Technically your email client will automatically
* prepare for this by creating a crypto key for you and uploading   it to your provider (or second best to public keyservers).
* sign all emails so others see that you are ready for crypto   (unless you opt out)
* ask the mail provider of your recipients for their pubkeys.
An email-provider offering the "web key service" technically has to
* provide a pubkey for each user via ~HT~TPS
* allow each user's email client to automatically manage the pubkey    that gets published by email.

for decryption, only the private key of the recipient is needed.
Typing in that passphrase is as difficult (or easy) as typing in the symmetric key. Of course asymmetric crypto would need them to create a key-pair first.
But symmetric encryption has the problem of you needing to transfer the keys each time.
Usually you sign first and then encrypt. This way the signature stay verifiable even after decryption.
A passphrase is not needed for asymmetric encryption.
It is only needed to unlock your private key for signing.
If you want to build an automated system, one way is to just have a private key without passphrase (and secure the system). There are other ways of Yes, it is. :)

I completely agree, the paper shows problems with the current specifications, backend and frontend implementations. We should (help to) fix it in all three Best for GnuPG would be to not display contents which did not have integrity protection by either:
 a) MDC
 b) AEAD
 c) a signature over the whole contents from someone where it has been
    encrypted to (if this is feasable to detect).
Note that it is not just email clients that are in danger.
If you get a file with active contents (e.g. an HTML file, or a video reference) and you decrypt it as data on the command line it is fine up to there. But once you try to read or open it, you'll have a backchannel.
People clearly seem to want a way to send files with potentially active elements. So in my opinion the crypto standards and backends should be designed to allow this in the safest way possible. Best Regards,

.. to only display contents if there was integrity protection by either
if users or frontends still want to show contents, to me it seems good if
* there is a very explicit disable-safety-button
* ideally working only for one encryption, so it has been issued explicitely
  each time
* a warning against active content which may become active much later
* an attempt to prevent active backchannels as much as possible
  (e.g. by only showing plain text and saving as plain-text suffix)
would need to be put in the documentation so GnuPG frontends know.

My point is that it is legitimate to send files with potentially active contents. And they are a problem even outside of an email application.
So making integrity checks a hard requirement and do not display anything

Personally I believe that it is a need for users to have end-to-end
encryption with email. And it is a legitimate need for users to have
some markup and graphical layout. I agree that technically HTML (with it extensions) is a bad format to serve this need. Similiar to PDF. One RTF was an approach Nextstep's mail took
and that got some adoption, but not enough. Today it would be some very simple
wiki markup language.
The technical and organisational difficulty is how to control backchannels

Can you give me pointers here.
Even unattented use needs proper care of passphrases
(best is to leave them out) and status codes (which a command line cannot usually handle well, thus gpgme for more complicated cases).
In my experience command line and unattended use is fully supported
and extended in GnuPG. It is just the rare unix system or very small system
space that may get more problematic because of different support libraries and system calls. GnuPG cannot implement all functionality it needs by itself
and thus we inherit some size and platform restrictions.
I wonder about pubkey management though. There is a faster pubkey store,
there are ways to automatically assign fetch pubkeys with basic trust (WKD) and options to give a pubkey for just this encryption operation, those all sound like improvements in the server use cases to me.

until about 2009 GnuPG [1] had dsa1024/elg2048 as default key algorithms.
There are still keys around with those algorithmus.
Recommendations from the US and Europe [2] only list DSA between 1900
and 3000 bits as allowed for legacy use. So it is clear that DSA1024
should not be used anymore.
How urgent is it to convince people to create new keypairs?
To me this means rephrased:
   How strong or weak is this combination of keys for todays usage?
Wikipedia points out a strong  sensitivity of the algorithm to the quality of random number generators and that implementations could deliberately leak information in the signature [3]. This alone probably is a reason to switch Apart from the problems an attacker could be solving the discrete log problem.
A presentation from 2013 [4] assumes that advances are made towards solving
this in a practical time frame. Does somebody has good pointers on the state of the art for this?
Because dsa1024/elg2048 used to be a default of GnuPG, I think it would be helpful to point our users towards a well understood reasoning when and why they should move to a better key-pair.
What do you think?

The problem with autocrypt are the cases where its security measures are tested. There is not good way to interact with the users in those cases.
I know this is not parts of its design goals, but it works against a better
user experience.
The progrem with hagrid (from what I've heard) is that it is again an attempt of a validating keyserver, which means it has to centralize the trust function or there is no point in the validation.
This makes WKD most mature and easiest for users in my eyes. (I was involved in its design.).

To add to this:
The idea for WKD was to be able to improve the algorithm when a new search is done. It is just obvious that the extreme cases to always retrieve a pubkey
when using it and to never again retrieve a pubkey are not suitable.
There is a lot in between, which could also depend on the client and users idea of their security compromises. So it is a normal situation with WKD that the client algorithm when to refresh will be adapted like Werner is mentioning above.

With WKD and the related "automatic encryption" concept, there is an outline since 2 years how a much better crypto experience can be done with GnuPG as a crypto engine. Modern clients like GpgOL already implement a large part of this, you type in an email address and even if this is the first time, you get an encrypted

If you trust a set of root certificates, like the ones shipped with your operating system or a different application, you could just import them all and mark them trusted. Of course you would need to sync this, if the set changes on updates.
