hello guys,
well this is my first mail to this mailin list, i hope
i get my problem solved.
i have created a encrypted data file through gnupg
algorithm, as it is it can be decrypted anytime with
the right passphrase and the UID, what i wanna do is
decrypt the encrypted file through a shell script, any
person whom i send this file should just have to run
the shell script which will do all the work for him,
like decrypting the file and the performing some tasks
after that.
i have gone through the man pages of gnupg but couldnt
really solve my problem.
can someone please tell me how this could be done ...
all comments would be appreciated
Thanks in advance

hi guys,
   this is the first time i using GnuPG. i have
successfully encrypted the file, what i want to do it
copy the fle and take it somewhere else, now the
person who has this file should need to run some kind
of binary format script which will decrypt the file
and make it available for use on thhat machine.
as explained in the GnuPG i cannot decrypt a file
without giving the "passphrase". i wanted to know if
there is any way i can decrypt gpg encrypted file
without giving the "passphrase". my binary file which
is a c program will automatically decrypt the file
first and then do the further processes
Thanks in advance
