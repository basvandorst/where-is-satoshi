What would be an equally good equivalent
for those of us using a Linux distro?

It's my understanding that the Chinese Government forces the family to
pay for the cost of the bullet.
I like the Chinese system:  Just have the criminal to be executed kneel
and then kill him or her with a single bullet to the back of the head.
Quick, humane, and with the family paying for the cost of the bullet,
cost-effective.  Seems like a much better system than we use in the US.

@_subject: Meaning  of "sig!   N" self-signature 
I've received a key with two userIDs (identify and keyIDs changed):
     uid  Dummy Name      sig!     N   12345678 2007-10-29  [self-signature]
     uid  Dummy Name
     sig!         123456789 2007-10-19  [self-signature]
Question 1:  In the first userID's self-signature what does
             the "N" indicate?
Question 2:  And how would one generate such a self-signature.

@_subject: Command Line Use of GPG 
*Using*:  Using Windows XP with SP3, Thunderbird 2.0.0.17,
          GPG 1.49, and Enigmail 0.95.7.  No problems.
*Question*:  How -- independent of Enigmail or any other GUI -- can I
             use GPG via the command line procedure (e.g., to sign
             someone's key with a "trust" signature)?
For some reason the following approach won't let me access GPG:
    1.  "Start | Run" gpg --edit-key deadbeef.
    2.  C:\Documents and Settings\Kara> gpg --edit-key deadbeef
    3.  C:\> gpg --edit-key deadbeef
In each of the above attempts, the resulting error message is:
'gpg' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable
program or batch file."
Once I can access GPG via the command line, I know what to do from
that point on.

@_subject: Absence of John W Moore III 
G'day Friends of John
Regretfully and unexpectedly John's mother quietly died early Tue
morning (6 Jul).
John has asked me to inform you that as an understandable result of
the above, he anticipates he will be both out-of-contact and off-line
for perhaps the next two months or so.
    a.  The 8 Jul surgery on John's foot has been canceled
        and will probably be rescheduled for sometime in Aug.
    b.  As you could anticipate, John plans to be actively
        back as soon as possible under the above
        circumstances.  However he wants you to be aware of
        why that will not be possible within the immediate
        future.
