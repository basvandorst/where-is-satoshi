Yes, you should.
There's a better solution: Why you don't get a mail address
which you can use your whole life?  There are much services
where you can get such an address, for example Hotmail.com
or Netforward.com.
Cheers, Thomas

@_subject: GnuPG distribution - Windows 
* Samuel }slund  [011010 13:30]:
Yes, it's possible to do so.
But you don't have to distribute any source code at all.
You only must make sure, that your users get access to the
source code for free (or, only at cost of sales).
Pointing them to ftp.gnupg.org (if you use an unmodified
version of gpg) is enough, to fulfill the license.
But please notice, if you distribute gpg with your own
changes, you must distribute your modifications to the
public, under GPL and as source.

@_subject: locking problems? 
I'm using GnuPG on Linux.  Now, something strange happened.
I was running a 'gpg --import' while I was trying to do a
'gpg --list-keys'.  I got the following output:
(thomasb ~ 113/0) % gpg --list-sigs XXXXXXXX
gpg: /home/thomasb/.gnupg/pubring.gpg: Schl=FCsselbund erstellt
gpg: error reading key: =D6ffentlicher Schl=FCssel nicht gefunden
(yes, I've enabled NLS. It means something like:
gpg: /home/thomasb/.gnupg/pubring.gpg: keyring created
gpg: error reading key: public key not found)
It seems, like GnuPG has overwritten my pubring.gpg.
Fortunatly, I had a backup in ~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg~... but
maybe, someone needs to look a bit deeper into file locking
in GnuPG... imagine, something like that happens with your
secring.gpg.... :/
