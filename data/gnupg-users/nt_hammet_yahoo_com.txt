@_subject: gnupg, can v1.0.6 be used to gen RSA keys? 
Hello gnupg users,
   Going through the source code and testing the gpg command line,
I don't see a way to gen an RSA-type public key.  the FAQ says that
after ver1.0.3, that RSA is supported.  Does this mean it is only
supported for encryption with RSA public keys, and not with RSA
key generation and of course RSA private key decryption?
Regards, Newton
