Please CC me in etc, I'm not subscribed to the list.
Haven't been able to 'refresh all public keys' on keys.gnupg.net in
Enigmail for a while now (only have two keys), so I had a look at the
servers responsible (host keys.gnupg.net) - the following appear to be
bad for me accessing from the UK:
131.155.141.70: No response to pings
63.230.134.161: Destination Host Unreachable
173.175.198.28: No response to pings
I'm guessing Enigmail/Icedove is consistently using a bad server.

Fair point, although that would be a network misconfiguration as
ping/ICMP is required for network troubleshooting, packet fragmentation
stuff etc (for reference I'm testing from a dedicated line that I control).
I can confirm that all hosts at least appear to respond (i.e. not stall
gpg), when queried direct, but a number don't seem to be maintaining the
same pool of keys:
gpgkeys: key 7977070A723C6CCB696C0B0227A5AC5A01937621
gpgkeys: key E76095ECDACD5DEC7653A99617D23C7DFDC2F38F
Cant be retrieved hosts:
Not found on keyserver hosts:
hkp://109.239.48.152:80 was particularly bad:
gpg: refreshing 2 keys from hkp://109.239.48.152:80
gpg: requesting key 01937621 from hkp server 109.239.48.152
gpg: requesting key FDC2F38F from hkp server 109.239.48.152
gpg: packet(2) with unknown version 71
gpg: read_block: read error: invalid packet
gpg: Total number processed: 0
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpgkeys: key 7977070A723C6CCB696C0B0227A5AC5A01937621 not found on keyserver
gpgkeys: key E76095ECDACD5DEC7653A99617D23C7DFDC2F38F not found on keyserver
The stalling I guess is an Enigmail screwup (more commandline experience
for me is fine ;))

Thanks for all your help - sounds overly complicated so clearly I'm not
going to be able to go further here. Assuming the servers work, I ran
the gpg query and then triggered the same thing in Enigmail while
running wireshark listening for HTTP traffic - gpg clearly showed up,
whilst Enigmail did nothing!!!
So it was Enigmail all along... I will post a bug now.
Thanks again.
