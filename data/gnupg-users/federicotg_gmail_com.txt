@_subject: Question regarding user identification withing the keyrring 
I am writting a tool to help distribute files securely using cryptography and I am basing my ideas on PGP (in fact its web of trust I have a doubt regarding how does such a tool (GPG, PGP) identify users when it has to pick up a public key from the keyrring to verify a signature.
Does the signed message provide the signer's public key along with its name and email? Does the system look for the email and name in the reciever's keyring and try to verify the signature with one that matches?
I have to decide what information would I use for matching a signed document with a user's certificate, should I use the public key or the I know X.509 certificates have a unique Id per certificate issued, but that is because there is a central CA issueing all certs., which is not the case when using GPG.
I know this is not related to GPG particularly, but I thought maybe some of you may help me.
I hope you understand my question.
Thanks you  and sorry for bothering you.

Thanks, you have clarified this to me. However isn't there a very small chance (of course negligible) that 2 users will generate the same keypair? After all a key is just a computer generated number and each key is independently generated by each user.
Anyway, now  know I have to use the public key as the keyID or a hash of it, thanks.
