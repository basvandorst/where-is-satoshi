@_subject: newbe question: How to change the directory of the \gnupg\keyrings on WinNT 
I have a slightly problem with making the Gnu PG working the way we want it
to do.
I have downloaded the gnupg-w32-1.0.6 and are following the Installation
We want to keep everything on a diskett (a:) both the program and the
folder with the keyrings.
It says in the Installation instructions that if we would want to use
another directory wi should enter into the Registry under the key:
and use forward slashes
I can not get this to work, please help
