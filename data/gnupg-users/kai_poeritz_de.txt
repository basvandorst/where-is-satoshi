@_subject: Is the OpenPGP card open hardware 
Hi folks,
I hear a lot of poeple -saying- that the OpenPGP card is "open hardware".
Now as much as I would like it to be just that, I can not find any
reference about that claim to be true.
I see a lot of online shops selling the OpenPGP card, but none of them
claims the card to be open hardware.
I am confused about what people -say- when i -talk- to them in personal
and what I find as printed facts.
E.g. A mecrchandise shop owner at "Linux Tag 2014 in Berlin" that also
sold the OpenPGP cards said (that was his 1st and major selling point):
"The thing is open hardware".
So my questions are simply:
1) Is the OpenPGP card indeed open hardware?
2) If so, where can I read abaout the hardware layout and the firmware?
3) If not so, what makes the OpenPGP different from any other
proprietary samrtcard?
Thanks in advance
