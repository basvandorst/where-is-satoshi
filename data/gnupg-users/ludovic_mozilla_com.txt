@_subject: Organizing a GPG key signing party in London 
I'm organizing a pgp key signing party in London on March the 25th at
6:30 PM BST in the mozilla space of the mozilla office in London.
I've been trying to reach out to Londoners and Uk users of pgp using
twitter (  ),
I've tried to contact the Linux Users group, but din't get much out of
it. So I'm going to try to get some atention here.
The space is limited in the london office so you'll need to register
using event brite at

When I see the state of the entries on big lumber (I've contacted
everyone whose in London , and 75% of the email addresses didn't work) -
I'm pretty sure it won't help.

This was pretty clear on the fosdem keysgning key page
That's because some people were late. I've submitte feedbakc to the
organizer , adn he'll change a few things for netx year.
We had that once in 2007 - it didn't scale at all. Time for people to
seat etc ....
that's a very good point.
I've said tell people in avacnce how long it might take.
Thanks Julian
