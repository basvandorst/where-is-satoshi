@_subject: Do I have to install gpg before using gpgme library? 
Dear All,
I am making development on an encryption tool based on the GPGME library.
As the gpgme manual describes, it uses GnuPG as one of its backends.
Then my question arises, if I want to encrypt/sign some messages with
OpenGPG protocol through GPGME , do I have to install gpg on my computer as
Hope someone can help me:)
And if you answer my question, please cc me back, because I don't subscribe

@_subject: Errors when running the relative executables after compiling 
Dear All,
I have managed to compile gnupg-2.0.18 on MinGW which is installed on my
Windows 7 PC. My steps to compile it are as below:
1. tar -jxvf gnupg-2.0.18.tar.bz2, then cd to the directory gnupg-2.0.18
2. run command './configure' to make configurations.
3. change the Makefile under the directory 'gnupg-2.0.18/g10' and
'gnupg-2.0.18/tools' to enable gcc to link the zlib library correctly, by
modified the flag 'ZLIBS' to 'ZLIBS = -lz -L/usr/local/lib
-I/usr/local/include' in the Makefile.
4. run command 'make'
5. run command 'make install'
That's all. And all goes well - the relative gnupg executables (gpg2.exe,
gpgsm.exe, gpgconf.exe, etc) are generated and copied to the
But when I cd to the directory /usr/local/bin and run command 'gpg2
--version' in the MingGW shell, then a window of appcrash is prompted,
showing that gpg2.exe is already stopped.
Results of running other executables are the same.
I don't know why this happen. Can anyone help me to go though it?
If you answer my question, please cc me back as I don't subscribe as a

Thank you

Yes, you're right![?]
I am able to cross-build it on my Ubuntu OS using command './autogen.sh
--build-w32' instead of './configure' at the first step.
Then run command 'make' to build the executables(gpg2.exe, gpgv2.exe,
gpgsm.exe, etc) for Microsoft Windows.
Now all the exes do work  well on my Windows 7 PC.
Thank you.
