My task is to send encrypted emails via an asp page.  I have two options I
believe.  The first is to have my asp page execute a dos shell and use
commands to encrypt a file on the server and then attach that file to the
email using cdonts, but I can't find a resource for dos commands anywhere, I
realize that gnupg is opensource and there are all kinds of unix/linux
references but nothing for a win os.  I can create a email box on our server and have cdonts email to that box,
the box would intern automatically encrypt the data and ship it off to the
recipient, problem is when I turn on encrypt new messages by default, and
try sending an email it asks which key i want to use, is there a way around
that?  Im using Gnu Privacy Assistant for Ms Outlook 2k.
If anyone can help on either of these two options that would be very
