@_subject: Multiple Encrypted Files in one file. 
Hi All,
I have the following issue: I get pgp encrypted files from my service
provider in the following format:
I am getting this data in 1 file named ABC_12345.dat.asc. I need to decrypt
this file without splitting the file but when it try this i am getting the
following message: gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=1e).
I wanted to know if it is possible to decrypt the file without splitting it?
If yes, how?
