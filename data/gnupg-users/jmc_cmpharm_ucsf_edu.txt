@_subject: Bus error on Irix 6.5.* 
with gcc 2.95.2.  The bus error problem mentioned Scott McIntyre is
still there.  I did get 1.0.1 to work using the native cc compiler
and the directions given earlier in this thread (multiple char* vs
byte* warnings are given during the compile, but it works).  Also,
IRIX's native cc dies on the  statements in the 1.0.1c
source; I hope these get taken out before the 1.0.2 release.
before 1.0.2, let me know.
