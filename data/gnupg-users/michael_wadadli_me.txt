@_subject: Import keys from .gnupg folder 
Hi all,
I was a bit ignorant to the nuances of importing/exporting GPG keys, and as a result I simply copied the.gnupg folder from my home directory and wiped my hard drive. Is it possible to import these keys on another installation from this folder? The public key is on a public key-server, and I have the private keys in the folder.
The version of GPG on RHEL7.4 is 2.0.22, while Arch happens to be on 2.2.4-1. Would this be problematic?
