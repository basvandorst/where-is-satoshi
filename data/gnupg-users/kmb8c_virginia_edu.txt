@_subject: Two different problems 
I accidentally used the wrong revocation key, and I need to undo it (for key 0x37512C45).  Is there a way to do that?
 I tried to fix  by refreshing my keys/re-receiving them from the public-key servers.  I get this error:
C:\GnuPG>gpg --recv-key 37512C45
gpg: can't get key from keyserver: No such file or directory
gpg: Total number processed: 0
GPG worked fine before this (I was trying to revoke 42020537).
