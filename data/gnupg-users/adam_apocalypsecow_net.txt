@_subject: GPG & Perl 
Newbiemail here.  I'm trying to swap from PGP to GPG for sending out e-mail
from a Perl script running on a website.  This is probably more of a Perl
question than a GPG question, but if anyone can help I'd be eternally
grateful!! Otherwise I may have to install PGP :-( and continue using it,
which is less legal.
Bear with me on this.. I'm 99% there, and I'm sure the problem may be
resolved easily.
Am I right in thinking that Perl executes CGI scripts as the user who owns
the script?
If so, my problem may be that the user who own the script does not have a
.gnupg directory or keyring on the system.  I've set GNUPGHOME to
Thing is, it is not this user that executes the script, it is bbadmin who
owns it.  Two problems:
1) The HTTPD user does not have the rights to execute CGI scripts
2) The user who *does* own the script, bbadmin, cannot have a .gnupg/keyring
directory of his own because he does not have shell access.  - I mean I can
make the directory for him, but how do I then get a keyring in there.  Can I
just copy the HTTPD one?
Is there any solution to this?
Extra info supplied below.
