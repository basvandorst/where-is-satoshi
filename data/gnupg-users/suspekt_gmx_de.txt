@_subject: Why create offline main key without encryption capabilities 
Hi there,
I understand the concept of using a secure offline key and than creating one or multiple subkeys to use in rather insecure environments like a internet-connected laptop or a smartphone. Depending on which tutorial you look at, the recommended capabilities of the offline key vary.
Some use the key just for certification of own subkeys and keys of other Some recommend using it for certification of own subkeys, keys of other people and signing of documents that are so important, that the signing-subkey is not secure enough.
But I yet have to find someone recommending to use the offline mainkey also for encryption/decryption of files, that are so important that subkey encryption/decryption is not secure enough.
Is there a reason for that? Am I missing something?
thanks a lot

Hauke, I read your site, but obviously I should should read them again.
A great help by the way!
I don't get it. Decrypting data by signing it?
Thats a good point! Also it will be interesting to explain the judge
the details of PGP, main keys and subkeys ;)
Probably we have to get an expert from the CCC for that
Thanks, I'll have a look

OK,lets take the forced-by-law-theory in account. Than the "best" way from a pure security-standpoint in this regard would be:
0. OFFline-mainkey (certification of own keys and other people's keys)
-> 1. OFFline-subkey (signing)
-> 2. OFFline-subkey (encryption)
-> 3. ONline-subkey (signing)
-> 4. ONline-subkey (encryption)
You use keys 3&4 for everyday-usage. You use keys 1&2 for high-security operations. If you get forced by authorities you would give them exactly the keys they demand (lets say key 1 and key 4), revoke them and create new ones with your offline-mainkey (key 0).
Or they just force you to hand over your entire keyring but then this whole thing would be half the fun

Glad to hear
Also, AFAIK, they can't put you into jail or fine you if you have forgotten the according passwords and sometimes those passwords are really hard to remember...

Correct me if I'm wrong but doesn't GPG prefer the keys created last over keys created earlier? So it would use the every-day keys by default and use the high-security keys only if told specifically?

@_subject: Google releases beta OpenPGP code 
I have read the article too but I have to disagree. People using gmail will probably be logged in their google account all (most of the) the time. So google knows what they're searching, watching, listen to music, what the are talking about(g+) and so on. I think google has so massive data about their users that scanning emails as another source just isn't mission critical any longer. Probably they also know whats going on on facebook and twitter by their omnipresent google ads.
IIRC google doesn't scan cooporate mails and students mail (if the school or university participates in googles programs)  because of data protection issues, at least in europe.
I think google offering PGP is VERY interesting for several reasons:
- it'll integrate seamless in gmail, so no issues with plugins getting shut down or incompatible by some changes
- people maybe get used to encryption, so no more or less "i can't open the strange attachment you sent me"
- they will probably find a convenient solution to integrate it on smartphones, more and more (young) people don't use "classic PCs" at all
- i think some people at google are really angry about the 3-letter-agencies. see: To be clear: There are of course a lot pitfalls storing keys somewhere in the browser etc. but its definitely a interesting development.

I just commented on things that I think you may change. I am no GPG-Master though. Note that there are people on this list with far more expertise than I have.

Set an expiration date. You can extend it any time, even after it has expired. In a worst case situation (keys and backups are lost) the key will not be valid for eternity.
Store the revocation certificate separately. Again, in a worst case (Key lost, backup lost) you can still revoke using the certificate. Some people print it out and store it at at their bank/safe place.
Dont know which OS you are using but this won't work if you're using Gpg4win on windows. It cant handle the hkps protocol.
This will you incompatibility with many (I think all) versions of PGP. Maybe its not relevant to you if you mainly communicate with people using GPG.
see above
I'm not sure about this option and I don't really know what it means. Just leave it out.
There are commercial implementations. The most known is probably PGP (The Original Software created by Phil Zimerman). Check it at Wikipedia.
Why not? If your GPG version supports it. Check with "gpg --version"
Don't know, just use PGP/MIME instead of PGP/Inline. This will keep the hash separated from the text.
I would say it's best practice to use linux live cd and stay offline!
Move the mouse, open a texfile and beat your keyboard :) GPG will tell you if there is not enough entropy.

I have some links about key creation and gpg in general that I would provide of course. the problem is, that I don't know if/how correct they are because I am not that into gpg yet. Some blogposts are rather old, which can mean they are no longer up to date but doesn't have to. I don't want to spread outdated/incorrect information so how to proceed? That said, adding them to the wiki directly doesn't seem to be ideal...

I understand that. But those links are out there and just by searching on the internet you'll find a lot of some, because they seem to quite popular on google... Maybe start a "bad practice" list? naming and shaming?
I really like the idea of taking the threat model approach. The problem I see: What if I have a thread model with needs beyonds defaults? Say I assume that someone could launch a targeted attack, where should I look up best practices then?
I recently started to dive into gpg and find it very hard to find reliable information between "just stick to the defaults" and "look up rfc4880". Looking at the gnupg homepage I can choose between 1-4 howtos, a 158 page manual, the man page, the gnu privacy handbook and the gnu FAQ.
I think that is part of the reason for many blog posts and some of the questions on this mailinglist: based on the official documentations it's kind of hard to do the step between "beginner" and "master of the gpg
