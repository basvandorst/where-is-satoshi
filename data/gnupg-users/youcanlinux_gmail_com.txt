Your feeling is basically wrong.
Here comes the proofing example you asked for:
Someone put on top of some mails a question which has nothing todo with
the problems the other posters have faced.
Es ist mir egal... I don't really care about top- or bottom-posting,
but I suppose it's more polite/proper to bottom post.
I care more about editing and content.
I often quote differently anyway...

"pgp --version" and "pgp2 --version" indeed showed different results
on my system. Hmm. I can't help but wonder if it's such a big deal, so
long as I'm otherwise following best practice and using the software
as appropriately as I can, but I figure I'm on the right track by
using gpg2 on the CL.

hey flapflap,
I think you're onto something. I think people who care about
open-source/libre software should carefully consider how they mention
proprietary and/or non-free/non-libre software. I feel people can
discuss almost anything if handled in a thoughtful, respectful manner.
Maybe GNU people would consider touching on this topic at
or some such page?
At the same time, I wouldn't want a "Chilling effect" [1]

Are you recommending...
$ gpg --armor --export-options export-local-sigs --export >pub.asc
instead of
$ gpg --armor --export > pub.asc
$ gpg --import-options import-local-sigs --import pub.asc
instead of
$ gpg --import < pub.asc
Or should
$ gpg --import-options import-local-sigs --import pub.asc
$ gpg --armor --export-options export-local-sigs --export >pub.asc
$ gpg --import-options import-local-sigs --import pub.asc
$ gpg --import < pub.asc
all be done?
And this all functions with gpg2 in place of gpg ?
Please note that  while I greatly appreciate that Mr. Hansen wrote a
program to handle this, I still like having the option of doing things

Have you ever asked Werner about what he thinks about "ease" of
backing up?" He is very accessible on this list, and he often points
out nuances of the coding, versions, etc., and he's very good about
clarifying what people bring up on the list.
While it would be nice if it were easier to be able to back up easily
as you're suggesting, shouldn't the focus of GnuPG be on security?
Werner's company has working for it someone working on Enigmail, which
lets you do key management, including importing and exporting.
Werner Koch co-founded Free Software Foundation Europe.

This is silly. I am flabbergasted at this assertion.
whether it conforms to everyday usage in the community in question.
For someone who touts himself as a "languages geek extraordinaire," I
am shocked that you'd claim this.
I don't expect Germans to communicate in anything other than German. I
appreciate that the main developer communicates in this forum in
English, but I certainly don't feel he owes it to anyone.
