@_subject: Clarifying the GnuPG License 
Since GnuPG comes under the GPL, I would like to clarify if a person's proprietary software makes use of GnuPG purely by invocation of the commandline commands, and the GnuPG exe's and DLL's are bundled unmodified with the person's proprietary software, can the person use GnuPG commercially in this manner without having to publish his/her source code?
