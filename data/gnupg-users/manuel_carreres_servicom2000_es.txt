Hi all,
I'm trying to compile GNUPG1.0.1 for a Windows platform with the mingw32/cpd
kit (I have to modify the gpg code and compile the modified version for
Windows, so I need to know how to compile it).
The environment I've used is: binutils-2.9.1, gcc-2.95.2,
mingw32-cpd-0.2.4 and windows32api-0.1.2.
After the execution of
./configure --target=i386-mingw32 I got the next errors:
i386--mingw32-gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I.. -I../include -I../intl    -g
-c signal.c
signal.c: In function `got_fatal_signal':
signal.c:56: storage size of `nact' isn't known
make[2]: *** [signal.o] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/a00aa119/windows/gnupg-1.0.1/g10'
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/a00aa119/windows/gnupg-1.0.1'
make: *** [all-recursive-am] Error 2
and the file g10/gpg was not created so I cannot create gpg.exe
Does anybody know how to solve this problem?
Thanks a lot.
