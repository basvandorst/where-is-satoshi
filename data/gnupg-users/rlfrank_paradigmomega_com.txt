@_subject: What is kmail looking for? 
Sorry for the slightly OT post, but when kmail encounters mail where it is signed in an attachement rather than inline, it disolays this.  What is it looking for?
Message was signed with unknown key.
The validity of the signature cannot be verified.
Problem: OpenPGP plug-in was not specified.
Use the 'Settings->Configure KMail->Security' dialog to specify the plug-in or ask your system administrator to do that for you.

Although I thank you for that info, I have to say I am astounded by the hum=

easier to tell those few of our business clients who use MUAs that put the=

it will allow me to go back to our standard of rejecting mail that isn't=20

If nothing else, the software.
It had been our policy to reject any mail with a Content-Type  of multipart/ as a security measure.
In the years we've used PGP and then GPG, we have come to trust the approach.  To put our trust in an approach that gained much of its popularity due to the world's most insecure mailer would require more antacid than I have in the medicine cabinet.
Now, as to the software required to accomplish this, I will point to this quote from KDE's howto page:
Now, compile and install them (note that you need much stuff here only to make newpg's configure script happy):
I'm sorry, but installing software that is not actually needed???  I don't know about you, but the idea of being subject to potential vulnerabilities of software I don't actually need.  The rule usually is, if it isn't needed, don't install it.
Now, I ate my own words and compiled and installed, following the instructions to the letter.  After finding it wouldn't work unless one of the libraries was symlinked to /usr/lib from/usr/local/lib (not included in the documentation), I then discovered that kgpgcertmanager crashed everytime I tried to start it and that no key requiring a passphrase was useable.
You will, however note that gpg, when used as nature intended, works just fine.  No, I take that back, It won't recognize my passphrase.  Progress :-(

I'll respond with my $0.02.  Everything compiled okay here.  But though I=20

As if I wasn't already annoyed at the concept, I got to the part of the kma=
