Hi Guys,
I downloaded the CM4000 driver from
 and I
tried to compile it on both a Kubuntu 7.10 with kernel 2.6.22-14 and a
Linux Mint 3.0 (== Kubuntu 7.04) with kernel 2.6.20-16 (on both machines
I installed both the kernel headers and the kernel sources).
I'm keep on getting a flood of error messages and I'm not able to
compile the driver. It looks like the compiler does not find some header
("cm4000.h"?) or something like that. I tried to fix it but I was not
Does anybody know hot to compile this driver on Kunbuntu 7.10?
Do I have to put it in any particular location (maybe in
Am I missing any required component/header?
Any suggestion?
Many thanks in advance.

@_subject: Problems with GPG, a Cardman4000 and the FSFE card 
Hi Guys,
I'm trying to use this stuff:
Card Reader: PCMCIA CardMan4000
Smartcard: FSFE (OpenGPG) Card
Distro: Linux Mint 3.0 (something like Kubuntu 7.04)
GPG 1.4.6 (and GPG2 2.0.3, as an alternative)
OpenSC 0.11.1.3 (ubuntu)
PCSCD 1.3.3.1 (ubuntu)
PCSC-Lite 1.3.3.1 (ubuntu)
All this stuff works fine with Windows XP (winscard.dll).
On Linux, the card is reacheable from opensc-tool, openct-tool and from
the PKCS part of Mozilla Thunderbird (that is:
There is no way to see the card from GPG 1.4 or GPG 2.0.3.
There is no way to see it from the Enigmail part of Mozilla Thunderbird
(that is: the OpenGPG menu).
I just keep on getting this message:

gpg: pcsc_establish_context failed: no service (0x8010001d)
gpg: reader not available
gpg: OpenPGP card not available
Thunderbird/Enigmail says: "Your card reader is not accessible".
So, it looks like my reader is not visible but... that is not true! The
CardMan4000 is visible from PCSC (that should be used by GPG, behind the
scene). Even the card is visible from PCSC (and PCSCD is obviously

Thunderbird is able to access the card from within its PKCS internal
support and lists the FSFE card, as expected, amongst the others
security devices in its "preferences/security/devices" page.
(I tried both GPG1.4 and GPG2, with and without the "--disable-ccid"
option, and it does not make any difference.)
Is anybody able to understand why this card is not visible/usable from
GPG and GPG2 while it is still visible from PCSC?
Many thanks in advance

Hi Guys,
I'm trying to use a Eutron SmartPocket reader to read a FSFE card with
GnuPG 1.4.6 on a Linux Mint 3.0 (== Kubuntu 7.04) and on a Kubuntu 7.10.
I tried the "--disable-ccid" tip I found here:
but it does not work.
Any suggestion?
