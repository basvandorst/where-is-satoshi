since I've had a stable E-Mail address for a while now, and it's bound to=
 be=20
stable for the indefinite future, it's time for me to swtich PGP key, if =
so that the primary ID is my real E-Mail address. So given that I want to=
switch, making the new key my default, and having keyservers updated prop=
so that other people's GPG/PGP till notice the switch, I plan the followi=
1) Revoke the key.
2) Upload revoked verison of key to key server.
3) Expoert public/private keys for personal storage if I need my old key =
the future
4) Delete my key from the keyring.
5) Make my new kew the default.
Is this the correct procedure to follow? And how do I accomplish (5)?

Hmm. But as far as I can tell, that's on a per-invokation basis. Extract =
the man-page:
       --default-key name
                 Use name as default user ID for signatures.   If
                 this  is  not  used  the  default user ID is the
                 first user ID found in the secret keyring.
I would like to make gpg always go for my key even in response to a "clea=
invokation. This is good for (1) convenience, and (2) applications might =
support using --default-key.
I *could* do this by exporting all keys I really need, deleting my keyrin=
entirely, create my new default key, and re-import the keys I exported. B=
is this the only way?

revuid seems to be non-existent; however revkey revokes a secondary key. =
my case though I want to get rid of the old peter.schuller
*primary* ID. I was under the impression this ID could not be revoked.
I just tried it now btw. It seemed to work fine, but for example kmail st=

I'm just wondering; in what manner is Rijndael supported? I see no mention
of it in the key generation. Is it used for encrypting the private key?
I may be confused about this, but the way I understand it one algorithm is
used to encrypt/decrypt actual content, and one algorithm is used to encrypt
the private key with a passphase.
Also, does Rijndael support arbitrary key sizes? I've seen horrifying
statements that it supports "256 bit keys" (and similar) which would
indicate that it does *not*.

The best bet is probably to help improve Cryptix ( It
currently works with PGP 2.x style stuff, but not later versions.
I wish I could get into it myself (because a Java PGP engine is something I
*really* want), but I'm not that sharp at cryptography (yet :)).

The first step to getting help is describing what the problem is:
(1) What are you doing?
(2) What happened?
(3) What did you think/want to happen?
Are you having trouble unzipping it? Are you getting an error message?
Without such information it is impossible to be of assistance.

I don't agree.
In order to achieve secure communication, there are certain steps that
MUST be taken. It cannot happen automatically, because if it does it is
by definition not secure.
Granted, one could use a finger print device or similar to rid oneself
of the passphrase problem, but the fundamental principles of secure
communication is still there.
It works exactly the same as any "real world" communication. If I'm
given a phone number to John Doe and call him up - I have no way of
knowing I am really talking to John Doe, nor that he possesses the role
that someone else claims he does.
If one were to try, I believe one could come a LONG way just through
social engineering.
E-Mail is also like postal mail. You have no way of knowing who sent it
- unless you trust a return address which can be faked as easily as it
can be real. You also have no way of ensuring that only the intended
recipient reads the message - unless you take certain steps to do so.
The one thing that makes electronic communication different is the level
at which insecurities can be exploited. Tasks can be automated, etc.
If you get into a company building through social engineering you might
be able to sneak out with a PDA or two. You can't empty the entire
building without being noticed.
If you get into a server, you can easily delete everything on the hard
drive - or worse, plant a trojan. Once you are in a position to exploit
a vulnerability in a piece of software or in the way communication is
being carried out, you have a helluva opportunity to exploit it,
compared to non-computerized similar situations.
For that reason, security in the digital world is often more important
(or at least, the lack thereof is more disastrous) than in the physical
I believe users (and others...) must be taught to respect security and
understand the basic principles of trust that are a fact of life - with
or without computers.
(There are other importans issues aswell of course, such as E-Mail
clients acting properly to protect the user, development of appropriate
standards, etc. But at the very core of all issues is awareness.
Automatic and therefore transparent security is seldom possible, even

True. SSL with no pre-existing knowledge of certificate is better than
nothing. SSL with a CA signed certificate is better than SSL without it.
SSL with pre-defined certificates is bettar than CA signed certificates,
Correspondingly, PGP encrypted/signed communication where the passphrase
is stored in memory and/or on some network drive is a lot safer than not
using PGP at all - AS LONG AS one is not mislead into a false sense of
security above what is actually in place.
No, but perhaps I was not clear enough.
Encryption is much less meaningless without authentication. And you are
right, I don't care about the actualy PHYSICAL identity of a person in
many cases, but I might care about the person's position. The public key
of the CEO might be published on a company's website for example.
And true, the analogy falls somewhat when you consider this. With
encryption one is usually interested in knowing that only a certain
person X has access to the E-Mail - or that that person wrote it. One
does not always have to know who X really is. A relative assurance that
the same person is at the other end is often enough when the inital
trust is based upon E-Mail communication to begin with.

Amen to that. I still don't know how to configure MSIE or Outlook etc to
trust only a specific key (mutt does this fine though for example).
