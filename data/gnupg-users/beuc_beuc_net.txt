@_subject: 2048 or 4096 for new keys? aka defaults vs. Debian 
I saw a lot of activity in the Debian project about upgrading to a
4096 RSA key,
e.g. However GnuPG's default is 2048.
Is this zealotry on the Debian front, or something to update in gnupg?

Hi and thanks for your answers,
Would it be a good idea to update the FAQ in this regard?
-> "1024 bit for DSA signatures; even for plain Elgamal signatures."
Well I've heard that in security, more bits isn't necessarily more
secure, depending on the algorithm.
Plus, following this principle, why doesn't gnupg default to 4096 if
there isn't any reason not to?  I would suppose that if gnupg defaults
to 2048, the devs have a good reason to.

Hi Werner,
Thanks for your answer.  To foster spending less time on these
discussions, how about this? :)

-    1024 bit for DSA signatures; even for plain Elgamal signatures.
-    This is sufficient as the size of the hash is probably the weakest
-    link if the key size is larger than 1024 bits. Encryption keys may
-    have greater sizes, but you should then check the fingerprint of
-    this key:
+    GnuPG comes with a default recommended preset, which 2048 bits
+    primary RSA key as of 2013.
-    : $ gpg --fingerprint +    There are regularly discussions about using 4096 primary RSA keys.
+    Well, there is no benefit of overly large keys on average
+    computers.  After all the goal is not to have large key but to
+    protect something.  Now, if you want to protect something you need
+    to think like the attacker - what will an attacker do to get the
+    plaintext (or fake a signature)?  Spend millions on breaking a few
+    2k keys (assuming this is at all possible within the next decade)
+    or buy/develop/use a zero-day exploit?
-    As for the key algorithms, you should stick with the default (i.e.,
-    DSA signature and Elgamal encryption). An Elgamal signing key has
-    the following disadvantages: the signature is larger, it is hard
-    to create such a key useful for signatures which can withstand some
-    real world attacks, you don't get any extra security compared to
-    DSA, and there might be compatibility problems with certain PGP
-    versions. It has only been introduced because at the time it was
-    not clear whether there was a patent on DSA.
+    Also, 4096 keys have a few inconveniences: they increase the size
+    of the signatures and thus make the keyrings longer and, worse,
+    computing the web of trust takes much longer - not on your high
+    end desktop machine but on old laptops, and phones where it drains
+    the battery faster.
+    Instead of discussing these numbers the time could be much better
+    use to audit the used software (firmware, OS, libs, apps), which
+    often are the weak link of the security chain.

Since it's the 3rd or 4th format of the FAQ that I come accross in the
past 24h, I'm just giving the full text, adapt it however you like :)
