No matter how I try, I cannot encrypt a file using that public key, even
using --edit-key to assign trust:
gpg: 845F5188: skipped: Unusable public key

The owner of the public key insists that it is self-signed; but, our GPG
cannot find the self-signature

Please, advise. Thank you

During our current annual PCI DSS audit, our auditor complains that a human
being can access the company's private key and, thus, a human being can
decrypt sales files containing credit card information.

Yes, our company has been doing all four of your suggestions for years,
including written policies and procedures, and we passed all prior years of
PCI DSS auditing without incident.
Near as I can tell, nothing has changed in this regard in PCI DSS standards
in the last twelve months, to which our auditor agrees.
You can find his non-member post here:
He says that PGP has some mechanism that satisfies this requirement. I

@_subject: With which key did I sign my encrypted file? 
My company uses several keys for signing files encrypted with one of many
recipient public keys.
Once in awhile, we get pushback from a recipient that they cannot decrypt
our file, and sometimes they claim it is because the encrypted file is
