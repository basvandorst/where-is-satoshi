@_subject: how to only signate a mail by GnuPG, command line? 
I am brand new to PGP and GnuPG, so my question might sound dumb, but I am
really stuck for days now, so I hope and would be thankful to probably
receive some answer here.
I am trying to send a GnuPG signe email by PHP. The PHP part of it isn?t
really a problem to me, but I don?t get the correct command line for GnuPG
to do as I need.
I tried so far that:
gpg -o signature_file.txt --clearsign original_file.txt
The point is I don?t know the syntax how to add the Emailadress/Key ID which
should sign the signature_file. E.g. something like that (allthough that
obviously ain?t the correct syntax):
gpg -o signature_file.txt --clearsign original_file.txt
myemailadress at domain.tld
Thx in advance :)
best regards, dd
