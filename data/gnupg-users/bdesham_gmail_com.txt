@_subject: Are all the UIDs on a key supposed to be equal? 
Recently I changed e-mail addresses.  In order to update my GPG keys,
should I just generate a new subkey and revoke the old ones?  What
effect(s) will revoking my old subkeys have?
Thanks for the info!

Okay, I had a look at the manual, and I think I know what to do now.  the manual didn't really make clear what will happen after I revoke my old UID.
If I just revoke the old UID and then distribute my updated public key, people will be able to use it without a hitch?  Thanks!

@_subject: Good introduction to GPG concepts? 
Where can I find a fairly basic introduction to GPG concepts like trust models and
signatures?  I've been using GPG for personal use for five years, but somehow missed
some of the more basic concepts.  I took a look at the GPG Privacy Handbook, but it
looks like it hasn't been updated for six years.
Thanks for the help!

@_subject: Necessity of GPG when using SSL 
I saw a neat trick somewhere online... if you use "https:// mail.google.com" as your
login page for Gmail, the entire session is encrypted.  I haven't  used the normal
method since I learned how to do this.  I hope someone finds this  helpful! :-)

But wouldn't it be much easier for an attacker to intercept all of your
e-mail by listening in on an unencrypted webmail session than by  trying to
intercept each e-mail individually somewhere else?  I think there  is a benefit to having SSL-encrypted webmail for exactly that reason:  determined attackers will not have access to the plaintext of the  (Although granted, it would be kind of foolish to depend upon SSL  webmail if
the messages are sent in plain text.)

Hi Mica,
I believe what Werner meant was that your submitted image should be at
least 300 pixels wide or 300 pixels tall.  (Of course, the bigger the  better :-))

@_subject: Newbie questions about keyring maintenance 
Hash: SHA1
Hi all,
I've been using GnuPG for personal things for many years, but I've only
recently started to try to understand the "social" aspects, like signing
others' keys and the trust model.  I have a bunch of basic questions that I
was hoping people here could answer.  (If these are answered by some
beginners' guide then a link to that would be appreciated too!)  I'm running
GnuPG 2 on Mac OS X.
1. Right now, my crontab contains
     gpg2 -q --batch --refresh-keys
     gpg2 -q --batch --update-trustdb
   This will grab new copies of the public keys from the servers and then
   recalculate the trust relationships.  (There's a thirty-minute gap in
   between to allow for the downloading to take place.)  Is it necessary to
   manually update the trust database this often?  Are there any other
   commands I should run periodically to maintain my keyring?
2. During the update process, I get a bunch of lines like
     gpg: requesting key 1234ABCD from hkp server subkeys.pgp.net
   Is there any reason this is displayed even though I've invoked GPG with
   -q?  I get an e-mail whenever this command produces output, so it would
   be nice if GPG would really be quiet unless there were an error.
3. During the update process, I also get errors like
     gpgkeys: key 1A2B3C4D[...] not found on keyserver
   Is there something I should configure differently in order to avoid this?
4. When I run gpg2 --update-trustdb, I get a message like
     gpg: 3 marginal(s) needed, 1 complete(s) needed, PGP trust model
     gpg: depth: 0  valid:   1  signed:   1  trust: 0-, 0q, 0n, 0m, 0f, 1u
     gpg: depth: 1  valid:   1  signed:  10  trust: 0-, 1q, 0n, 0m, 0f, 0u
     gpg: next trustdb check due at 2010-07-24
   How do I interpret this output?  Also, given a certain key, how can I get
   GPG to tell me what its trust status is?  (For example, "this key is not
   signed by you, but it is signed by two keys you consider fully trusted,
   so it is valid", etc.)
Thanks a lot for any answers!

Hi Joseph,
Why not simply create a symlink from "gpg2" to "gpg"?
