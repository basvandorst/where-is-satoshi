@_subject: WinPT error on win95 
Can you please advise me on how you guys get your message sent to gnupg-users I did join the list about two weeks ago. Up till now, none of the request that I sent to the group ever went through. I have been sending my request in plain text. Can you please forward this request to the organization for me? Gbenga Abimbola
**** beginging of request *****
How do you generate a revocation certificate? I did the following, but it returned an error:
gpg -output revoke.asc --gen-revoke mykey   (mykey is "gbenga", which is the comment that I supplied before the key was generated")
The error message that I got was:
gpg: WARNING: using insecure memory!
gpg: please see  for more information
So, the revocation certificate was not created. **** end of request ****
