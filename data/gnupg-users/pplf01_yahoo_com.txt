@_subject: GnuPG is secure on what platforms ? 
What are the platforms in which the GnuPG source-code is really secure=20
out-of-the-box (in terms of PRNG) ?
I suppose GnuPG is secure on Linux, Free/Open BSD, Windows9x, Me, NT, 2000,=
XP (even if Windoze is not secure per se)=2E
But what is the situation for Solaris, MacOS X, BeOS, HP-UX, IRIX, or others=
Unixes ?

For people who are interested, I have done a Win9x/Me/NT/2000 package with a=
"installshield", containing Windoze Privacy Tray (WinPT) 0=2E3=2E2 and GnuPG=
1=2E0=2E6 for Win32 :
The source-code is :
- the files from these 2 ZIP :
- packaged with INNO Setup (with a GPL-like licence) :=20
It has been tested under Windows 98 without problems=2E
For Windows XP, be careful, it has not be tested under XP (I think INNO Setu=
is *NOT* XP compliant)=2E

The CKT versions have been created to allow big keys (RSA 16k bits) and
some others customisations=2E
For info, PRZ has asked PGP users to not use these CKT versions for
compatibility reasons=2E
I am not sure that the CKT versions are considered as "respected
versions" by all the GnuPG / PGP users=2E=2E=2E

@_subject: OpenPGP without GnuPG? 
For info, it appears that Will Price, the Former Director of PGP
Engineering, doesn't want to see the future of OpenPGP with GnuPG,
saying : "GnuPG is polluted by the GPL". Too bad...
