What would the command line be in GnuPG to sign a key and specify a domain, so that if that signed key signs another key in the specified domain, the other key would be listed as valid?
For instance if I want to sign the gnupgAdmin at example.org public key so that any key that the gnupgAdmin signs is listed as valid, if the key is for a user in the example.org domain.  This is typically referred to as a "Trusted Introducer" signature and is listed in RFC 4880 section 5.2.3.14.

Tsign works - thank you!
Hash: SHA512
Domain specificity is one of the Questions that will be 'asked' during
JOHN ;)

Use "gpg --edit-key (thekey)" and then "tsign".  You will be asked the
usual signature questions, and also the trust level (RFC-4880 section
5.2.3.13) and then the domain.
