@_subject: how to delete a signature? 
hi all,
my friend's public key expired, so i removed his key from my keyring.
however, his signature is still on my public key:
   p gpg --list-sigs salzman
   pub  1024D/67EA951D 2000-12-08 Peter Jay Salzman    sig 3       67EA951D 2000-12-08   Peter Jay Salzman    sig         58D7BA3C 2000-12-12   [User id not found]
that "user id not found" is my friend's expired key that i deleted from
my keyring.
i'm having no luck at all getting delsig to work:
   p gpg --edit-key salzman
   Secret key is available.

   You must select at least one user ID.
i'm not exactly sure what a user ID is.  :(
how do i remove 58D7BA3C [User id not found] from the list of people who
have signed my key?
