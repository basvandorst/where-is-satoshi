I inherited a key that was created in 2000.  I have used it to create
signatures for emails and files for a long time.  But for some reason it
fails to work with any version of gpg greater than 1.0.4.
Anyway, I am now running into problems that sometimes this key fails to
properly sign large files.  So I would like to recreate the trusted key
so that (a) it will work with gpg greater than 1.0.4, and (b) sign large
I tried the command "gpg --export-ownertrust" and nothing came out.
Here are the files I am trying to sign (in case you are interested):
ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/CTM/svn-cur/ - it is the file
whose signature fails.  Almost all the other files have good signatures.
Does anyone have any other suggestions as to how I can fix my trusted
keys?  Or should I go ahead and create completely new keys?
I'll be happy to provide more details upon request.
Thanks, Stephen

I am using it to create detached signatures.  gpg-1.0.4 creates
detached signatures, but when someone else tries to verify the
signature, it says "BAD signature."  Most files I generate detached
signatures for work in that verification works, saying "Good signature
from "CTM Generator "".  But for a couple of very
large files, it creates "BAD signature."
gpg-2.0.19 does not create signatures at all, instead coming up with
error messages like
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=73)
gpg: keydb_search failed: Invalid packet
gpg: error checking usability status of C380B4D8
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=73)
gpg: keydb_search failed: Invalid packet
gpg: key C380B4D8: secret key without public key - skipped
gpg: no default secret key: No secret key
gpg: signing failed: No secret key
The issue is that it seems that my private key is corrupted.  I
probably should have said "private" instead of "trusted."  (Gpg is
rather new to me, and I probably don't get the lingo correct.)
