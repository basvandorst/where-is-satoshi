Doug Barton:
Yet, no one came up with a tool as straightforward as parcimonie?[1]
before two years ago. My keyring has been fresh ever since I could
`apt-get install` it.
Easy to use public key cryptography is a hard problem. Maybe PGP has
some issues that can't be solved, but I believe we are making progress
in understanding how to make the whole experience more enjoyable.

@_subject: gpgme: is there a way to identify a signature as clear text or 
While having a look at a missing feature in seahorse-nautilus?[1], I did
not find a way to use GPGME to figure out if a signature was a clear
text signature or a detached signature.
The idea for seahorse-nautilus is to allow users to right click on a
`.asc` file and select ?Verify signature??. Ideally, if the file
contains a clear text signature, it would proceed to verify the
signature immediately. When having a detached signature, it would
eventually prompt the user about the location of the signed material.
Is there an easy way to give GPGME the file and know if it is a
clear text signature or a detached signature?
Another related question: in my tests, using the following always
    err = gpgme_op_verify(ctx, sig, NULL, NULL);
It seems that the `plain` 4th argument is mandatory when verifying
cleartext signature. I don't understand the rationale for that. In
seahorse-nautilus use case, we are only interested in the validity of
the signature.
Thanks for your help!

@_subject: Is there a MIME type for clear text signatures? 
shared-mime-info currently recognize files beginning with
`-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----` as having the MIME type
According to RFC3156?[2] which defined `application/pgp-signature`,
I believe this to be wrong. Can any one confirm this?
In that case, is there a MIME type that has been defined for clear text
