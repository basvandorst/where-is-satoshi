@_subject: Problems building GnuPG 1.0.6 under CygWin! 
I have started on a new education here in Denmark, Master in Cryptography,
and we're have been told to use GnuPG in our daily work.
In order to be able to run in on my machine at home, Pentium III with
Windows 98, I have installed CygWin (Newest release of 7th of August 2001)
and downloaded GnuPG 1.0.6.
But when I try to compile GnuPG, with:
I get some errors that I don't know how to solve. Below the output of make
is included:
Default /gnupg-1.0.6
$ make

If anyone knows how to solve this problem please let med know, and CC me
with the answer, due to the fact that I'm not in the users list yet!
Best regards
