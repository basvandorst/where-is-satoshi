There was nothing for us to submit for inclusion that hadn't already
been committed earlier.

It appears to compile correctly if you add
 just before the line which reads
 in keyserver/gpgkeys_ldap.c before compiling.
It'd probably be best to just include lber.h if it's found, which would
probably require a change to configure.ac.  I don't have a patch handy,
but if it's useful, I can make one.

Good points both.  I hadn't considered them before.
