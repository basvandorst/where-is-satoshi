@_subject: [GPGSM][GPGME] thawte freemail certificates? 
Hi there,
I have a very hard time trying to get a mail signature verified which was created using a Thawte Freemail certificate. I'm using GPGME to access GPGSM.
The Problem appears to be not a new one:
It says here, the certificate contains the information that it's only fully valid when the CRL has been checked, but fails to specify the location of that CRL.
Using KMail with the same backend I can have the siganture valid (green) when I specify "disable-crl-checks" in gpgsm.conf. If I don't, it's yellow (unknown). But gpgme doesn't seem to recognize it. It says "validity=unkown", even when I add the fingerprints of all relevant Thawte root certs in I know, it sounds all a bit weird, but there must be a way to have Thawte's Freemail signatures verified. Please let me know if I can provide any further Thanks and Greetings...

Of course, there's one thing I can do. I can attach a sample.
This mail is signed with one of them vicious Thawte Certificates. Is there a way to have it verified with or without checking CRLs so validity is "valid" and not longer "unknown"?

Yes, I can, but under the same limitations. When I activate "disable-crl-checks" it is green, when I don't it's yellow. Same now with gpgme! I realized yesterday after working on this bugger for 4 days that I do the validation remote on a different machine, which I forgot and kept wondering why my local changes had no effect whatsoever ;-) Given that I wrote that remote daemon and set up this architecture long ago it gives me a new impression about the meaning of the word irony.
Anyway, i think given the way those thawte certificates are made, the above behaviour is how it should be: The CRL can't be checked because it's not specified in the certificate and so the signature is only valid as long as I trust the certificate and disable CRL checks.
Or am I wrong here?
