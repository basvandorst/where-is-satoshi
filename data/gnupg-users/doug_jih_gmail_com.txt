@_subject: Trouble decrypting AES256 symmetric encrypted 4.58 GB file 
I got the following messages when I tried to decrypt a file.gpg with
the size 4,920,412,393 bytes using gpg version 1.4.2, official Windows version:
:symkey enc packet: version 4, cipher 9, s2k 3, hash 2
        salt 5088796db832388a, count 96
gpg: AES256 encrypted data

GPG failed when the output file has a size of 614,055,611 bytes.  I
noticed this is exactly the number of bytes shown by "raw data:" in
the above messages.   Is this a flaw in GPG?  It's hard to believe GPG
would have a serious flaw like this, because there was absolutely no
error message when I encrypted the file, and now GPG is unable to
decrypt the file to its ooriginal size?
Can anyone please help me recover my data!  Thanks.

The file was produced by encrypting with

When the error messages occured, the output file has a size of
614,055,611 bytes.
Can anyone please help!

I used 7-Zip to archive about 4.6 GB of files, and I used GPG to
encrypt the 7z file.  7-Zip can't seem to open the partially decrypted
file, unfortunately, so I can't get any of the files back.
I was hoping that the whole 7z file was still available in its
encrypted form, and that GPG was simply confused by an overflown
32-bit index or something like that.
In any case, this seems like a serious problem that people should be aware of.
