I don't know how terrible your jessie install will get, but there is a gnupg 2.1 (2.1.3 currently) package in experimental:
I know it can be installed in jessie using these steps:
but of course this means mixing two versions, which is less than ideal on a stable system. anyway, you can try that or backport the gnupg 2.1 package for stable
This is the only grain of help i can give,

============================== START ==============================
Yes, In 2.1 you are not supposed to start the gpg-agent on login, it starts automatically on demand. If you start it like in <2.0 you will not be able to connect to it.
But ssh needs that, that is documented here
At least in debian's default version, that is already in /etc/X11/XSession.d/90gpg-agent. But i kind of think that's responsability of the package mantainer and not gnupg upstream.
