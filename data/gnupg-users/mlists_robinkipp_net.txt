@_subject: Problem: cannot generate / copy keys larger than 1024bit on my 
Hello all,
I'm trying to setup my OpenPGP-compatible SmartCard with 2048-bit subkeys, using GnuPG version 2.0.18. However, it seems that I currently can neither copy nor create keys larger than 1024bit on the SmartCard.
When I try to generate a completely new set of keys on the card using gpg --card-edit -> admin -> generate and choosing to overwrite the existing key, GPG will seem to start generating the key, but then exits with a "Card error" but no more details.
I then edited my scdaemon.conf file and set the debug-level to expert, then restarted GPG-Agent and SCDaemon and repeated the process, reproducing the same error.
Here's what I ended up with in the SCDaemon log file:
2012-06-02 15:46:48 scdaemon[6044] DBG: send apdu: c=00 i=47 p1=80 p2=00 lc=2 le=2048 em=1

2012-06-02 15:46:48 scdaemon[6044] apdu_send_simple(0) failed: general error
2012-06-02 15:46:48 scdaemon[6044] Key generation failed
2012-06-02 15:46:48 scdaemon[6044] operation genkey result: Card error
scdaemon[6044]: chan_7 -> ERR 100663404 Card error scdaemon[6044]: chan_7 <- RESTART
scdaemon[6044]: chan_7 -> OK
This did not result in anything being written to the card, but according to gpg --card-status I now have no keys on the card whatsoever.
Just to make sure the problem wasn't specific to my system, I tried going through this process using GRML and Ubuntu Live CDs, however I always ended up with the same issue at all times...
Please, can anyone here help me out with this one? I've already tried some googling and came up with some results, however none of them offered any helpful solutions as far as I could tell.

It is an OpenGPG v2.0-compatible card. According to its specs, it should be capable of handling keys up to 3072bits...

Hmmm, very interesting. I'm using an OMNIKEY 6121 USB card reader, which I purchased along with my OpenGPG-compatible card. Since the retailer where I bought it (Cryptoshop.com) offers quite a few card readers, I even made sure to contact them about which reader I should choose beforehand, so that I wouldn't end up with anything that was incompatible... Also, I just made sure to check out their website once again to have another look at the reader's specs, however unfortunately I wasn't able to find anything OpenPGP-specific on there...

Wow... That's unfortunate for me... Yes, I can generate keys up to 1024-bit in length on the card. However, as I'd much rather use 2048-bit keys, I guess I'll just have to sort things out with the retailer I got it from... Can you recommend another brand that produces readers which are easier to use? E.g. Gemalto or G&D or anything in that direction.
Thanks a lot!

Hi Werner,

OK, well, I really didn't expect that *before* buying the reader, but I honestly wasn't aware such compatibility issues existed with Omnikey readers. Oh well, I guess I'll just have to sort things out with my retailer, and end up purchasing a new card reader. So, if you could possibly recommend a brand that produces easier to handle readers I'd definitely appreciate some advice on that! :-)

@_subject: Testing GPG EMail encryption 
Hello all,
well, as of today, I finally decided to start signing my EMail messages using GPG to prove the integrety of my messages. As I am primarily using Mac OS, I downloaded MacGPG ( installed it and set it all up. As I'm completely blind, I first had some issues with MacGPG, as it uses a special window (called, I think, the PINEntry window) to ask for the passphrase. Unfortunately, this window isn't accessible using VoiceOver, the screenreader built into Mac OS. However, I was now able to come up with a workaround and now it seems as if I can sign and encrypt messages without much trouble. I've informed the MacGPG developers about the accessibility issues in their software, and they seem very committed  to solving it in an upcoming version. If anyone is interested, the related ticket can be found at Now, I'd really like to test out EMail encryption so that I can verify this works properly, but for that, of course, I need one other party also using GPG. So, I was wondering, would it be possible for any of the GPG users on here to contact me offlist so that we could try this out once? If anyone on here would be willing to do that, I'd greatly appreciate that!
Thanks for any help :-)
Best regards,

Hello all,
thanks a lot for that! Actually, I'm quite flattered by the amount of encrypted messages that came in over the last few minutes from all of you who wanted to help, I honestly wouldn't have expected so much feedback! I'll definitely reply to all of you who took the time and effort to reply to me with an encrypted message so that I could try and decrypt it in order to make it readable. Actually, I succeeded in decrypting all of them, but the exercise also showed that my workaround is far from being flawless. Nevertheless, it's been a lot of fun reading all the messages that ended up in my inbox, and I'll definitely reply during the next few hours!!! This is a great community, and I'm really glad that I'm now part of it - keep up the great work everyone!!! :-)
Best wishes,

Hi Jean,
no, I think you can be fairly certain that you never contacted any piracy department. If you look back through the last messages that have been going over the lest you'll find this has been going on for a while now, also for others posting to this list. Seems like their contact address got on this list somehow, hence a new ticket gets created each time someone on this list starts a new discussion. So, looks like their Piracy Department is getting lots of work for no reason :-)

@_subject: First steps with GPG, am I off to a good start? 
Hello all,
I'd like to get started using GPG on a regular basis, e.g. to sign my EMail messages and exchange encrypted messages with a few people. So, I just generated my first keys in this manner:
1. Booted to a secure system.
2. invoked GPG using the following command:
gpg --expert --gen-key
3. Generated an RSA key with signing and certification capabilities and 2048 bits in length.
4. Edited the key using gpg --edit-key in order to add all required UIDs.
5. Invoked addkey to generate a 2048 bit RSA sub key, with encryption and signing capabilities.
6. Exported all secret and public keys to a secure medium, also exported the secret sub keys.
7. Rebooted to my production system, imported the public keys and the secret subkeys.
The listing now looks as follows.
For public keys:
MacBook-Pro:~ robin$ gpg --list-keys DC329876
pub   2048R/DC329876 2013-10-10
uid                  Robin Kipp uid                  Robin Kipp uid                  Robin Kipp sub   2048R/77DFFF08 2013-10-10 [expires: 2013-11-09]
For secret keys:
MacBook-Pro:~ robin$ gpg --list-secret-keys DC329876
sec#  2048R/DC329876 2013-10-10
uid                  Robin Kipp uid                  Robin Kipp uid                  Robin Kipp ssb   2048R/77DFFF08 2013-10-10 [expires: 2013-11-09]
I'm signing this message using this subkey - and since this may not be widely available on keyservers just yet, the public key is at the end of this message.
Could someone on this list perhaps be so kind and see if I've made any mistakes? I set the subkey to expire in a month just incase something went wrong with it, as I'd like to get it right before starting to effectively use it?
Many thanks for any help!

Hi Robert,
many thanks for your reply!

I only put the --expert flag because I wanted to take advantage of having a main key that can only sign and certify, and which I can then store offline. I know it's perhaps easier for a beginner to start out with a single key for everything, but since I think I understood the reason one should have several subkeys, I thought it would be best to start out as such and (hopefully) not have to revoke the main key because of any stupid mistakes?

That's something I simply wasn't sure about, but now I have revoked the old subkey, generated 2 new ones and submitted the new key to a keyserver. I will append the new public key at the end as well.
Thanks! I changed that to something more reasonable for the main key now as well.
This is something I'm not really sure about, for the reasons that Daniel pointed out in his reply - putting in such a 'dummy UID' might confuse someone wanting to sign my key, as it cannot be verified.
As for the key policy, I'm still considering what to put in there. Right now, I'm just more concerned about my knowledge of GPG in general and getting my keys right, as I wouldn't want to sign someone else's key before my knowledge and understanding is more mature.
As for the preferred keyserver, I think Daniel's comment on that makes sense. For example, I use eu.pool.sks-keyservers.net, which links to a pool of servers rather than just a single server. I'm not sure if putting in an address like that would make sense at all?

Many thanks for that advice and the link! As I said in my previous message, I've now revoked the subkey and generated 2 new ones.
I did just that, and now have 3 subkeys: the revoked one, one for signing and one for encrypting. However, after checking my last couple signatures, it appears GPG is now using the revoked subkey for signatures, which, of course, is not good at all! What do I do now, do I have to delete that subkey?
Many thanks for the great explanation! I now edited the expiration date of the main key? As for the revocation certificate, I have to admit that I didn't generate that right away. To be honest, I kind of skipped over that option, as I suspected that this would immediately revoke the key? Well, I do have it now, and it's stored in a safe place as well :-)
Well? This may be a question of personal preference, and I could well imagine that religious battles have already been fought over questions like that...
Very true. I think that a user ID should perhaps always contain a verifiable component, such as an EMail address - well, I guess someone could even put in their phone number or street address if they so desired, right?
Yes, thanks a lot for the effort - greatly appreciated! :-)
