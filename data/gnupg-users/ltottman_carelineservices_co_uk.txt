@_subject: GPG question 
We have a file that needs encrypting on a daily basis. The filename changes
from day to day, is gpg able to give the encrypted file the same name it had
before it was encrypted without specifying it in the command line. Can the
encrypted filename be generated automatically?
Any helps would be appreciated
