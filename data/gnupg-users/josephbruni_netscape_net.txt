@_subject: Sendmail issue 
Linux and Windows users, please move along -- nothing to see here. This is a OS X issue.
This issuse has nothing to do with GPG. Sendmail is complaining about the fact that / is group writable. A quick trip to Terminal.app will fix that:
% sudo chmod g-w /

@_subject: Decrypt file using a shell script 
I noticed in the man pages for 1.0.7 a discussion about a gng-agent. I'm going to assume that this is probably similar in concept to the ssh-agent.
If so, you would load your private key into the agent and use it to handle supplying the gpg --decrypt command with the private key.
Unfortunately, I can't find any documentation on gpg-agent just now.
I hope this at least gives you a direction.

@_subject: Recovery of PCSECURE files and bogus GnuPG algorithms 
Based on what I read, Mr. Zimmerman doesn't seem to be rude or sour-graping about anything. He in fact stated that he wasn't so concerned about the container as with the algorithms.
I personally, would like to hear his objections about the algorithms, but that would probably take a white paper rather than a hastily typed email at 30,000 ft. I'm sure the information he is alluding to is available.

@_subject: version report 
Perhaps you have more than one copy installed and the old one is in a directory earlier in your PATH than the new one. Do a "which gpg" to find which one you are running.
