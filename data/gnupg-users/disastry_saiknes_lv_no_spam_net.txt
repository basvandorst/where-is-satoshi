@_subject: what is the use of signing keys? 
Hash: RIPEMD160
you're worng. it's less provable.
seconds means nothing - one can set computers clock as needed.
your key looks like you have applied revocation certificate,
which was generated N seconds after creation ;->
I think only proof that it was used for encryption is encrypted message with that key.
and one can make such message!
its very easy to remove revocation packet from key and use it for encryption.
but if there is no subkey at all, noone can encrypt to it.
indeed it provides.
It can make DSA/DH key and then delete DH (Elgamal in fact) subkey.
This is *exactly* the same as generating DSA (sign only) key.

yes.. keys life, but I can't find reason to extend subkeys's life.
I doub't it is even possible (I have not tested however).
RFC probably allows multiple subkey binding signatures (I'm not sure),
but gpg does not handle 'em well.
and if you extend keys (subkeys) life you'll sooner or
later will end with several self (binding) signatures
(because keyservers delete nothing)

exactly. there are about 1600000 keys on server (  )

81 keys with duplicate keyid are normal, some of them are DEADBEAFed of course.
