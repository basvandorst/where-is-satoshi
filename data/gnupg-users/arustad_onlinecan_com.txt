@_subject: Determining the type of file. 
Since both encrypted files and signed files have the same extension (
*.gpg), how is one to tell what each file is. Is there a flag/option that
checks the status of a gpg file?
Thanks for your help.

@_subject: Where can I find info on "use-agent" 
Can anyone tell me where I might find information about using the
"use-agent" flag? I have looked in the man file, Howto, Handbook, mailing
lists....but no luck.

Email encryption is a Joke...especially PGP/GPG....but not because it
doesn't work, and not because the interface is ugly and hard to work with,
but because  the "other guy" almost always refuses to take the time to learn
it. Strong measures need to be taken to force people to use it...especially
corporations. I would love to see my employer at least mandate the use of
PGP internally, but, even though we are a high tech company, we are just to
lazy to put forth the initiative to secure our mail/intellectual knowledge.
Like I said, I would use it all the time, however, that means that everyone
else would have to use it too. Sent: Wednesday, October 23, 2002 4:30 AM
Why isn't everyone doing phone encryption?  Why isn't everyone
encrypting their personal postal mail?  Just because something is
technically possible doesn't mean everyone should use it.

Ed, this sounds like a shameless plug. =-)

I agree with this comment and the others like it. I've quit relying on GnuPG/WinPT for much encryption per se, simply because people don't want to be bothered with it.
When I have to send or show something sensitive to a colleague or an existing client, I try to do so via a tunnelled connection using my Privaria software. I wrote it for ease of use, and it's literally a one-click connection (no Amazon, this ain't online shopping...) once you've set it up. Perhaps the 25,000 downloads of the software since its May 2002 initial release says something about the value people place on encryption that's (relatively) easy to use.
