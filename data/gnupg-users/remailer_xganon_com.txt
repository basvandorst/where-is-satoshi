It's the selection of compression algorithm that gives you a problem.
Change that and decrypting the message becomes a piece of cake  ;-)
$ echo test |
  gpg -v --passphrase-fd=0 --digest-algo=md5 --compress-algo=2 nokia.htm.asc
Reading passphrase from file descriptor 0

1. Displays Serial Number. 2. Displays the Month and Year of Manufacture (0997) 3. Displays (if there) the date where the phone was purchased (MMYY) 4. Displays the date of the last repairment - if found (0000) 5. makes you capebel of transferring user data if you have the gear for it 6. shows how many hours the phone has been on

The new Enhanced Full Rate CODEC adopted by GSM uses the ASELP (AlgebraicCode Excitation Linear Prediction) compression technology. This technology allows for much great voice quality in the same number of bits as the older Full Rate CODEC. The older technology was called LPC-RPE (Linear Prediction Coding with Regular Pulse Excitation). Both operate at 13 kilobits.(but you take up more space on the network, so they can charge you more) - Talk-time is reduced with about 5%

--allow-non-selfsigned-uid
                 Allow the import of keys with user IDs which are
                 not self-signed, but have at  least  one  signa=AD
                 ture.  This only allows the import - key valida=AD
                 tion will fail and you have to check the  valid=AD
                 ity  of  the  key  my other means.  This hack is
                 needed for some German keys generated  with  pgp
                 2.6.3in.  You  should  really  avoid  using  it,
                 because OpenPGP has better mechanics to do sepa=AD
                 rate signing and encryption keys.
       --always-trust
                 Skip  key  validation  and assume that used keys
                 are always fully trusted.  You  won't  use  this
                 unless  you have installed some external valida=AD
                 tion scheme.
I have been sent such a key. After importing it into my pubring,
how can I _check the validity of the key by other means_ and force
gpg use it as an encryption key?
The --trusted key option doesn't seem to help:
The --always-trust option used to allow using this key (in previous
versions, eg. 1.04), but in 1.05 it does not:
Thanks in advance for any and all replies,
