@_subject: Problems with www.keyserver.net 
Someone pointed out a problem submitting keys to keyserver.net, and I can duplicate it. I'm using GnuPG 1.06 on Linux:
  [rich rich]$ gpg --keyserver search.keyserver.net --send-keys rich
  gpg: error sending to `search.keyserver.net': eof
  [rich rich]$ gpg --keyserver search.keyserver.net --send-keys 0x0CEA86B6
  gpg: error sending to `search.keyserver.net': eof
Anyone know what's up?
Also, the guy who pointed this out to me submitted his key successfully to the pgp.com keyserver, but it doesn't seem to have propagated to keyserver.net. I'm curious about this, too.

@_subject: FORGOT PASSPHASE 
This is why people recommend generating a key revocation certificate when you generate a key pair. It won't help you get the passphrase, but at least you can revoke the key.

@_subject: Configuring GNUPG 1.06 in RedHat 7.1 
The one on the 7.1 cd is 1.04. There is a 1.06 package in the updates,
though. You can get it here:
Marty, I've compiled and installed 1.06 on RedHat 7.1 and it works fine.
It does look like you're missing some development packages. I think that
you'll need gcc, make, autoconf, and automake, at least. If you do want
to compile it yourself, try installing them and see where you get. You'll
want them for building a lot of other software, too, if you expect to be
compiling much.

@_subject: Domain registrars (was Re: signing + mailing lists) 
Any other registrars that use PGP/GnuPG? The others I've seen all do web
forms, and some don't even use SSL...
