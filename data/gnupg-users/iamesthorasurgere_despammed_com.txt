Forget your old behaviour, read this list via gmane.org as newsgroup.
On Windows I prefer GPGShell which offers all the features I want:
Yes, have a look at the FAQ:
Gnus is not the question, Gnus is the answer.
AFAIK no.

Well, the number has the following meaning:

@_subject: lag time on mailing lists? 
Yes, I also noticed this. A mail (actually it's a news posting for me)
from me took more than one week to show up in the list.
I read this list and write to it via gmane.org so I would like to ask if
it's possible to make mails coming from gmane.org automatically mark as
subscribed. Gmane users must follow a TMDA-like procedure before their
mails will be sent through the gateway to the list. Thus I believe there
isn't coming spam from the gateway to the list.
Huh? I read some very high traffic mailing lists which use SA as spam
filter and there mails reach the list much faster.
This reason is more understandable.

@_subject: gpg --edit-key when the key has many signatures 
I'm quite happy with subkeys.pgp.net and keyserver.kjsl.com which never
caused duplicate UIDs. blackhole.pca.dfn.de and pgp.zdv.uni-main.de seem
to be affected of the keyserver bug.
PS: Still waiting for your signatures in my keys.

@_subject: Detection of sign-only vs. sign-and-encrypt keys 
could anyone please point me to the right section in the man page
(which I'm obviously missing) how I can find out with a single gpg
command line option if a key is just a sign-only key or a "normal"
sign-and-encrypt key?
Thanks in advance!

@_subject: Keysigning CeBIT 2004 
Good question. :-)
Well, last year there was a keysigning party at the KDE booth on Sunday
and a regular meeting for key exchange at the Debian booth every day at
2:00 pm.
I haven't heard of any key signings at this year's CeBIT but I guess the
Debian booth should be a good place for a start.
Due to possible public interest I answered to the list.

And here is mine:
Maybe someone of you would like to have a look at it and tell me what
could be improved.
One thing will be added in the next few days: I won't sign keys that
consist of a pseudonym only (and haven't done in the past).

@_subject: Key signing policies 
Thank you! If anyone wants to use it feel free to copy the content but
please send me a mail with the link to your policy so that I can add the
link to my page. And since I'm not a native English speaker I would also
be happy if someone sends suggestions for removing weird phrases or
spelling errors. :-)
Well, usually these keys are just used for signing other people's keys
and not to sign mails (these guys usually have a second sign+encrypt key
for this purpose). And very often these keys don't consist of e-mail
addresses where I could send challenge mails to. Since a very accurate
check (level 3) means to me that I have verified 1) fingerprint, 2)
identity card and 3) mail addresses I decided to give sign-only keys
only a signature level of 2 as step 3 will obviously fail.

@_subject: Trust model: classic or pgp? 
I have two questions concerning the trust model. The man page says:
,----[ man gpg ]
First of all, what is actually the difference between "pgp" and
"classic"? The first option tells about WOT and trust signatures but the
latter just mentions the WOT.
My last question is why
  gpg --check-trustdb
results in   gpg: 3 marginal(s) needed, 1 complete(s) needed, classic trust model
                                                   ^^^^^^^
when "pgp" is supposed to be the default? I cannot remember that I have
ever changed the trust model. I guess I should switch over to "pgp",

@_author: Marcus Frings 
@_subject: Trust model: classic or pgp? 
Sorry for the misunderstanding, my problem was that I wasn't aware of
the new option "tsign" which is new in 1.4.0. After reading the info
about "tsign" in the manpage I understand the difference now.
Yes, this was an upgrade from 1.2 to 1.4, I have changed to trust-model
"pgp" now although I don't use these trust signatures at the moment.

@_subject: Can't select single UIDs for signing keys 
see this:
What's going on here? Why does GPG 1.4.0 return to the shell immediately
without giving me the option to select the UIDs I want to sign? In
previous versions, when I pressed "n", I had the possibility to select
the UIDs I want to sign and then say "sign". Now I'm just back on my
shell ...

I wish the old behaviour would still be the default.

@_date: 2005-03-23 16:15:14
@_author: Marcus Frings 
@_subject: signature level 
Not really, according to my signing policy I have to use level "2" or
"3" quite often thus a fixed setting doesn't really make sense (for me).

@_subject: Key signing at the LinuxTag 
Okay, then I believe you will not attend the key signing party for they
use another protocol and registration is required by this Sunday:
However, I would like to exchange fingerprints with you, Werner. I will
be there on Friday. Can we set up place and time here so other people
can join, too?

@_subject: Keysigning challenge policies/procedures 
Before I used a protocol to signing keys where I sent out random strings
as challenge response but it's not worth. There is no enhanced security
and only more work for "signer" and "signee". If you send the signed UIDs
encrypted to each mail address separately it has the same effect in
security because if the mail address bounces or the person behind the
address doesn't have the private key your signed UIDs won't become
publicly available.
There are some scripts around but don't use CA-Bot as Ingo suggested. As
he has already said it has problems with so-called sign-only-keys and it
sends out broken mails. caff, from the same author, handles these keys
much better. It can be downloaded from the third link I
mentioned. Besides it is already available in Debian and FreeBSD.

@_subject: Keysigning challenge policies/procedures 
Me, too. I just give these sign-only keys a level of 2 as explained in
my policy. I have been at several (large) keysigning parties and luckily
there are not so many sign-only keys around. I don't like them very much
but that's life ...
