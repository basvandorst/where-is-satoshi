@_subject: Adding keys 
I am new to using GPG. I have consulted the manuals and help online, but I
am not sure it addresses my concern. I am trying to use this on Mac OSX Snow
Leopard (so using MacGPG is apparently out of the question).
Here is the situation:
On Machine A (that I no longer have), I created a GPG key with email address
A. Before I got rid of the machine, I backed up everything to disk (so I
have the .gnupg folder and when I try using the keys within with certain
scripts (using pathnames), the key works (it authenticates me to my Amazon
S3 backup).
On Machine B (that I am currently using), I created another GPG key with a
different email address (B). I am using that key to make encrypted duplicity
backups to a local Linux server (which is different from Amazon S3 - I am a
fan of redundant, geographically diverse backups). This key appears in the
output of gpg --list-keys (while the other one, for obvious reasons, does
I want to merge the two keys in some way so that I get both keys listed.
Importing a public key appears to be standard procedure. But what I need is
access to the secret key for both keys so that I can make both the Amazon S3
and local Linux server backups without being forced to pass paths to certain
1. Is my question even well-posed ?
2. Is this kind of thing even possible ?
3. How do I do it ?

Thanks. I will try this out.
This is not for a mail user agent. This is for a duplicity backup to S3.

Tried this.
No use.
I have two keys installed on this machine (different email addresses). It
just can't seem to use the newer one, regardless of the default-key
Do I have to restart start-gpg-agent on Mac ? If so, how do I restart
without rebooting ?

Due to many reasons, I was unable to attempt a backup to my S3 account.
Today, with the copied key, the backup failed:
Error accessing possibly locked file /Users/sm123/Private/.Trashes

I have tried to edit the key and given it a trust level of 5. No use. How do
I fix this ?

I finally bit the bullet and cleaned out my old S3 bucket on Amazon and
started afresh with a new key.
Generated an RSA and RSA (4096 bit) key.
Tried to use it with duplicity. It fails:
===== Begin GnuPG log =====
gpg: no default secret key: secret key not available
gpg: [stdin]: sign+encrypt failed: secret key not available

OS: Mac OSX 10.6.4
What gives ?
I have two keys (corresponding to two different email addresses listed -
both --list-keys and --list-secret-keys attest to that fact).
Thanks for your help.

It did not work. I still get the same error as before.
I somehow doubt that this suggested solution would work, but how do I get
the 16 last characters ? I remember seeing it when it was generated.

I had given up on this last year but want to make the key signing work
I still have the same error:

Hello David,
I am not using this key for any email program.
I am using it to sign and encrypt my backups.
I do have a key pair (I think - I followed instructions from the gpg home
$gpg --list-keys
pub   4096R/F784A849 2010-09-29
uid                  Madhusudan Singh sub   4096R/BB9A877C 2010-09-29
$gpg --list-secret-keys
sec   4096R/F784A849 2010-09-29
uid                  Madhusudan Singh ssb   4096R/BB9A877C 2010-09-29
I am not really a gpg expert, but those two above came from pubring.gpg and
secring.gpg, respectively.
I have tried revoking, deleting and regenerating new keys many times, but it
has not worked.

Thanks for your response.
I do not think it is any of those issues. I have used this system (and this
script I wrote) successfully in the past (on Linux / Mac). I just
transferred machines a few months ago (Mac OSX to Mac OSX) and somehow the
key did not transfer properly. Then I started getting these errors.
So, I deleted my old backups and the key, created a new key following a
HOWTO on the net (which is just like zillions of other HOWTOs you will find
using Google), and it still refuses to work (with the error I have
I do not use the Toy OS. I seriously doubt that a Yahoo group is going to
help me if the official gnupg user mailing list does not.
