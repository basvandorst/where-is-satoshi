* Atom 'Smasher'  [2004/04/13 15:52]:
Yes, it does.
With PGP/MIME you can sign the whole message, instead of individual
parts.  Verifying an entire message is different than individually
verifying each individual component.

* Atom 'Smasher'  [2004/04/13 16:12]:
No, there are many mail clients that can natively use x509 certs, like
Lotus Notes and Netscape Messenger.  The standards exist and are
implemented independently of Microsoft.

Sounds like a pretty good reason for a security- and privacy-conscious
user to switch to something else...

* Atom 'Smasher'  [2004/02/04 22:45]:
Just to chime in here again, for mutt -- verification, signing,
encryption, and decryption can be made about 99% transparent, once
configurated.  The only non-transparent parts are selecting the
recipient's key (sometimes) and entering your passphrase.  mutt also
supports S/MIME almost as cleanly, from what I can see (S/MIME is a bit
of a mystery to me, but I thought I'd mention it for the sake of

* Albert  [2004/03/02 17:14]:
If you're already root:
  # gpg --no-default-keyring \
  >     --keyring /some/user/.gnupg/public.gpg \
  >     --export KEYID
You'd just need to be able to read the user's keyring file.  (This is a
good reason to not keep your keyrings on a box you don't control, BTW.)
If you're not root, and have no way to become root, then you're probably
out of luck, barring permissions problems on the keyrings.

This might be a good time for someone to point to a handy guide showing
which hash functions are supported by GnuPG and PGP.  Does anyone have
one lying around?

Bruce Schneier thinks it's probably be true
  SHA-1 has been broken. Not a reduced-round version. Not a simplified
  version. The real thing.

  The paper isn't generally available yet. At this point I can't tell
  if the attack is real, but the paper looks good and this is a
  reputable research team.
So this would be when we start putting:
  digest-algo RIPEMD160
in our gpg.conf, right?
