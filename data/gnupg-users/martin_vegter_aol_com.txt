@_subject: unable to use gnupg on a read-only filesystem 
Dear list,
I am working on a read-only filesystem and I am using following command:
     echo "hello" | gpg -e -a -r martin at example.com
This command fails with the following errors:
gpg: failed to create temporary file `/root/.gnupg/.
Read-only file system
gpg: fatal: can't create lock for `/root/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg'
I don't have the option "use-temp-files" enabled in my config. Even when
I explicitly disable it, I get the same errors:
     echo "asdf" | gpg --keyserver-options no-use-temp-files -e -a -r
martin at example.com
Could somebody please advice how I can use gpg without temporary files ?
many thanks,
