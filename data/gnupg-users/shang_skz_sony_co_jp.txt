@_subject: Beginner's Q: How to change the location of my keyrings? 
Hello, this is Shang, a beginner to GNU PG and this list.
I know PGP has a environment variable "PGPPATH" which can
control the default location of the keyrings. How can I do this
in GPG?
And another question, Is there a search page for the archive of
this list? Thank you in advance.

@_subject: --passphrase-fd n 
Hello, I am a beginning to GPG, I'd like to do a autometic en/decryption but I don't know how to pass passphrase to gpg. Option --passphrase-fd
seems can help me to do what I want, but I don't know what the fd is,
(file descriptor?), and how to use it.
Please help, thank you in advance.
