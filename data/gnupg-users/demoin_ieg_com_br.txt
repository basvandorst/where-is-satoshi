@_subject: How to import an old GnuPG signature? 
Hi, how are you?
I bought a new machine and I need to import my old secret keys, from the old
In the old machine, I was using the same version of GnuPG (1.0.6), in Red Hat
How can I do this?
I neet it for decrypt old emails and sign the new mails using the same old signature.
I just import one of my two signatures with the command:
$ gpg --import file.asc
But I can't sign files or encrypt with it.
Anyone can help me?
Thank you.

Here's the line command about what I do:
$ gpg --allow-secret-key-import --import Demoin1.asc
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
gpg: key EEB28B01: not changed
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:              unchanged: 1
$ gpg --allow-secret-key-import --import Demoin2.asc
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
gpg: key 6D9C7C61: public key imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
$ cat opa
la la la la la test test test
$ gpg --clearsign opa
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
gpg: no default secret key: secret key not available
gpg: opa: clearsign failed: secret key not available
Another idea?
Thank you.

$ gpg -u EEB28B01 --clearsign opa
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
gpg: skipped `EEB28B01': secret key not available

I'll try to put in my home dir the files that Peter told me and try
Thanks again. I'll tell the results.
