@_subject: Program announce: gpgkeymgr 
I'd like to announce the first official version (0.2) of the new program It is an small tool for managing and cleaning up you're keyring, by removing old and unnecessary keys.
Currently if supports the following features:
  - remove expired keys
  - remove revoked keys
  - remove not-valid keys, optional with given level
  - remove not-trusted keys, optional with given level
  - remove key listed in a file
  - backup you keyring
  - AND or OR mode for key choosing
  - secret key will not be touched
  - multilingual (english & german for now)
You can find it here: I'm not an experienced developer, so I'm not sure about my code fitting Code-quality standards and would be glad about any feedback. Furthermore I'd also like to get feedback about features wishes, bug reports, etc.

@_subject: gpgkeymgr 0.3 released 
I've released version 0.3 of my tool gpgkeymgr today.
With gpgkeymgr you can clean up and manage your GnuPGP-keyring, by removing old and unnecessary keys.
There haven't been any new bigger features, but I have an French translation (thanks to jbar), German translation of program and manpage, some smaller improvements and probably most important an improved makefile working on more different Systems without problems.
