@_subject: Where can I buy OpenPGP smartcards? 
Does anyone know if any of the following cards are OpenPGP compatible and
will work with GnuPG?
     Or is the card at...
     The only option?
Are there any other companies that also make OpenPGP compatible cards?
I'm looking at a possible deployment of OpenPGP smartcards at my company and
want to ensure that I have multiple vendors.

Wow, that's cool.  That definitely would simplify things for me.  Are there
plans in the future to incorporate PKCS support into the main GnuPG

@_subject: generate command fails on OpenPGP cards 
I created a test key pair on an OpenPGP card.  When I try to run generate
again to replace the test key pair, I get the following error:
  gpg: existing key will be replaced
  gpg: please wait while key is being generated ...
  gpg: pcsc_transmit failed: not transacted (0x80100016)
  gpg: apdu_send_simple(0) failed: card I/O error
  gpg: generating key failed
  gpg: key generation failed: general error
  Key generation failed: general error
This is on an Ubuntu Dapper box:
gnupg: 1.4.2.2-1ubuntu2.5
pcscd: 1.2.9-beta9-1
libpcsclite1: 1.2.9-beta9-1
Any ideas what the problem might be?
