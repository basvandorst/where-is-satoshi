after import of a key (and it is some time, so forgot which one it was --
can I get list of all public keys on my ring sorted by the time of import?)
to gnupg 1.4.1 on Debian/sarge I am getting these error messages whenever I
do anything with gpg:
chelcicky:matej$ gpg --update-trustdb

I guess there is something wrong with my public keyring or trustdb, right? I
tried to export both pubring and trustdb into ascii file, remove
pubring.gpg and trustdb.gpg, and reimport them again, but if anything then
I am getting even more error messages.
I hope that it is OK to put my pubring on the web (is it?), so here it is --
. Can anybody tell me how
to clean it up?
        Thanks in advance for any suggestions,
                Matej Cepl

Just immediately after sending the message to this newsgroup, I have found
out message
 and
yes, it was also PGP Global Directory key, which seems to me screwed up --
when it was removed from my public keyring, everything seems to be all
right. Is there any known legitimate reason, why the organization which
claims to be the organizer of PGP community distributes broken keys?
Sorry for bothering you,
        Matej
