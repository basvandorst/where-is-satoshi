@_subject: My key expired, do I need to revoke 
My GPG key expired during July (I was on holiday then hospital). I am
going to generate a new secret pair but was wondering if I should send
an revoke to the pgp key servers.

Thanks for the tips, I have revoked the key and generated a new key, atm
with no expiry but I will change that, I think as I have a tendency to
lose my secret file.

It is a personal choice, but I think most people would say to have one
set of keys with muliple IDs. I have seen keys with 10+ id's :)

@_subject: Problem with GPG and TheBat 
Hello gnupg-users,
I am using gpg 1.41 Windows with TheBat and I get the following trying
to retrieve keys:
gpg: Signature made 05/21/05 21:52:30 using DSA key ID 6F50DB32
gpg: requesting key 6F50DB32 from hkp server blackhole.pca.dfn.de
gpg: renaming `c:/gnupg\pubring.gpg' to `c:/gnupg\pubring.bak' failed: Permission denied
gpg: error writing keyring `c:/gnupg\pubring.gpg': file rename error
gpg: key 6F50DB32: public key "[User ID not found]" imported
gpg: error reading `[stream]': file rename error
gpg: Total number processed: 0
gpg:               imported: 1
gpg: Can't check signature: public key not found
Is there anyway to get around this?

Hello omn,
Added that now, It looks, from my reading, to be a gpg error not a Bat
