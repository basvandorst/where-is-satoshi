Is there a way to synchronize them?

Hash: SHA1
I'm receiving a lot of spam in  my old email account...
I'm even receiving emails with my own old email as sender!! :-(
Is it a way to tell the sysadmin of this email provider to add some kind of scripts for automatic sign all the outgoing emails (in the name of the department)?
Or maybe the solution has nothing to do with GPG?

I have set the "Always sign msgs" option in Thunderbird with  the THAWTE
So, if  I  now sign also with  GPG, it will be double-signed.... right?
I don't know if its useful or not...
 It must be something like signing the letter and the envelope...
At least... is it compatible, both in technical and philosophical aspects?.

Thanks Werner (and Robert) for your response and information
I'm building an application that needs to extract UIDs and SIGs from
the keys.
At the begining, it was for my own usage, but now I'm thinking that
maybe it is useful for the community...
Since I still don't know where to host it (maybe I won't have
permissions to install everything needed) I think that the parsing
solution of the colon-format is the only solution I can find...

Hi Andre!
Do you know sims?
    You can edit the line (perl)
if (! -p STDIN) {
    close(STDIN);
    open(STDIN, "gpg --list-sigs |");
and tell it to use different keyrings
if (! -p STDIN) {
    close(STDIN);
    open(STDIN, "gpg --list-sigs --home myKeyringA |");
Hope it helps!

@_subject: storing gpg keys on a database 
And does a keyserver use a database? or is it based on a filesystem and
on the fly operations?
(I know how to handle online-databases (mySQL, Postgres...) with perl,
pyton or PHP but I don't know anything about LDAP...)
My idea is having these structures to easy see who has signed someone's key
So I "only" need to store the fingerprint, the email and the signatures...
Thanks to all of you

What I have in mind is to get an easy way to see if I have signed he key
of the people who has signed mine and viceversa.
If it takes the aspect of a table it looks like (let's say key2 is mine)
Only "my row/ my column" is usefull for me, but the other values will be
useful for the other owners...
That's the idea
