@_subject: Trustworthy Android implementation ? 
I'm looking for a trustworthy and user-friendly encryption product to use on my Android smart phone.  I found four implementations of GPG. I don't know anything about the competence or trustworthiness of the implementers.
I'm concerned that if the phone is lost or stolen, how much resistance will the GPG implementation have to exposing my passphrase or private key.
I found:
APG - Thialfihar
Gnu Privacy Guard -The Guardian Project
OpenKeychain - Dominik Sch?rmann
PGP SMS lite - woodkick
