@_subject: how to suppress new "insecure passphrase" warning 
I have been using gnupg for a few years now, with no change in the way I
invoke it. Recently (I guess my package manager updated to a new version:
2.2.23) it started injecting a warning about "insecure passphrase" and
suggesting that I ought to include a digit or special character.
I don't want to do that. I have a strong passphrase that was generated via
Diceware. It's simply a few words made of plain letters; but it's long
enough, and totally random. Stronger than a short, lame password that
someone simply appends a "1" to.
Is there a way to suppress the annoying warning?

I tried that, but it doesn't seem to have any effect. Then, as an
experiment, I tried setting it to 2, and observed that including just 1
digit in the passphrase resulted in no warning (again suggesting that the
setting was not having any effect).
But I don't even think I'm using the agent (unless I misunderstand): I'm
simply running a command like the following:
gpg2 --output *outputfilename* --symmetric *inputfilename*
and waiting for the program to prompt me to enter the passphrase each time.
Sorry, I should have made that clear.
(Thank you for your quick responses.)

D'oh! Sorry! It is working after all.
I didn't realize that the `gpg2` command was starting the agent
automatically. And I didn't realize that when I first tried changing the
configuration, there was an already-running agent that I had to kill first
in order to get it to reread the config.
It's all working great now. Thank you so much! And sorry for the bad info
