@_subject: DSA vs RSA 
Hi all,
I am new to this list and I have same questions.
I hope somebody can answer. If there is a faq where I can gain this
knowledge, please direct me to it.
I am working on project wich will involve exchange of electronic documents.
The requeriment is to ensure that the identity and the contens of electronic
signed messages can not be forged with out the recipient noticing it. Most
users will be using Windows workstations and there will be a unix server.
I have same questions regarding GnuPG and electronic signatures:
I have heard about lots of efforts being made to break RSA-encripted
messages. From this I understand that 1024-bit RSA is safe now will almost
sure be safe for at least 20 years.
I understand that GnuPG uses DSA (Digital Signature Standard) instead of RSA
to sign the documents.
Is it as safe as RSA ? Has there been any important efforts to break this algoritm ? Another question, perhaps related to the above:
What are the similitudes between RSA and DSA? Are they comparable,
different, essentialy the same...?
 inally:
I am worried about the interoperability between GnuPG and other PGP
programs. Every PGP program supports DSA?
thanks in advance,

@_subject: gnupg for windows 
First of all, I would like to thank L. Sassaman and Sam Simpson for their
answer to my previos question [DSA vs RSA]. I've read the article
 and I higly recomend it.
Now, I have questions about the security and the usability of gnupg under
x86 with Win95/98, WinNT and Win2000.
I have read the following and I understand I should get gpg 1.0.2:
Also, as I am using gpg 1.0.1, I took a look at the README.W32 file. It says :
I know now (thanks to Sam's recomended article) that a good random source is
completely critical in the DSS signature process.
unique & unpredictable. If recovers "k" then they can obtain the >private key [Sch96a] - this is a
really catastrophic failure. My conclussion is that gpg for windows does not fit my requeriments, as the
forgery of electronic signed messages could have serious [legal]
Therefore I am considering other options for the windows workstations. I may be loosing some points in my analysis. I am new to this subject and
and I'll appreciate recomendations...
One option is buying PGP from Computer Associates. Price should not be a
problem. (I haven't contacted them yet...-:)
