@_subject: revoking a key using 'addrevoker' 
Hash: RIPEMD160
after adding one of my keys as a deisgnated revoker, by using
the --edit-key 'name' command and and then   'save'
upon editing the key, gnupg listed the added designated revoker
as being able to revoke the key.
then, when trying to send the updated key with the new revoker
to the keyserver, got the following error message:
"Sending key(s) 0x46D7F7C7 to server x-hkp://pgp.mit.edu ...

if the sender wants the signature preserved, it can easily be done by
and then encrypting, or signing and encrypting,
the clearsigned message.
{n.b.} it is important to be aware that ordinary signed and encrypted
messages 'can' still be separated into free standing signed
messages, even though it is not in the GnuPG released versions.
There were a few additional lines of code written for this modification {by

The point is, that it 'can' be done,

@_subject: default algorithm for symmetric encryption 
have noticed (in gnupg 1.0.7 and 1.1.90, and as explained in the man.page)
that the default algorithm for a symmetric encryption, is the one that is
set in the option 's2k-cipher-algo name',
and not in ,
'cipher-algo name'
{although using the option 'cipher-algo name' will over-ride it}
was just curious why it was set up this way
if neither of the above options are used, it will be cast-5 by default, but
if the 's2k-cipher-algo' is set to twofish or aes256,
and then a symmetric encryption is done, it will include mdc packets
(possibly without the user intending this/or being aware
of it)
intuitively, it would seem that the default would be in the 'cipher-algo
name' option, and that if none were specified,
it would default to 3des, as this is required for all gnupg generated keys.
anyway, i'm sure there is a good reason why it is the way it is, and am just
curious about it ;)

question about the 'mpi too large' error issue :
have examined the 'problem' form of a secret key
with pgpdump,
as well as the 'safe form'  pgpdump clearly identifies the zero octet in the beginning of the encrypted
secret key packet:
here are the pgpdump results for the key form that causes the error message
of 'mpi too large' :
Old: Secret Key Packet(tag 5)(928 bytes)
Ver 3 - old
Public key creation time - Thu May 23 14:41:06 UTC 2002
Valid days - 0[0 is forever]
Pub alg - RSA Encrypt or Sign(pub 1)
RSA n(2048 bits) - {not included in post}
RSA e(5 bits) - 11
Sym alg - IDEA(sym 1)

Encrypted RSA u(1023 bits) - {not included in post}
Checksum - 3e 32
Old: User ID Packet(tag 13)(24 bytes)
User ID - keypic
the pgpdump results for the same secret key 'safe' form with the passphrase
changed, shows the following for the Encrypted RSA d packet:  Encrypted RSA
d(2045 bits) - e5 87 dd .. {remainder not included}
as this is easily detectable, would it be possible for GnuPG to
use -gpg --listpackets
automatically, as a 'screening' test before importing a keypair, or secret
key, or after changing a passphrase ,
and alert the user 'not' to import the 'problem' key
{with an 'override' option available, for those who wish to investigate
does the 'mpi too large' problem happen only when the 'first' encrypted mpi
packet of a secret key, begins with a zero octet,
or can it happen when 'any' packet, (even not in a key, but in an encrypted
file), begins with a zero octet?

@_subject: remove non PGP blocks data 
because it is not a gnupg option, and does not apply at all to gnupg
in pgp > 5, the pgp viewer displays 'all' contents on the screen, not just
the decryption or verification of a message block
{gnupg does not do this, and never has}
this, at best, adds extra distractions to the actual pgp message content,
and, at worst, can lead to some exploits that 'might' fool some new users
the 'remove non-PGP blocks data' is a default option added to all ckt builds
from 6 and on, so that the viewer will
display only the pgp message contents,
(and the encryption or signature details; which hash, which symmetric
the signing and encryption key id's, date and time, etc.)

your system is made up of two letter syllables out of a (13 consonant) X (5

so, 1:85 chance of picking a pair
a diceware word is 1:7776
a pair of syllables from your list would be 1:85^2 = 1:7225
so a 15 syllable combination from your list, would give the approximate

{assuming paper clip randomization is about the same as random dice throws,

15 syllables = 30 characters
7 diceware words @ about 4 or 5  letters per word, also about 30 characters

@_subject: keys beginning with zero-octet mpi's 
i recently had a proble with a v3 rsa key imported from pgp to gnupg 1.0.7.
after importing it, gnupg would give error messages about
'mpi being too large'
i forwarded the key to someone who reported the same problem with it, and
forwarded the key onto the gnupg devel list,
he forwarded the answer to me, that:
"It's probably an encrypted MPI started with a zero octet.  This
problem is already known, I think.
Workaround: Create a new directory, copy the secret key (in
non-armored from) to "secring.gpg", use "gpg --home . --edit-key" to
change the passphrase.  It's likely that the result is readable by
GnuPG (the bug is triggered with a probability of 1:85 or so)."
i did this, and after changing the passphrase and importing the key, it
worked fine.
my questions now are:
How can one tell when one's key begins with this type of problem octet?
Is it the same frequency for all key types?
{the key in question was a v3 rsa test key,
can post the original problem key here, with the passphrase if it would be

@_subject: interoperability 
there still remains a minor potential interoperability problem:
if a pgp user encrypts a message to a recipient's dh key, and (by default)
to his own v3 rsa key,
(inconvenient to change a long-standing key that has come to be known and
trusted by many correspondents)
and the recipient's dh key was generated in pgp
{and therefore 'allows'  the idea cipher for that key, even if it is not the
preferred one}
then the message will have 'idea' as the symmetric cipher for 'both' keys,
even if the pgp user specifies a different algorithm,
as long as the 'idea' algorithm is not disabled
now, if the recipient was a previous pgp user, and moved to gnupg, and took
the pgp generated dh keys with him,
but does not use the 'idea' module, in gnupg,
then the message will not be decryptable in gnupg
this can easily be worked around by having the pgp user (sender) temporarily
disable the 'idea' cipher for messages to those recipients where this may be
an issue
this does not apply to gnupg users whose keys were generated in gnupg
without the idea module,
as then pgp will automatically pick a symmetric cipher common to both keys,
and not use idea
