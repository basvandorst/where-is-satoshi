@_subject: What to do with public key signature 
So I received a public key from a party. I verified it and I'm ready to sign it.
What's next step? What should I ideally do with that signature?
1) send back to the key owner hoping that he will publish it to the keyserver?
2) should I just push it to keyserver myself?
3) what if the key owner did not publish his key?
Best regards,

Shortly, I know only one combination that provides reasonable
use experience on mobile.
Android + K-9 Mail + OpenKeychain + YubiKey with NFC.

Can you explain what kind of workflow do you mean here?

This is not true. Many crypto systems are designed to perform damage
control and recovery in such cases.
If the compromise is game over for the user - it depends on threat profile.

The strategy I advice would be to not use GnuPG and look for alternatives.
I wouldn't look for some golden practice because I believe there
is none. Bluntly speaking, GnuPG is not fit for purpose of
securing everyday communication and shall not be advertised
as such.
Generally your keys should never leave secure environment. Secure
environment can be either dedicated machine that you control
or (better) SmartCard/HSM.
If your keys cannot be contained in secure environment, your comms
channel should be re-keyed after use. Modern communicators perform
re-keying after every message. GnuPG makes re-keying very cumbersome.
Sadly, GnuPG never delivered friendly user experience.
It found it's niche in some specialized use-cases, such as
infrastructure - package signing, backup encryption, commands
by e-mail, etc - but it never gained significant adoption among
wider population.
If you expected more - I' m sorry that you will be disappointed.

20?  Wow. There are 8 billion people on this planet, most of them don't
work at 20 companies from Fortune 500.
WhatsApp build crypto system that is successfully adopted by billions of
users without technical knowledge.
Our views on what can be considered a successful adoption are strongly

tells a different story.
It would benefit the community if you guys stop bending over backwards,
explaining potential users that their needs are invalid.
Over and out. I really don't want to continue this
fruitless conversation.

They don't want to bundle GnuPG because of GnuPG licence:
Requiring user to set up GnuPG separately is out of question if
they want to achieve any sensible level of adoption.
There is another matter of key distribution and I guess they plan
on taking control over it to provide acceptable level of UX.

> It doesn't do
that? Why would they choose to tightly couple TB with
for me.
Dealing with GnuPG complexity is a deal breaker for ordinary users,
preventing adoption. You need to look at it from product/business
development perspective and it makes perfect sense that they want to
ship their own UX.
Also, they mention that the key management workflow is something they
plan to address.

Do you know why they resited OpenPGP adoption it so much?

I can confirm that this happens and users are being b0rked because
of trolls.
Street level rumour is that GnuPG key exchange is broken and you should
not use it.
It doesn't matter what the truth is - it is the public perception
that recent SKS events made it unusable, this was advertised
across the media all over the place and the image stuck.
Additionally, poor handling of SKS fiasco by GnuPG community
hurt it's credibility a lot, so a clear signal that this issue was
treated seriously would be beneficial.
Should it be advertised as a new go-to standard or as
transitional standard, beta/alpha/whatever - I don't know,
it's debatable.

YubiKeys are supported. You can use NFC key to perform crypto gimmicks or plug USB one.
OpenKeychain does support quite large palette of hardware tokens.
Paired with K-9 it actually provides relatively good UX.
