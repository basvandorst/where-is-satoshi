@_subject: self-signature problem 
I have just installed the gnupg version 1.0.3 on my linux system
and on my windows system. Everthing seems to work, except....
when I create new key on the windows system and export it, then copy it
to the linux system. Then try to import it on the linux system I get
invalid self-signature
no valid user IDs
may because of missing self-signature
I'm sure someone has encountered this problem before...
Have I missed a step?
I tried it in reverse...i.e. from the linux machine to the windows nt
and the same happened.
I can't find anything in the docs that might indicate what I did wrong.
Can someone help please?
