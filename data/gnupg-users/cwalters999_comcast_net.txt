@_subject: A question regarding gnupg and passphrases... 
Hash: SHA1
Hi All,
I have been lurking in this group for a while now, and have been using
gnupg for a while, as well.
My question is this:  When I symmetrically encrypt something with
"gpg -c" it will allow me to enter only one passphrase.  However, when I
decrypt the same thing, with the same passphrase, it has a line that
says "Encrypted with 1 passphrase".  This implies that it is possible to
use more than one passphrase when encrypting.  Does anyone know if this
is true?  Or if it is a future plan?  If it is possible, could someone
give me an idea of how to do it?
By the way, I looked over all of the documentation on the site, and it
does not seem to mention multiple passphrases, nor does the man page.

Hash: SHA256
Hi All,
I actually have a couple of questions regarding passphrases - speaking
mainly of symmetric encryption (e.g. gpg -c).
The first question regards the maximum length of a passphrase - I would
like to know what it is in GnuPG.  I know there is a practical limit to
what someone could type, but I am looking more for the limit within the
The second one is, how does GnuPG handle "non-printable" characters,
other than new line characters?  What I mean by this is basically
anything you cannot directly type with a normal keyboard (upper ASCII
and the lower ASCII characters).
