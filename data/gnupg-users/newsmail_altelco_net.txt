@_subject: Unable to send key to keyserver 
I am trying to send my public key to a keyserver using this command, and here is the error message that was returned.
gpg --keyserver  --send-keys 0x6038EB02
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
gpg: error sending to ` eof
I have also tried replacing the 0x6038EB02 with the name I used in generating the key which is John Pitz.  What am I doing wrong?  Please cc  newsmail in the reply as I don't subscribe to the mailing list.

keyserver.net software has troubles receiving keys from gnupg. The solution
is to a) pass the request through http proxy (don't know why but it worhs
with this approach) or use another keyserver,like certserver.pgp.com.
