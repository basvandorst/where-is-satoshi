  Some servers are hard to configure to use sftp (if possible at all)...
as an example, a friend of me asked me to enable SSL in his server (I am
not sure if it is a virtual server or just a virtualhost, but I am sure
it has shared IP). When I tried to install the certificate... I realized
it couldn't be done without having to pay an extra monthly fee to get
our own IP. Without it, we are stuck to the "common" certificate
extended to all the hosts in that IP, and I am not sure if it is
trustworth at all... so sometimes, it's not by choice... or because they
don't know how to configure these services. About what is "sensitive
information", some people have fun by stealing somebody's email and
closing it... but of course if we talk about a file containing the
credit card number of your customers, then that is info is worth hiring
somebody to set up security before something bad happens...

  I suppose it is clear text, and that would be the reason for the
"security risk" warning. The idea about export a secret key is to import
it in other place, so it must be cleartext... unless you want to back up
it, in that case, you can encrypt it right after exporting it... But all
this is what I suppose, since I don't remember having exported a secret
key from command line.
  I remember somebody asked the same question a couple of months ago,
and the answer was:
  If you encrypt it and then sign it, if somebody steal the message, he
would get the sender's key ID from the signature. If you sign it and
then encrypt it, the thief would not have any info about the sender.
  I suppose decrypting a file is not a security threat, so there should
not be a problem if you decrypt a message and just then you notice it
doesn't come from the sender... (invalid signature).

advices about using ccleaner, fileshredder, erase57, and other tools
like those, but after reading a lot about how difficult is to make data

to make deleted files (not whole drives) unrecoverable to commercial
recovery software, I am not interested in protecting myself against
government class laboratories (if a judge ever wants to see my data, I
would rather give it, and privately laugh about the resources spent to
recover harmless data).

  That's is what I am no longer sure I can do, I mean, it seems I can

least, that is what I have understood from this thread). But maybe there
is some app capable of telling the disk "write this random patter right
over the place where the original file is, and not in other places".
  Or maybe if I fill the whole disk with zeroes, it MUST overwrite the
file... since I would be using the full capacity of the disk, there
would not be "other places" available... but this was already discarded,
and I didn't really understand why it is not reliable in the "avoid
commercial software utilities for info recovery" context.
   Well, the original question did not include any context (and I was
not the one making the question), so it was very reasonable to talk
about physical destruction of the drive, but since I am sure some people
is not concerned about NSA or KGB trying to recover the info, just about
low budget people, I added that context... something like "I want to be

girlfriend naked, which I just deleted" (it is just an imaginary

  Now, a lot of coffee cups latter, I am thinking maybe it is harder to
"securely" delete a single file than a whole disk or partition... since
with just 1 file, you must overwrite the place where the file is
located, and if we want to erase the whole disk, it should be matter of
filling it up to full capacity with some debris data... there is no need
to "aim" to a specific spot...
  Sure! I know forensics labs can do things amazing (or they are
supposed to be able to do them... once I read they can recover files
overwritten 7 times, without much problems, and after that, it becomes
more difficult, but not impossible). I still think the flame torch can

  You could use pidgin to talk, and windows live messenger to use shared

GnuPG splits its command-line arguments up into options and commands.
Any option can also be specified in your config file, ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf,
which will cause it to be in effect for every gpg command you run.  As a
result of this, the documentation lists a lot of command-line switches
that are of little use on the command line, but useful as part of your
config file.  The "group" option is one of these.
If you specify a group on the command line, that group only exists for
the lifetime of the command that you are running (and is therefore nigh
useless).  If you specify a group in the config file, that group will
exist to gpg whenever you run it, allowing you to specify it as a
recipient of encrypted messages (-r groupname).
It looks like you're expecting the --group command-line option to create
a group which persists for longer than the lifetime of the gpg process
you gave it to.  That's not how configuration works in GnuPG.  Any
change that you want to make to the behavior of all subsequent gpg
processes must be made in the config file.

  Once I read "a signed public key it is a certificate". I have also
seen discussions about if people is using keys OR certificates... since
I couldn't understand the difference (and the discussion seemed to be
becoming a flame), I didn't participate on that one... So I was almost
sure they were the same animal, but not sure enough to defend that
position. However, since most people just know about x.509 certificates
(because they are used by SSL), when I see the word "certificate", the
first thing I think about, is SSL stuff related (and I think S/MIME uses
the same kind of certificates). At GPG list, people usually talk about
keys... so when I read "public key", the first thing I think about is
  Clear like water... but I think it would be interesting if people
could use x.509 certificates as we use GPG... I mean, if I can make a
self signed certificate, and exchange it with a friend, and we could
sign these certificates, and make some software to trust them (since
they have been signed with my own key), I could use these certificates
with outlook, or even for web site login purposes (at CAcert web site,
people can use their CAcert issued certificates to login, instead of
user name and password). I figure all that CAN be done... but I don't
think that would be easy to do... so I though _maybe_ GPG2 would be
taking a step in that direction. All I know about GPG4win (the only GPG2
software I can use, since it can't be compiled in windows environment),
is it comes with a lot of software, probably even with a mail client,
and "it supports x.509 certificates". But I don't know if it intends to
decentralize the "trust", or if it is just about to put all
security/authentication stuff together.
  Yes, but if we compare certificates created with OpenSSL, and
certificates OpenPGP, it is an apples and grapes thing, so I supposed
^maybe^ they were talking about GPG2, and that GPG2 had the capability
to generate x.509 keys... but I never confirmed that, so I archived it
in my "maybe..." folder :-P

, or if you have access to a computer with gpg already installed on it.
If this is not the case, then you can't check the tar file by using the
*sig file, and you must look for the hash value to compare with the
sha1sum.exe file...
  Take a look at   There are the instructions about checking the downloaded package, and
also a list of files and sha1 values to compare.

Hash: SHA256
arghman escribi?:
  Well... I got a x.509 certificate from CAcert.org, with my name on it.
But also, I got CAcert's pgp signature on my pgp key... Also, if you
have a Thawte certificate with your name on it, you can use it to sign a
message containing your PGP public key, and some people would accept
that as a prove the key belongs to you (unless somebody has stolen you
email account, and your x.509 certificate).
  Rather than using the same key pair with x.509 and PGP, I would
suggest to use your x.509 certificate as a "proof" of your identity, and
if people accept that as a valid proof, then they would sign your pgp
key too.
  Take a look at  people there accepts CAcert and Thawte
certificates as valid ways to prove your identity, and can sign your key
to reflect that. Of course, that would only help you if the one
challenging your identity trusts GSWoT Introducers signatures...

      I have been carrying portable thunderbird with portable gnupg in
my flash memory stick, plus GPGShell, and it works fine. But GPGShell
licence forbids to redistribute it. The idea is to make that "combo"
available for download... it is not making any modification, just saving
the "end user" the problem of having to install these apps by themselves
(also, to put GPGShell in the flash drive, the user needs to have it
already in his computer). So I need another tool to make easy for the
user to verify the signature of a file (or to send and receive encrypted
email). I am not intending to actually make it available for donwload,
just to be able to say "we would use that combo to provide our customers
free software capable of dealing with privacy and authenticity, already
configured (fool-proof)". But I don't know about other GUI tools
available under windows environment (or under any other environment...

that plugin is not so portable... I will try this one. Anyway, my
current problem requires portable apps, not to be able to use the

people is much more likely to use these tools if they read "download it,
unzip it, and you are ready to use it... if you no longer want it on

copyright, but I *feel* Gnu people would focus the subjet in a different
way... it's not something I can express with words, just a "feeling".
  What locklizard does, it is to encrypt the document, lets say, a pdf
file, which now can only be open with a special (free) viewer...
basically, a pdf viewer with other functions (FileOpen, another DRM
company, uses a pluging for adobe acrobat reader). The viewer checks for
a user ID in the computer (which is sent to the user, and I don't know
how do it identifies the computer... but supposedly, it can't be copied
to another computer), and then connects to an internet hosted database,
checks the user rights to access the document, and then grant or deny
the document. It can be configured to restrict some rights, or
everything, and also the frequency (for each document) the reader checks
the current status of the user, in the online database. They have
solutions for websites too, but I don't know how does it work.

@_subject: Confused about Sub keys. 
Hash: SHA1
Simon Dwyer escribi?:
  Hello, and yes, I think subkeys are confusing... I am still a bit
confused... Anyway, there are a few things I understood, and they are:
1.- There are keys used to sign, and other keys used for
encrypt/decrypt: DSA keys can sign but not encrypt, Elgammal can encrypt
but not sign. RSA can do both functions, but the function intended for
it must be defined at the moment of creating the key. And that is the
reason to use "key pairs", because a singe key can't do both functions.
2.- You can make a key pair using DSA-Elgammal, or
RSA(sign)-RSA(encrypt). Maybe you can mix, but I am *not sure* about that.
3.- A key pair is always composed by a primary key (used to sign), and a
subkey used to encrypt/decrypt.
4.- You can add more subkeys, for signing and for encrypting. But I
don't have any idea about how does GnuPG chose what key is going to use...
5.- The primary key is the only key that can sign other keys.
6.- But if you have a signing subkey, and an encrypting subkey, you can
use these subkeys pair to sign and encrypt... you can even export the
secret keys and store them safe, then export the subkeys, delete the
key, import the subkeys, and be able to do everything, except to sign
other people's keys. You can revoke the subkeys, if they get
compromised, and since the primary key would not be compromised, you can
import it, make a new subkeys pair, and keep functioning with the same
master key ID (so, you would not lose the signatures people have done to
your key).
7.- If you delete a subkey used to encrypt, you won't be able to read
messages sent to you encrypted for that subkey, so, if you have to
revoke a subkey, do it, but never delete it.
  And that is all I know about the subject...
  So, you don't have to do anything to use your subkey, it is already
being used anytime you need to encrypt/decrypt.

LD_PRELOAD is for portability of code)

attacker had access to it. But anyway, maybe there is a lot of other
nasty things that can be crawling in the computer, if somebody had
access to it...

the countersheet got broken (after many translation attempts, I am not

use to break through locked doors, we don't those ways to do it.

the other email addresses, used the option "I forgot my password, send
it to my secondary email", and all the other email accounts sent their
passwords to the email that was compromised... allowing the hacker to
take control of all these accounts, changing the security questions and
secondary emails, so the true owner can't recover the accounts.
  Since then, I'd like to keep my email accounts isolated from each
other... I still have to figure out a way to set the secondary addresses
to still be able to ask my password in case I forget it, but without
risking all my accounts if somebody takes control over one of them.

gpg --edit-key 12WP8CAQ  (12WP8CAQ must be replaced by your key's ID)
then it should ask your passphrase, and then ask you to enter the new
passphrase (it ask it 2 times, as usual, to be sure you are not
mistyping it)
I figure if you don't hit any key, and answer by hitting "enter", it
should assume you want a blank passphrase... But don't belive too much,
I seldom use command line with gpg (I manage my keys from GPGkeys or

  Thanks, Sven Radde, I figure Truecrypt will be a good option when I
have enough privileges in the other computer too, and I am a bit
unwilling to use an outdated version to work around that limitation...
  For now, I think the best option would be a gpg self extracting
encrypted file (containing the private keyring), and using symmetric
encryption in it, and that file hidden inside a lossless compressed
image file (and what would look more innocent that a folder with some
pretty girls in swimsuits? well, maybe pretty girls without swimsuits).
  I already found a java based steganography program (freeware and
opensource), and I also have portabilized jre + gpg + gpgshell in the
usb flash drive. The procedure would be to extract the encrypted file
from the picture, extract the private keyring, copy it to the right
folder, and do whatever I have to do. Once finished, I would just delete
the keyring. All this with my fingers crossed to avoid some malware
stealing my passphases and all that.
  But I also found a tutorial that shows how to protect the primary
private key, allowing to revocate the compromised subkeys without losing
everything (signatures other people could have put in my keys). The
problem is I am still newbie in how public keys work, so I am not sure
if the public keys I already uploaded to the keyservers can work with
the private subkey the tutorial suggest to make (but it wont be a really
big problem, since the only public key that would receive a message is
the one I use in this list, and I can wait until I arrive home to check
this mail... I can just revocate and rebuild the other one)... and also,
I am not sure if these subkeys would be enough to decrypt encrypted
emails sent to me (and if they can't, then there is no point in
following the tutorial).
  I will give put the link to the tutorial, so, in the unlikely case you
don't already know it (everywhere I look for cryptography info, I find
the name of one or two people in this list), you can read it and give

to that kind of software. I chose Digital Invisible Ink Toolkit, since
it is open source, free, built in java, so it should run anywhere. I
already had some portable apps (like portable openoffice.org) in my
flash drive, including jre... so it looks very viable to use that.
  I don't trust them too, since I was told it is very likely they can be
hacked... at least, laptops protected by fingerprint readers can be
hacked. So I would rather use a USB flash drive with built in 256 bits
AES... but then, I think it would be the same than just encrypting the
keyring with that encryption system, or making a self extracting gpg
encrypted file... And if I put that file inside a picture (which
supports encryption too...), that probably would be more than enough to
keep the data safe...
  Well, the thing is my keyring is not valuable at all, it has not even
been signed by other people... but since I am studying an IT related
career, I should do things "the right way" (or learn how to do them "the
right way"), before I actually have to use that knowledge...
  Thanks for your advice, since cryptography is based on "the security
is in the key, not in the algorithm" (the info is not hidden, but
protected), and steganography is based on hiding the info, I thought
maybe talking about steganography at gpg list would be some kind of

  Yes, that IS a very important point I was missing. And the real
dimension of making pre computed rainbow tables useless... I found this:
  It have estimations of the time required to generate a set of tables
for passwords 1-7 characters long, with just alpha characters, and with
alpha+numeric characters. The second option (with a 666 Mhz computer,
very slow by now, but it helps to get an idea of the required time) is
more than 15 days! With some weak protected files, maybe it would be a
lot faster to use bruteforce (in other hand, once the tables are ready,
the required time to use them can be really short... but since salt
ensure the tables can't be used more than once...).
  I know people who explained salt to me don't need this info, but maybe
there are more people following this subject...

  Well... probably the puppies would be more suspicious (lol)
  But now I am more interested in following the tutorial "Keeping
primary key safe" than in hiding the keyring... since that way I also
would be protected in the case some malevolent malware takes a copy of
the keyring while I am using it... I would just revocate the subkeys...
  I still need to know a few things... I can "play" with the keyring in
my USB flash drive as often as I need, but I would hate messing my
desktop computer's keyring on daily basis (actually, I don't think I
would be using the USB drive so often, it would be more a "just in case
I need to access the mail when I am not at home"). So I would like to
know if I need to keep a copy of the "disposable" subkeys in order to be
able to read the messages...
  I mean:
  Home computer
- - Primary Key (SC)
 - Subkey1 (s)
 - Subkey2 (e)
  USB keyring
- - #
 - Subkey3 (s)
 - Subkey4 (e)
  Now, if I suspect my USB keyring becomes compromised,  would revocate
Subkeys 3 and 4, and generate Subkeys 5 and 6 to replace them, but...
would I still be able to read messages I received when I was using
subkeys 3 and 4? What happens with my public key each time I add a
subkey? Does it "grows"? It is always exactly the same public key? Since
I am not so sure to know how subkeys are generated, I can't know those
things (and if it involves high level mathematics, probably I would no
understand it, too).
  Maybe the subject is preventing people from reading these messages,
since at least 1 person thought it had gone almost off-topic...

  Now I went to the site again, and took a look at gpg 2.0.9. There is a
link to an external site that provides a GNUpg installer for windows...
but the most recent version available is 2.0.7 They also provide
instructions to make the installer (I figure that way people doesn't
have to wait to get an updated version), but they say it is better to
make it on a linux based system (or in a virtual machine with linux). So
it is easier for a linux user to get the updated version than for a
windows user. Finally, when I read the FAQs, the paths to files are
linux style, not windows style (but it is not a problem, since it is
easy to understand). Even some portable version of the software says
something like "for people who doesn't have a linux based machine at
their work and want to carry... from home" (not exactly those words,
since I don't remember where I saw it...).
  For all those reasons, I *think* if we make a poll about what

something for 100 years, they would encrypt the file and store it
somewhere... and if it is so valuable, probably it should be in a place
safer than a computer...
  By the way, it would be easier to steal the protected file, and steal
the key.. have you heard about "burundanga"?
  Or maybe, it would be a good idea to protect the file with the

there were one GUI capable to concentrate the different tools, or maybe

  Well, I feel different... soon after I was born, a nurse put ink on my
foot, and made a "footprint". That was archived, with my name, and my
parents names. Latter, when I was about 8 years old, I got my ID card,
and a ID code was assigned to me (now they are making those ID codes
when a baby is born), and they took all my fingerprints (both hands). I
admit they didn't check if my feet was the same as in my birth
certificate, but if somebody says she is my real mother, it can be
verified (without DNA test). So I feel here, in Chile, state provided ID
cards are reasonably safe. Or at least, if there is any claim of wrong
identity, it can be tracked to the moment a new born is registered in
the system. Sure, maybe there can be a mistake in the hospital, and 2
babies can be exchanged... but that is one of these "what if...?" that
we shouldn't be worried about, unless something forces us to consider
that case.
  My point is, when I had the age to be able to think "I am going to
fake my identity", it was already too late to be able to fake the
system. All I can do is forge my ID card, and that is a complex thing to
do, they have many security measures.

  Hello Carlos Williams. GNUpg is the opensource (and free) software for
PGP encryption, so it is a very good choice. It doesn't need to be
installed in a server, but in each end user computer. It can even be
carried in a USB flash stick. What you need to send a signed, or
encrypted message with gpg, is: gpg, an email client with support for
gpg (I use mozilla thunderbird, with Enigmail add-on for that), and your
key pair (you generate it with gpg, there is not an external provider
for that).
  Then both sides exchange their public keys, they need to import the
public keys to their public keyring, and start using them. How to export
 and import the public keys varies depending if you are using command
line commands, or if you are using a GUI.
  But also, you must make sure you really got the right key from your
vendor, and not the key from somebody impersonating him. About how to do
that, I am sure other people here can explain it a lot better than I
could do that...

  There is a tutorial somewhere, "keeping your private key safe", that
says you can carry just a couple of subkeys, and use them to
sign/encrypt/decrypt messages... and if something bad happen, you just
need to revocat... to apply revocation to the subkeys, and to generate
another subkeys using your primary secret key (which you would keep at a
safe place, like your home computer, or in a USB stick hidden under your
dog's feeding bowl (use a titanium covered USB Stick, in case the dog is
hungry). The good part is you would never lose your primary key, so you
don't have to gather signatures again. But you won't be able to sign
other people's keys at work, just at home. Also, if your subkeys are
stolen -or you think they could have been compromised- on daily basis...
you would be collecting a pair of revocated subkeys each and everyday...
so maybe a combination would be good... carry the subkeys in the USB
stick, so if you lose it, you just lose the subkeys, and the files
wouldn't be available at your office when you are not there... so it
should be harder to steal them...
  And off course, use a passphase that is not in any dictionary...
bruteforce takes a lot of time, but dictionary attacks are pretty
fast... think about something that would make the thief to curse aloud
and in several languages (lol). The passphrase in your home computer
doesn't need to be the same than the one in the USB stick...

  Yes, I don't remember to have seen a message from Kara in the list,
but she has helped me too, by private messages.
  Well, on her behalf, the idea about an "extreme example" is to make it
"extreme". Now, you should not let an "extreme example" bother you, in
special if your nervous system is weak (maybe you should ask a medic
about it, and sometimes, you need a second opinion). The thing about
signatures in our public keys mean: "you can't control them", but I
would add: "since we know we can't control them, why should be worried
about them?". I mean, most people doesn't know how to use GPG, and the
people trying to learn about it, soon or latter will learn about that
fact... They will learn it sooner if that point is included in a FAQ...
  By the way, the fact the used that example as "extreme example",
implies she considers it a very undesirable signature... a racist person
would not use it as an example, since that person could even be proud of
such message...
  The first thing I should point, is the message you sent to the list,
is not encrypted, it is just signed... and yes, if you sign a message
and send it unencrypted, you should be careful about what are you
saying, since we would know it was you the one who sent it. BUT at the
same time (*if I am not wrong*), malicious people can't modify it to
change the context... so if you send an "extreme example", a malicious
user would need to show the whole message, and that would make clear the
fact it was just an example, and not an opinion.
  The second thing, is the purpose of encrypting messages, is to keep
them private. There are laws about reading letters sent to other people
(at least, in my country, that is not legal), and the only thing gpg
does, is to give us a way to bring the same privacy principle to email
messages. In _my_ _opinion_, the only concern we must have when we send
an encrypted message, is to not offend the recipient's sensibility, but
I would not care about what a "listener" would think about the message,
since gpg (_if_ _used_ _in_ _a_ _proper_ _way_), will take care of
  Well, IIRC, there was an attempt to forbid encryption, but it could
not be done, because it would destroy the electronic commerce...
  Now, I would be careful about the use of encryption in countries where
privacy is not a right... but I suppose if you are in this list, then
you are not in one of those countries.
  The only ways the authorities can know the content of an encrypted
messages are:
1.- If the recipient disclosures the content of the message, as you did
with Kara's message (but since the only thing it contained was an
"extreme example", and also you didn't post her signature -so she can
claim your forged the message), I suppose it won't cause any problem.
Anyway, maybe next time you should ask people before posting the content
of a private message...
2.- If the authority ask a judge to order either the recipient or the
sender to disclosure the content of the message (note that, if the
sender has not configured enigmail to encrypt the message to his own key
too, he would not be able to do it, even if he wants to).
3.- If either the recipient or the sender has some spyware in his

  Well, if it was already printed "You will pay the price for your lack

it right, paperkey generates a txt output file (ascii 7 bits). You can
copy and paste that output, chose a clear font, and print it...
  I don't even dare to think the effort that would require, since the
few OCR software I have used, made use of dictionaries to avoid making
too many errors... and still they made a lot of them. Without the aid of
dictionaries... it's scary XD

you mean when you talk about bits of entropy v/s bits of passphrase?
  It took 32 characters (mixing lowercase, uppercase and numbers) to get
129 bits (I bet it's not easy to get exactly 128 bits). The character
'r' just added 2 bits, while 'R' added 6 bits... interesting, probably
people is used to think in terms of characters, and "1 character= 1

2 keys are found at the search, I would expect a contact to write and

  That is what I thought, they would use the KeyID instead of the
fingerprint (but then somebody pointed the Key ID is the last part of
the fingerprint, a fact I had not noticed before). So I can either tell
them the last part of the fingerprint can be used to retrieve the key,
or give them my biglumber url... I chose to give my biglumber url, since
if I ever have to change my email address, I can just update my key, and
 they could retrieve the update key, with the new UID linked to the new
email address...
  That is if we are talking about some kind of notary or assurer... But
if I give the card to a cousin, he would not require my picture ID...
And some other people would not really care if they know my real
identity, as long as they know my real email address... As an example, I
am in an alliance of players of some multiplayer game. While everybody
was invited by somebody they know in real life, some just knew the one
who invited them. So the first time I went to a barbecue with them,
everybody was talking to the other people referring to them by their
nicknames... However, it would be important to exchange our email
addresses, and it would be a good thing to use gpg... sometimes a player
send his "game sensitive information", like user and password... or even
worst, they post them into the alliance forum (and we know there have
been attempts to penetrate the forum...). Well, this was just a real
example about situations where real ID is not important...
  Right, now I am convinced the whole fingerprint is better...

  Hello Laurent!
   Well, I _suppose_ (and I can be very wrong about it) it is not a
threat, probably, since GnuPG is "smart" and it can "decide" what to do,
depending on the input it receives, probably enigmail detected a PGP
block, and sent it to gpg... and gpg probably detected it was encrypted,
and asked for a passphrase to decrypt it... I _suppose_ the worst thing
that can happen, would the secret key being displayed unencrypted in the

David Vegano escribi?:
  Hello David, welcome!
  I don't think so, remember the pass is to protect your private keys
(stored in your secring.gpg)... so what you should be worried about is
if they can access the keys... the pass is just the lock you use to
protect them. The thing you use to encrypt or decrypt, it is the key,
not the pass.
  And the pubring is "public"... (Maybe you don't want people knowing if
you have locally signed some public keys, but other than that, there is
not "private" info in the pubring, as far as I know).
  First, don't use a password, use a passphrase (it's the same thing as
a password, but it is composed of several words, and numbers, and it is
better if the words can't be obtained from a dictionary). I mean, don't
use "Enterprise" as the pass, use something like
"TheEnterpriseIsTheBestSpaceship". But all those words can be found in a
dictionary, and I didn't use any number... so that is not a good
passphrase, it is just an example.
  Anyway, you are in the right path, the passphrase is your last defense
to protect your keys, the idea is to don't let strange people to have
access to the files... And I don't know how to protect them, without
knowing if you share your computer with somebody, what operating system
you are using, and all that info.

  Well, I don't know what other people would think about keyloggers and
the use of gpg just for file encryption, but I think in your case, a
keylogger would not be so terrible (provided it doesn't steal your
pass). But the problem is, if you already have a keylogger, you don't
know what else you could have. And the problem with encryption, is you
will always need a password to decrypt, so, instead of stealing your
key's pass, they can steal the pass used to decrypt the keyring, and
then they can steal the keyring itself. Another option is to use a
keyfile, instead of a password, but then you would need to protect that
keyfile... so you would have to encrypt it, and use another keyfile,
which would have to be encrypted...
  Or you can put your keyring in a removable media, like an USB flash
memory stick... but remember these devices can "die", and if you lose
your private keyring, you lose all the encrypted files too, since there
is no way to decrypt them without the keys... At least, you should have
a reliable backup.
 If you use windows, maybe you should install software to keep the
computer "clean" from malware. I don't know what is recommended for
other operating systems... Since I use windows, I know a couple of free
tools, like antivirus, firewall, and such, that can help a lot to keep
windows "safe".

translation is not accurate... but you will recognise it when you see it).
  Now I am thinking maybe it is not bad if you keep using the old
SMTP... it would allow you to receive a copy of your messages sent to
email lists (once you add your new address to the list), and maybe it
would make it harder for spammers to harvest your email address...

I have modified my preferences in gpg.conf, but my key was generated
before making those changes... when I use showpref command, the cypher

so my concern was the keys generated previous to setting the

yesterday shows the same preferences as my oldest key...
  Right, but if I edit a key, or generate a new one, gpg could take the
preferences from gpgp.conf (if any), and set the key preferences
according to that list... if it doesn't do it, probably there is a good
reason for that... it is my newbie point of view about the subject.

  By the way... if I use setpref to set my encryption algorithms to
AES256 and AES128, does it mean people won't be able to use, let's say,
3DES to send encrypted messages to, even if they are incapable of using
AES? I mean... if I forget to add some algo, would I be making my key
less compatible with other OpenPGP software?
  I ask this question because, while maybe I would rather receive
messages with some algorithms, that doesn't mean I don't want to use
other algorithms if the preferred ones are not available... I figure the
answer is "no, the sender still can use the algo's you forgot to add to
your preferences list", but I want to be sure before doing any change...

   Well, since I made the question, I must agree with that point of

   However, it is true I should not give for granted I will always
receive messages using my preferences (and that is the reason why I
finally added the IDEA library to my GPG... just in case... but I don't
intend to use it). I almost forgot the cipher-algo command, since when I
saw it is a very good way to produce a message the recipient can't
decrypt... but well, without changing anything, there is always the
option somebody can send me a message using whirlpool...
   I am trying to say, while the cipher-algo thing was not what I was
asking for, it is not a bad thing to remember people, from time to time,
the sender can manage to send messages useless for the receiver...

  I had the intuitive idea about that could be the its meaning...
however, I missed the fact "cap" is also the short way to say
"capabilities". I am not against the use of abbreviated  words, but I
will need clarification from time to time, as I said, it was a problem
of lack of vocabulary ;-)
  Well, I wrote what I intend to use as default preferences, but before
modifying anything I wanted to ask opinions...
For encryption: AES256 AES192 TWOFISH AES CAST5 3DES (didn't include
Blowfish because I was told it is not supported by PGP, and also its
author says people should move to Twofish). I am not sure if Twofish
uses 256 bits keys, or shorter (according to wikipedia, it can use
different lengths of keys).
For hashing: SHA256 SHA512 SHA1 RIPEMD160 (I prefer to don't use SHA1
since it is not as safe as it was supposed to be, and since my key
doesn't expire, the idea is not having to alter it in shot or medium
time. SHA512 seems a bit oversized... but I suppose the sender will
decide what to use. I am not sure if to add the other SHA hashing algo's
since something with a length that is not 2^n looks a bit unusual to me...).
And for compression: ZLIB BZIP2 ZIP Uncompressed
What is better, to use S1 S2 S2 codes, or the names? I figure using the
codes would save a bit of space, and since I don't have to keep those
codes in my memory, it is not a problem for me to enter them that way.

  I will tell the true: because some of my likes and dislikes are not
based on rational arguments...
  Ok, let me say something on my behalf: in my experience, when
something does't work as well as expected, and people say "well... lets
do it 2 times, that should work", usually that leads to something that
works, but it is not as good as it could be... An example: I decided to
backup my private keyring in a remote backup... a free host. I put a
private folder, and encrypted the file 3 times, with different
encryption utilities, and different passwords. But I don't "feel" it is
the best solution... probably I should have stored them in a pendrive,
and store it in my grandparents house. Now, my keys don't control the
launch codes for ICBM, so I don't need more protection... but if they
were "important", probably I should look for a better solution.
  Well, if an expert says that, I don't have another choice than trust
it, until another expert says something different.
  Well... that resumes what I would expect from something designed to be
applied once, and "fixed" by applying it 3 times... but again, I admit
my expectation's come from an irrational base. If it was my job to
decide what algo to use for some serious thing, I would stick to the
hard facts... but it is not the case with _my_ key.
  If it couldn't do that, it would be deprecated... I know all the
encryption algo's provided by GPG are safe enough... but I can't use
them all... and if one of them is big, clumsy, ungainly, and with poor
aesthetic, that one will be the one I won't _prefer_ to use.
  The thing I dislike about "let's do it 3 times" is it was not designed
to be used that way... using it 3 times is the solution to the "it is
not secure enough" problem. In other words, I get the impression 3DES is
a "patched" DES. And other algos are not patched... or at least, not so
obviously patched (I can't be sure about if they are patched or not).
  But despite I don't like it, it is good to know the ultimate
compatible algo in OpenPGP is also the most secure of all...

  No, it was me who screwed it, by quoting the quote, but not providing
the link to the full interview. Of course the interview could have been
changed, but it looks "natural"... (mean, if they cut and paste, it is
not obvious)
(page 3 of the interview. If somebody wants to read the interview but
thinks tinyurl is not safe, search wikipedia for Twofish, and follow the
link for Blowfish, and look at the references).
  In fact, the interview is interesting, Schneier talks a bit about the
real security, and the feeling about security...
  I will try to read it, probably I will have better chances to
understand something that if I read _Applied Cryptography_
  Or maybe he was deprived of caffeine at that time, and forgot to talk
about AES... Anyway, from Wikipedia, I got the idea Twofish was not
chosen because it is a bit slower than AES with 128 bit keys (and
probably, at that time they thought these would be the most used keys),
but it is a bit faster with 256 bit keys... But it is just they idea I
got from an unreliable source of information... I use wikipedia to avoid
having to read a lot of high density information, and to get the main
idea about things...
  It is ok to have emotional reactions, as long as these reactions don't
break things or put yourself in danger...
  I don't think Twofish should be read-only, since it was a finalist in
the same contest where AES was elected... and by reading Schneier's
blog, it seems he still thinks it is safe... but of course, I just
looked at the most recent entry with "Twofish" word...
  I _suppose_, if we have different algo's for encryption, if one of
them fails, we would just need to modify a preference, and we can be
safe again (for a while)...
  Don't worry, I know the difference... and since I suppose you was
rational when you said any encryption algo included in GPG was safer
than we would need, I allow myself to do irrational choices... but just
because any choice is supposed to be safe enough.

  I was not intending to say 3DES suffers from that problem. In fact, I
don't have any experience with 3DES, and just about 5 months using gpg.
Also, I have said many times I am talking about a "dislike" not based in
a rational reason (sorry if I am being redundant there). So probably it
is a mistake to try to explain in a logical way something that is, by
definition, non based on logic. But since maybe I caused a wrong
impression, I will try to clarify a bit my point of view... the rational
  When people is lazzy and don't want to spend time and energy to make a
proper solution for a problem, and just take what they have and adapt it
in a sloppy way, they use to get solutions that are bulky, non
aesthetic, and with a lot of disadvantages... a bit like you described
the performance of 3DES. But these solutions need to be good enough to
be able to be considered "solutions". For that reason, I have a biased
feeling about solutions that seems to be done that way. I don't have a
knowledge deep enough on 3DES (on any encryption algorithm, I lack the
maths skill needed for that) to be able to judge it, and I don't intend
to judge it. But when I saw an article about 3DES, and I understood (or
_misunderstood_) it was just to apply DES 3 times, that arose the same
_feeling_ that I feel when I see a sloppy job. But it was just a
feeling, not a rational condemn to that algorithm, or to the people who
developed it. I _DONT_ think the developers of 3DES are (or were, I
don't even know if they are still alive) lazzy, or any other
adjective... these adjectives are for the people responsible of the
sloppy jobs I have seen, and all those jobs were about masonry (I talk
about building or fixing a house, not about the Society with the same
name), electric installations, and that sort of manual work.
  So I always knew my experience was not applicable to software, and if
I failed trying to point that, I admit my fault. I also knew 3DES is
good enough to be the default and must have algorithm in OpenPGP, so
despite any disadvantage it may have, it can't be a bad algo, or it
would have been deprecated, or at least, there would be advices about
avoiding its use if possible.
  One thing is to discover new way to apply something, because that
thing has many possible applications, and other very different thing is
to apply something a lot of times to so solve a problem, instead of
looking for a better solution. I will give an example:
  Once I saw a shelf attached to the wall by no less than 24 screws.
When the shelf was removed, the wall looked like it had been attack with
a screw-shooting machine gun. Sure, the shelf was firmly attached to the
wall, but it would have been better to use bigger screws, or maybe to
add "legs" to it to support its weight. Or maybe some other solution.
  But it is not the same than to discover a painkiller can also reduce
the risk of heart strokes.
  I don't know if the article I read was not clear enough about that
point, or if I failed to notice it. If 3DES is the application of a
theory that was not considered before, then it is not what I thought it
was. If 3DES is built using DES, as a wall is made using bricks, I don't
have anything against that.
  Software use to have errors, or bugs, and it is ok to fix them. The
problem comes when the hole that need to be patched is a triangle, and
the patch is a square, and you need to use a hammer to make it fit
inside the hole...
  I will make another comparison... lets suppose I build a house, and
after a while, I notice the door is not strong enough for my safety
requirements. I can replace it with a stronger door. Or I can get
another weak door, and nail it to the original door, to increase its
strength, even if now it doesn't follow the wall line, and also, since
all those nails made it a lot heavier, now I need to lift the door a bit
to be able to open or close it.
  Yes, but I figure these patches are carefully designed to solve the
problems without causing new ones. And if a bug is introduced, there are
efforts to remove it ASAP.

  That was never my intention, I always knew my prejudice was not
rational, and I tried to make that clear. But maybe I should have tried
harder. I used the terms "I don't like" instead of "it is not good",
because I know it is good enough to be in use. I didn't know it is
supposed to be the most secure algorithm available.
  Again, I was talking about "likes and dislikes", things that are
subjective, and not about "good or bad". I can say something like "I
don't like cola beverages, because when I was a boy, I was drinking
pepsi and I almost chocked and the bubbles came out from my nose". But
people would not think cola beverages are bad, just because of that
statement. By the way, I do like coca cola.
  True, it is not relevant to me, since I don't process large amounts of
data, so I don't count how many miliseconds does it need to do the work.
Anything that doesn't take more than 5 seconds is fine for me. And if I
just use it from time to time, I can gladly let it work for some
minutes. But there are speed comparisons between AES and Twofish, so I
suppose if people took the time to do the comparisons, it was relevant
_for them_. In that context, being slow is a disadvantage. But end users
want to use the software, not to make contests...
  No, I don't want to call them 'lazy', I was talking about the things
not related to software I have seen, done by people too lazy or careless
to think if there is a better solution to solve a problem... I really
tried to be clear at that point.
   Oh, well... I was not trying to opine, I just was trying to talk
about the impression I got from an article I read last year...
  I think it is pretty. You use the term 'overengineered'. I talked
about the absolute lack of 'engineering' in the shelf attachment
solution. The guy had a lot of these plastic things that are put inside
the holes in the wall, to hold the screws (screws and concrete requite
something in the middle), with 6 mm diameter. That size is good if you
want to hang a picture, or a telephone, but are too small for bulky
things like the shelf I was talking about. And the guy just used a lot
of them to solve the problem, instead of thinking if a bigger screws
would be a better option.
   Excellent, at least this discussion have made me to change my opinion
about 3DES. If I find the article I will read it again, and if I
conclude that I didn't misunderstood what is written in the article, I
will give you the link, so you can suggest the author what should be
changed. And it was me the one who misunderstood the content, I will try
to be more careful in future.
  Well, I didn't know that, I was thinking it was like the weak door
example... I was wrong.
  Then, it is not a "lets do it 3 times" solution, *in the spirit I
tried to communicate with these words*. Sorry if I can't explain it in a
clearer way. Maybe latter I can send you an example of what I was
talking about.

  Because the shelf had to be removed latter, and it was known from the
begging that it would have to be removed in a few years (I think it
lasted just 2 years attached to that wall). After removing it, the wall
would need be repaired (nobody likes to have a wall full of tiny holes
in the bedroom). And it is easier to remove 6 plastic fixations than to
remove 24 of them. But also, after removing them, you need to apply some
product to fill the holes, and make the wall to look like it as if it
has not been drilled. And finally, and maybe the most important thing,
is maybe one day somebody will want to attach another thing to that
wall, and product used to fill the holes doesn't behave like cement, so
probably they will need to avoid drilling too near to the previous
holes... and with a lot of holes, it becomes harder to find a good spot
to drill the new ones.

  Hello!
        I have not seen any reply to your question, so I will try to
help, but keep in mind I am have been using GnuPG for just about 5
months, so I am not an expert, and anything I say can be inaccurate or
  There are 2 ways to use GnuPG to encrypt a file (and you have a lot of
options for each way, but I wouldn't mind about that for now):
1.- By using Asymmetric Encryption. Usually, you encrypt the file or
message to the public key of the recipient. The recipient needs to use
his/her private key to decrypt the file or message. Since you said you
are new to GnuPG, I think you didn't have a key pair (_unless_ you have
been using PGP before moving to GnuPG, or maybe the sender of the CD
asked you to generate a key). In that case, you won't be able to decrypt
the file... you would have to ask the sender to encrypt it again for you.
2.- By using Symmetric Encryption. That is the traditional kind of
encryption we all know: you encrypt a file using a password, and the
same password is required to decrypt it (sometimes a file is used as a
keyfile, but I think it is unlikely this would be the case. Of course, I
can be wrong). Have you received a password to decrypt the file? (don't
tell me the password, just tell me if you have one).
   What is the extension of the file? the usual ones are .gpg or .asc,
but of course, the sender can specify another extension, no extension at
all, or he could have renamed it... But since you have problems, any
detail can help to troubleshoot the problem.
  I am not sure, since I am not good at troubleshooting GPG... maybe you
should install GPGshell and right click the file, go to GPGshell and
select PGP Packages, that should give you some info about the file...
  The null characters message puzzles me... maybe it was encoded using a
different set of characters? I mean, maybe the sender is using chinesse

  It seems there is a lot people busy, I have seen little traffic in the

but remember I am not an expert, and my answers are "as far as I know"
or "if I understood it right...". If someone else reply something
different, probably that is the good answer (and mine is the wrong one)...
  I know it... but I am still learning how to use it.
  No, are 2 different kind of signatures. As far as I know, there are 2
"families" of certificates/signatures. One is x.509 certificates, used
for SSL (to use https "secure" connections), these certificates allow to
sign files and encrypt data. Usually, they are issued by a CA (see
 for details).
Basically, there is an organization that has its own private key, and it
uses it to sign certificate request from people (or organizations). They
must verify the identity of the people requesting the certificate,
before issuing the certificates.
  If they have a good policy about how to verify these identities, and
they manage their key in a secure way (to avoid it being stolen), they
can make browser manufacturers to consider them trust worth, and they
will include their "root certificate" in the browser's list of "trusted
CA's". So, basically, if I sign a message with my certificate issued by
Thawte, your browser or email client will see my signature, it will see
it was signed by Thawte, and it will check if Thawte is in its "trusted"
list. And it will trust I am who I say I am, because it trusts Thawte.
  It is something like asking: "Dady, can I go to play with that man?
Yes, son, you can, because I know him, and I think he is not a bad guy".
  That is the kind of certificates OpenOffice needs to sign files.
Thawte issues free certificates for email encryption (and surprisingly,
they can sign files too, I just tried with mine, and it worked). The
only thing Thawte knows about me, is my email address, any other info I
gave them can be false, they didn't verified it (and for that reason,
they didn't include my name in my certificate, because they are not sure
if I told them the true). If I use their mechanisms to be verified, then
I could ask them to give me a certificate with my name on it.
  GnuPG works in a different way, and with a different kind of
certificates. There is no "daddy" saying whou you can trust, you must
verify the identity of the people by yourself. But if you trust one of
your contacts is who he claims to be, and if you trust he really cares
about other people identity before signing their keys, then you can
trust that people using keys signed by your contact, are also who they
claim to be. This is like asking your friends if you can trust somebody.
If they know him, and they trust him, you can say "the friends of my
friends are my friends too" and trust him... or you can say "my friend,
I know you very well, and I trust you, but I know you trust other people
too easily... so don't be offended, but I need more info before deciding
I can trust your friend".
  This is a very simplified explanation about how does this work, there
are a lot more things to know, but I think it is enough to notice the
difference between the 2 systems.
  Both kind of certificates follow a different standard, and they are
not compatible, so an OpenPGP key can't be installed to be used directly
with OpenOffice.
   But GnuPG can sign files, so you can write the document, save it, and
sign it using GnuPG. OpenOffice won't detect the signature, but you can
check it externally (using GnuPG) and be sure the file has not been
  I am not sure if that is true... The signature should be able to prove
the file was sent by the guy that holds that certificate... the problem
is to know if that sender is who he is claiming to be... If you don't
trust the CA that issued the certificate used to sign the file, you
can't trust the signature.
  Well, I can ask a free domain and a free host, and make an email
account like bankmanager at yourbank.co.cc and get a certificate issued to
that account, and the messages signed by that certificate will show a
good signature, since the signature is not broken... but if you take a
look at the signature, you should notice you real bank domain doesn't
end with ".co.cc", but with ".com", so you would know I am trying to
impersonate your bank manager... and that is the reason why the help
file ask you to read the certificate details, and to don't trust the
signature just because it is not broken.
  With GnuPG it would be harder to fake an identity, since the only
trusted signatures, are the signatures made with keys you, or the people
you trust to check identities, have signed. You would say "hey, nice
signature... but I don't know you, so go to scam someone else".
   Yes, sure... with so little system files in windows, it should be
easy to check then one by one to be sure they are not fake... since I
just have 5260 files in my system32 folder, supposing I need just 20
seconds to check them, it would take just 29,2 hours, without stopping
even to go to the bathroom... Sure, I can run an antivirus, but there is
no warranty it would discover the fake files...
  They do almost the same thing the GnuPG public key does, and since
your own certificates include the private key, they do, for you, almost
the same thing than your own GnuPG keys do. But they do it in a
different way.
  They would sign your certificate request (your x.509 compliant public
key). They also have OpenPGP keys, but I am not sure what do you need to
do to make them sign your GPG keys.
  I don't really know, I didn't even know how to make OpenOffice to use
my certificate to sign files... until I started replying this message,
and I checked the help file you talk about. Now I have already signed my
first document :D
  That is the list of valid companies that are supposed to verify
carefully people's identity before signing their certificates. CAcert is
not included by default in that list... and it is harder to get a
certificate capable of signing files from them than from Thawte, which
is included by default in most browsers...
  That is right, but you also need to import CAcert root and
intermediate certificates, because they are not pre loaded in windows,
or in firefox, or in opera... They are trying to be included in the main
browsers, but it takes time, effort, and money... and since CAcert is
  secring.gpg, pubring.gpg and trustdb.gpg. But I don't know where are
they located in your computer... I installed GnuPG with default options,
and it placed them in a different place than they where supposed to be
(according to some replies about the subject I have seen).
  I don't really know that one... you can export your key (for backup
purposes), or you can just copy the whole keyrings into the USB drive or
CD... if you want to do the second option, search for the files
secring.gpg, pubring.gpg and trustdb.gpg and copy them to a safe place.
If you want to back up just your keys, use Enigmail's Key Manager (and
create the revocation certificates too... BUT NEVER IMPORT THEM (the
revocation certificate) unless you really need to do it... there is no
confirmation, as far as I remember... and if you make a mistake and
import it, DONT UPLOAD IT to the keyserver, or your key will be revoked
and there is no way to un-revoke it. If you have a back up of your key,
delete the revoked key from your keyring, and import the backup. If you
don't have a backup... ask for help here, maybe somebody knows how to
"un-revoke" it in your keyring... but once you upload a revoked key to a
keyserver, the key is revoked and nothing will change that (unless the
server explode before being able to propagate the key).
  You need to add an UID to your key, and then upload your public key
again... for details about how to do it, RTFM... (just joking), to tell
you the true, I don't remember how to do it, but I bet I can get the
answer in 3 minutes.
  Ok, it should be as this:
c:\>  pgp --edit-key AE235FTZ0 (your key's number)
c:\>  adduid
     and fill the fields gpg will show you. To save the changes, you
need to enter the command 'save', if you just enter 'quit' the changes
won't be saved.
    I think maybe you would like to set the new UID as primary UID for
the key... but maybe it would be done automatically, since it would be
the most recent (the last added). If it is not done... this is just a
'guess', I have not tried it... but I think you would need to:
c:\>  pgp --edit-key AE235FTZ0 (your key's number)
c:\>  uid n (instead of n, put the number of the UID you want to be the
primary one)
c:\> primary
  Don't forget to 'save' (without the '' signs) before quit...
  Nobody was born knowing things (other than how to cry, how to drink
milk, and how to... well, that is a body function...). I have asked
almost exactly the same questions (and I hope I could recall the answers
correctly), about 3 months ago... and I am still learning the basic stuff...

Lawrence Chin escribi?:
  IIRC, you would need to import the certificate to your keyring, and
then upload the key to the keyserver... once you have done that, there
is no coming back... And I think if you do that, you will revoke the
whole key, with all its UID... the only time I imported a revocation
certificate, the key just had one UID, so I am not 100% sure about that.
And it was very easy to import it (indeed, I didn't intend to do it).
  Not upload, you need to import these files to your keyring... it is
easy to do. And yes, that is the meaning of "backup"... a backup is a
file or set of files, that allow you to restore the info to the state is
was before the disaster. Of course, if you modify one of your keys, you
need to export that key again, since the backed up file would not
contain the modification...
  Good question... I think it should be in the same folder where your
backup key files were exported... and the name should be something like
the one you showed us in the question n?1, something like "email address
(keyID number) rev.asc". If it is not there, it could be at C:\Documents
and Settings\YourWindowsUserName\  or maybe in the GnuPG folder, since
you was working at that folder when you generated the rev certificate.
  By the way, I use Enigmail's Key Manager to generate easily the rev
certificates. Also, if you want to revoke a key which you still control
(I mean, you have the key, and you remember the passphrase), you don't
need to use the revocation certificate, you can revoke the key using
Enigmail's Key Manager, or by using GnuPG command line, or using
GPGshell if you have installed it... the revocation certificate can be
used to revoke the keys even if you forgot the passphrase... so please
keep it out from reach of children ;)
  Yes, maybe we can answer the easy question, and leave the hard ones to
the experts...

  By the way, you can also revoke UIDs, but not delete them. So if you
have a key with a nickname, and you add your real name, there is no way
to go back to anonymity anymore, once you have uploaded your key to a
keyserver. That means you need to be careful, but other than that, is
not a big problem.
  My advice is you should not care about having too many signatures,
just focus in no losing the ones you want to have, and keyservers are
perfect for that. Each person is free to "clean" their copy of your

operates, when they upgraded, they moved to RFC 4880, and you are still
using an older way to do things...
   Maybe you should consider upgrading too... I don't know how complex
would that be for you. PGP 6.x is too old currently, and the standard
advice is to upgrade to something that supports the current standards,
but that advice is mostly for end users, maybe migrating would not be
trivial for your system

  Even worst, because the servers usually (there are exceptions) "talk"

   Anyway, I think the owner of the key signed by another key which
containst an illegal picture, would be safe, because he/she can't
prevent people from signing his/her key. The ones in problems would be
the keyservers themselves, and the admins and owners of these
keyservers, and the owner of the key with the illegal picture (who
probably lives in a place where he is safe). I suppose that could lead

  As a side note, I am not sure I like these proposals...
"Therefore when a public
    encryption key expires, an OpenPGP client MUST securely wipe the
    corresponding private key [4]."
  What if I want to be able to decrypt an old email message? If my
encryption key was compromised, and my messages were sniffed, I get no
advantage in deleting my copy of the key and the messages, the attacker
has his own copy of them, and surely won't delete them.
"2.2 Key surrender
    Before an OpenPGP client exports a private key as plaintext, the
    associated public key MUST be revoked and redistributed. A "reason
    for revocation" signature subpacket MUST be included in the key
    revocation specifying "Key material has been compromised" (value
    0x02)."
  That would prevent the storage a paperkey backup of the key, if the
key doesn't have a passphrase (which could be a good idea, if we assume
paper allow long term storage, and maybe in 10 years I won't remember
the passphrase I was using at the time I made the backup). Of course
that paper backup should be stored in a safe or something like that.

Hash: SHA256
Well, I was reading some old messages of this list (from 2004), and saw
something about it would be possible to steal the public part of a
signing subkey... the solution was:
"The fix is fairly simple conceptually.  Just have the signing subkey
issue a signature on the primary key."
 And, since I made a signing subkey, I'd like to know if I need to do
something to issue that signature, or if it was done automatically by
gpg. The key was created using gpg 1.4.9, so maybe that problem was
solved a lot of time ago... or maybe it still require some user action...

  Absolutely nothing.
  Assuming you are making your question to know what preventive measures
to take, maybe you can store _in a safe place_ a backup of your key
without a passphrase... but that would mean that anybody having access
to that backup can steal your key. Another option could be to remove the
passphrase, print the key with paperkey, store the printed backup in a
safe place (and don't forget some insects can eat paper). And set again
the passphrase of your key. The printed backup has some advantages:
1.- If stored in a dry and dark place, safe from fungus or insects, it
can last for a really long time.
2.- It is stored "off-line" (of course, it's a printed sheet of paper),
so no trojan can steal it.
3.- Probably, anybody that finds it, won't have any idea about what are
those funny numbers (of course, if "somebody" means "NSA expert" he
would probably recognise what the paper is, and would get an
_unprotected copy of your key!_)
  Since my concern is about being "hacked", but not about being
investigated by government, I don't need to hide my backups under a
stone in the middle of a forest... any backup safe from a computer
trojan, or a fire affecting my house is good enough for me. But maybe
that is not your case.

  I would:
1.- Make a backup of my keyrings and trustdb.
2.- Export my main key with all it's stuff.
3.- Delete my main key (and subkeys).
4.- Import the subkeys.
5.- Import the main key.
  If everything goes well, and you finally have all the stuff together,
I would:
6.- Export the mainkey and subkeys.
7.- Restore the backed up secring.gpg, pubring.gpg and trustdb.gpg
8.- Import the whole key (main with all the subkeys).
    And in future, I'd try to don't do different edit operations to my
key in different machines... just in case.

version of gnupg it installed, should be exactly the same thing than
gpg4win, except that it has been compiled for linux instead of windows.
  GnuPG comes in 2 flavours, there can be some differences. GPG1 is...
well, the "traditional" version, while GPG2 includes GPG1, plus GPG2 and
some tools. AFAIK, gpg4win implements GPG2, but you can ask the

  Yes, but, IMHO, the main advantage of having a paper backup, is it is
unlikely you would have a nasty surprise when you need the backup... a
CD can get damaged from one year to the next one... Maybe the room will
be too warm for them, or anything like that. I lost 10 CDs that where
stored in their boxes, and the individual boxes stored inside the
cardboard box (a 10 CDs package). They looked fine, but when I tried to
read the CDs, they where unreadable. And they where not exposed to
direct sun light.
  But a paper, maybe ink will turn grey instead of black, but it would
still be readable... and probably, if the paper itself starts rooting or
something, you will notice it before it's too late (or at least, you
have a good chance to notice it and be able to make a new backup).

Dr. Scott S. Jones escribi?:
  Well, as Robert J. Hansen already said, you must chose between 2
different standards: S/Mime and OpenPGP. Personally, I would rather use
OpenPGP, since I think it is more flexible, I can encrypt/decrypt text
in the clipboard, encrypt files before uploading them to an ftp... But
not every email client supports OpenPGP. Most people I know (including
me), use Mozilla Thunderbird with Enigmail addon to provide support of
GnuPG. Other people is using FireGPG, an addon that allows them to
compose encrypted messages using webmail interfaces (like Gmail). But if
you use FireGPG, beware of auto saving of draft messages, there is no
warranty they will really be deleted after sending the message.
  On windows, I would install GnuPG 1.4.9 for windows (available at
GnuPG website), or GPG4Win, which is GPG2 compiled for Windows (includes
GnuPG 1.4.x as its core files, plus GPG2.exe which is the one capable of
using S/Mime, _if I am not wrong_ about GPG2). Recently,
gpg4win-1.1.4rc1.exe was released, and if everything goes right, in less
than a week we should have the updated version, which includes gpg 1.4.9
as the core files, the most recent version of GPG2, and some useful
tools. The advantage gpg4win has, is it include a lot more things than
gpgp 1.4.9, but doesn't force you to install these things. Also, it will
include gpg in the windows path global environment variable, something
the user has to do manually with gpg 1.4.9.
   I would also install GPGShell GUI tool for gpg, it is awesome, and
let you to perform easily a lot of task, as encrypting/decrypting the
content of the clipboard, etc.
   About a good way to learn about OpenPGP (in special, GnuPG) is the
GnuPG Privacy Handbook, it is not hard to understand, and if somebody
has any question, they can ask here about it.
  By the way, do you have the chance to do face to face or telephonic
meetings with the people with whom you exchange sensitive information?
If you do, you can easily exchange OpenPGP keys fingerprints. If not,
maybe you would be interested in getting a digital certificate signed by
a trusted CA, and use it with S/MIME standard (it's a centralized
system, so you won't need to arrange face to face meetings). Or you can
do as I did, first I got a certificate from CAcert.org, and then used it
to prove my identity and exchange OpenPGP fingerprints (also, CAcert
signed my keys, which made thing easier). Also, that way, you would be
capable of using both standards.

  Yes, it's very possible, and each private key can have it's own
different passphrase. GnuPG knows what key to use to decrypt each message.
  Well, the advantage is you can decrypt all the messages encrypted to
your different keys without having to switch from one keyring to
another. The disadvantage is if your hdd crashes, all your keys crash
together. Of course, the idea is to have a backup.
  I started making 1 different key pair for each one of my email
accounts. But at some point, I added more UIDs, so currently 2 of my
email accounts can use either 1 key or another one. The remaining email
addresses are still "isolated". And I keep all those keys in the same

(Mozilla Thunderbird). My TB is configured to use 1 key when composing

  You can solve that problem by adding a freeform UID to the key (an UID

you can revoke the UIDs bound to email addresses, and add new UIDs for
new email addresses, without losing the old signatures (as long as you
don't revoke the freeform UID). But sometimes people will refuse to sign
an UID without an email address. Anyway, most of time, people won't even

  While I can't be sure about that, it looks VERY good...
  *I think* there is a good chance it is what you need. GnuPG uses the
files secring.gpg and pubring.gpg to store the private and public keys.
But the .ASC file extension is used to store files as "armored ascii"
format, which can be opened as a text file, printed, etc. But the
content of an .ASC file is still the same content it would have if it
was stored as .GPG (I mean, the format doesn't remove the info).
  Maybe you exported your whole private keyring as an ascii armored
file, and if that is what you did, you just need to import it back.
Please note I don't know how to export the multiple private keys into a
single .asc file, but if you just had 1 private key, probably it is
backed up inside that file.
I think the command you need is:
gpg --import secring.asc
  Let us know if you can recover your key.

      I while ago, there was some talk about Paperkey, and John Clizbe

Today, in other list, I saw a question about "what about windows users?"
and paperkey, so, I wanted to ask both David Shaw and John Clizbe, if is
 it OK if I send a copy of the compiled windows binary file to other
users... If I understood the license the right way, I can send it, as
long as I include the source code... but while I trust John didn't
modified the code before sending the compiled file to me, I am not sure
if I saying "I trust the binary file is true to the tarball, but just

  You are welcome ;)
  Yes, you can send messages to me, and I am sure other people here will
volunteer to test encryption with you. But currently there is a problem
with your key... keep reading.
  Well, when I install GPG, the keyrings are empty, so I don't think it
comes with a "demo"...
  There are several problems:
1.- I downloaded the key ECABF51D from keyservers, and it doesn't have a
 subkey for encryption purposes, so you can only sign and certify, but
not encrypt/decrypt.
2.- Also, the key lists in it's preferences, the encryption algorithm
IDEA (cipher algorithm 1). And GPG doesn't include that algorithm,
because it is not free. It seems it can be used for non-business
purposes, but I am not really sure about that, so if somebody sends a
message to you, and it is encrypted with IDEA, you would be unable to
decrypt it (but I think that is not your worst problem, since as long as
you don't get encryption capabilities -by adding a subkey capable of
encryption- I *think* people won't be able to send encrypted messages to
   You can download idea.dll and configure gpg to use it, but unless you
are sure you are not breaking the copyright... I am NOT sure about that,
I have read somewhere it was allowed to use it if you are not doing
business, but I am not sure about the reliability of the place where I
read that. Also, when I tried to find the company that is supposed to
hold de copyright, I couldn't find it on internet... (and since I was
just curious about it, I didn't keep searching).
  Last words: I am not sure if you should add a subkey first, and edit
preferences latter, or to edit pref first, and add the key latter...

  Mmm... it is strange, I think I found it on a keyserver, but it had

ask him about what does he think about that...
  No, most people don't use it, since it is not natively supported by
GnuPG, and there is that copyright problem... I installed it just in
case somebody sends a message to me using that algorithm, but I would
never use it to send a message, and I have not listed it in my
preferences... my keys don't list it, so the only chance somebody could
send a message encrypted with IDEA to me, is if the sender forces GPG to
do what it is not supposed to do (to use algorithms not supported by the

  Probably, but, as I said, I'd ask John about the subject first... he
can provide some advices about what to do with the old key, and what
kind of key you should generate (well, since it will be YOUR key, you
can generate any kind of key you want, but I mean, probably there are
some options better than other options...).

it's my ineffective attempt to promote the use of OpenPGP... I am still

  Sorry, I didn't fully answered your question... The purpose of
signatures is to prove messages have not been tampered in transit from
the sender to the recipient, but sometimes the signature can be broken
without any malicious attempt to modify the message... It also should
prove the message comes from the sender and not from somebody
impersonating him/her, but all it can prove, is the sender has control
of the key... I mean, if somebody steals my key, that somebody would be
able to use it to sign messages, but it would not be me the one writing
them... but as long as there are not legal or economical consequences,
I'd consider signatures as a proof of the sender identity...

  Hello!
        I am not sure if you got replies, so I'll reply now...
  Don't worry, GnuPG is available for windows.
    Go to the binaries section of that page (just scroll down), the one
you want is:
  GnuPG 1.4.9 compiled for Microsoft Windows.  (click on the FTP link)
  Probably you will need to add GnuPG manually to the path global
environment variable.
  I don't know how to do it, but surely there is a way to do it, since
there are third parties GUIs (like GPGShell and Enigmail).
  Well, the program comes with an user manual, that explains how to use
it from command line. And the site has links to HowTo's and other
resources. I think the usage of GPG is the same, no matter the operating
system you are using, but I can be wrong about that. The manual included
in windows binaries works fine (open it using WordPad, or notepad).

   For GPG users, there is an alternative, to add a signing subkey, and
to remove the main key, and work with the subkeys. The main key would be
stored in a safe place, and would only be imported to sign other keys,
or to generate new subkeys, as the old subkeys expire. That way, you
don't need to go through the whole process of exchanging keys each year.

  Well, there are tools implementing SSSS in Windows, but I think
different implementations are not compatible with each other. The only
open source implementation I have found is the one available at
  I was told the souce code is simple enough to make an updated version
for windows, but I lack the skill needed to do it, and the person that
told me it won't do it unless the organization in which we are involved
require the tool. So maybe the easiest way would be to install ubuntu in
a machine (maybe a virtual machine), install SSSS from ubuntu's
repositories, and use it on that platform.
  I think people would find SSSS a lot more reliable if GnuPG includes
(and maintain it) as a complement of GnuPG, that way we would know it
will be available as long as GnuPG is available, but I understand they
can't implement each and every tool somebody thinks desirable to have.
  Now, about splitting the public key, it doesn't make sense to me,
since the public key is, by definition, public, you don't need to keep
it secret or safe. What you MUST keep secret and safe is the private key.
  I took a look at PCI DSS v1.2.1, and found:
3.6.6 Split knowledge and
establishment of dual control of
cryptographic keys.
3.6.6 Verify that key-management procedures are
implemented to require split knowledge and dual control of
keys (for example, requiring two or three people, each
knowing only their own part of the key, to reconstruct the
whole key).
IMHO, it refers to the secret part of the key, not to the public part.
  When you say you are the encryptor, I suppose you mean you are the
party sending the information, which, at first sight, don't require to
handle private keys, unless you are also signing the message.
  If I understood it right, yes, GPG is not compliant because it doesn't
include an "out of the box" tool to archive that. But maybe we can be
creative and find a way to solve the problem.
  Private keys can be protected by a passphrase, and if the passphrase
is strong enough, _maybe_ the key will be protected with an encryption
stronger than the key itself. With that in mind, why don't we split the
passphrase, instead of splitting the key? That workaround looks fine _to
me_, but I'm not an expert, and I'm not an auditor of PCI DSS
compliance, so I don't really know if it would be a good solution.

  I'm not sure if I understood it right, as far as I know, you need to
have the public key of the recipient of the message before you can send
him an encrypted message. The recipient can decrypt the message even
without having the public key of the sender, that key is required just
in case of wanting to reply, or to check the signature of the message.
  I think downloading they keys one by one, is usually the correct way,
because most people operate with public keyservers, and of course, they
just want the keys of people they know. But that doesn't apply to your
case, since you have your own (private) keyserver.
  I don't know if there is a command to do that, and also, I know very
little about using GnuPG at the command line (I always use a GUI), but a
possible workaround could be if one user (probably an administrator)
download all the keys (one by one or whatever), and then export all the
public keys into a single file, which could be distributed to each user.
But then, there would be no need of the keyserver, except to keep track
of revocations.
  Maybe you can configure Evolution to automatically download keys when
  I hope someone else with more knowledge about the subject can help you.

  Well, there are graphical interphases to use GnuPG easily. Since you
said you pasted your key into a word file, I assume (maybe a risky
asumption) you are using Windows. My favorite GUI is GPGShell, but it is
not open source, so you can either trust or distrust it. GPG4win package
includes other GUIs, and these are Open Source, so it is up to you what
you would like to use, if any.
  With GPGShell, I just double-click the public key file, and it is
imported to my keyring.
  Well, I guess the most common format is an ascii enarmored file
(file.asc), which can be opened into notepad, or imported directly to
GnuPG (using either the command line or a GUI). As Simon Richter said,
you should check the key fingerprint with the key owner, to make sure
you have the right key, and that should be done using a "secure
channel", like a phone call (assuming you know the voice of the key
owner and can detect if someone else is trying to impersonate him/her).
Another option is to upload your key to a public keyserver, and then
anybody can search by email address or name or keyID, and download your
key. Of course, that way is even easier to upload a bogus key, so you
should check you are downloading the right key.
  By the way, once you have uploaded your key to a keyserver, there is
no way to remove it from the keyserver. Most people don't care too much
about that, but a few persons don't like their keys to be uploaded to
keyservers, so you should ask permision from the key owner before
uploading his/her key to anywhere. So, usually, the recomendation is, if
you sign a key, send it back to the owner, and let him/her to chose to
upload or not upload it.
  Don't worry, these things take time to be fully digested.

  The only stupid question is the one that is not asked.
  As far as I know, RSA keys required licence to be used, so GnuPG
favored DSA and Elgamal combination, since they were free. Finally, RSA
keys became free and got included in free software. So far, it would be
almost the same to use one or the other option, _but_:
  DSA keys used to have max size of 1024 bits, which by today standards
are too short. DSA2 standard allows bigger keys, but may cause trouble
with legacy software. IIRC, RSA has been around in free software for
longer time than DSA2, so it is less likely to have problems. Of course,
there are no guarantees you won't find somebody using a really old
implementation of OpenPGP.
  And there is something about hash algoritms and DSA, so I would chose
RSA and forget about it. As Robert J. Hansen said, the defaults are
good, so don't change them unless you know what you are doing.

match I want to import, or O for other, or F to finish. But if I enter O
or F, it just repeats the question, it doesn't finish the process. I
tried different characters based on English words I thought may have
been used in English version of GPG, and found 'Q' (for Quit) is the
right answer to finish the process and exit, but I don't know the
equivalent for 'other', nor what is it supposed to do.
      So, there is a problem with Spanish translation.

   I (but that is ME, just my opinion) would remove that 50 characters
long randomly generated passphrase. Chances are if you don't use it very
often, you will forget it, and then you won't be able to revoke your
keys. Or maybe, I would change it for a shorter password, easy to
remember, just in case somebody steals the rev-certs while I'm at the
rest-room (well, probably replacing my keys would require less time than
to change all my passwords).
  IMHO (but again, it's just my opinion), revocation certificates don't
need to be protected as much as your private keys. If somebody revokes
your keys, that's bad, and you need to make new keys. But that person
won't be able to sign things on your name or read your encrypted
messages. It's like if somebody cuts your credit card in half: you need
to replace it, but your money remains safe.

  I might be wrong, but I remember Bruce Schneier used thermodynamic to
show it is not feasible to brute-force a 256 bits key, because the
energy required to do it would be too much (like all the energy
generated by the sun for several years, or something like that), even
considering the computer used is fast enough, and doesn't lose energy as
heat. It was somewhere in "Applied Cryptography, 2nd Ed." (search by
"Thermodynamic Limitations" title). But of course, a flaw in AES would
be a very different problem.
  Now, I'm not advocating for the usage of 32,768-bit RSA keys (nor
tweaking GnuPG to allow 8,192-bit keys), but I was thinking... What is
the key length of the OpenPGP implementation of Twofish? (I put Twofish
as an example, because of the for-now-useless flaws in AES 256). If it
is 256 bits, and provided the algorithm doesn't have flaws (or given it
doesn't get as much attention as AES, the flaws remain undiscovered), we
would already have "the ultimate symmetric algo" available, so we might
want to use the strongest asymmetric size currently available.
  And a question: does the computation power required to factor RSA keys
increase in lineal or more-than-lineal way?

send dissidents to jail instead of defeating them in elections? How can
you tell government is not going to abuse its power?
  Not much time ago I read some criticism to... I think it was Nokia,
because they sold some equipment to Iran, which gave them the capability
to locate dissidents. And human rights activists blamed them for selling
the equipment. But from Iran's point of view, they are a legitimate
government, and they used the equipment to catch dangerous people. We
could debate about it a long time, and the only thing I can say, is I'm

  Based on Schneier's estimations in "Applied Cryptography, Second
Edition", I calculated breaking RSA 2048 would be between 1E7 and 1E9
times harder than breaking RSA 1024 (I divided the MIPS required to
break RSA 2048 by the MIPS required to break RSA 1024).
  I know the book is old, and the estimations might be wrong, but
still... there is a huge difference between breaking RSA 1024 (which so
far has not happened), and breaking RSA 2048. It's not like saying "it
would require 2 times more computing power", it's several orders of
magnitude harder.
  If RSA 1024 becomes breakable today, and after that factorizing keys
become 1000 times easier that it is today, and computers become 1000
times more powerful, they would still need at least 10 times more power
to break RSA 2048. Yes, a lot of if's, but still useful to give an idea
about how harder it would be.

  Well, somebody could think "if they made a 256 bits symmetric algo,
there should be a reason for that. And since if the asymmetric key is
broken, the message is decrypted, no matter how strong is the symmetric
algo, then it makes sense to use something equally strong".
  Now I think about it, AES-256 would be also an overkill, and the only
reason why we don't think it is a bad idea, is because we don't notice a
reduction in performance (with "normal usage") compared with AES-128.

  I am not familiar with command line, since I use a GUI (GPGShell,

encrypting the file only to the client's key, and you should encrypt it
to both your key and your client's key. You are asking GPG to sign with
your key and encrypt only to your client's key. I don't know how to ask
GPG to encrypt to both keys.
  A key fingerprint has 40 characters:
In my case, 388C1FBDBE9835D7BD02253B82121A454319410E. The last 16
characters at the right (in my example, 82121A454319410E) is the "long
Key ID". And the last 8 characters at the right (in my example,
4319410E), so that should clarify the mystery of the variable length of
IDs. But also, my key (as most key do) has a subkey, bound to it, which
is the key used for encryption (in my case,
3E497861B97C3E51244A61023EB64AF12E6CD89E, or 3EB64AF12E6CD89E, or 2E6CD89E).
 Maybe GPG is reporting it needs the encrypting subkey, instead of
asking the primary key of your client.

Hash: SHA256
Doug Barton escribi?:
  IMHO, the main key (used to sign other keys), is the most important
one, since you can add or revoke subkeys, but the main one, can't be
changed. If the key length chosen becomes unsafe, you should revoke the
key and make a new one, so I would chose a length with a larger security
margin, like RSA 2048 (by the way, RSA 2048 is the new default in
current version of GnuPG). IIRC, RSA 2048 is considered to remain safe
until 2030 (according to a wikipedia article quoting RSA estimations).
Of course that estimation may change.
  Well, if you want to store something encrypted, and it must remain
safe at least until 2030, maybe you can use that length, since it would
give you a larger security margin.
  Another thing to consider, is SHA is not as safe as it used to be, and
it it becomes easily crackeable, signatures issued using SHA can become
unsafe. So maybe you'd like to use SHA-256 instead of SHA-128. If I'm
not wrong, you would need to add the following lines to your gpg.conf
file, before generating your key:
s2k-digest-algo SHA256
cert-digest-algo SHA256
The first line tells gnupg to use SHA-256 instead of SHA-1 to mangle the
passphrases. I don't really know what is that mangling thing, but if the
idea is to replace SHA-1 with SHA-256, it can be useful. (I have a bad
feeling about telling other people to use that line).
The second line tells gnupg to use SHA-256 instead of SHA-1 for signing
other keys.
 But beware, older implementations of PGP maybe won't be able to read
SHA-256 (but probably, these implementations are outdated).

  Right, I was referring to SHA-1, and I confused the bit length of
SHA-1 with key length of AES.
  I saw another message, from Robert J. Hansen, saying indeed there is a
"SHA-128" unofficial denomination. Maybe I saw "SHA-128" while browsing
documents about SHA, and that contributed to my confusion. But anyway, I
was referring to the "normal" SHA algorithm.
  Good, now I know what is "password mangling" about.

  Good question, but, since the old key (unless it has expiration date)

  No, the comment could be useful in case somebody had the first (now
orphan) key, and now he has found the new key and wants to know which
one should he use.
  Let's think about the following case:
  Alice creates a key, get it signed by CAcert.org (she has validated
her identity in their WoT), and uploads her key to keyservers. Then she
loses her private key, make a new one, and get it signed by CAcert too,
and uploads it to keyservers.
  CAcert signatures expire 1 year after being issued, but until then, I
don't know if there is a way to make CAcert to revoke the signature.
  Then Bob finds Alice in PGP-Basics list, and wants to send an
encrypted message to her. He just knows her email address, and has set
CAcert's key as a valid introducer. He performs a search at keyservers,
and find 10 keys saying they belong to Alice. But only 2 of these keys
are showed as valid (the bogus keys have not been signed by a valid
introducer). But which one is the key he should use?
  Of course, he can send a clear text message to Alice, and she can tell
him which one is the right one, and then Bob would deactivate the orphan
key and use the good one. But a comment in the new key would not do any
harm, and would allow Bob to chose the good key without having to wait
for Alice's reply.
  They should be considered as noise unless these keys have been signed
by a valid (trusted) introducer.
  Indeed, the comment advice was just a complementary (and optional)
measure, the main response should be to get the certifications revoked.

  No, no, he didn't have access to any private key, he just had access
to YOUR public key.
  To encrypt a message, I need access to the public key of the
recipient, and since it is public, anyone can have access to it without
any security risk.
  To sign a message, I need access to my own private key.
  To check a signature issued by someone else, I need access to the
public key of the sender.
  To decrypt a message, I need access to my private key.
  To "prove" a message comes from somebody, the message should have a
signature, otherwise it can come from anybody with access to the
sender's e-mail account.
  To prevent people from signing things with your key (or reading your
encrypted messages), you need to use a good password (more likely, a
passphrase), and don't leave your computer alone while the password is
cached in memory (you can set a short amount of time for it to be
remembered, or you can clean the cached password before leaving).
  To prevent people from sending messages using your e-mail address, you
can either:
1.- Protect your windows account with a password, and never leave the
computer with your session open.
2.- Don't let Thunderbird store your e-mail account password (so you
would have to enter it manually each and every time you want to use the
e-mail account... very inconvenient).
3.- Protect Thunderbird's password database with a Master Password, and
close Thunderbird each time you leave the computer alone.
  Keep in mind that, according to OpenPGP point of view (if I understood
it right), your identity is checked by your signature, not by the e-mail
account used to send the message.

  Yes, something like that. That's why I installed something supposed to

If it works as expected, I would get a warning about trojan.exe trying

it, and making a rule from my decision to prevent future warnings about
the same thing.
  I'm not requesting that feature, I don't need it, but it won't bother
me if somebody decides to implement it, as long as it can be disabled.
Also, since software is always changing, many times in annoying ways
(I'm _not_ talking about GnuPG), probably soon or latter I'll have to
get used to a confirmation screen where there was none in the previous

  Well, you can create a key for membership validation. Of course, that
won't be the usual usage for a key, but the nice thing about OpenPGP is
your group defines the policies for it. So a signature from that key can
mean the user is a member, and also he has been validated. The other
members of the group could sign the new member's key (or not), and once
the signature is revoked, the member is no longer a member, but
signatures issued on that key will remain. If somebody didn't want to
sign the member's key, probably also won't want to maintain secure
communication with him after he left the group.

  I don't know about that, but that is what GPG is for. Any mail server
we don't control might be scanning documents, and if they don't do it,
it might be done elsewhere (have you heard about Echelon? I don't know
if that thing exists, but a lot of people thought it was possible for
them to "read" your emails).
  Fortunately, we have GPG, and Gmail provides SMTP, so it is really
easy to setup thunderbird, install GPG, and nobody at Google will be
able to read your messages (if you can make your correspondents to use
GPG too).
  Again, I don't know, hotmail knows where I live (or at least it knows
the block of houses where I live, they have 1/6 chance or so to drop a
bomb in the right house), I had to provide my postal code. Gmail knows
my phone number, but that was optional when I provided it (I've heard
now it is mandatory, to prevent spammers creating accounts). Still, all
of them could be involved in nefarious acts, and none of them will admit
it, or provide statistics about their nefariousness. But one of them
provide POP3 and SMTP, which allows you to use GPG or S/MIME for free,
the other 2 charge for those services (or used to charge, last time I
checked, that may have changed).
  Talking about insecurity of webmail apps, probably (but I don't have
numbers about it, it's just my guess) the main problem is accessing to
them using compromised computers.
  And what do all this have to do with GnuPG? Nothing, but all started
with a spamm message received from the compromised account of a member
of this list. And since compromised accounts is something that worries
many of us (nobody want his/her own account to become compromised), we
replied and talked of general stuff. Probably this thread dies today due
to lack of interest.

  That's very alike with what some people said to me at truecrypt forum,
when I asked if there was a way to "disable" deniability if I don't need it.
   They said if somebody finds 7-zip in my computer, they could suspect
I sent compressed and encrypted messages to somebody (7-zip uses AES for
password protected compressed files), it is just they have not found
records about it -not yet, but there is when the lead pipe comes into
play. Or I could be using some unknown steganographic software (which I
might have shredded or ran from the usb drive I "lost" last year) and
the pictures of my family I uploaded to Facebook have hidden messages
about an evil plan to take over the world.
   And keep in mind in UK it is a crime (or fault, or... whatever they
call it, something you must not do because you will receive stick
instead of carrots) to have an encrypted file and not be able to decrypt
it. So if somebody sends an encrypted message to faramir.ch but misstype
it and send it to faramir.cl, then I would be already toasted (if I was
in UK).
   But I DO get Robert's point, and what worries me, it's we might get
into troubles even if we don't have deniability, we just need to be
linked somehow (maybe by unwanted email messages?) to some evil person.
And now I think about it, I have an orphan PGP key, I lost the secret
key and it is still on keyservers, unrevoked, and without expiration
time. Somebody could infer I have not revoked it because I still use it,
and that I have the secret key stored in a flash drive somewhere. All
Alice needs to do, is to encrypt something to that key and send it to
the email address of that key, and then how can I prove I'm not hiding
the key?
  It seems she has been trying to evade paying taxes and to cheat her
husband since a long time ago, according to some crypto articles.
John Gordon?s After Dinner Speech: Now most people in Alice?s position would give up. Not Alice. She has
courage which can only be described as awesome. Against all odds, over a
noisy telephone line, tapped by the tax authorities and the secret
police, Alice will happily attempt, with someone she doesn?t trust, whom
she cannot hear clearly, and who is probably someone else, to fiddle her
tax returns and to organize a coup d?etat, while at the same time
minimizing the cost of the phone call.

  Yes, but the default setting of GnuPG is not encrypt to untrusted
keys, so the first thing a newbie might do is to sign the keys of people
providing support in the list. After all, "trust all" doesn't sound any
  And it might be a good reason to issue a local signature, after all,
after reading some messages, we might want to "mark" your key as a key
belonging to somebody that provides advices we can trust. But local
signatures is something we don't learn on the first day.
  Yes, that would add more "noise" to your key. People could interpret
it as a signal of distrust, instead a "neutral" signal.
  As long as you write in support lists, I think that key would be

  Probably the idea is to avoid bruteforce at all costs, because if you
have to do that, you might be bruteforcing an 8 characters password for
more than 50 years (if mixed lowercase, uppercase, numbers and symbols,
and you just have 1 home computer dedicated to the task).
  Maybe we should just pick a "good password", hash it a couple of
times, and use that hash as the real password... we could carry the
hashing tool in a flash drive.
  Right, limiting the attacks make even 4 pins codes secure, if the
account becomes blocked after 3 wrong attempts. But that won't protect
your password database if it falls in the wrong hands, or your GPG
private keys. And to say "that's a server problem, fix the server" is
wrong, because it will quickly become an user's problem if the password
is cracked, and the user uses the same password for different things (as
a lot of people do).
  I was checking how much time would it take to bruteforce a SHA-1 8

that is not the plain text password, it may be an encrypted file, or a

so far I have not seen a site with the complete set for MD5 (maybe I

  The good thing is we are not forced to chose words just from English

vulnerable to a complete rainbow table for SHA-256, but if such rainbow
table exists at all, then we are all toasted, no matter what password we
use, it would still be found.
  I don't know the storage space needed for the whole key space of
SHA-256, but I guess it would be huge (maybe not feasible).

  Indeed. In fact, I keep some passwords on paper, just in case I can't
use my password manager (like the password to access the site where I
stored the password manager database backup. It doesn't include the
passphrase to open the backup, just in case).
   By the way, I just found something interesting: an extension for
Firefox, to make different passwords for each site, but all of them
based on a single "master password", so people just need to remember 1
password, and yet knowing the password for 1 site won't grant the
attacker access to the other sites.

"well... why did you sign it? there is no title in this paper, it
doesn't say assistance record... now I can write anything I want, and
you already signed it! What if I write 'petition to fire the dean'?"
  Of course the teacher wrote the right title on the sheet, and no harm

to you. So, somebody could encrypt a different file to your public key,
and replace the encrypted file in the untrusted drive. You would be able
to decrypt it, and depending on the content of the file, maybe you would
not notice it is not the original file (imagine it is a list of email
addresses, with dozens of addresses, you would not notice if one is
missing, or if there is one extra address).
   A signature would let you know easily if the file has changed.
   But I'm not saying you should sign it, it is up to you. Princess Leia

  I think you are wrong about that. All the user needs is a properly
configured portable install of GnuPG (and very likely, an easy to use
GUI, because if Allice can't understand WOT, probably using CLI won't
make her happy at all).
  The "group manager" (from now on, the administrator) has a key, used
to sign the member's key (as Robert explained in the message from july
31, about using Thunderbird+Enigmail). Gpg is configured to trust
Administrator signature, probably her own signatures, and nothing else
(so, it will be a very short WoT). If she encrypts a file to a public
key, either:
a) Gpg sees the key is signed by the administrator, and allows the
encryption. Allice doesn't have to know about the internal magic in
this process.
b) Gpg doesn't find the administrator signature, and rejects the
recipient's key as not valid. Allice doesn't need to know what does it
mean, she just need to know "if GPG doesn't let me do this, I must not
do this". Of course, if all they keys she has available came from the
software provided by the administrator, this will never happen.
  Then the end user will never have to bother about what is a WoT. GPG
and the group manager will handle that part. End user just need
updated public keyring.
  I have GPG with GPGShell on my USB flash drive, and I can encrypt,
decrypt, and generate keys quite easily. Of course I can do a lot more
things, but I'm not forced to do any other thing. And since GPGShell
is JUST a GUI, that means GPG can do the same things from command
line, and unlike GPGShell GUI, it is available for windows, linux, etc.
  Now I already said that, I must also say I don't enter my private
key passphrase in a computer I don't trust. In fact, I don't remember
if I ever used my portable gpg, other than to test if it works. I
carry it with me just in case I go to visit my father, and for any
strange reason, I want to decrypt a file I have at my 4shared account.
I know his computer is probably safer than mine, since he uses it just
for work, he doesn't install stuff on it, and so on.

  You are welcome, lets add more comments.
  Clicking a couple of buttons on a GUI usually is easier than
remembering a command with 1 or 2 options plus 2 or 3 parameters.
Selecting a recipient from a list is easier than remembering and typing
the ID of the recipient. I'm not computer illiterate too, but a lack of
GUI would make gpg usage very uncomfortable for me.
  Yes and no. If the group manager configures the software, and Alice
doesn't modify config files, GPG should prevent her from taking wrong
turns. Getting people's public keys is easy, but making GPG to accept
them as "valid" keys is not that easy. You need to either sign them, or
to modify config file to skip GPG's decision. There are several WoT
models available, and if the Group Manager chose an strict one, and
Alice doesn't sign keys or modify the config file. It is possible to
remove Alice's primary key from her keyring, so she can't sign other
people's keys, even if she wants to.
  In other words, if the software is properly configured, taking a wrong
turn would require parking the car and using a wrench to remove the
guard rail. So Alice would not take a wrong turn by mistake.
  Since she is already going to use security software on unsecured
computers, I don't know how much confidence she should have on it, but
that is another matter.
  Well, it was you the one that said Alice doesn't have the time to
learn about WoT and other stuff. I tried to say GPG can be configured to
don't let her make wrong decisions (she can't take wrong turns). But
that requires Alice won't attempt to disable safety measures, because if
she does so, then she will be in a road with a lot of possible turns
with banners she doesn't know how to read.
  Well, considering she will be using insecure computers which no amount
of encryption can make safe, maybe she should respectfully decline to
participate in the activities of the group.
  The configuration Robert suggested to you means the WoT is reduced to
"keys approved and provided by the Group Manager". Any other key Alice
might find would be considered as "invalid" and the software would
refuse to encrypt messages to those keys. In other words, there is no
WoT, there is a vertical single-link chain of trust, because the only
person that can add keys to the allowed recipients list is the group
  In other words, her USB stick must look like an unformatted storage
unit? If that is the case, no GPG based software can do that. Whatever
software you use to encrypt files will produce FILES as output. And
files can be seen when they are stored in a drive, even if you can't
know what is that file about.
  What you would need is an encrypted drive, that can make an USB stick
to look as empty, without even a filesystem on it. But that would be
suspicious by itself, because USB sticks come formatted from the
factory. If you want that USB stick to look like it is ready to receive
files, but otherwise empty, and filled with random bits (but full of
information if you enter the right password), then I don't know of
anything capable of providing that capability.
  Truecrypt can encrypt the whole USB drive, but as I said, each time
you plug it on a computer you will get the message "the drive doesn't
have format, do you want to format it now?". And also, you can't run
truecrypt portable on a computer if you don't have administrator rights.
  There is also a risk in how you jettison those programs. Currently
even "secure wipe" is not guaranteed to work, maybe you can corrupt the
files, but some parts may remain. To make sure nothing can be recovered
from a drive, you need to encrypt it before adding files to it.
  If Alice will get a CD with the program files on it, then that CD
can have a "live CD" operating system on it, plus truecrypt (to mount
the encrypted USB drive), and GPG (you can place encrypted files
inside an encrypted drive, in case you later want to send them as
email attachments or whatever). But the USB drive will still look

you decide to use Truecrypt, you must also be aware you can have a

show what does she have in the hidden partition, even if she has not
created one. Nobody can prove there is a hidden partition, but you
can't prove you don't have one, so beware of bamboo needles.

   Maybe "Bridge over troubled waters"? (I'm joking)
   IMHO, the main trouble probably is people don't feel the need to
protect their privacy. If they don't feel that need, why should they
bother in learning, or even asking about privacy software?
   My opinion is NOT based on studies, but on the answers my techno
savvy friends and relatives gave me when I told them about GPG and x509.
   Maybe we should dress in transparent clothes, and say "we don't
have anything to hide" if people ask us why are using that clothes. It

  Sure, as long no moderator gets pissed off, I think it is good to
discuss a bit about the "why" from time to time. Of course, the list
is devoted to discussing the "how".
  Well, sure, but there are some other instances that are unrelated to
freedom, like sharing you baby pictures... Or the increasing cases
when a woman sends a picture of her in underwear to her boyfriend, and
the picture ends on the news, causing her to lose her job. While we
can argue the women did nothing wrong, and the one that must be
punished is the person that disclosured a private picture, well, the
fact is given the nature of internet, if you don't want Eve seeing
your pictures, you need to send them encrypted somehow. Even if Eve is
the only unauthorized person that saw the picture, one unauthorized
person watching the picture is already an undesired case, even if the
picture is not published anywhere.
  I think it is very likely it was because everyone was dressed... I
mean, clothes are not transparent, and are very useful to keep people
warm. It also protects the body against scratches (if you are a
caveman, surely the walls of your "house" are not soft).

  What would happen if you start reading your daughter's diary
everyday, but never let anybody catch you reading it? And you are
careful to don't talk about what you've read, or take actions that
could hint you have read the diary. Your daughter will never know you
read it. What happens with her right to privacy? She is still
exercising it, she writes on her diary everyday.
  The same thing applies to email messages, we expect only the
intended recipient will read it, we send them everyday. And yet, we
don't know if we have privacy or not, until something we sent is
published somewhere AND goes viral. But since we are not celebrities,
it is unlikely what we write will go viral, even if we send nude
pictures, it is unlikely we will ever know someone already saw them.
And by sending more and more email messages, we won't make that change.
  So, in order to enforce our right to privacy, we use a tool to make
it really hard to break our right to privacy (a subpoena is very
likely to make us disclosure our messages, if we don't have anything
to hide). That tool is encryption, and it doesn't only enforce our
privacy right, it also make us aware about people trying to take away
that right from us, because the one trying to take away that right,
first would have to take away our right to use encryption, or force us
to install some backdoor on it.

  Uh... well, that brings in another problem: how does Allice get
Bob's key or symmetrical password to encrypt the messages?
  Currently I don't even imagine what are the expected use cases
software must allow.
  Maybe I misunderstood the description of those on the road
computers. It may have been my fault, but I got the idea they would be
computers like you can find on coffees, or maybe libraries. If the
don't have permanently installed software (not even operating system),
then it is very likely they won't have malware on them. Unless Mallory
suspect Allice might use one of these computers, it is unlikely she
would install malware on the bios, or to use hardware devices to
tamper the computer.
  Then, Truecrypt, if Allice can get admin rights on the computers she
use. But only IF she is sure to don't be mistreated for the possession
of an unreadable USB stick.
  Then Allice must evaluate if the possession of an encrypted USB
stick can make her employer to suspect she is involved with something
he doesn't approve.
  Remember:
- - Encryption: Eve knows you have something there, but can't read it.
- - Steganography: Eve doesn't know you have something there, but she
might be able to find it if she looks very carefully. And if she finds
it, she can read it (unless you combine steganography with encryption.
But then you lose the benefits of steganography and you not only have
encrypted messages, you are also trying to hide the fact you have
encrypted messages...).

  Right, that was my point. From your previous message, I got the idea
you suggested if we want to use buses, we must use them, if we want
privacy, we must send clear text messages and claim "don't read
them!". But it can only work if we get aware about people violating
our rights. With email messages that is not the case (unless people
disclosure things they saw on the messages).
  Ok, my fault, I was talking about privacy and not about her rights.
  Well, what should she do to ensure her privacy is respected and not
violated, if she can't know if somebody is reading her diary?
  I can leave my passwords on a piece of paper next to my screen, I
know my mother won't read them, and certainly she won't use them. I
know her and I trust her. But I don't know the guy sitting with a
laptop on the next cafeteria table, I don't know the administrators in
my ISP, and I don't know the path my email messages will follow to
reach the recipient's email box, so I don't have any reason to trust
that people. And since the email can be read at several points, by
several people, even if I see the content posted somewhere, unless I
can track the person that posted it, there are many possible Eves, I
can't know which one intercepted it, so I can't sue anybody. So my
options are to encrypt my messages, or to assume they can be read and
I must not send passwords or other sensitive data.
  I agree. Maybe I made a mistake comparing her diary with email
messages, since her diary is at her home (no strangers should be able
to enter the house), while emails are "out there", you don't even know
who can have access to them.
  Yes, my fault, I was talking about privacy.

  There may be several reasons for that, and I'd like to ask about
them to the friends that, being capable of using GPG, have said "no, I

they use envelopes to keep all the paper sheets together. And I don't

would say "but the mail-man can't know there is a PIN inside my
letter, why would he open the envelope?".
  Ok, maybe they trust mail office doesn't open envelopes. They have
too many letters and too little time, and no interest on reading
letter. But email messages don't go straight from your hand to
mail-man's hand, they have to travel a bit before reaching the mail
server, and if you are using Wi-Fi, anyone in router's range can take
a look at it. If we add the fact Eve doesn't even have to re-seal the

  I don't think that is anybody's nightmare. After all, many of us are
not "masters of cryptography".
  Right, but it doesn't require high technological skills or a degree
in computer science to become an initiated. It can be explained in 20
minutes, while you drink a coffee. Manuals are long and sometimes hard
to understand, because they must cover a lot of information, and list
all these options we will never use (but are still there, because what
I don't use is a must-have for other people). Just stay with us a bit,
and soon you'll find yourself transformed into a GPG initiated.
  Well, but it is. It is an almost impossible to open envelope, but
encrypted email still have the recipient's address, and the info of
the sender, at plain sight.
  That is also very true, Eve is probably very close to either the
sender or the recipient. Unless we are talking about NSA, CIA, or Men
in Black, but if that is the case, then using cryptography is only a
small part of the protection measures.
  Or even better, attach the armored file to the message, and then you
don't even have to worry about html stuff messing it.
  As a thunderbird user, I don't find it buggy or slow. At least, it
didn't use to be slow.
  Not sure about the faster part, you have more steps to follow to
send a message. But it still can be done. And as you need to carry
your encryption tools with you, you can also carry a portable install
of Thunderbird+GPG+Enigmail. Well, not sure if GPG2 will run in
portable mode, but for a while we can still use 1.4.x branch
  Lol, it is not like that. It is we are talking about encryption and
why except us -the paranoid guys- the other people don't use it. It is
not about education level, intelligence, or anything like that, in
fact, if we were looking down at people, we would be saying "they
aren't capable of using this stuff", instead of that, we are talking
about "why don't they use it? How can we make them use it?".
  Initiation? I'm lost now... I came here, joined the list, read a
bit, made some questions, tried GPG, left a orphan key... and somehow,
now I'm a GPG user. And to think it all started when a teacher said
"well, this is my public key, your assignment is to send an encrypted
message to me, that is the link to PGP's site". And of course, I
thought "isn't there a free version?"
  By the way, some years ago I went to a CAcert assurer's meeting. It
was on a coffee shop, no basements involved.
  It used to be. You can still get the portable version.
  Unfortunately, it really depends on your needs. But there is hope:
the standard answer here is "most people should stick to the
defaults". There are even some straight forward wizards to set it up
and generate your key (like enigmail's wizard).
  Options are more complex, but people with unusual needs should know
they have to devote more time reading manuals, after all, they already
devoted some time to discover they have unusual needs.
  Well, but remember email encryption is not about anonymity, it is
about privacy. Pretty Good Privacy, not Pretty Good Anonymity. Sure,
some people wants both, but that is out of our scope.
  Until very recent times, GPG branch 1.4.x windows binary was easy to
find, and could be run in portable mode. Probably there will be (or
already are?) packages offering portable Thunderbird+Enigmail+GPG combo.
  I think you are following stereotypes a bit too much. You imagine
people here are fit for the "Revenge of the Nerds" movie casting.
   Well, we are the Iluminati, our Order comes from the time lay
people used to live in caves, while we already had cable TV. Bazinga!
  Well, I use it in a vain attempt to make people aware about there is
something called OpenPGP. Also, because the first time I found spam
messages sent... by me to me, I was very worried about how my email
box had been compromised, I changed password, ran every anti-malware
tool I could find, and so on. Then I learned anybody can fake that. No
compromise at all, the spammer just crafted a message that to me,
looked like a message sent from my email box. So I said "fake this,
M.F.!" and started signing my messages.
  By the way, I caught you. You say you are an outsider, yet you know
about GPG, Thunderbird, Enigmail, you know they can be portable, you
know about gpgp4win -and it has its own mailing list, so usually it is
not mentioned here-, you know how easy is to encrypt text on a plain
text editor with encryption capabilities and paste ascii armored text
on the webmail composer. You talked about TOR, and you know the
password strength is related to the entropy it has. You know xkcd

  I don't know why do you say security through obscurity. Private keys
can be stored encrypted, so even if somebody steal them, the thieve
can't use them. That is security through encryption.
  A hacker will know what key he needs to open a file, because the
encrypted file say it, unless the sender selects hide recipient's key
or something like that. By default, the file say the ID of the key
required to decrypt it. But that is a different thing, and has nothing
to do with storing the keyring inside a Keepass database.
  I bet it is, as long as that 45 characters passphrase is not
something that could be found on dictionaries, or combining dictionary
words. But probably it is an overkill. Anyway, Keepass has a built in
password strength estimator, measured in bits. I don't know what is
the criteria to measure the strength, but I know it is not only based
on the characters used, it also include the order used (once I was
testing it, and swaped 2 characters, and the strength increased). If
your password's strength is 128 bits or more, it won't be feasible to
bruteforce it (probably the infeasible level is reached with less bits
too, but I don't know where is the limit). Of course, if it is
vulnerable to dictionary attacks, then you are toasted.

  Indeed. But, AFAIK (and I can be wrong), private keys are stored
individually encrypted (lets assume the use encrypts them all) inside
the private keyring. Each one can have a different passphrase. Then
you take that keyring and encrypt it using... lets say, Twofish algo,
with a different passphrase. In that case, you would be encrypting a
different file, not the individual private key, so it might be at
least equivalent to using salt to make the file change.
  Anyway, do you know about any list of "compatible" encryption
algorithms? I mean, pairs that work well together.

  If I even saw a reputable reference, I forgot it. I know TrueCrypt
can stack up to 3 different encryption algorithms, but that is not the
same as if Schneier, Shamir or that kind of professionals say it is a
good measure. I know Schneier adviced to be careful, because you don't
know if you will improve security or decrease it, but that was a long
time ago, maybe now they know a bit more, but if they do, I could not
find a reference.
  Now I found this article, with some references to papers:
  Probably because some software offers the option to do it, it would
be good to know what to avoid, other than "avoid everything".
  In that case, it might make a sense to, lets say, compress and
encrypt a file using winzip, and then compress and encrypt it using
7zip, in case one implementation fails, the other might hold. Or in
the case of the original question, storing the private keyring inside
a keepass database. If there is a bug in GnuPG, maybe keepass will
hold. If there is not a bug in gpg, then it doesn't matter if keepass
is bug-free or not.
  It might make a sense using cascade encryption in truecrypt, just in
case there is a bug in the implementation of one of the encryption
algorithms. But if the bug is elsewhere, since it is the same program,
the bug would affect both ciphers, and there is no gain in using cascade.
  True. If we combine 2 different systems (lets say, winrar and
keepass) would avoid the danger of more bugs, but of course, won't
help with the increase of keys.

  Not right, if your secret key is protected by a passphrase (or
strong password), it doesn't matter if the attacker know where to find
it. Actually, the attacked is very likely to know where it is, since
probably it will be at the default folder. But finding it doesn't mean
he can USE it, without the passphrase, it is just a "soup of bits".
  Most of us want to keep our keys away from other people, and also
keep them protected by a passphrase, in case the key falls in the
wrong hands. The attacker needs 2 things: the key and the passphrase.
It is a matter of making things harder for the attacker.
  Don't forget there can be attacks with dictionary and mutators. Of
course, you can increase mutators until the attack becomes infeasible
too (what is the point when a dictionary attack with mutators become a
bruteforce attack?).
  Anyway, a good password should include uppercase and lowercase,
numbers and special characters. One of each of these forces the
attacker to increase the key space (even 1 special character forces
the attacker to include them in the attack). Of course, there may be a
sub-set of special characters known as "most used special characters".
And of course, make it long enough a bruteforce attack is infeasible
for your adversary. And what is infeasible for your adversary? Depends
on your threat model.

  Anyway, one reason to cascade the 3 algorithms might be: Serpent,
because it is the most secure. TwoFish, because it might lack the
vulnerabilities AES has, and because we might be affraid Serpent was
not implemented right. And AES, because it is the standard, and no one
gets fired for chosing AES. Now, if we consider Serpent was rejected
because its lack of speed, the 3 algos together must be like an

  Same here, any attack (other than thief) on my machine would come
from Internet.
  Only your private key can generate the revocation certificate,
Keyservers don't have your private key. After the revocation
certificate is generated, anybody can import it to your public key and
upload it to keyservers... remember rev certs must be capable of
revoking a key in case the private key is no longer available. So we
think probably somebody had access to your key, or to a backed up rev
cert. You say there was not an already generated rev cert, so it is
very likely your computer has a trojan on it.
  By the way, how long was your private key? 1024 bits? Or less?
because if it was a 512 bits key, it MIGHT have been factorized.
  Just in case, I keep my master keys off-line, only the subkeys are

  You define yout policy about what do you check when you sign a key
(or an UID, after all, you sign UIDs on a key, not the key itself). So
somebody might check email address and name of the key owner, and
ignore the comment, unless it is false (like the comment sayind "USA
President"). Others might don't care about the comments at all.
  I think you must make the new UID primary UID before being able to
delete the old one, but not sure about it. The worst thing that could
happen is to get a message saying "you can't delete your primary UID"
or something like that.
  If the key is not signed and it is not on keyservers, just make the
new UID, set it as primary, and delete the old one. If the key is
available at keyservers, then revoke the old one instead of deleting it.

  Well, I can carry my photo-Id stuff with me to a keysigning party,
but I don't have any document to show I own my email address. Some
people solve that by sending the signed key, encrypted to the
recipient's key, to the email address. If the person doesn't control
the email address, the person won't get the signature. If the email
owner doesn't have the key, then he can't open the signature.
  Some people even adds what it is called a Freeform UID, which
carries Name, Comment, but no email address, that way, if they change
their email provider, signatures collected on that UID won't be lost
(you should revoke the UIDs that include an email address you no
longer can use).
  Well, that depends on the technology used to make the passports.
  That depends on what do you want to achieve. Some people wants to
know which is the real key of a person (binding the key to a name),
some others want to make sure they are sending stuff to the right
person, but don't care about who is that person (they bind the key to
an email address, or to a nickname). That is the good (and for some
people, the bad) thing about OpenPGP, your signatures have the meaning

  We can use RSA 2048 and wait until something stronger is available,

  CAcert requires face to face meetings, since we (yes, I'm an
assurer) must check the government issued ID and try to figure out if
it has been tampered. Then we must compare the picture with your face,
to make sure you are you, and not someone else with your ID.
  But the purpose of getting a signature in your key is to:
1.- allow the person that issues the signature to trust your key validity.
2.- allow people trusting the signature issuer's judgement to trust
your key validity.
   So, if you get CAcert's signature, it allows people trusting CAcert
procedures to consider your key as valid, but it won't have any
meaning for people that doesn't trust CAcert. Several persons in this
list falls in that category. A signature from a local linux users
group would mean nothing to me, since I don't know any of them, and I
don't know what kind of validation they do before signing a key.
   In other words, you want signatures, but not just any signature,
you want signatures that have some meaning for the people that will be
exchanging messages with you. I know when I first made my key, I
wanted it signed, as if it was some kind of autograph book, but after
a while you realize it just increases the key's weight. Nothing to
worry too much about, since while you can't remove signatures from
keyservers (and you can't prevent somebody from fetching your key from
a keyserver, signing it with 200 bogus keys, and uploading it again),
you can still clear your local copy of your key, and send it by email
to one of your friends. And your friends can also fetch your key and
clean it from all the meaningless signatures it may have (meaningless
to them, as I said, it depends on each person).
   For some uses, I could use a key carrying only a nickname, and
exchange signatures with my gaming alliance, and that would be OK,
since I won't be exchanging any world domination plan with them. If I
were working with a customer that is a representative of a bank, and I
had to email him the user and password for the server I just setup for
them, I'd require a face to face meeting to sign his key (and I
wouldn't mind too much about what name is on the key, I'd care about
the person that uses the key. If they key says "Barak Obama", I'd
issue a local signature, so I can still use the signature to verify
the key's validity, and I would not be vouching to the world the key
belongs to "Barak Obama"). Or I could trust the signature already
issued by my boss.
   By the way, that was just an example, probably any customer
requesting me to give them the server login info would accept it in
plain text over email, or maybe using whatsapp. If "paranoid", they
may request the user name being sent by mail and the password by SMS.
Yes, it's frustrating.

  That's not possible, since the public key is based on the secret
key. Maybe it got deleted somehow, but at some point of the key

mistake, it should still be there, somewhere. I'm not good at
troubleshooting, but maybe you should post the version of GnuPG you
are using, and the operating system too, so other people can tell you
where to look for the missing secret key.
  As a general advice, always add an expiration date to the key, that
way if you ever lose the private key and revocation certifies, at
least it will die a natural death and stop haunting you. As long as
you have the private key, you can modify the expiration date and
increase the key life span.

   IMHO, Heartbleed is not the point, any certificate suspected (or
even worst, known) to have been compromised should be revoked. I
wonder what would happen if a stolen certificate is used to do a
fraud, and the affected customers can prove the CA was aware of the
compromise and refused to revoke it because they didn't get money.
   I'm glad StartSSL provide certificates for free, but I'd rather
have them asking a nominal fee to issue the certificate rather than
asking it to revoke it in case of dissaster. In my case, I don't own a
credit card, and I can't send money to paypal, so eventually I might
be tempted to get a free certificate, but would be unable to pay a
nominal fee to revoke it, not because I don't have money, but because
I don't have any way to deliver it to the CA.
    I also agree that using CAcert certificates may be very
uncomfortable, since the root certificate must be manually added to
the browser, and we (yes, I'm part of CAcert community, and used to
collaborate in policy group) have been unable to produce a license

  Yes, you are right... then, a new keypair for work related stuff,

saying "if you send personal stuff to me, send it to my personal
email, encrypted to my personal key". Maybe it would be nice to be
able to bind specific encryption keys to specific UIDs, but the
simplest thing is to keep things apart.
  I agree. A few weeks ago I started working for a company that makes
websites (usually, wordpress or joomla), and the passwords to access
the sites obviously belong to the company. For now the solution was to
say "the login details are in an excel file in my desktop, in case you
need them". Of course I keep a copy with me in case the desktop dies
or is stolen. A work mate left the login details of the site he was
working on, written in a piece of paper on his desk (I hope he

  Hello Hauke,
   Well, my university handles it like this: the person sends the
important message to the authority backing up the announcement
(usually the "secretary of studies", a.k.a. the man you need to talk
when there are troubles), and he sends it to the students. Students
see a message from him and say "OMG, I hope I'm not in troubles, I
need to read this".
   On thunderbird there is an addon that allows to re-expedite a
message without modifying it, so I suppose it would not break an
inline pgp signature, but probably s/mime would break.

     You only need 1, but he must be well known.
    Well, then the sender must be somebody that usually sends
important messages to students. One more message won't trouble him.
   Mmmm... you would have the message sent to the supporter, and if he
forwards it with copy to you, maybe... or maybe not, not sure about
what is the problem.
  But the message should include your email address... again, I don't
get what is the problem.
  Well, then he should involve the person that has the addresses,
probably the person that uses to send important messages to students.
   Remember, no matter how many signatures the message has, if it
doesn't come from a know source, they may consider it as spam and
delete it without even opening it. You need the sender to be well know
and respected.
   Yes, it would be nice to have a tool that allows you to attack a
signal from other people to make the message more appealing, but then
the email clients would have to support it, and now more and more
people moves to webmail, that is becoming harder.

El 10-05-2014 4:23, Tomer Altman escribi?:
  You need to create the revocation certificates before removing the
primary key, since it is needed to create them.
   Also, I'd use paperkey to print my secret keys, I'd have them
protected by an easy to remember passphrase, since by the time you
need the paper backup, you may have changed your passphrase several
times, so... also, malware can't steal the printed key, so the
passphrase doesn't necessarily need to be bruteforce-proof (now, if
you think somebody may want you secret key so bad to do burglary...
then it must be a strong passphrase).
   To remove the primary key, what you do is to export the secret
subkeys, then backup your keys (and store them somewhere safe), delete
the key, and import the subkeys.
   If you are working on a live CD, the only malware that may
interfere is a tainted bios, something most people doesn't have to
worry about (but again, some people DO need to worry about it, I've
heard a hint about a non profit CA got a donated computer, and when
they checked it before using it, they found something nasty in the bios).
  I've been thinking maybe I should designate a revocation key
(somebody I can trust), but so far, I don't know anyone I know to
1.- Be willing to be my designated revoker.
2.- Know how to keep his key safe until I need him to revoke my key.
3.- Be careful enough to don't revoke my key by mistake.

  Yes, using the command line, but I'm not sure what are the commands
involved, since I use a GUI that lets me select the key I want to
sign, and the key I want to use to issue the signature (after that,
the GUI invokes GPG, gives it the command and parameters and let you
continue the process using GPG on the command line), you will have to
check the manual to figure out how to do that from command line. Once
you get there, you will get a screen asking if you are sure you want
to sign all the UIDs, if you say NO, it will suggest you to select the
UIDs you want to sign (you will notice each UID is numbered from 1 to
n). Enter the number of a UID to select it, press enter, and then you
can either select another, or enter the sign (or lsign for local
signatures, or tsign for trust signatures) command and follow the
dialog to complete the signature process. I don't remember, but I
think you may need to end with the SAVE command to save the changes to
the key. It's been a long time since I signed a key.

El 22-01-2015 a las 20:43, Robert J. Hansen escibi?:
  Yes, but maybe you are missing an interesting point: if a smartcard
requires the user to push a button each time it has to issue a
signature (maybe the pin can be cached for a while, but still require
pushing a button means physical access to the device, not just some
remotely controled malware), and the card flashes a message saying "I
need you to push the button", when you are not requesting the card to
issue a signature, then you can realize your computer has been
compromized. Or if you issue a signature and then you get a message
about "do it again", ok, you can fall once, but not 500 times.
   Some years ago, I got malware in my computer, and I detected it
when the firewall warned me about some program attempting to connect
to internet. The firewall was not intended to be a malware detector,
but when it requested me to create a rule for that unknown app, I got
aware about the problem and could take steps to solve it.
   By the way, here (at Chile), the law recognizes 2 lvls of digital
signatures: the "advanced" digital signature, that is considered like
a handwritten signature (and requires a certificate in a smartcard,
issued by one of the 3 or 4 approved companies), and the "normal"
digital signature, which means the judge will determine the value of
that evidence (so, my signatures issued with GnuPG are in the same
level as a scanned picture of my handwritting... a bit unfair, IMHO).
   In that context, I would not only want the smartcard to prevent my
private key from being stolen, I'd also like to know malware won't be
able to start signing 1000s of things without my approval.

  Oh, yes, you are right. After all, if the attacker can "steal" a
signature, then each time we try to sign something legitimate, the
attacker may be able to hijack it and sign something we don't want to
sign, and the thing we want so sign will remain unsigned. And even if
the attacker can't hijack the signature, malware may very well hijack
the email account, etc.
  Yes, compromised machine must be cleaned ASAP. BTW, if somebody is
willing to develope such safety device, I hope it is designed to have
a "go ahead" button to press, but not to require entering a pin-code
each time. If entering the password to unlock GPG key too often is
unpleasant, doing that in a tiny pin-pad that maybe is not in a
comfortable place would be unusable.

  I remember a tutorial that compared it to a lock and 1 key. I keep
the key, and send the lock to the person that will send messages to
me. The person writes the message, put it in a box, and locks the box
with the lock.
  I think that is very accurate, because I can encrypt messages to
your public key, even if I don't have a key of my own (of course, in
that case I can't sign the message, but that is a different operation).
  Maybe the magical wax could be useful to explain signatures? Or... I
can send you a sample of my DNA. Then I write a message, and sign it
using my blood as ink (ouch!), you get the message, run a DNA test...
The only way somebody can fake my signature would involve stealing a
sample of my blood, but then, it would be like stealing my private key.

  I think it is a mistake to consider a signature can degrade a key's
value. After all, we CAN'T prevent people from signing our keys,
unless we try to keep them off the keyservers. But keys tend to end in
keyservers (probably they feel lonely and want to gather with their
peers). And bogus signatures from bogus keys don't weaken the WoT,
since a bogus key is not signed, so the signatures are meaningless. Of
course these signatures increase the public key size, but you can
distribute a clean copy of your key to your peers.

  Hello,
  Well, I live in the capital city of my country, I studied IT related
stuff, and yet... most signatures on my key are not from people I've
met in person. You'll see, most people I've met in person don't know
what an OpenPGP key is, and the few that know, can't care less about them.
  I know that feeling.
  Well, you don't really need your key signed for that... at least,
not the key with your name on it. You can make a key using the name
"mysoftwarename distribution key", and use it to sign the files. Once
people start using the software, they may sign the key. They don't
know who is behind the key, but they will know it is the same key that
has been using since day 1.

  I keep my whole key (main and subkeys) in an encrypted container,
and use only the subkeys on a daily basis (one signing and one for
encryption). The idea was that I could carry gpg on a pendrive and if
the pendrive is lost, I could revoke the subkeys, and don't lose the
signatures on the main key. It worked on gpg 1.4.x and it works for me
on GPG4Win, the only things I can't sign are other keys (unless I
mount my whole key).
  Now, if my computer gets infected by a key-stealing virus and I
don't notice it before mounting my whole key, I'm toasted anyway. But
at least I have a chance to get a warning, and I also can read my
encrypted emails on my laptop without worrying about the keys in case
I lose the laptop.

P.S: about orphan keys, I've set my keys to expire in 2 years, so if I

  You may also want to set an expiration date for your keys (in case
you lose the private keys and revocation certs... let's say they were
on the same hdd and it crashed), which can be edited later (only
problem is your correspondents will need to get an updated copy of
your public key to still be able to use your key). You can also export
your keys using paperkey utility, that way you can print them in an
easy to type (maybe even easy to OCR) way and store the printed
version in a safe place. I don't really care that much about my
signing key, but if my hdd crashes and I need to use my remotely
stored backups... I'll need my encryption key to open them.
