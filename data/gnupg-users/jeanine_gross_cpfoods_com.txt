Can anyone point me in the right direction.... I've worked on a project for
the last 6-7 months.... it landed on me because the person who originally
worked on it was laid off... he was kind enough to give me the password for
the key ring. I have been able to decrypt files for the last 6 months with
no error messages, however I have now noticed in the last 3 weeks or so that
gpg is kicking back an error message to me, "gpg: can't check signature:
public key not found". Can anyone tell me why it is happening for the last
month?  do I need to get another public DSA key? Jeanine Gross Jeanine Gross

this is what gpg responds with (i've x-d out the key nbrs...)
I have also done a gpgp --list-keys ,  but the DSA key from the
signature below does not display for this inquiry  gpg: encrypted with ELG-E key, ID xxxxxxx
gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit ELG-E key, ID zzzzzz, created 2003-02-12
"user name" gpg: Signature made 10/10/03 23:57:54 using  DSA key ID yyyyyy
gpg: Can't check signature: public key not found
