Dear Robert J. Hansen,
I'd like to know more about the process by which unsigned packages become
signed packages. This matters, I think, when using SELinux, which is what
I do.
Some packages are unsigned, e.g. Xcas, a computer algebra system by
Bernard Parisse at a university in France:

I had to tell the SELinux motor that she must trust two modules loaded when Xcas is launched. I succeeded after many hours.
It would be easier, I think, if Xcas (the application) had a electronic
signature by someone that Fedora 10 trusts ...
Thanks a lot,
David Bernier
