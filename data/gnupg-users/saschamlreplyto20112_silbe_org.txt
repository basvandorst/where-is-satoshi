@_subject: OpenLDAP schema to store OpenPGP keys? 
Excerpts from 's message of Mon Feb 20 10:56:32 +0100 2006:
Like Walter, I'd like to add OpenPGP keys to an LDAP server, but can't
locate the schema used / understood by GnuPG. The file mentioned above
has since gone.
Where did the schema come from originally? If the license is GPL
compatible, would it be possibly to include it as part of the GnuPG
