@_subject: problems with gnupg2 and passphrase 
I'm using GnuPG 2.0.12 (GPG4Win) and have problems in decrypting multiple files with the same passphrase via command prompt. My old GnuPG Version 1.x.x commad was
gpg2.exe --allow-multiple-messages --passphrase geheim --decrypt-files C:\Test\*.gpg
The command doesn't work anymore and I'm getting a popup window for entering my passphrase. I'm looking for a command that decrypts multiple files with the same passphrase without any additional "ask windows". I already searched the manual but didn't found any helpful information.
Thanks for any help.
