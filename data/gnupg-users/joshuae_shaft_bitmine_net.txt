@_subject: Automating Encrypting Message to Users with no trust level 
I'm tweaking a mailing-list manager to use gpg and I need a batch command line that will encrypt messages with a key that has no trust level.  Or a batch command line to give a key a trust level?
I'm not on this list so please email directly,
Thank you in advance,
Joshua Eichen
