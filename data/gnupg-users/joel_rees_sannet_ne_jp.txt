Anybody got any idea why my non-root admin user's ~/.gnupg directory  is or should be owned by root? This is on a Mac, where root logins  are generally disabled, so that, for instance, we install with "sudo  make install".

I think my first use was as my admin login.
I don't think I did the make check via sudo, but I might have.
I chown-ed it to the user. I suppose I should look inside and see if  I can tell what I did from what's there.
