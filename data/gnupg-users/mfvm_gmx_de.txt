@_subject: Problem with compilation on OSF1 V4.0 alpha 
It definetly does. But it needs some manual help. There is a bunch off
mpih*.S files, which you may compile via gcc -c file.S in the mpi
directory. You may also take a look at the akefile and delete the .S.lo
target at the end (IIRC, I did that some weeks ago).
Next thing you will have to face is the -lc trap: The gcc will fail in
linking the C library because there are several -lc options in one
command. Needs handwork, too. But it is possible :-)
Werner Koch suggests using GNU make instead of DEC make, but I never
tried this.

@_subject: What are fingerprints? 
fingerprints are something like a hash value of a key: A short, unique
number. It is intended to use a fingerprint to verify that the key
belongs to the user given in the Key ID: If you can communicate over a
secure line, eg, via phone, you may compare the fingerprints of the
key. Other possibility: The public key of a newspaper publisher: It may
be printed in the newspaper, and you can simply check whether the public
key from the keyserver is the correct one comparing the
fingerprints. (You don't want to check the whole key, eve if it is
printed out :-))

The document is still avaiable on the GPH page, in a (hopefully)
improved version.

You may do something, but ther are the old problems due to the RSA
patent. The procedure is described at
but remember, it should be a temporary solution, as one should generally
prefer non patented algorithms.

As hard as the rsa website :-), the FAQ reads
Question 6.3.1.  Is RSA patented?
RSA is patented  under U.S. Patent 4,405,829, issued  September 29, 1983
and held by  RSA Data Security, Inc.; the patent  expires 17 years after
issue, in the year 2000. RSA Data Security has a standard, royalty-based
licensing policy,  which can be modified for  special circumstances. The
U.S. government can use RSA without a license because it was invented at
MIT with partial government funding.
In the  U.S., a license is needed  to "make, use or  sell" RSA. However,
RSA Data  Security usually allows  free non-commercial use of  RSA, with
written permission, for academic or university research purposes.
