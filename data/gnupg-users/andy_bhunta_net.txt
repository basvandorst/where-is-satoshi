@_subject: RSA sign key id being modified on MIT PGP keyserver 
Hash: SHA1
Hello List,
I have subscribed here to find an answer to a pain-in-the-arse problem
to do with my 4096b RSA sign-only public key ID being modified when the
key is uploaded to the MIT PGP keyserver.
I see this problem has already been discussed in the thread "Problem
with GnuPG 1.2.1 generated Key (Broken Key or Keyserver Problem)" -
OP'er Bjoern Buerger.
David Shaw wrote back and said he had a patch prepared and it was
waiting for release.
So just a couple of questions to follow up.
- -1- After the patch is applied will the RSA (public) key need to be
uploaded once again to the MIT PGP keyserver to correct the key id, or
will the key id be corrected automatically once the key applied?
- -2- Is there any timeline for when the patch will be applied to the
- -3- Is there a preferred alternative keyserver for GPG generated keys,
where the key id's for RSA keys are not modified?
Thanks in advance for any and all help. And thanks to the original
thread posters for their discussion which helped me find quick answers
to questions about this problem.
