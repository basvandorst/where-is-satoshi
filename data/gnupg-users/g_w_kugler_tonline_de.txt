@_subject: a beginner, migrating from pgp5 to gpg 
my keys were generated by pgp5 (I think, as I had installed also pgp2.6). If
I try to decrypt a mail, which can be decrypted by pgp5, gpg tells:
gpg: Entschlüsselung mit öffentlichem Schlüssel fehlgeschlagen: Unbekanntes
gpg: verschlüsselt mit ELG-E Schlüssel, ID 55DAE3A3
gpg: kein geheimer Schlüssel zur Entschlüsselung vorhanden
gpg: Enschlüsselung fehlgeschlagen: Geheimer Schlüssel ist nicht vorhanden
(no secret key available)

sorry not clear:
$ gpg --list-secret-key

The first key was made by pgp2.6, the second (I think) by pgp5. I have
copied pubring.pkr and secring.skr as pubring.gpg and secring.gpg to the
.gnupg-directory. Therefore they are known, as you see.

@_subject: several recipients 
is it possible to encrypt to several recipients? Can I define a group of
recipients with one name?

@_subject: sending public key from within mutt 
if I am sending my public key, mutt offers:
7 +  1024/0x6C5F526A DSA  -s Gerhard Kugler 8 +  1024/0x2832BB54 ElG  e- Gerhard Kugler The "-s" seems to say, that it is for signing, but why should another
person use it for signing his mails with my public key? You see: I
don't understand it.

@_subject: Publishing public key in gpg 
is it a good idea, to put the pubkey onto the own homepage as a file?
And would the method above be the best one?
