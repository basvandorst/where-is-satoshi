@_subject: PGP 7.0.5 and GPG 
My company owns PGP e-Business Server 7.0.5.
Our clients want to be able to send us encrypted files without purchasing
NAI's E-Business Server, because the only version they now sell is the
enterprise version for $6000 and up.
Can my clients use GPG to encrypt files that I can decrypt with PGP 7.0.5?
If so, are there any howto's you can point me to?
Thanks in advance,
