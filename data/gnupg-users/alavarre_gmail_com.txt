Hash: SHA1
Ben hello:
Please tell me more. When was this? I'd like not to be doing so and did
not do so intentionally.
I suspected that I had a rootkit a couple of months ago, but reformatted
the disk and reinstalled (OpenSUSE 11.2), use guarddog and rkhunter
assiduously, with no indications of a problem.
Haven't studied MUA reply protocols:
But shall do so now, to ensure I am not offending you or others. But at
present I see no reply-to addresses in my headers.
If I am doing so it is certainly unintentional, as I have only replied
here once before, and that by accident, which may have triggered
werner's comment. It was late and I was intending to reply to gnucash,
not gnupg...
So this is only my second knowingly posted transmission to the group, so
if you are getting others then something is decidedly wrong.
Please instruct me.
Best regards, Andy Lavarre

@_subject: Where to find g13? 
Hello. Can someone please show me a link to download and install *G13*,
the LUKS replacement? Alternatively, would you suggest an exit to the
quagmire below... Extensive googling has not succeeded.
I am on OpenSuSE 11.2 (kernel 2.6.31.12-0.1-default) with their
selection of GPG 1.2.0.12-2.3. I've tried upgrading directly from
gnupg.org and end up with the same version.
I'm trying to install OpenVAS and Nessus. Both fail with the installed
gpgme 1.2.0-2.5.
Googling tells me that gpgme 1.1.18 works, but I haven't been able to
find that, although I *have* obtained gpgme 1.3.0 source.
Compiling gpgme 1.3.0 from source fails with a warning that g13 is not
available. I cannot find a copy on my system or in its repositories.
It is just a *configure* warning, so I can proceed to *make*, but then
that then fails with
We load libassuan and try again. But it still fails.
So I'm getting nowhere fast.
Thanks in advance, Andy

@_subject: transaction already being edited in another register 
Hash: SHA1
discussing the subject error, I have found that:
+ The General Ledger shows blank transactions that cannot be deleted
when this error appears. If you try to Delete Splits in the General
Ledger or offending register when it has occurred you then retrigger the
+ However, as suggested in the URL, deleting the transaction immediately
when the autofill fails to perform seems to avoid the error.
But it definitely is a PITA if you have a lot of common transactions to
fill out... :-(
Best regards, Andy
