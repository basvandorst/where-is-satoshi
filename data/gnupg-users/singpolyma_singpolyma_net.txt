Is there a set of switches to tell gpg or gpg2 to produce "new" packet length headers for output?  Specifically

Hmm, ok.  I was hoping that with all the "advanced mode, you probably don't care about this" features, there would be one for this.

I might do that if I get further along.  I want to be able to have partial OpenPGP implementations that only bother with new-style headers.  Such implementations' ouput can be read by gpg, but there's currently no way to convince gpg to talk to them :)
My own implementations currently do support both kinds of headers, so it's not a pressing need.

The manpage for gpg sez:
Does anyone know what the actual security risk is?  Using a weaker checksum obviously makes it easier to forge data, but in this case the data being forged is just the secret parts of a secret key.  What are the attack vectors there?

Thanks!  That paper implies that both the public *and* private elements must be integrity protected to defeat the attack (depending on algorithm), however it seems that only the private elements are protected by the SHA1 under RFC4880.  Was the need to protect the public elements discovered to be
