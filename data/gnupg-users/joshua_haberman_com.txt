@_subject: encrypting everything 
Is there any Linux kernel patch available that allows you to
transparently encrypt your entire hard drive, and perform decryption on
the fly?
I want to be prompted for a password at boot time, and then have my
password used to then decrypt all the files on the drive, so that if the
password is wrong the hard drive is completely unaccessable and
Is this feasable? Would you take a pretty severe performance hit? Is
there a better way to achieve the desired effect?
