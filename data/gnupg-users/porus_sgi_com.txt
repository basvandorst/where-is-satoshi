@_subject: Key is marked INSECURE! 
I just started working with GnuPG. Everything works fine. Its just that the
keys I generate are marked INSECURE! porus 508% gpg --list-keys

I ploughed through the guide, the man pages and the FAQ, but could not find
it mentioned anywhere.
What is the reason for this?
Would really appreciate any pointers on this.
I am working with v 1.0.7 if that is of any relevance.
Thanks a ton in advance.

This really helped. I am running on an SGI IRIX box and do not have
asked GPG to use it. The new key I generated is not marked INSECURE!
Thanks David!

This code from g10/keygen.c may help pinpoint the issue:
 * or it is switched into  quick testmode */
if( quick_random_gen(-1) )
    strcpy(p, " (INSECURE!)" );
