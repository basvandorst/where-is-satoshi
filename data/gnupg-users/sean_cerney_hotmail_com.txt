@_subject: automating gnupg decryption 
Hello All,
I am using gnupg to decrypt files that are imported to us daily.  These are xml files.  I use GnuPG in a Windows environment.
i'm trying to find the right command line code to use to automate the decryption of these files.
I can enter the following code:
gpg --output (pathname)\(desired output name) --decrypt (pathname)\*.xml.pgp
where *.xml.pgp is any decrypted xml file in my folder.
my question is:  can I automate gpg to assign a unique name to the OUTPUT file (such as 11_05.xml, etc.) instead of manually entering a name each thanks for any help.

@_subject: dealing with password in batch file 
I've been decrypting xml files for a while now with a batch file that converts the pgp file into an xml file with a timestamp.
The thing is I always have to manually enter the password each time I run the batch file.  I want to automate this thing once and for all, but I have to figure out how to incorporate password entry into the batch file.  I try to echo the password but that has no effect.  I am using DOS command line.
Any suggestions?  Thank you.
Here is basically what I have at the moment..(actual drive name and subfolders omitted)
DriveName:\SubFolders --output DriveName:\SubFolders\ScheduledExtract.xml --decrypt DriveName:\SubFolders\*.xml.pgp
 off
:: variables
set hour=%time:~0,2%
if "%hour:~0,1%"==" " set hour=0%time:~1,1%
set NewFileName=%date:~10,4%_%date:~4,2%_%date:~7,2%_%hour%_%time:~3,2%
RENAME ScheduledExtract.xml ScheduledExtract%NewFileName%.xml
once this runs it prompts for the password
