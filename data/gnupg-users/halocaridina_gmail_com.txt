Hello everyone,
I was interested in hearing from anyone who might be using OpenPGP v2.1 Smartcards with the Identiv SCR3500 A "SmartFold" USB Reader. A spec sheet on this reader can be found here:
Specifically, has this reader been successfully used to read and write to OpenPGP v2.1 Smartcards under current distros/versions of Linux and/or Apple OS X using recent versions of gnupg?
The reader is natively recognized by the kernel on an up-to-date ArchLinux system with lsusb as:
Bus 001 Device 007: ID 04e6:5410 SCM Microsystems, Inc. SCR35xx Smart Card Reader
as well as Apple OS X (at least from reports on sites selling it), suggesting some level of support.
Any info would be greatly appreciated and thank you in advance,

Dear Damien
Thank you greatly for your quick response and helpful information. This is very good news.
Setting up the reader for a normal user should be fairly straightforward using a udev rule, so thank you for the reminder.
