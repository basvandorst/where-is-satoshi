Hi (David and) Debby :-)
You might want to have a look at  ("WinPT (Windows Privacy Tray) is a taskbar utility (...)"). Once installed this will lead you through a graphical key-generation process ("Key Manager / Key / Generate").
And check  ("GPGOE is an Outlook Express plug-in for GnuPG created by Timo Schulz (...)").

Dunno if this is of any interest to you, but decrypting with NAIs PGP Desktop Suite 7.1 works fine, too.

@_subject: Problems decrypting 
recently I received a message that was encrypted to 9 recipients (one of them being me) using "CryptoEx" [1]. I was able to decrypt it using NAIs Desktop Suite 7.1 (Windows 2K) without a problem, but I could not decrypt it using GnuPG 1.0.6-2 (win32) (w/ WinPT 0.5.9) -- it just spit out the error message "No secret key available" followed by a Key ID that doesn't belong to one of my keys.
Apart from that I noticed that PGP 7.1 shows a message box like this
Applied to the same message GnuPG (w/ WinPT) fires up the same info-box but it looks like
Do you have any ideas? Is there any additional information you need?
Thanks a lot for you help!

@_subject: Replacing PGP (Freeware 7.0.3) by gnuPG + gpgSHELL 
I don't know if this is any help, but I recently replaced PGP 7.1 with GnuPG+WinPT any did not experience any of the problems you describe.
If you are not tied to GPGShell for some reason I'd suggest you give WinPT a try ( 0.5.9 works fine with me).

@_subject: Problems understanding IDEA problem :-) 
this seems to be a follow-up-problem to last weeks issue --- though I've learned quite a lot about gpg in the meantime :-)
Here's a brief description of the problem again:
John Doe wants to send encrypted mail to me using "CryptoEx". I'm using GPG 1.0.7 (w32) (Hideki Saito's build).
About CryptoEx:
"CryptoEx (...) allows a choice of different standards according to requirements, such as the widely used protocols OpenPGP (...) This (...) setup guarantees that you can securely communicate with all your business partners."
Hmmm ... here's my key prefs:
--- cut ---
Secret key is available.
pub  1024D/452E8863  created: 2002-05-03 expires: 2002-12-29 trust: u/u

(1). Thorsten Delbrouck-Konetzko      Cipher: AES, CAST5, 3DES
     Hash: SHA1, RIPEMD160
     Compression: ZLIB, ZIP
--- cut ---
And here's the actual problem when trying to decrypt a message:
--- cut ---
You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: "Thorsten Delbrouck-Konetzko "
2048-bit ELG-E key, ID 4CBAE7B1, created 2002-05-03 (main key ID 452E8863) <--- seems to be the correct key
gpg: cipher algorithm 1 (IDEA) is unknown or disabled
gpg: the IDEA cipher plugin is not present
gpg: please see  for more information
gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit RSA key, ID AB123456, created 2001-02-20
      "John Doe "
gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit ELG-E key, ID 4CBAE7B1, created 2002-05-03
      "Thorsten Delbrouck-Konetzko "
gpg: public key decryption failed: unknown cipher algorithm
--- cut ---
Now .... did I make a mistake with my key again or did CryptoEx simply pick the wrong cipher algorithm (thus violating the openpgp spec) ?
Thanks for your help!

@_subject: Looking for a comparative survey on s/mime - (open)pgp usage 
my apologies if this is way off-topic here, but I felt someone might have some info on this:
I am looking for a comparative survey containing the following information:
  -- percentage of companies using mail-encryption
  -- encryption standards used at this companies (S/MIME, PGP, PEM, Notes internal etc.)
Additional information (tendencies, amount and size of analyzed companies, geographic differences (EU/US/Asian/Worldwide) etc.) should be included as well.
This does not necessarily need to be from a free information source (though I personally would prefer this), but we are as well willing to pay for a survey like that.
Any ideas or hints where to find something like this are highly appreciated!
Thanks for your support.
