@_subject: Documentation gap: User-agent configuration under windows 8.1 
Dear GPG user community,
Got to admit it took me ridiculously long to find a way to pass
arguments to the gpg-agent under windows 8.1 like setting max-cache time
The documentation so far doesn't mention that the gpg-agent.conf file
has to be placed in the C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\gnupg
directory in order to be considered when gpg-agent.exe is invoked by
I'd strongly suggest to include this detail in the documentation.
Kind regards
