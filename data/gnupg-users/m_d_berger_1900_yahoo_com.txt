@_subject: Why a subkey? 
On FC4 with gpg 1.4.1:
I created a new user account and used gpg --gen-key .
I selected RSA (sign only) since it was the only RSA
It says the key cannot be used for encryption, and a
subkey must be generated. Why?  Is it related to
(sign only)?  If so, why was (sign and encrypt)
not offered as an option?
I did this a year or two ago, and I do not remember
needing a subkey.  I still have that keyring in
under another user.
Thanks for your help.

Now I created a key using "DSA and Elgamal (default)".  As you
suggest, it created a subkey for me, as can be seen in gpg --list-keys.
If I run gpg --list-keys on my old keyring, I see no subkeys in the
old keys (Apr 2006), but there is a subkey in the public key imported
from the new user account.  Has there been a change?  Are my old
keys obsolete?  I don't remember if I upgraded gpg in the interim
(present version 1.4.1), but I will upgrade, as you suggest.

Thanks four your "-expert" suggestion.  While I would consider
myself a "-novice" with regard to gpg, it is, perhaps, something
I should try. Your "Why not?" question is another matter. If you
are employed, I suggest you try it on your manager next time you
are required to justify a costly idea.

Following your advice, I ran:
   yum update gnupg
a few days ago, and now I have v1.4.5 . But I
see that you have v1.4.6 .  I ran yum again,
and it got nothing new.  So what's happening?

@_subject: Files to Backup 
To protect all my gpg keys against disk failure,
what files or directories should I back up?

Thanks for this.  This auto-key retrieval sounds like something
I would like to disable.  Is there a way to do that?

@_subject: Encrypted Directory 
I would like to use gpg to create encrypted directories
on an external hard drive.  I would like to do this for
both WinXP and for Linux.  Could someone direct me to
appropriate documentation?

Actually I have both situations and also something in between --
a directory I want to store on the external drive is too large
to allow its zip file to coexist on the main disk.  To zip and
encrypt it I would have to first have unencrypted data on the
external drive -- clearly a bad idea.
Also, AFAICT, truecrypt, luks, FreeOTFE do not have public key
encryption, which I would prefer.

It is similar to using the the public key with ssh.  The public
key is on the server (the hard drive in this case) and those with
client access (a CD mounted on my WinXP box, but usually kept in
a safe) have the secret key.  Once you are "logged in", encrypted
access continues transparently.  That way, the external drive can
safely be taken on travels, which is what we intend to do.

I tried to zip a 90G directory tree, but it failed on a bad file
name -- something in a bookmarks directory, I think, but it
doesn't make any difference what it is.  Zip will not do.
Since I have a Samba connection from a Linux box to the WinXP
box, I tried
   tar -cvzf
on the 90G directory on the WinXP box.  It seemed to work ok.
After about half-an-hour, it had done about 6G.  That's ok,
but then I remembered I had reliability issues moving large
files via Samba, so I stopped it and abandoned that idea.

@_subject: ...key belongs to ... 
On a Linux box, in encrypting a file with gpg, I get this query:
   It is NOT certain that the key belongs to the person named
   in the user ID.  If you *really* know what you are doing,
   you may answer the next question with yes.
   Use this key anyway? (y/N) n
Now in the context in which this is being used, there is no
uncertainty regarding key ownership, and the encryption is
part of a bash script.  The query stops the script.
Therefore, how can I prevent this query?
Thanks for your help.

@_subject: ...key belongs to ... 
I went to the account in which the key pair was generated
and tried to sign the key.  I got that the key is already
signed.  Was there perhaps something in the export of
the public key that might have gone wrong?  Or, perhaps,
is there some other signing that is necessary?
Thanks again.
