@_subject: Different output of list-secret-keys 
Hash: SHA1
I have added a second uid to an old RSA key
old uid: myname new uid: myname Real name is the same on both IDs!
Using GnuPG 1.2.2 and the 'primary' command I set the new uid to be the
primary one.
gpg --with-colons --fixed-list-mode --list-secret-keys myname
shows the new ID first, the old ID second.
BUT without 'myname' (no parameter for --list-secret-keys)
the old ID is show first then the new ID second.
Unfortunately I have a script which relies on the order of the 'uid:' entries.
Any comments on this?
Best Regards,
Holger Sesterhenn

@_subject: IDEA licence (was: Timing test of GnuPG and old PGP ) 
Try  There is a FAQ about IDEA.
You can avoid using IDEA because most of the current OpenPGP compliant
implementations can handle 3DES or CAST as a symmetric cypher.
If you import your keys from PGP to GnuPG, you should remove IDEA from the
preferences and update your key on the public keyservers, if necessary.

@_subject: How can one tell what kind of a key one has set up? 
'gpg --list-keys' gives you the type of key:
pub   768R/0C9857A5 1995-09-30 Werner Koch (mein alter key) 	
The 'R'behinf the key length tells you this is an RSA key, the big letter
means you can sign and encrypt!
pub  1024D/621CC013 1998-07-07 Werner Koch sub  1536g/ADF6A6E1 1999-02-20 [expires: 2002-11-01]
sub  1536G/B5A18FF4 1998-07-07 [expires: 2002-07-06]
The 'D' tells you this is a DSA key for signing. The 'g' this is an ELGamal
for encryption only, the 'G' this is ELGamal for signing and encrypting
(THE BAD ONE!!!!)
Or you use 'gpg --with-colon --list-keys'

Take a look at the document doc/DETAILS, there is an example how to use
--gen-key and --batch to create keys without user interaction.
Some month ago I published a Bash shell script to do this easier (linux

@_subject: Problem with multiple encryption subkeys 
I would like to encrypt to a public key which have two ELGamal encryption
subkeys (11111111,22222222). Because I don't know which of the subkeys is
valid I encrypt to both!
This is my command:
gpg --armor --recipient 0x11111111 --recipient 0x22222222 \
GnuPG 1.2.3 says something like "0x1111111, Public key already there, skipped!"
If I use 0x22222222 as first recipient this keyid is shown in the message.
Does GnuPG detect the keyid of the primary (signing) key which of course is
the same because its the same key (certificate)?

It's called 'client authentication' and you have to import this special

behaviour since ages.
I'am working with such a configuration every day. Of course we have
created our own certificate hierachy. No need for Verisign.

@_subject: verifying signature after decryption  
If I remember correctly there was a feature request on Gnupg-devel at
the end of february: --unwrap
This would decrypt the message but leave the signed data with the
signature packet untouched. Of couse you need again an OpenPGP client to
verify the signature and get the data.

@_subject: Moving from PGP to GnuPG and other questions ...  
I have tried to remove IDEA from older V4 keys (RSA or DSA) using GnuPGs
--edit command and failed using PGP 8.03. Of course there are no
preferences on V3 keys.
I have deleted the old key from PGP, exported the public key with new
preferences from GnuPG an then imported again this key to PGP 8.03.
PGP still showed IDEA as prefered algorithm (just set 3DES, CAST5 and
AES with GnuPG).
Don't know whether there is a special feature to rebuild the keyring
with PGP.
I have in mind that there is somewhere a switch to force PGP to use a
certain algorithm as default. Some time ago I have created 3DES
encrypted data with PGP 8.0x.

If I import a new key to PGP which has been generated by GnuPG with its
default preferences
     Cipher: AES256, AES192, AES, CAST5, 3DES
     Digest: SHA1, RIPEMD160
     Compression: ZLIB, ZIP, Uncompressed
     Features: MDC
,done with GnuPG 1.2.3)
PGP will encrypt with CAST5 or 3DES (maybe AES).
BUT I have changed the prefs of a V4 key which has been generated with
PGP (with IDEA as default!), exported to GnuPG, *deleted* entirely from
PGP, exported from GnuPG with new prefs set and again imported from PGP.
Will say: there was a time where PGP did not know about the existence of
this key. But somewhere in PGP's key database information can be found
that this key has had IDEA as the default algo.
That exactly is the question!

@_subject: Moving from PGP to GnuPG and other questions ...   
Well, I have to admit that I have to correct my previous mails. Because
my test have been a while ago I have done it again. The latest PGP 8.x
seem to handle the key preferrences correctly.
I have created a testkey with GnuPG, setting CAST5 as preferred algo,
imported it to PGP. PGP shows CAST5 as preferred algo.
Then I have used 'setpref' with GnuPG and switched to 3DES as preferred
algo (CAST5 still at second position). After importing this changed
public key, there was a second selfsig and the key show 3DES as
preferred algo with PGP8. Don't need to delete the key before.
Everything is merged. Looks like the old versions (6.5, 7.x) did not
merge correctly and that was the reason why I said PGP has some bugs.
I have found the 'default algo' switch for PGP8 under
'Options/Adavanced' (well, I have the german version! Maybe the
translation is not exact). You have to set the algo *before* you create
a new key. It's possible to disable specific algos, too.
So tell your recipients to switch off IDEA and use AES, CAST5 or 3DES.

@_subject: UTF8 passphrase problem (I think)  
Hi Tom,
If a key is older than 1999 and it is an RSA key the possibilty is not
that small, especially if it is created with PGP 5.x ;-)
This is strange.
I am not sure but using CAST5 as the sym algo for encryption does not
necessarly mean your passphrase is encrypted using CAST5, too. I have
not dig into the source of PGP 5 but there has been some discussions on
this point a few month ago (David?). PGP 5 can encrypt messages (and the
passphrase of course) using IDEA even if the key is of version 4
(DSA/ElGamal or RSA V4) like yours.
Have you ever tried to use the evaluation version of PGP to clear the
passphrases, export the keys and import them with GnuPG?
Or use the old PGP for linux version? (5.x)

@_subject: Signatur type 0x30, Certification revocation signatures 
I do some tests with key/uid revocation.
Calling 'gpg --edit' I use the commands 'revuid' on a uid and 'revsig'
on the self signature of the same uid. The result (using --list-packets)
seems to be 2 additional signatures of type 0x30 on this uid.
Looks like there a two ways to get the same effect (revoke this uid).

@_subject: capacity of keyring 
I have done some tests with dumps from a HKP keyserver (> 20MB of data, 25000 keys, SuSE Linux 9.x and own Linux distribution).
GnuPG 1.2.3 crashed during import after about 2500 keys. GnuPG 1.3.9X and 1.4.0 did the job but terribly slow.
It took more than 6 hours to '--import' on a P-IV/2,4 MHz (512 MB RAM, 40 GB ATA)  and was only a bit faster on a dual P-IV/3 Mhz (2 GB RAM, SCSI with 64 MB Cache controller).
It's because GnuPG has to scan the whole keyring again and again if you append keys to it. It's an exponential behaviour.
GnuPG is still a client software not designed to handle such an amount of keys.
But as Werner mentioned, this may change in future releases ;-).
