Hi Kristian,
I've fixed inaccuracies in the Hockeypuck total key count. Hockeypuck
now uses an exact row count, updated in the background every few hours
(at release hockeypuck_1.0.1~a2~dev20140609+8e0dfc6).
keys.cmarstech.com has been updated to this latest version, which is
available in the unstable PPA, ppa:hockeypuck/unstable. I'll be
proposing this fix along with a few others into trusty/universe soon.
Apologies for any confusion this has caused.
