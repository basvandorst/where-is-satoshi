I had reinstalled a while ago, and forgot to backup my gpg files. I have
retrieved my public key from MIT's keyserver, but I don't have the
private key, so I can't sign anything. Help?

Nope. the howto I followed had nothing about it. I'm admittedly quite
green with GPG. I just needed it to sign something once, now I need it
to sign something else, and I don't have the revocation cert. *bangs head on desk*
