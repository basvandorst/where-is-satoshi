@_subject: Gnupg Integrity check 
Hello Guys I am a new user to Gnupg and i am having problems checking the integrity of the thunderbird Enigmail  extension "enigmail-0.94.1.2-tb15-win+lin+mac.xpi"
I have placed both the enigmail file (.xpi) and its signature file (.asc) provided by the official site in the same folder and i have used the following command:
"gpg --verify enigmail-0.94.1.2-tb15-win+lin+mac.xpi.asc "
It is returning the following result:
gpg: Signature made 11/06/06 10:43:05 using DSA key ID 9369CDF3
gpg: Can't check signature: public key not found
KNOWING THAT: I have placed the public key that i have copied from the site in the same folder under multiple names:
The integrity check gave me the finger, i have searched everywhere for an answer but it is the same unclear answers.
Please help Thk you guys
