I would use the entire fingerprint in the same format as reported
by --fingerprint (10 groups of 4 hex chars).  The key ID is last
8 characters of the fingerprint.  At one point I even had a rubber
stamp made up with the fingerprint so I could just stamp my business
cards with it.

The 8 char key ID is enough for one to retrieve your public key from
any keyserver, however, if that person would like to sign your key they
need 2 things from you.  At least one picture ID and your key's
fingerprint.  Chances are, if someone has your business card they have
met you in person so they could easily have checked your ID.  So including
it on your business card makes it more convenient.  That's the real reason
for including the fingerprint instead of just the keyID.  They are not
going to use the fingerprint to retrieve the key, only to verify that the
retrieved key is yours.

Hi there,
I received a signature on my public key from an unknown key.  Is there a
way that I can mark the signature as suspect, i.e. that I did not verify
that this person verified my identity, in a way that can be re-uploaded
to keyservers?

Is that because there is not a 2-way trust relationship going on?
I guess I don't understand how the WoT will be able to figure out
that he is untrustworthy if there is no way to mark a signature
as untrustworthy.  It seems there should be a way to sign signatures
as good or bad.
