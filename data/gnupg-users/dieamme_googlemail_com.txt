thx for your feedback.
Ok, but the secret Keys in "private-keys-v1.d" are
encrypted with (symmetric) AES128.
Ok, but can the hash algo changed to sha2?
If i understand it right, with gnupg < 2.1.x, the private keys in
the sec Keyring are stored with the usage of a stronger hash algo.
My question is, why securing the private key's with sha1?

I'm trying with gnupg version 2.1.6.
Based on the changelog: Is there a way to change the encryption-cipher for the secret Keys in "private-keys-v1.d" ?
I tried it with:
  gpg2 --openpgp --s2k-cipher-algo AES256 --s2k-digest-algo SHA512 \
  --s2k-mode 3 --s2k-count 65000000 --edit-key Key-id
  gpg> passwd --> change passphrase --> save
But this didn't work for me.
With the default config the secret keys are encrypted and stored
with AES128 and SHA1.
How to change it?
