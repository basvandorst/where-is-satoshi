@_subject: how to use samrtcard with PC/SC cardreader 
I am interested in NOT put private keys in disk. I like the idea, put
private keys in smartcard.
 How to use the Fellowship
how to use OpenPGP card with gpg. But in section 2.3.2,
PC/SC(Personal computer/Smart card), there are only two lines:
option to GnuPG.
My questions are:
1. If I use command
    gpg --disable-ccid
    I got message
    gpg: invalid option "--disable-ccid"
    (PS, I use GnuPG 2.0.17 in Windows 7)
   What is wrong?
2. Are GnuPG 2.0.17, Windows(Operation System), OpenPGP SmartCard
100 PU USB PC/SC IC card reader compatible ?
