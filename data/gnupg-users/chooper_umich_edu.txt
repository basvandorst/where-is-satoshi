@_subject: Must I Retrieve? 
Hash: SHA1
I use GnuPG in pine via pinegpg. So far everything works well, but I have
one question. When reading a "signed" message I have to set the option
'keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve' in the options file. This retrieves
the correspondent's public key and imports it into my keyring.
My question is: Can I check a signature without importing the public
key? Sorry if this has been asked many times before.
