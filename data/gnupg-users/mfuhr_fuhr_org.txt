@_subject: Book advice 
I have both books, among others.  HAC seems to be highly regarded
as a reference amongst cryptographers, while AC is more of a popular
exposition for non-cryptographers.  HAC is more academic in tone;
it's dense with definitions, facts, algorithms, and examples, and
the chapter endnotes contain a lot of background information.  It's
also free[1].  AC is more conversational, making it approachable
for newcomers.  If you've read AC and want more detail then HAC
might have what you're looking for.  Both books are about a decade
old so you'll find nothing about AES and only brief mention of
elliptic curves.
Newer books worth considering are _Practical Cryptography_ by
Ferguson and Schneier, with less coverage than AC but with more
emphasis on using cryptography to build a secure system; and _Modern
Cryptography_ by Mao, with more math and rigor.  The latter book
has production flaws like numerous typos and a poor binding (at
least on my copy) but I liked the author's emphasis on showing why
"textbook crypto" is insufficient for building secure systems --
something obvious to cryptographers but less so to the naive.
Rescorla's _SSL and TLS_ is good, being a detailed description of
how a real, widely-used protocol works.  Another interesting book
is _Decrypted Secrets_ by Bauer, especially if you're interested
in rotor machines and cryptanalysis of classical ciphers.
Here are a few links with book recommendations:

@_subject: GPG gives wierd data when trying to decrypt 
Does the original file contain binary data?  Are you using symmetric
or public-key encryption?  Could you show the encryption command?
If you redirect standard output, do you get any errors?
gpg -d filename > filename.decrypted
What do you get for the following?
echo test | gpg -c | gpg -d
You should be prompted twice for the encryption passphrase, then
prompted for the decryption passphrase.  The final output should
look like this:
gpg: CAST5 encrypted data
gpg: encrypted with 1 passphrase
gpg: WARNING: message was not integrity protected
