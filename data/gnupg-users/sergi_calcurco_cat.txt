@_subject: Support for additional ECC Curves in GnuPG (gcrypt) 
In my humble opinion, this has been an enormous limitation on this
standard. But there are other curves with OIDs (check for the "Brainpool
standard Curves". The rfc4492, similar to what you mention but for TLS,
allows any arbitrary curve (prime & char2) but rfc 6637 doesn't allow us to
go that far.
About your question of the alternative curves, yes, I'm working in an
auditable algorithm (to get us to trust on it) to allow us to not share the
curve we use as the X9.62 mention as a issue when too many people shares
the same curve. The issue I'm having for this algorithm is to build them,
even for the "big" fields in a non-user desperation time (I mean not bigger
but smaller than equivalent rsa generation).
