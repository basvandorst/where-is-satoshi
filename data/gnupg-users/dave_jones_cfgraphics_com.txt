@_subject: Can you help me??...I need it!   
To anyone who can help:
I am trying to run Gnupg using WinPT.  When I start it I get this message:
(Embedded image moved to file: pic24868.pcx)
It then says I need to set my preferences...here they are:
(Embedded image moved to file: pic13948.pcx)
I can't import any keys or do anything.  I hope someone can help me find
what I've done wrong.
Thanks in advance for any assistance you can provide.
David Jones
