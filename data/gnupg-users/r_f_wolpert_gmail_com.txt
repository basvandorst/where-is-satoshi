@_subject: Erratic passphrase recognition (gpg (GnuPG/MacGPG2) 2.0.17) 
I am new to gpg -- and I am confronted by a weird, erratic behaviour
of gpg: sometimes it recognises my passphrase, sometimes (alas, a lot
of the time!) it doesn't. Since I can make the passphrase in pinentry
visible I know that I am making no typing mistake. Any advice what I
should do?
Many thanks,
PS. It just right now doesn't let me sign this email...
