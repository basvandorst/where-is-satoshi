@_subject: Can't import valid GPG keys in Ubuntu 
I have a multi-boot system, Windows and Ubuntu 9.10.  I installed Gpg4win on
Windows, and on Ubuntu I installed GNU Privacy Assistant and Kleopatra to
make the encryption process similar on each OS.  All the keys imported
correctly in each OS when I first set up this system, but recently all my
keys disappeared from the Ubuntu installation.  I know the original keys are
still good because I can still import them to Windows, but I get different
results when importing on Ubuntu.
Importing any key from GNU Privacy Assistant give the error, "No keys were
found."  Importing from Kleopatra gives me "Total number processed: 0 Imported: 0."  Using the Passwords and Encryption
Keys applet that came with Ubuntu nothing happens at all.
When I try to create a key in GNU Privacy Assistant it says, "The GPGME
library returned an unexpected error.  The error was: General error  This is
probably a bug in GPA.  GPA will now try to recover from this error.
me the error: Could not create certificate: General error."
"Couldn't generate PGP key.  General error."
All my keys are like this:
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: GnuPG v2.0.12 (MingW32)
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
What can I do to resume using GnuPG on Ubuntu?

That's possible, but I can't seem to use them.  I even checked with Enigmail
and it gives:
Send operation aborted.
Error - encryption command failed
gpg command line and output:
gpg: /home/administrator/.gnupg/gpg.conf:243: invalid option
gpg: /home/administrator/.gnupg/gpg.conf:244: invalid option

I commented them out.
 basic
 socket:///home/administrator/.gnupg/log-socket
Things are working now.  If there's anything I should do about those lines,
let me know.
