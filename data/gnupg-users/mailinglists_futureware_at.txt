@_subject: Feature Request --import-minimal 
GnuPG has an option called --export-minimal, which exports only the minimal key. Unfortunately, GnuPG does not have the same for importing yet, which I would need. Is it possible to have a  --import-minimal function added to Best regards,

@_subject: Batch Options 
Is it possible to put automatic answers into the gnupg config file?
Something like "set sign_uid.okay = yes" in the .gnupg/gpg.conf
That way, those options could be set as a profile in the configuration, and they could be automatically used in -batch mode.
Best regards,
Philipp G?hring
