Hi Frank,
this is the configuration I used on our AIX machines:
    ./configure  --prefix=/usr/local/appl/gnupg-1.0.6 \
                 --enable-static-rnd=egd '--with-egd-socket=~/.gnupg/entropy' \
                 --disable-dynload
And it worked  :-)

When I installed gnupg I looked into the source but I could not figure
out why it tried to build rndlinux.  Since I could force its suppression
by configure options I did not care anymore.
