@_subject: Suppressing passphrase prompt 
Hi All,
I am a new user to GPG and I am hoping that someone on this list can provide an easy answer to this.  When I try to sign & encrypt a file (--sign --
encrypt --armor), gpg prompts me for a passphrase for my secret key.  Is there any way to suppress this prompt?  I need to suppress it because the encryption is going to become part of an automated batch file.

After I posted my question, I did what I should have done in the first place - I checked the archives.  I then found a suggested C solution to the problem which I am going to adapt for my purposes.  Since I am on NT (I should have included that in my original email), I'd be interested in your solution as well.
