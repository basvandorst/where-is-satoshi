@_subject: GPG Setup 
I am rather new at gnupg and encryption. I have spent a good deal of time reading up on the subject. So, I think I understand what my setup should be, but would like input from the experts.  :-)
1. Change to sha256.
2. Generate separate keys for signing, certifying, and encrypting.
3. Generate a revocation certificate.
4. Disable hibernation on all my machines to make sure passwords aren't saved to hibernation file....   (just kidding)
Thank you so much for your comments.
Here is my gpg.conf:
 GPGConf ---+++
keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net
 GPGConf ---+++ 05/28/09 17:27:21 Eastern Daylight Time
# GPGConf edited this configuration file.
# It will disable options before this marked block, but it will
# never change anything below these lines.
 --personal-digest-preferences string
 Set the list of personal digest preferences to string. Use gpg2--version to
 get a list of available algorithms.
# personal-digest-preferences SHA256
personal-digest-preferences H8 H2 H10 H3 H9 H1
 --default-preference-list "string"
 Set the list of default preferences to "string." This preference list is used for
 new keys and becomes the default for "setpref" in the edit menu.

@_subject: Hibernation and secret keys 
I was reading through the archives and came across this one dealing with Hibernation and secret keys:? So, here is the question: Is is possible to secure gpg (or PGP or TrueCrypt for that matter) on a Windows system?
