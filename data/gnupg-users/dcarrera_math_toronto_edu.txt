Not a clue.  pre-compiled packages are always behind.  A pre-compiled

In the case of Windows I figure it might be a while because most of us are
probably not running Windows.  I am not.
Why don't you compile it yourself?  You asked how to do it and I found out
for you.  Now you know.

Check that you have this file.

@_subject: Using GPG to encrypt tape backups 
I have an interesting solution.  You can get expect to run your backup and
answer "yes" when the question comes.  Expect is used to control
interactive programs.
I don't know much about expect, but here is the solution I have.
First make a single shell script that contains your backup.  Expect won't
be happy if you use pipes inside an expect script.
tar cf - backup| gpg -e -r daniel -z 9 -o /dev/nst0
I called this fle encrypt.sh, and made it executable.  Then I made the
expect script:
 -f
# Spawn the program.
spawn ./encrypt.sh
# Wait for the computer to ask "Overwrite (y/N)?"
# Then sned the characters  y  to the process.
expect "Overwrite (y/N)?"  {send "y\r"}
I don't know what the usual extension for expect is, so I called it
'encrypt.xpt'.  I made it executable.  I tried it and it worked fine.
Expect uses TCL, so you can use all the flow-control constructs of TCL.
The spawn line has the form:
spawn program args
If you type 'spawn prog1 | prog2' it will treat "|" and "prog2" as
arguments for prog1.  That's why we needed the shell script.

man page :-)

No such thing as a dumb question. :-)
The simplest thing is to edit '~/.gnupg/options'.  Near the end there is
an option to set a keyserver.  Uncoment it and choose a key server.  My
file says:
keyserver wwwkeys.pgp.net
When you need a public key that you don't have, gpg will try to fetch it
from wwwkeys.pgp.net.
In this particular case, the public key is also posted here:
Highlight and save everything from "-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----"
to "-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----" to a file - say 'gnupg.pub'.  That
is the public key.
I believe that you can then save it to your keyring with:
gpg --import gnupg.pub

It just occurred to me that, since you want to put this on a script, the

@_subject: How to split up gpg data into multiple volumes? 
I don't see how the files having different sizes can produce any
information.  Specially because gpg compresses the data before encrypting
it (eliminating redundancy in the files).
Therefore, if the orignal files are close in size to begin with, the size
of the final files will depend as much on the sizes of the originals as on
the particulars of the data in each one.
This makes guessing information much more difficult ("is it a small file
with little redundancy or a large file with lots of redundancy?").
I don't think you have much to worry.
However, if you wish to have the files the same size, perhaps you could
add some garbage data at the end of the original files.
To "pack" the data into the file, your program would:
1) Add some non-printing character which you are sure will not appear in
the orignal file (perhaps the "bell" character?).
2) Pack a random sequence of characters until you reach the desired size.
3) Encrypt.
To "upack" the data:
1) Decrypt.
2) Search for the given character.
3) Remove everything from there on.
Or perhaps you could keep a table mathing the filename and the number of
characters you added at the end.  And you would keep this table encrypted

Thanks for the help.  I have a few more questions.
Is there any drawback to using a 2048 bit key?  I know that it'll take
longer to make the key the first time, but I don't care.  That's a
one-time thing.
I figure that there must be some sort of tradeoff other than the original
key generation.  Otherwise everyone would be using a 4096 bit key.
Is it actually important to upgrade?
Is it difficult to upgrade?  I mean, will my current public and private
key rings still work?  Will they have to be "translated" to RSA?
Well, if there is no loss, I can just be a little paranoid and go for an
unbreakable key.
I kind of like the idea of having a key that is beyond human technology to
break.  Would a 2048 bit key be beyond our technology to factor?
Also, how complex should my passphrase be?
I chose my passphrase so that guessing it would be roughly equal to
guessing a 128-bit key.  I figure that anymore would be overkill because
it'd be easier to crack the 128-bit key, and any less would compromise the
security of the 128-bit key.
Am I right?

I'm confused.  Perhaps I have severely misjudged the security of my
This is how I calculated it:
Suppose that my passphrase has only lowercase alphabetic characters and
has n characters.  Since there are 26 letters, the number of possible
permutations is 26^n.  Thus, if I want security at least as good as a 128
bit key, I require n such that:
26^n >= 2^128
That gives n >= 28.
If you use mixed case letters and numbers you need:
62^n >= 2^128
Which gives n >= 22
A passphrase with 28 letters is not impossible to remember.  You could,
for instance, come up with a paragraph with more than 28 words and take
the first letter of each word.  That's not quite random, but pretty good.
Add a few unusual characters here and there, some random capitalization
and you'll be good.
Since I know how to type, 28 characters aren't too bad.
Have I made a mistake somewhere here?

smaller keys.
Why is 1024 the maximum for DSA?  That's interesting.

True, true.  You can add another layer of protection by using Tripwire.
I will fire an alarm if anything in pre-defined regions of the file system
changes.  You can add another layer of protection by using POSIX
Capabilities.  Those will limit what kind of thing programs can do.
Even better than either of these is to use SELinux which gives you
mandatory access control (MAC).  A malicious program shouldn't be able to
do anything in theory, even when ran as root, because it needs to be
given permissions to do stuff.
I am not aware of any way to get around MAC.  But there must be one.
Someone mentioned the problem with local security.  You can actually do a
fair bit in that arena.  You can set your CMOS to boot from C only, and
you can put a password on your CMOS.
A skilled attacker with a screwdriver can just pull out the CMOS battery
and put it back in.  The operation only takes a few minutes (I should
know, I had to do this once myself when I FORGOT the CMOS password :-).
Again, this simply reduces the number of people to worry about.
To attain even better security you can encrypt your entire file system.
That way, even if someone steals your hard drive they won't get at your
data.  This slows your system, but a good compromise is to only encrypt
the /home partition.
I am not really that paranoid, but I take confort in knowing that I *can*
attain excellent security if I want.

- Encrypted file system.

- Send all your critical data encrypted.

Hi Joelh,
I don't know the details of how signatures and timestamps work.  However,
it occurs to me that perhaps Alice could send a signature without a

Problems could only occur if Alice's key is compromised after she sends
her email to Terry, and before Terry forwards it to Bob.  If it's
compromised before, Alice won't send the email, if it's compromised after,
Terry's timestamp will identify the authenticity of Alice's email.
Since Terry is probably a computer, and the delay between these events is
probably small, I would think that this is pretty good.
