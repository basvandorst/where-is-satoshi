@_subject: gnupg privicy assistant - card manager. 
I hope this is the correct list to raise this issue at?
The GNU Privicy assistant seems to be working fine, when I start it I can see a list of my keys.
I'd like to use the card manager function, but whenever I invoke it the application returns the error "Error accessing the card", and the status bar reports "Checking for card .. "
Looking at my system logs, start to fill up with:
gnome-keyring-daemon[5531]: unrecognized command: SCD
gnome-keyring-daemon[5531]: unrecognized command: GETEVENTCOUNTER
gnome-keyring-daemon[5531]: unrecognized command: GETEVENTCOUNTER
The last two lines are repeated continiously until the card manager is Otherwise if I run gpg --card-status with a card in the USB card reader I get the following:
gpg: detected reader `Alcor Micro AU9540 00 00'
Application ID ...: D276000124010200000500001EAD0000
Version ..........: 2.0
More stuff follows - but shows the card reader is functional.
At the command prompt I can enter the gpg --card-edit and read and edit the card parameters.
I presume, the system is misconfigured is some way. Any one got any

My pleasure.
I would be interested in how to accomplish this. If you can point me to a thread or reference in the gnupg manual, that would be appreciated.
So Gnome breaks gnupg-agent and they will not fix it?
I prefer the gpg-agent UI. Anyway, Seahorse doesn't seem to know about smart cards so the whole reason I posted, to see my smart card in the card display of gpa  is defeated if I disable gpg-agent.
Unless I have the wrong end of the stick?
