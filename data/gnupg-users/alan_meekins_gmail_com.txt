@_subject: GPG tool for Windows Embeddd Compact 7 
Not all Windows Embedded OSes are built on top of CE! Look here for a
listing of the products.
It sounds like you are likely using Windows Embedded Standard 7(aka WES7,
yuck what a mouthful!) which is just a rebranded version of normal old
Windows 7. If this is the case it means anything that can run on windows
7(big windows) will run on WES7 with no modification. The caveat about
Windows Embedded is that you have the flexibility to strip out just about
any componenet of Windows so the most likely issues you will hit are around
what you have removed from the image causing breaks in 3rd party software
such as GnuPG. So in short we need to know the exact version if Windows you
are running to really give accurate advice. CE is a different world which
may require you to recompile the programs you wish to run depending on your
exact scenario.

@_subject: GPG Assuan protocol usage 
Hi gpg-ers,
I'm interested in utilizing GnuPG in software that I'm writing and it seems
that communicating with the gpg-agent over a unix socket using the Assuan
protocol is best suited for my use case but am open to other options if
there are better approaches.
My problem lies in getting the assuan protocol in practice to match up with
the documentation
When attempting to use the GENKEY command as described
new user I always get an invalid data error when using the example client
socat /tmp/gpg-xxxxx/S.gpg-agent -
Starting gpg-agent with --debug 10 I get the following debug output:
[user at host]:~$ gpg-agent --daemon --no-detach --debug 10
gpg-agent[]: directory `/home/user/.gnupg' created
gpg-agent[]: directory `/home/user/.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d' created
gpg-agent[]: failed to convert keyparam: Invalid length specifier in
gpg-agent[]: command genkey failed: Invalid data
gpg-agent[]: failed to convert keyparam: Invalid length specifier in
gpg-agent[]: command genkey failed: Invalid data
gpg-agent[]: failed to convert keyparam: Invalid length specifier in
gpg-agent[]: command genkey failed: Invalid data
This seems to suggest that there exist more parameters to the GENKEY
command than are documented. What am I missing here? Taking a step back is
this a good solution for 3rd party software to use GPG or are there
libraries I should be using instead to accomplish the communication? Diving
into the code to see if I can't figure it out but maybe you can help.

Ah thanks, that was the problem. Would be helpful if this
updated to reflect the correct syntax for future users.
Was just using socat for testing purposes. My system requires the lowest
latency and fewest memcpy's possible so if I continue with the socket
interface I will use it directly. Since posting I've come across the Qt
Cryptographic Architecture (qca) which looks to be a better approach for me
as I'm already developing in Qt.
Thanks again,
