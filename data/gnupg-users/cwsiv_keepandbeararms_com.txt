Is there a limit as to how people to whom a message can be encrypted. In the old days of pgp2.6.x the limit was three.

please get them to switch to eudora or you will be cleaning viruses
every day.  goto the gnupg.org site and check the front ends.  It will be
much easier for the windows people to use.
If its just for yourself then knoppix privacy edition bootable linux cd
will handle it nicely.

@_subject: can receive, but not send, encrypted e-mail 
Since no one else has answered Ill take a wack at the problem.
first are you trying for inline or attached signatures?  Inline being
the more universal hence my use of kgpg in kde when I need encryption.
Can you encrypt messages with the Enigmail front end if you cut and
paste into its editor?

What you seem to want is a ramdisk something existing since the days of
16bit DOS.  Distro?  How much memory?  How much Harddrive and how is it partitioned?
Why not an encrypted partition? In Suse you have the option to create
one at install time.  Does your local university have a linux group?

Yes keep the 6gb for win98 and put it on a caddy then get a WD for *nix.
Put both caddys on the system that way you can mount the win98 system
and do backup via the *nix.  to boot the 98 just switch the drives.

Interesting I get only lowercase letters not the capitols you indicate.
I made my keys with 1.2.4 under and updated Suse 8.2 now 9.1
Is this a display variation or something wrong.  Note some have more

@_subject: wiping files 
for windows look for a utility called erase or shred which is a port of
the *nix utility.  You can always use the standard delete which puts
things in /windows/desktop/trash then in console use shred on those
periodically.  Not perfect but if you do it daily it should not be  a
major chore.

@_subject: paraphrase 
There is a command line method but that requires the password to be in
the open.
Then again you could use a script to break out the password from the
first file and pass it as an environment variable to the second one.
But thats no better because the first passphrase is in the open.
Best to google for a gnupg based password protector.

Don't worry about Opera just use a good stand alone shell for gnupg.
I use both kgpg and Seahorse in *nix.  GNU.org has several links to front ends for gnupg.

@_subject: gnupg and the Bat  //  ? possible in linux    under wine 
We have no need for windows front ends.  In Gnome there is Seahorse
which comes from SourceForge.  In KDE there is kgpg both of which have
editors to facilitate use of inline signatures for PGP compatability.

@_subject: Second problem...gpg or kgpg? 
Seahorse is source only unless someone creates RPM.  So far I find its
main problem is SuSE uses different names for certain libraries so
the ./compile step fails.
BTW Seahorse is up to 1.x stable with 2.x beta.
I have 10.0 here and 9.2 on an old PII for email.
