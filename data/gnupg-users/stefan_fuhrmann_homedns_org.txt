@_subject: import keys from PGP 8.03 
Hello List,
I'am trying to get the gnupg running on ubuntu Linux. I want to use
Evolution as mail client.
 I have a PGP key that I had imported from PGP 8.03 to gnupg. And I
can't encrypt or sign I got the message that the secure key is missing
but when I have a look with "gpg --list-keys"  all seems to be okay.
What is wrong??
I tried gpa , but the gui comes up with the question if I want to create
a key or not and then the gui stand complitily still.
It seems that my imported key is not the default key. But I set it over
the bash "gpg --default-key name" but here I get the possibility to
write text. I can't see that my selected key is default.
I want to use ubuntu as my desktop environment, it's made for this and I
test it now. And it's important to me to get a running encrytion.
Please, can someone help me with this issues??

thanks for answering!!!
I solved the Problem now.
I failure was that I imported the keys over root Terminal. I just
imported the keys with normal user account than I had to trust again.
that was it. Cool-- now it works.
Interessed to a linux desktop distro??
Try based on debian!
Try the LIVE-CD.
Booting from cdrom, no installation needed to have a look!!

@_subject: linux-gpg and win-pgp 
Hello all,
Im using kubuntu and so kmail with gnupg.
When I send an encrypted mail to win user who has pgp the encrypted mail is 1.) Why this message is attached and pgp is not able to decrypt it?
I have to save it first and decrypt it then. 2.) Is there a way to sent this mail so that win users have the mail in the mail body and not as attachment?
But when I do it some german characters are not displayed!
3.) What is the reason for it?
The character set under my linux is okay!
When I use win-pgp with this characters ??? and so on all is okay also under my linux , only when I send the mail from my linux to a win and trying to decrypt with pgp I have the problems with pgp and the characters.
4.) How can I solve this?
Can someone help?

okay, most of the win users have outlook....so what....?
Cant find something like that.
hmmm... I dont understand this: when I save the message the information is lost?! Why?
 And how can win-PGP users decrypt such messages? With a correct character set I tried a lot and search a lot but cant find a solution.
maybe somone has an idea??

@_subject: cant sent a sig with inline openpgp 
Hello all,
I use kubuntu with kmail and kgpg.
When I try to send a mail with signature and I use "inline openpgp" then the sig is attached and not inline. I see this when I send a mail to winusers and Can someone tell me how I can send a signature inline? So PGP on outlook can read it?
