I did this with $ gpg2 --expert --edit-key key N - to select hte proper subkey

@_subject: Usability of OpenSSL vs GNUPG 
Most of the criticism I have seen is that it is difficult for the target users of a specific use case to use gpg effectively to protect themselves.  This is things like message/email encryption/verification.
I haven't seen OpenSSL pitched as the GPG replacement here, possibly for the reasons you cite.  Mostly I see, use application X (Signal, etc.) and don't believe email can reasonably be secured without ALL parties being "experts" at GPG.  The one use case no one seems to have a replacement for is "encrypt this file on disk for me to use later."
My understanding is that most people encounter OpenSSL configured by someone else who is presumably a technical expert.
What usecases do you have in mind?

@_subject: Identifying one of multiple authentication subkeys 
I would like to eliminate my SSH keys and consolidate my existing keys into my gpg key.  I can do this by either importing my existing keys (easier) or creating new authentication subkeys.
Either way, I am unsure how to identify which subkey is which SSH key.  I created a test key, below, with two authentication subkeys.  I can't tell which subkey matches each key.  How do you know?  Without this knowledge it is hard to know which key goes with which server and which key is safe to delete later.
Any advice?  Thank you.

@_subject: Identifying one of multiple authentication subkeys 
This worked and will allow me to associate the keygrips with the old identify file names for my own bookkeeping/sanity.  This way as a project terminates, so can its key.
I think having the ability to name or associate metadata here is a nice-to-have for those of us managing multiple auth subkeys.
That said, I have a new problem of course :D
There is no longer an identityfile to use in the .ssh/config file which means all auth keys are tried with all hosts.  I have multiple auth keys and the hosts give up after 2 or 3 failures.  How can I get the right key served to the right host since SSH doesn't know how to ask for it anymore ...
PS: This should possibly be a new thread, however, there are so few discussions of multiple auth-subkeys I feel like a searcher is likely to wind up here first.

@_subject: Identifying one of multiple authentication subkeys 
Having done no code examination, I feel like this is where the identity information for subkeys comes into play.  I presume the SSH request would pass the value of the identity file to the gpg-agent.  This is probably 100% wrong though/
Also, as an aside.  It appears that subkeys do not prompt for the key passphrase.  Instead I just get an allow/deny dialog or no dialog at all if I don't force confirm.
Happily - and I should have last time.  Distracting myself with GPG/SSH while doing taxes is a bad idea and leads to bad internet hygiene :D

Hi Peter,
Your help has been amazing and very useful.  I was re-reading this answer and I noticed the comments below:
How did you import this key?  Monkeysphere's pem2opengpg only reads older formats that don't support comments.  I didn't see anything about import from the newer formats in my searches.
Should I open a feature request on this, or have you already done so?
