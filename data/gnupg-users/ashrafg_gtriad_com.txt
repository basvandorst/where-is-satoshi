Can we use GPG to decrypt any file using batch mode .. i.e . I do not want
to manually enter the passphrase. I need to store it in a file and pass the
file name in my options.
  Ex :
 When I Encrypt my file I use :
 gpg.exe  --output [Filename.gpg] --recipient [name]   Filename.txt
  where : Filename.txt is my original file
             Filename.gpg is my encrypted file
             name is my key name
Now When I'm decrypting my file, I need to do the following
gpg.exe --output [Filename.txt]  --decrypt    ????? Filename.key
  where : Filename.txt  is my decrypted file
             Filename.gpg is my encrypted file
             Filename.key is my passphrase stored in a file
