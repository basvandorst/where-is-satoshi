@_subject: Problem with "gpg-connect-agent" command 
Good day! I am trying to follow the setup guide here:
it is all fine, until I get to the following command
gpg-connect-agent "KEYINFO --list" /bye
instead of writing KEYINFO, it just outputs "OK".
Please, could you tell, how to solve this problem?
