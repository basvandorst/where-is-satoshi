@_subject: question on decryption with missing passcode 
I do not understand.  If usually you just "use the passcode" to
decrypt the backup file, why did you treat the early December
2012 differently?  Whys should the "vendor" handle this?  Why not
you, in the usual way, by using the passcode for that backup
If I understand correctly:
1. There was an original file, call it A .
2. gzip was applied to A to get the file A.gz .
3. Then gpg was applied to get A.gz to get A.gz.gpg .
I ask
What operation of gpg was applied to produce A.gz.gpg from A.gz ?
Is the "passcode" a PGP public key, or something else?
I have likely not understood how things work, but one natural
way, it seems to me, would be to have the course publish a PGP
public key, and anyone who wanted to send a file to the
teachers/administrators of the course could just use gpg to send
the file, not as cleartext, but encrypted with the public key of
the course.  In this situation, there would be no "passcode"
provided by the vendor, but rather just the course's own public
key, with the course carefully keeping the corresponding private
key private.
Perhaps gpg's encryption failed.  But more likely it seems to me
the big file was corrupted in transit.  I have heard, though it
always seemed almost unbelievable, that some http browsers
corrupt files, unless the browser is specifically told not to.
It is also the case, and this I believe easily, that many email
stacks corrupt files sent via the stack.  I believe this easily
because I remember the early, and now traditional, misdesign of
parts of our email system.
I'd try getting hold of the file by transporting it from the
vendor to you by using "rsync --rsh=ssh ...".  In my experience
rsync is reliable for even gigabyte files.

Ah, I missed that.  Indeed, as others also have suggested and
argued, that message suggests that gpg cannot even open the file.

MFPA, thank you for a very clear and useful answer!
I have just now read the Wikipedia article on X.509 and the article on SSL:
      [page was last modified on 12 April 2013 at 06:34]
      [page was last modified on 18 April 2013 at 09:31]
I read the standard documentation once, but I read it many years
ago, and I never wrote any code, nor ran any simulations of how a
"network" of X.509 certificates might work.  There is much to
think about here.
Here is a short version of what I think is a good question:
Many people buy stuff from Amazon and other
companies/organizations/people by communicating over the Net.
For explame, people use credit cards.  I believe that certain
data is in transit between the buyer and seller, and the reverse
too, encrypted, using as part of the communications stack SSL
(actually TLS nowadays, I think).  I have the impression that
many people learn how to buy stuff by this method, that is, using
a credit card with SSL in the stack.  But learning to use GnuPG
seems much harder to most people who have learned how to buy
stuff using a credit card over the Net.
Here are some pieces of my question:
1. Is the stack used for credit card use over the Net sufficiently "secure"?
Indeed this question is ill defined: "secure" for what, against what?
2. In what ways does the problem of email encryption differ from
the problem of encrypting credit card and other money-valuable
data in transit, with http as the transport protocol?
3. If the stack used for credit card use over the Net is good
enough for most purchases, could we use a similar stack to secure
email in transit?  In particular, could we use a similar stack,
with a similar ease of learning and ease of use, as perceived by
most of the people who today buy stuff using a credit card over
the Net?

Ship a device.
Your argument seems to show that, in order to get more people
using encrypted email, we should use part of the system you think
is superior, namely the browser with whatever crypto stack your
banks use.  If such a superior system for easy delivery of well
encrypted stuff exists I would like to learn about it.

@_subject: Why the software is crap 
Of course you are, in part, right.  GnuPG should be easier to set
up and use.  The GnuPG team is well aware of this and work to
make GnuPG easier to use.  But your claims as to the difficulty
of moving keys are not true.  Yesterday at a large organization,
I explained to a cow-orker how to create and distribute keys.
The meeting did not take two hours.  We are now testing the
sub-system, and so far, it seems to work, that is, it does the
job of encryption and decryption.
You claim that you cannot just copy over .gnupg from machine A to
machine B and get a working set of keys on machine B.  But I have
done this successfully more than a few times.  I do not have a
page of instructions, but if you wish, I will meet with you and
we can try to find and/or write such a page.  I think there
already exists such a page, published on the Net, and published
in paper and ink book form, but I will not look for it now.

Thank you, Diego!
One failure of the culture of Usenet and many mailing lists is an
unreasonable reluctance to publish exact specific code, in answer
to a question about how to do something.  Often an answer of this
form is given:
   Ah, you just have to frobniculate the upper side parser, then
   reduce the dimension of the third homotopy group by killing all
   high pressure *reverse* constraints forced by the file which
   specifies the Lipschitz spectrum, at level 2.  Then just restart
   the daemon.  It may take a minute or two, if the network checks
   are fully enabled, but that is the only trouble I have ever
   had, doing it this way.  Some vora114 administrators recommend
   re-compiling all of the Lipschitz spectrum, some even suggest
   regenerating the Sobolev softmax pragmata, but I have never
   found that necessary.
which is correct, and easily understood by anyone who already
knows how to do the task, but difficult to understand, if you do
not already know how to do the task.  A more useful answer is:
   Become root on the machine.  Then do
   root at example:~# cd /etc/vora114
   root at example:~# cp -a lipschitz.conf lipschitz.conf.bak
   root at example:~# echo frob upper 2 safe >> side-parse.conf
   root at example:~# echo :l2 v.. greater-than > l2.l.rev.remove
   root at example:~# grep -v -f l2.l.rev.remove lipschitz.conf > lipschitz.conf.temp
   root at example:~# mv lipschitz.conf.temp lipschitz.conf
   root at example:~# /etc/init.d/vora114 force-reload
   You may, if vora114 checks all network connections, have to
   wait a few minutes for vora114 to fully start.  So wait five
   minutes and then do
   root at example:~# /etc/init.d/vora114 status
   and send us a copy of the first sixty lines of output.

Have you sat down, in front of one or more of the computers at
issue here, with a friend who is experienced and willing to help?
If not you have not begun the serious task of debugging.  You
have a stack of stuff, which is fragile in the traditional way,
and from your reports to this list, it is difficult to tell where
the problem might lie.
I do have two pieces of finite advice:
1. Do not re-install your OS.  Re-installing will just introduce
    further difficulties which have, almost surely, nothing to do
    with your original problem.
2. Attempt to get GnuPG its own self setup right, without
    involving Enigmail, GNUIPGFront22.6, or
    Filbert-Kong-Crypto-Manager.  Use only the command line.

I use Debian.  On my system, if I open a terminal, and then,
whether I am root or no, give the command:
   apt-cache search gnupg
apt returns a long list of packages.  Here are the last few:
pinentry-tty - minimal dumb-terminal PIN or pass-phrase entry for GnuPG
python-gnupg - Python wrapper for the GNU Privacy Guard (Python 2.x)
python3-gnupg - Python wrapper for the GNU Privacy Guard (Python 3.x)
libqca2-plugin-gnupg - transitional package for libqca2-plugins
signing-party - Various OpenPGP related tools
gnupg-doc - GNU Privacy Guard documentation
gnupg-agent - GNU privacy guard - cryptographic agent
gnupg2 - GNU privacy guard - a free PGP replacement (new v2.x)
gnupg2-dbg - debugging symbols for gnupg2
gpgsm - GNU privacy guard - S/MIME version
scdaemon - GNU privacy guard - smart card support
On Debian, if you are connected to the Net, and if you do, as root;
   apt-get update
and then
   apt-get install gnupg-doc gnupg-agent gnupg2
apt should install the above three packages.
Likely Ubuntu has a "GUI" wrapper or an equivalent for apt.  I'd
have guessed that the "Ubuntu Software Center" would be it, and
that the USC would show you gnupg easily.

Well, I see gnupg in the list, I am not sure whether it is gnupg2 or not.
gpg is hard to set up.  Even after it is set up to do what you
want, your correspondent must also have a working gpg/PGP system,
else you will not be able to communicate using gpg as your
encrypt/decrypt system.  The Free Software Forces have, so far,
failed to produce an email crypto system which one billion people
could use.  We have a good central armature for such a system,
namely gpg, but the stuff around gpg is in practice very
difficult to use.
What do you want to with GnuPG?
