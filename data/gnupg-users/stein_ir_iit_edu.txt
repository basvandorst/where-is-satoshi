@_subject: pinentry stdin problems 
Hash: SHA1
I recently upgraded from GPG v1.4 to GPG v2.
Previously, I was able to do this:
tar c | gpg -s > a.tar.gpg
However, with the new version that uses pinentry,
it does not allow me to insert my password
whenever I redirect stdin as above.  I don't
even get the ncurses password entry box.
Is there a way to make this work as before?
Can pinentry be made to fallback to the plain text
password entry, should the other ones fail?
