hi ,
i am doing project on network security using cryptography.
where, i use a authenticating server which check the authenticable client user.
In this i use gnupg to generate keys and encrypted messages.
my query is that can i use gnupg commands in the client program or just the encrypted message file which will be send to the authenticatin
g server.
another query is that during exporting public key can i use ip address
to send the key to another p.c.
whether i have to communicate through client-server program or
gnupg will connect to another p.c.
