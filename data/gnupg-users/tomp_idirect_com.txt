Hi John
In doc\gnupg1.texi change line 4 from:
 'version.texi
 include 'version.texi
The 'c' after ' changes the line to a comment (and fixes your problem)
That is the quick and dirty fix if you don't need any documentation.

Hello Prasanth Thandra
in the folder /etc/ld.so.conf.d create a file called gpg2.conf (as root)
gpg2.conf contains one line
"/usr/local/lib" (without quotes)
reboot system or enter the command "ldconfig -v" (without quotes)
gpg2 was able to find libksba.so.0
