Doesn't ?--passphrase-file? need an argument, does it?  If so,
gpg looks for a passphrase file named ?-o?.

This is the GnuPG privacy handbook rather than the GnuPG manual.
I suggest that you read the GnuPG manual
() also, as
it is the definitve instruction how to use GnuPG.
A better way of committing the changes is typing in ?save?.
Please see the GnuPG manual
For the ?--edit-key? main command (given at the command line) it
lists the sub commands (to be typed into the edit key command
    Save all changes to the keyrings and quit.
    Quit the program without updating the keyrings. This is to remind you that you are about to discard your changes.
The GnuPG manual (not the privacy handbook) mentions both of
?save? and ?quit? and explains the difference.
Just remember to read the GnuPG manual also.
This isn't a general (?the?) GnuPG shell for all GnuPG commands,
it is a shell for the limited set of ?--edit-key? sub commands.
That is, the ?--edit-key? specified at the GnuPG invocation
command line lets GnuPG run an interactive interpreter for the
?--edit-key? subcommands that have to be typed in.
Generating this list doesn't need to ask the user to type any sub
commands, so there is no ?--list-secret-keys? shell.
If GnuPG has written this list into its standard output channel,
the job is done, thus GnuPG terminates, nobody is ?kicked out?.
You enter the shell that recognizes the limited set of the
?--edit-key? sub commands.
Please read the GnuPG manual
   ?gpg may be run with no commands. In this case it will perform
   a reasonable action depending on the type of file it is given
   as input (an encrypted message is decrypted, a signature is
   verified, a file containing keys is listed, etc.).?
So GnuPG expects that you type in an encrypted message, a
detached signature, a clear?signed message, a public key block, etc.
Here you cannot type a GnuPG command, because GnuPG wants input,
i.e. data.  As you haven't specified any input file on the
command line, GnuPG wants this data through its standard input
channel, that is, typed in from the keyboard.
Unless the end of data is signalled (by typing the end?of?file
character, with UNIX usually control d, with MS Windows perhaps
control z), GnuPG repeats reading input lines.
This ?quit? is counted an input line of data, too.
You don't in general start the GnuPG shell.  You put a command on
the invocation command line.  This command may or may not be an
interactive command.
If it is (as with ?--edit-key?), GnuPG starts a sub command shell
(as with ?--edit-key?) to read and execute further sub commands.
If it is not (as with ?--list-keys?, ?--sign?, ?--encrypt?,
etc.), GnuPG may (as with ?--sign?, ?--encrypt?, ?--decrypt?,
etc.) expect input to process, or may not (as with ?--list-keys?,
etc.) expect any input.
Please remember:  GnuPG is not a program, that does what you
mean.  It is a program, that does exactly what you command it to
do.  Thus you must know how to command GnuPG to do what you want
it to do for you.

I think, this can be done with GnuPG as it is:
In the following GnuPG invocations $TEMP_KEYRING stands for a
temporary key ring:
(1) export Bob's key from your default key ring, minimize it, and
    import it into the temporary one.
    $ gpg --export-options=export-minimal \
    --export =user_id_of_Bob | \
    gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring=$TEMP_KEYRING --import
Now you have Bob's public key minimized in the temporary key
(2) lsign a user id of Bob:
    $ gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring=$TEMP_KEYRING \
    --lsign =user_id_of_Bob
(3) export this version of Bob's public key into a public key
    block Bob.pubkey, that you can give to Alice:
    $ gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring=$TEMP_KEYRING \
    --export-options=export-local-sigs \
    --output Bob.pubkey \
    --export
(4) import your local signature into your default key ring:
    $ gpg --import-options=import-local-sigs --import Bob.pubkey
Alice would do the same:  Import Bob's keyblock Bob.pubkey
into a temporary key ring using
--import-options=import-local-sigs, lsign it there, export it
using --export-options=export-local-sigs into
Bob.pubkey, give Bob.pubkey to Mary and import
Bob.pubkey using --import-options=import-local-sigs in
her default key ring.

A solution for the verify use case: Just read the manual
and use ?--no-auto-check-trustdb?.
