If you do really think so, then you should IMHO actually ask yourself if
it is a good idea to release gpg under the terms of the GPL.
GPL means - as far as I understand it - that everyone is free to use the
product for whatever reason one wants. This is also valid for commercial
use and even for creating licensing keys.
Sorry to say that, but GPL means freedom.

Hash: SHA1
Hello to all,
I actually did carefully read through all the statements on the mailing
list about pgp 5.0 / gpg - compliance. It seems that all problems occured
when decrypting gpg-encrypted documents on pgp 5.0. With me, it's just the
opposite - a pgp 5.0 for OS/2 user is not able to send me encrypted mail
using my gpg key. His soft says that my key is not good enough for her
majesty. ;) Serious though, pgp 5.0 claims that my key cannot be used and
exits with the error message: "No algorithm available that all keys
Did I miss something? I always thought that DSS/DH are completely
compatible (or even the same) as DSA/ElGamal. If not, am I able to
generate a DSS/DH-key which to use in communication with them?
I also heard that PGP 5.0 messages are somehow weird encoded and should
not be sent armored but as binary to be encoded. Any suggestions for this?
