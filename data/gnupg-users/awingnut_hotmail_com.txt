Thanks for the reply. I admit I am behind but as there were no problems
there was no real need to change GPG.
As I said in the original message I believe the problem is associated with
the way the agent determines the path for the .gnupg directory if the user's
home is auto-mounted via Open Directory.
The specific error is:
gpg-agent[6675]: error binding socket to
Operation not supported
While that path is perfectly valid ($HOME) I have never been able to get it
to work with anything for unknown reasons. The path that I believe would
work is  '/Volumes/USER1/Users-home/xxxxxxx/.gnupg/S.gpg-agent'. However,
the best path would be ~xxxxxxx/.gnupg/S.gpg-agent'.

I am trying to upgrade to GPG2 and am having trouble, I think all stemming
from the new user agent feature. My first question: is there a way to simply
not use the user agent (i.e. just enter the passphrase as before) since it
does not seem to work in my environment? I tried using 'echo' and piping it
to the 'gpg' command with '--passphrase-fd 0' but it prompts for the
password anyway. Also, it appears to be looking for something related to the
user agent in .gnupg and produces an error because whatever path it is using
it completely wrong for a network mounted home directory. Where can I fix
that path?
FWIW, this is on an OS X 10.5 machine managed by Open Directory.
