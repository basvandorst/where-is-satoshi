Since you have posted your question so many times you have my
First I don't use perl or mutt, but I have a web server and perl and
probably mutt installed on my machine.
I also have just now created a key (and installed GnuPG), so my
thoughts are related to the way my pgp works rather than gpg.
When I sign my mail (and I would imagine encryption works the same
way) it uses the header of the mail in the mime formatting.  I have
some sort of bourne shell script that creates the mime message as
multipart/encrypted.  This script was downloaded from the net some
time back, and could probably still be found if you are interested.
What this script does I believe is to modify a mime message to encrypt
it and/or sign it replacing the original.  Then when it is completed
(I use emacs for mail), I read it in and send it on its way.
Is this something you are looking for?

PGP/MIME is a weird animal.  The message is signed with some of the mime
headers, I guess to insure that noone changes the file type from msword to
excel or something.  If your mail program saves the parts, it is very
difficult to put them back into a message for which the signature is sure
to be correct.

This message is in MIME format.  The first part should be readable text,
  while the remaining parts are likely unreadable without MIME-aware tools.
  Send mail to mime for more info.
A little odd seeing my name on someone else's message. :)  There are not
many Walters here.
My preference would have definately been to have a signature sign a part
before it is attached to an email.  In this format, mail programs that
save parts automatically (like what someone mentioned of eudora), the part
can still be verified.  It would still have been possible to sign a
multipart/mixed.  I am guessing there is a way to write a multipart mixed
to a file here.  It is definately not something that is usually done.  I
guess that doesn't make much sense.  Signing multipart would be about
equivalent to the current for signing the whole message.  And for programs
that automatically save attachments, it would not be possible to put
together the multipart to check a signature.
Basically I would like to sign a simple message (text only) by attaching a
signature that would work when checking only the text body (no mime
header).  Similar signatures could be made for each part.  The signature
should be against the format of the part when saved rather than the format
in the message.  I would at least guess that the CRLF would be used when
generating a signature for text parts anyways.
I suppose I could just start making my signatures in this way.  People
would not likely understand what to do with a signature, but most people I
write don't use pgp or gpg anyways.
Sorry this is probably not the correct place to discuss this, but I am
unsure where is, and the topic came up on this list.

Ok.  I see your point.  My reasons for disliking it, as stated in a
previous email have to do with the fact that you can't check the
signature unless you have the email parts of the message (including
the headers) rather than just the signed part.
For example, an email that has only the text/plain part before it is
signed will become a multipart/signed afterwards.  This multipart
signed when saved using MH will have 752.1.txt and
752.2.pgp-signature (assuming message 752 in the example).  However I
cannot check the signature without adding to the text message the lines from the original message:
Content-Disposition: inline

There is apparently a bug in tkrat, where it creates a bad signature if
I have a return on the last line.  I had just sent a test message to
myself before writing to the list, and was sure it would work.  Now I
know what the problem is anyways.

I spent a considerable amount of time trying to solve the error.
Everytime, I was getting the false impression that I solved the error. I
would send a test message to myself and it would work.  It turns out,
there was a problem in the program where after the first body has been
printed to a file, it would create an extra carriage return/line feed at
the beginning of following bodies.  I am not sure where this extra line
gets removed at a later time, but I have corrected my own version and
sent a bug report to the author (as well as my own patch).  If someone
is interested in using tkrat, I can email them the patch to get it
working correctly.
Something else I found in the code is a difference in the
multipart/signed header where it states the micalg=pgp-sha1 (or what it
had set to pgp-md5).  I am guessing that gnupg defaults to sha1, and
therefore set it to print this instead.  I would also suppose that gpg
can handle both, and it is not necessary to pass a flag to specify the
algorithm.  I will likely pass this to the tkrat author as well.
Now that I have it working, I highly recommend it as it has IMAP,
threading, and a handy watcher that can be used in place of xbiff.  This
watcher is more like tkbiff in that it gives you the author and subject
of the mail rather than just the beep and flag raise.

With a hotmail address it would be very difficult to use your key with your messages.

@_subject: gpg 1.0.1 cannot decrypt stuff encrypted by gpg 1.0.3 
TkRat is noticing that there are PGP messages in the mail.  It is
prompting for the password to a key you don't have.  I think it searches
the message for the BEGIN PGP tag, and prompts for the password based on
that.  The sender did not send an encrypted mail to the list (except for
the two example messages within the mail).
