@_subject: Faulting application gpg2 
Hi there...
Was there an answer to the query: Faulting application gpg2
As I am having exactly the same issue...
Faulting application gpg2.exe, version 0.0.0.0, time stamp 0x4fa14f63, faulting module unknown, version 0.0.0.0, time stamp 0x00000000, exception code 0xc0000005, fault offset 0x00000000, process id 0x1068, application start time 0x01cdb760d48d32b0.
If I run gpg -help logged on as user_account it works fine... but if I use a shell program (Autosys) to log on as the same user to execute the same command it fails with the above message
Please help!!!
