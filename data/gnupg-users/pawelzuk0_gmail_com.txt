@_subject: GNUPG 1.2.1 problem 
I use gnupg 1.2.1 version
For same cases during decrypting I receive:
gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit RSA key, ID 453733BB, created 2006-02-13           "Comapny (User) "         gpg: md_enable: algorithm 8 not available                                 gpg: Signature made Tue May 19 16:10:09 2009 CEST using RSA key ID FD947F6A
gpg: Can't check signature: unknown digest algorithm                      There is any possibility to skip this error. I can not upgrade my current version of gnupg
