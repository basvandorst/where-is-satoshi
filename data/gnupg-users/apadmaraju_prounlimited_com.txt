@_subject: Problem after going from gpg 1.2.6 to 1.4.5 
We upgraded from gpg 1.2.6 to 1.4.5 on "Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS
release 4 (Nahant Update 5)".
After that we encrypted a file as "/usr/bin/gpg --armor --output
$out_file --encrypt -q --yes -r '$gpg_userid' $file".
However, with 1.4.5 we get an encrypted file everything in one line
and gets cut at 80th char.  With 1.2.6 we used to get an encrypted
file in multiple lines with 80 chars per line and was able to see
complete file.
With 1.4.5, how to get it in 80 char format per line?  Right now we
cannot upgrade to beyond 1.4.5 because of consistency issues.
Thank you,

Hi Werner,
Thank you for the replay.
We found the issue is not related to GPG, but with file conversion.  It is
no more a issue now.  Please ignore this.
 Thank you,
 Anil

@_subject: gnupg not working with RHEL 4 
This is an important issue for me.  I would really appreciate, if any one
can help.
Server 1:
I have a server with Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS release 4 (Nahant Update
5) and having gnupg version 1.2.6.
When I am trying to import a key, I am getting below problem and the key is
not getting imported.  The key is 2048 bits.
# gpg --import /key.asc
gpg: DSA requires the use of a 160 bit hash algorithm
gpg: DSA requires the use of a 160 bit hash algorithm
gpg: DSA requires the use of a 160 bit hash algorithm
gpg: DSA requires the use of a 160 bit hash algorithm
gpg: key ACF6FA22: no valid user IDs
gpg: this may be caused by a missing self-signature
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:           w/o user IDs: 1
Server 2:
I have an another server with Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 5.5
(Tikanga) and with gncpg version 1.4.5.  On this I am able to import the
same key successfully.
Unfortunately, I cannot upgrade Linux on Server 1.  What I have to do to
solve the problem with gpg import on Server 1?
Do I have to upgrade the gncpg on Server 1 or is there alternate solution?
If I have to upgrade gncpg, to which version of gncpg I have to update?  I
cannot use up2date because the Server 1 is not subscribed to RHN.  So what
will be the alternate way to upgrade without up2date.
Thank you very much,

Thank you very much, David.
Our other server is having 1.4.5 and to be consistent want to go from 1.2.6
to 1.4.5.
Can I go ahead and update gnupg from 1.2.6 to 1.4.5 on "Red Hat Enterprise
Linux AS release 4 (Nahant Update 5)"?  Is 1.4.5 compatible with this Linux
version?  I did not find any information regarding this compatibility.
Thank you,

Thank you, David and Werner.
This is first time I am upgrading gnupg.  Are there any steps or document
to download source, compile, and upgrade?  I did some search in google, but
could not find detailed one.
After upgrading do I have to do gpg --gen-key or it is only needed when we
install for the first time?
Thank you,

I am using  to do the
upgrade.  Please let me know, if I have to do any additional steps.
Since I am already using gpg on this server, do I have to do "gpg
--gen-key" after the upgrade?
Thank you,

@_subject: File extension is .txt for gpg import. Is that ok? 
Hi Gnupg Users,
I have question that on of the user gave a file to import and the file
is having .txt extension, for example test.txt.  I usually import
files having .asc or .gpg extensions.  Can I do "gpg --import
test.txt" with that .txt file extension?
Thank you,
