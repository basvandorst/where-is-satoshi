@_subject: GPGShell for MAC? 
Hello All,
I have installed the GPGShell for Windows on the Win2k laptop and really
enjoy the functionality of it.  I can encrypt/decrypt/verify the clipboard
contents, I can encrypt/decrypt files by right clicking on them, etc. Well I am migrating to the MAC.  In particular an new TiBook runing MacOS
X.  I am looking for something along the same lines as the GPGShell for
Windows but for the MAC.  What are my options?

is there an ETA for 1.2?  We can not run 1.1.xx in production but would
like to use some of the new features.

I have been reading about the automated signing of people's key via a
robot.  I have mixed feelings about it.  First off, I like the idea, that I
can get it signed by "someone" else (although it is not really a person)
without any real effort.  But I do have issues with it.  The robot is
signing people's keys without knowing anything about them, except having
their email address.  This kinda defeats the purpose of people signing
other people's keys so there is a web of trust.
For me the jury is still out on whether I like this or not.
I will do more research on this before I make my final judgment.

in theory you can have as many keys as you want.  I try to keep my number
of keys to a minimum.  I have 2 sets of keys.  1 for signing/encrypting
and 1 for encrypting (the later one is a larger key).  When you get new
email accounts that you want to add, you can add an email account to an
existing key.  Removing it later is not as easy so just dont add every
little email address in the world that you have.  But anyone of the ones
you have that is permament (or I should say semi-permament) is a good
yes and you can use either key.  They both will be on you private keyring
and public keyring.
