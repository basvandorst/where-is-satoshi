@_subject: Some broken links on the openpgp website 
Hello, i'm new to this list/community so I hope this is the place to report
such things.
* Links for list pages are broken in  there's a port
  (8002) in the urls which if you remove will take you to the correct pages.
  These links are ok in * Also, the links to portuguese and japanese gnupg pages are broken in
   Pt seems to not exist
  anymore, and Jp might be going through some configuration hard times.
If this is not the place, can someone point me to the correct place to report
Thanks for the nice piece of software!
