@_subject: Problems with the gnupg 1.0.1 and FreeBSD 3.3 
Hi Dennis,
    I get this a lot myself. I'm running gnupg on an old sparc 2 running
redhat 6.1 . I'm using this machine for development so its not doing
anything other than my telnet session usually. I get around this problem by
working on the console and bashing away at the keyboard frantically until
the key is generated. I also keep the key length down to 1024, which is
annoying to say the least. It took be a while to figure out that typing on
the keyboard from a remote session doesn't do any good, is this perhaps what
you are doing?
