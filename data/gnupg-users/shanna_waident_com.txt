@_subject: Option to change location where encrypted files are saved? 
I have installed gnupg for a client along with gpgshell to make it easy for
them to right click a file and sign and encrypt it.  The one additional
thing I'd like to do is configure it to save it to a network drive
automatically instead of saving it in the same folder as the original
unencrypted file.  Does anybody know of a way to do this within gpgshell?
