Hash: SHA1
Howdy all. I've just released version 0.7 ("the Brown Paper Bag" release) of
EGD. The Entropy Gathering Daemon is primarily intended as a source of
randomness for GnuPG, for use on systems which lack a /dev/random device.
version 0.6, which has been available for about 8 months, had a serious and
embarrasing bug in which the gathered random data (the output from 'vmstat'
and other programs) was not properly fed into the entropy pool. The resulting
data stream would have been hard to predict (it was still influenced by the
timing and quantity of program output), but had far far less entropy than it
claimed to provide. Many thanks to Brian Carrier for spotting the problem.
Other changes:
