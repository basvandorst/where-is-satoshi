@_subject: Merging secret keyrings 
Hi everybody,
how can I merge two secrings? I've got an old one (with my old secret key)
and a new one (with my new secret key) but I can't export the secret key
from the old one and import to the new one because the primary key is already
present there:
gpg: key 14DCBC1F: already in secret keyring
Can i merge them somehow else?

@_subject: Can we combine secret keyrings? 
I'm searching for a way to combine two secrings. I've got an old one (with
an old secret subkey from my old PC) and a new one (with my new secret subkey) but
I can't export the secret key from the old one and import to the new one
because the primary key is already present there and gpg is complaining about this.
The DSA primary key is in both keyrings. I just want to import the old secret encryption subkey into the new secret keyring.
gpg: key 14DCBC1F: already in secret keyring
Can i merge them somehow else?
I did the following:
gpg -a -o secfile.asc --export-secret-key 0x14DCBC1F
gpg --allow-secret-key-import --import secfile.asc
