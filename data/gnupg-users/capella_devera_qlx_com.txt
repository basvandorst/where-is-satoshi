@_subject: Decryption Key Compatibility between GNUPG V 2.030 and GnUPG 2.0.27 
We have GPG v 2.0.27 installed on our Windows X64 Development Server. In
this server, we are able to successfully decrypt our gpg files using a
private key imported through kleopatra.
We have another Windows X64 Server (Our PROD Server) where we installed GPG
2.030. We imported the gpg keys from DEV server using kleopatra. When we
try to decrypt a gpg file on this server, we get the ?decryption failed: No
secret key? error.
I checked the list of keys in both servers. Both servers have the same list
of keys.
Could this issue be due to the difference in GPG version between the 2
