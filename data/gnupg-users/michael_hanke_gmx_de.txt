@_subject: Cannot verify PGP5.0i Signature 
Fellow GnuPG-Users, Programmers,
I'd like to bother you with yet another GPG/PGP5.0i problem.
I have received someones (Jenses) PGP signed message and his public key
(pgp5.0i)  . With his permission I supply both parts below.
I cannot verify the signature using gnupg-1.0.1c
gpg: Signature made Sat Mar 25 04:01:23 2000 CET using DSA key ID 081548D0
gpg: BAD signature from "Jens-Eike Jesau "
I could verify the message successfully after installing pgp5.0i .
Good signature made 2000-03-25 03:01 GMT by key:
  1024 bits, Key ID 081548D0, Created 1999-07-19
   "Jens-Eike Jesau "
   "jesau                  Of what I know from the archives, there are some compatibility problems
and various gpg options to avoid them. But I've found nothing obvious to
solve my problem. Thank you for looking into this.

Hallo Michael,
sag mir doch bitte, gibt es einen, fuer normal Sterbliche gangbaren,
Weg, mit Gnus PGP zu verwenden ?
Die Mails von den Mutt-Leuten muss ich jedenfalls
haendisch decrypten.. und mir das Gelaechter anhoeren.. :-(
Danke !
