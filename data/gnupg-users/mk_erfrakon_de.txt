@_subject: GPG and Mailinglists using IBCPRE 
what is currently the recommended setup for running encrypted mailing lists.
I am thinking about some IBCPRE mechanism. see also I think this would allow the mailing list software act as a proxy reencrypting without directly having the private key of the mailing list on the mailing list server.
What do you think about IBCPRE.
Mit freundlichen Gr??en
