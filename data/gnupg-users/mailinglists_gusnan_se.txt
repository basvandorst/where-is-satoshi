@_subject: GPA: Quicksearch the Keymanager keylist 
What I currently really, really lack(ed) in GPA is the possibility to
quicksearch for names in the key list by starting to enter their names
on the keyboard - So I took items into my own hands, and here you have
the simple result attached. (Simple patch against current git).
It might be debatable if one should search on the name, or on the
KeyID (GPA_KEYLIST_COLUMN_KEYID), but I find this more useful.
Thanks for GPA!
best regards

These keys are listed as expired, but I am still not able to delete
them - I don't see the point to having them on my system...
Could anyone shed some light on the mystery?
Is it some bug in GPA that interprets the data in the keys in an
incorrect way?

Which version of gpgme11 are you using? I believe you'll need at least
gpgme11 version 1.5.0 for that.

If I had the money, I would pledge for one of these: I believe It will fit with the GnuPG thoughts on privacy and security
very well.
