@_subject: sig help 
I'm trying to download and install GPG.  I've downloaded the files I need.  The readme's all say I should verify the file by running sha1sum.exe against the tar files I've downloaded.  They say to use the value in the *.sig file to compare the output against.  But I can't read the *.sig file.  How to I view that file?  Does it need to be converted in some way?  Thanks in advance.

@_subject: Installing gnupg 2.0.[89] on AIX 5.3 
I hope there is someone who can help me with the install problems I'm having.  I'm trying to install on an AIX 5.3 box.  Please CC me with any response.  I'm wondering if using an old version of gcc may be part of my problem. Thank you for any help you can provide.
First I tried to install gnupg 2.0.9 and got the following errors from the 'make check':
Making check in m4
Target "check" is up to date.
Making check in gl
        make  check-am
Target "check-am" is up to date.
Making check in include

After making no headway with version 2.0.9, I backed up a version and tried to install 2.0.8.  I got a lot further in the 'make' before it finally errored.  The 'make' generated the following error:
Target "all-am" is up to date.

@_subject: GNUPG - do I really need this? 
Nothing like killing a fly with a sledgehammer!  I have a (seemingly) simple task.  My employers tell me
I need to encrypt a file before I ftp it off site.  To perform this task I'm trying to install gnupg 2.0.9.
Do I need to install this release to do what I need to do, or can I use a 1.4.* version to get this done?  Or are
there any suggestions of any other software packages I can use to accomplish this?  Thanks.

I supposed I should have mentioned earlier, I'm installing in AIX 5.3.
Thanks for your response.

1.4.9 will work fine. Prebuilt windows binaries are available on the web site download page.
