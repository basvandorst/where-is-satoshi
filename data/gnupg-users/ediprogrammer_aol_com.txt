@_subject: Data not decrypting 
Hi, I'm a newbie, both to gnupg and to cryptography concepts in general, and the problem I'm having is: when I decrypt a file the output is completely unreadable, it looks like the file is still encrypted! My situation is this: I created and exported my gnupg key pair using the WinPT interface (gnupg version 1.2.1). I emailed my public key to the person who will be sending me encrypted files. This person encrypted a file using my public key (she is using PGP version 7.0.4). She emailed me the encrypted file. I wrote a .bat file containing the following decrypt statement:
gpg --passphrase-fd --decrypt --output input.txt input.pgp < passphrase.txt 2> log_decrypt.txt
I ran the .bat file and got the following messages in my log file:
gpg: encrypted with ELG-E key, ID uniqueid
gpg: encrypted with ELG-E key, ID uniqueid
gpg: encrypted with 1792-bit ELG-E key, ID uniqueid created 2003-06-24
      "my name here "
gpg: WARNING: message was not integrity protected
(1) from reading this list serv I believe the WARNING message is because gnupg is expecting MDC to be used but PGP is not using MDC. It is my understanding this warning message shouldn't affect the outcome of the actual decryption. In fact, to get rid of the warning message I added "--no-mdc-warning" which did, indeed, get rid of the warning.
(2) what do the three "gpg: encryped with..." messages mean?
(3) when I looked at my output file (input.txt), it was all garbage characters, it still looks encrypted!
Thanks for any light you'all can shed on the subject.

Thanks for the suggestion. However, I tried adding the 0 handle number and moving --output before --decrypt and it didn't make any difference. I still got the same gpg: messages as in my original email to the list serv.
Also, as a test, I encrypted a file using my own public key, then decrypted it, and that worked fine.

When do you recommend revoking versus deleting a public key? What does revoking a key do, exactly? Thanks.

Hi -
Where can I download the gnupg program for Windows?

Thank you. Another problem, though. When I go to that link, then click on "FTP" next to "GnuPG 1.2.3 compiled for Microsoft Windows" my web browser gives me a "cannot find server or DNS error" and the address shown in my address window is: ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/binary/gnupg-w32cli-1.2.3.zip. Do you think this is my firewall keeping me from accessing the ftp site, or do you think this gnupg ftp site is down?
