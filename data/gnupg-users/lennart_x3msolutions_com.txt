@_subject: Generation of keys. 
Hi everyone!
I have been assigned a task to develop a webmail with the support for
enc/dec of email and attachments. Now one of the features is that you should
be able to create a keypair through the webpage. Everywhere I get a big
nono, as soon as I say serverside generation of keys. But is this solution
not safer than the alternative..
This is the setup: A server that is managed by qualifyed security personel.
On this server we have a hardware number generator attached. The passwords
and userinformation used to create the keys are sent through a secure SSL
connection. The private key does never leave the server.
Or the alternative: A regular machine managed by the user, downloads
software to create a keypair with psuedo random numbers and then uploads
these through a secure SSL connection.
I really don't know if I should use gpg to generate the keys, but I was
planing to use it to enc/dec the messages and attachments atleast. As for
the keygeneration I am not really sure if I should start the a development
of one or if there are anything useful out there that I could use.
What are ppls thoughts on this? Is there a possibility to run gpg using a
hardware random number device without to much poking in the source..?
Comments and thoughts are welcome. Thanks guys.

@_subject: Standards? 
I have some questions regarding standards.. I was browsing the internet
yesterday and found some article about cryptography, and the author kept
mentioning some standards, IEEE 1363, PKCS, X.509v3 etc.. Anyone know what
these mean or where you can read some more about them? Does GnuPG use any of
these standards, or what standards besides OpenPGP do they use? Or are these
standards a part of the OpenPGP standard?
Would be cool to know.
