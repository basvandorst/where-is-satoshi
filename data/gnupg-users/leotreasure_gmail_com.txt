I'm relatively new to GPG but I'm having this problem I need some advice on.
When I clear sign a message using a newly created key pair it always
chooses the sub key instead of the main key. This happens even when
using --default-key .
In my settings, GPGPreferences I have the correct key in default key
selected. Also in ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf the default-key has the main key's ID.
I am running OS X Mountain Lion and the latest version of GPG
(GnuPG/MacGPG2) 2.0.19
I did not put an email address when creating the key is about the only
unusual thing I have done.
Any suggestions?

This is the expected behaviour. Why don't you want to use your subkey?
You can force the usage of the mainkey:
--local-user  0x1a571df5\!
--default-key 0x1a571df5\!
(the \ is for the shell and not always necessary)
The main key should not be available for normal usage. The keyword is:
offline mainkey.

Thanks dkg. I created the key under normal circumstances using version:
gpg (GnuPG/MacGPG2) 2.0.19
libgcrypt 1.5.0
When setting up the keypair I did not provide an email address.
Could it be that I am using the Mac version that I got this unusual
keypair setup?
