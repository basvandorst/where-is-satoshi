Iwant to use gnupg in network with windows 2000. As local user it works
fine. But when I´m trying to open pga as network user it shows me ,,GnuPG
execution failed: could not spawn external progam". Where´s my Problem and how can I
solve it?

If I try to run PGA in my network with Windows2000 as a client with local
installation it shows me: ,,GnuPG execution failed: could not spawn external
progam!" several times. What´s my problem?? How can I solve it?
