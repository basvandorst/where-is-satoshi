@_subject: gpg on public system? 
Hi there,
is there a secure way of using gpg in a more or less
public multiuser-system - say, a university's computer pool?
It might sound a little paranoid, but I don't trust the sysop's security
measures. And beeing it an almost public computer pool with a lot of
students, who know the system at least as well as the administrator -
Up to now I am using the  ~/.gnupg -directory just as usual, except the
~/.gnupg/secring.gpg beeing a link to a file on a removable cd-rom. I
know, anyone who gets root acces to the machine can also read a cd-rom,
but at least only while it is present (so the risk is a bit decreased).
I'm also planning to tripwire the whole gpg-related files.

Well, that indeed is a point. So I have to put up with minimizing the
risks. Any suggestions to that?
(of course the better alternative would be a really safe system, but that
is beyond the rights of my account :(
Thanks again,

Actually, you don't need any plugins or stuff like that. Since GnuPG is
based on OpenPGP and OpenPGP is based on PGP 5.0, all should work out
Indeed, for trial purposes I have tried using pgp 5.0 and gpg 1.04 at the
same time (both on linux). I was able to
- generate keys with both programs
- export the public key from gpg
- import the public keys to pgp
- encrypt with pgp to the public key
- also, to sign it with pgp (using another key, generated with pgp)
- decrypt with gpg
- and, best of all, do the whole thing the other way round (encrypt with
gpg and read with pgp)
But if your friends are using PGP 5, so you better use the
option (as found in .gnupg/options), as it makes gpg behave more
compliant. If your friends are using pgp2.6x or pgp with IDEA-encryption,
you should tell them to switch to pgp 5 or later.
Hope I could help,
