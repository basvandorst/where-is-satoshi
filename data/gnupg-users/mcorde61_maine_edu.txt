@_subject: Warning: using insecure memory! 
Please forgive my last message to this group (if it made it that far).  I am having difficulty using gpg with mutt.  Whenever i use gpg (ver 0.9.10) it complains that i am using insecure memory.  What is insecure memory?  and how to fix/repair it?  i have used pgp in the past and it never complained of such a thing.
I am using a rh6.0 i686
thanks all

What does you /etc/ld.so.conf look like?  It should just be a list of
your lib directories (e.g., /lib, /usr/lib, etc) each on a different
line.  Perhaps the '-lz' (below) is just some garbage in this file.  Why 0.9.8, 0.9.10 (or maybe greater) is out, perhaps give that a

@_subject: Windows and GnuPG 
Some people I write to complain that they recieve messages from me that
appear to have two attachments (or perhaps parts) one is the actual message
while the other is a *.dat file (GnuPG signing information).  Both people
use a combination of Pegasus Mail and/or Outlook Express.  Is it typical of
Windows email clients to do strange things like this?  I've tried it myself
with outlook express and it does infact claim a GnuPG message has two parts,
both of which it cannot identify, but I am given the option to open.  The
*.txt file is the message while the *.dat is the hash.
Does this always happen with GnuPG?  PGP?  Is it the fault of Outlook
Express (and perhaps Pegasus Mail)?  Can I do anything to ensure that people
who recieve messages from me receive the message as a I intended?
Thanks Alot,
