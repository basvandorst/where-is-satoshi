@_subject: Decrypting with private key and public key is missing 
Hi Im using GPG CL 1.4.9. case is - 1)somebody (trusted) is generating key pair on my behalf(as proxy). But he
is sending me only my secret key and NOT public key. 2) I was able to import the secret key in gpg keyring using
--allow-secret-key-import command
3) But when I try to decrypt the file (which was encrypted using my public
key its not with me though) I get error message such as gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available. Though I know I have
secret key with me.
Please help

Thank you all your response. I will try with "gpgsplit". But I do have secret
key in my seckeyring

I am sorry but I didn't get your last message.
1) I tried to import the key again (I deleted all the keyring files
C:\Documents and Settings\xxxxxx\Desktop>gpg --import newkey.asc
gpg: keyring `C:/Documents and Settings/xxxxxx/Application
Data/gnupg\secring.gpg' created
gpg: keyring `C:/Documents and Settings/xxxxxx/Application
Data/gnupg\pubring.gpg' created
gpg: key FBCFC5F9: secret key imported
gpg: key FBCFC5F9: no valid user IDs
gpg: this may be caused by a missing self-signature
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:           w/o user IDs: 1
gpg:       secret keys read: 1
gpg:   secret keys imported: 1
2) And now If I try to see it using gpg --list-secret-key. I can see it.
C:\Documents and Settings\xxxxxx\Desktop>gpg --list-secret-key
gpg: C:/Documents and Settings/gi185002/Application
Data/gnupg\trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
C:/Documents and Settings/xxxxxx/Application Data/gnupg\secring.gpg

Thank you all. Thanks "werewolf"..I got it done..and yes it was with
1) I imported "secret" key only that I am getting from my client
C:\Documents and Settings\xxxxxx\Application Data\gnupg>gpg --import
gpg: keyring `C:/Documents and Settings/xxxxxx/Application
Data/gnupg\secring.gpg' created
gpg: keyring `C:/Documents and Settings/xxxxxx/Application
Data/gnupg\pubring.gpg' created
gpg: key FBCFC5F9: secret key imported
gpg: key FBCFC5F9: no valid user IDs
gpg: this may be caused by a missing self-signature
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:           w/o user IDs: 1
gpg:       secret keys read: 1
gpg:   secret keys imported: 1
2) Then I use gpgsplit as you guys said
C:\Documents and Settings\xxxxxx\Application Data\gnupg>gpgsplit --no-split
--verbose --secret-to-public secring.gpg > pubring.gpg
3) Then I use list-key command..wollaaa I can see my public key getting
created now
C:\Documents and Settings\xxxxxx\Application Data\gnupg>gpg --list-key
gpg: C:/Documents and Settings/xxxxxx/Application Data/gnupg\trustdb.gpg:
trustdb created
C:/Documents and Settings/xxxxxx/Application Data/gnupg\pubring.gpg

@_subject: GPG decrypts but 11 bytes header of PGP doenst go and so it file 
Hi Im running into strange issue here. 1) I have large set of volume (multiple binary and text files) which are
encrypted using PGP CL. and trying to decrypt in GnuPG CL
2) Each binary block file is set of TIFF images appended back to back. and
encrypted using PGP CL AES256 cipher.
3) When I decrypt those block files (53) I see file 13, 26, 39 and 51
doens't decrypt properly BUT I dont get any error during decryption. The
only way I can verify that decryption didnt work is because I can not see
the TIFF images in it and also has same 11 bytes present which are there in
encrypted block.
im using gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.8
Below is the command im trying to run
11::02::02-04::103::2010_cidmdp6" -d IMAGEARCHIVENEW_13 gpg: using character set `CP437'
:marker packet: PGP
:symkey enc packet: version 4, cipher 9, s2k 3, hash 2
        salt af0784e63d4be8e0, count 524288 (144)
gpg: AES256 encrypted data
:encrypted data packet:
        length: unknown
        mdc_method: 2
gpg: encrypted with 1 passphrase
:literal data packet:
        mode b (62), created 0, name="imagearchivenew_13",
        raw data: unknown length
gpg: original file name='imagearchivenew_13'
gpg: decryption okay
