Very easy to use but I see a problem with encrypting or signing mails
with Enigmail because this is done on sending, which means private
keys  (and passphrase if cached) might be exposed when you go online.
An option to encrypt/sign and queue would solve this problem though.

Maybe I'm a bit thick, but I can't find an option to queue encrypted
or signed messages on my version (Enigmail 0.71 on Mozilla 1.2.1 on
w2k), though it can be done for unencrypted/unsigned messages. I have
to encrypt or sign with gpg outside the mailer, copy to the composer
and then queue the message.

Hi all,
I've been trying the Win build of 1.2.3rc2 and had a problem with it recognizing my private keyring.
--list-secret-keys at the command line gave me an "unsupported digest-algo" message. My configuration file included the option
"s2k-digest-algo SHA256" so I commented this out. But I still couldn't access my private keys until I changed their passwords.
1.2.3 has read-only support for SHA256 so it seems to me that it should have recognised my keys once I had commented out that line.

Proposing an OS to someone who is looking for an e-mail client
is not very helpful, IMO.
Outlook is very handy, as the original writer noted, as it
combines calendar, contacts, etc,. However it does present
security problems, and it does not handle PGP/MIME. My
suggestion is to install Mozilla (or Netscape) with the Enigmail
plugin, then drag the mailer shortcut icon to the Outlook
shortcut bar. That way you can use a safer mail client from
within your Outlook environment.

This link includes a download link to an IDEA DLL for Windows. You

include in your gpg configuration file the line:
load-extension Lib\idea
After that you can change your password on the key (to the same one, if
you like) and that will change the protect cipher on your secret key.

2**64 factor The point I was trying to make is that there's no "impossible" with
brute force attacks. An attacker COULD break the encryption at the very
first attempt, though the probability is extremely remote.
It's the improbability, not the impossibility, which makes a brute force
attack on 128-bit encryption not worth trying. Taking your base of the
cracking of a 64-bit key, trying 2**64 combinations on a 128-bit key
would almost certainly take longer and would have a probability of less
than one in a million million million of succeeding.
Which, I guess, answers your question anyway: Denis McCauley

As David Picon Alvarez has replied:
"If I remember correctly, writing an exclamation mark (!) after the

But your test 0 result seems strange because GPG should automatically
use a signature subkey if one is present. My signing key on this message
is an example of this behaviour.

That's a good question. Very few GPG users seem to trust 1024-bit

You can have more than one key pair on your keyring. To create a key
like that of David Shaw (or mine) you create a new key choosing the
option (5) RSA (sign only). Then you add the other (sub) keys:
     >gpg --edit-key      >addkey
which brings up the key-creation dialogue. When the subkey has been
created finish with
     >save
You can have either DSA (sign) and ElGamal (encrypt), or stay with RSA,
which will allow you to have a bigger signing subkey (2048 bits for
IMO, the real worry with the 1024-bit limit on regular DSA keys is that
they are the primary keys on which you collect the signatures that
construct your web of trust. If you have to revoke them because they are
no longer secure you lose all the signatures you've painstakingly
collected. Subkeys on the other hand can be revoked and replaced as
necessary without affecting signatures on the primary key.
However, there are some problems associated with such keys. You should
check out Adrian von Bidder's explanation at
4096 bits with GPG, though there are some unofficial versions of PGP
which can create RSA keys up to 16k.

Agreed, key size is only one factor to be taken into account, and not
the most urgent, but from my reading I see that I'm not alone in
considering the 1024-bit limit as a possible weak point in a
not-so-distant future.
My comment which you cite in introduction was made in the context of a
key with multiple subkeys (RSA 4096 with DSA/ElGamal subkeys). This
solution seems to me to have many advantages, apart from that of using a
stronger primary key for collecting signatures and signing keys.
My secret keyring is encrypted with a 256-bit algo and hash, which needs
a password of 40 random characters to be fully effective. If I split the
top-level CA and everyday functions on to two different keys, I would
need two such passwords -- one I can handle, but two?? Following the procedure for stripping secret keys outlined by  Adrian
von Bidder ( I can have only one secret
key stored on my machine: that of the signing subkey I use daily, which
has a different password (20 random characters) than that of the
primary key.
The secret key for the primary key and the encryption subkey can be kept
in safe deposit, and when they are  used, it's with a Linux system that
boots off a CD and runs in RAM, and not necessarily on my own machine.
As far as I can see this leaves only the problems of physical access to
my machine and radiation snooping as areas of concern. But maybe I've
still overlooked something so any comments are welcome.

it IS imported in the regular PGP fashion.

With GPG you can extend the expiry date of a key (although PGP
apparently does not recognise an extended expiry date).
Otherwise, you could revoke the keys of members who leave an
organisation, either by creating revocation certificates when keys are
created or by adding a designated revoker.
Hope that helps.

In reality it's not that simple, I think. First, an attacker must know that Diceware was used. Otherwise he would
try a dictionary attack with a much large word base.
Second, there are two Diceware word lists (in English), which would mean
combining the two and having more than 7776 possibilities.
Third, you can include spaces between the words, or not, which would
double the search time.
