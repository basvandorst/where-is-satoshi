I've got the most up-to-date version of PGP. In fact, it doesn't support them
The signs are there that they're _almost_ supported - in other words, if you
try to add a DSA2 signing subkey the combo boxes have 1536, 2048, and 3072
bit-length options, but when you hit the 'OK' button, you get the message
'Signing key size must be between 1024 and 1024 bits'.
A representative from PGP Corporation confirmed (and I quote) that "PGP is
still prepared to jump to the new DSS standard once it is finalized".

No problem. PGP Desktop accepts the GPG-created DSA2 key quite happily, and
verifies the DSA2 signature made in GPG on a separate key.
If I import the secret part of the GPG-created DSA2 key PGP will also let me
sign keys with it in PGP.
hmm... so PGP _does_ support DSA2 really... (but still won't create DSA2 keys)
Right you are. And I should have known better than to doubt Mr Hansen.
