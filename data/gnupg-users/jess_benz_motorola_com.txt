@_subject: keyserver problems 
I am having problems sending to and/or receiving from a keyserver I have set up.  PGP works with it, and I have no problems sending or receiving with it.  Here is the error I receive when trying to send a key:
gpg: write failed: ec=87
gpg: can't connect to `mykeyserveripaddr: No such file or directory
Please help!

Is the options file available under windoze?  I did a dir in dos and am not seeing it listed.

... in your GnuPG options file.

AFAIK, GnuPG doesn't support the LDAP keyservers, only the HTTP one.

Okay, I loaded Win98SE onto a virtual machine, found GPG for Windoze again, installed it, yadda yadda.
I generated a new key and tried to send it.
Here is the command I used:
gpg --keyserver myipaddr --send-keys EED38472
Here is the response I received:
gpg: success sending to myipaddr (status=200)
I think "Great, Wonderful!" I go to my keyserver to make sure it's there, only to find that it isn't, any ideas?
I also tried to receive a key that I had put up there from PGP
Here is the command I used:
gpg --keyserver myipaddr --recv-keys 27AA89D8
Here is the response I received:
gpg: requesting key 27AA89D8 from myipaddr
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found
gpg: Total number processed 0
Any ideas on this one?

Hi Janusz,
I didn't say anything about not having the public key. What I'm proposing
can be done using PGP. The process would seem to be, from my uninformed
POV, that the key is downloaded, though not actually imported to the local
keyring. You are able to inspect the signatures associated with the key
and these are cross-referenced with keys that may already be on your local
keyring. You can then check the signature without actually adding the key
to your keyring.
So, one should collect as many keys as possible so that trusts can be
calculated? I'm assuming here that trusts are calculated by examining the
signatures associated with the keys. If the person who signed the key's
public key isn't on your keyring then the signature would be just listed as
an unknown signature. So it would be wise to collect public keys for this
purpose. Am I reading you right here or am I totally off the mark and
exhibiting more incredible stupidity? :-)
