THIS IS A PREMIER OPPORTUNITY FOR YOUR COMPANY TO EXHIBIT AND SHOWCASE YOUR LINUX PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.  GO TO OUR WEB SITE. WE ARE VERY SUCCESSFUL AT PRODUCING EVENTS THAT SERVE THE INTERESTS OF GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY.
Event Sponsors: * CIS Global * Aronson, Fetridge, & Weigle * INPUT ... new sponsors to be announced.
Purpose of Conference:
Twenty-six percent (26%) of federal installations have reported use of the Linux operating system in their organization, as reported by IDC.  IDC also estimates that "most of the government's sophisticated, back-office computers will be running Linux by 2002."  Just when agencies are turning to enterprise-wide solutions and mainframe class applications, the Linux operating system offers a new and exciting alternative.
This will be a one-day conference that will present agency plans and strategies for deploying new and innovative Linux applications. The conference will focus on those Linux applications that are in the early or test bed stage AND will likely evolve into enterprise-level deployments.

* Government technical managers
* Agency executives
* Program managers
* Agency e-commerce planners

* Military command and control officers
What Attendees Will Learn:
* Where and how Linux is being used
* New plans for enterprise applications
* Innovative ideas and strategies
* New opportunities for Linux products and services
