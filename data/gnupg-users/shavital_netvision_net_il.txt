@_subject: Correct location of 'automake'? 
When trying to compile GnuPG 2.0.1, I was told to run automake before
applying David Shaw's patch.
Whenever I tried to run automake, I got a long error message, the gist
of which was the version I was using. 1.6.3, was wrong, and that I
should use 1.9.6.
I tried to install 1.9.6 by compiling the source code. It apparently
succeeded, but automake --version still gave 1.6.3, as well as
I have now tried 'locate automake', and it seems that I have the two
versions, 1.6.3, and 1.9.6 installed, but in different paths; following
are partial quotes of the Terminal output:
When I do:
I get version 1.9.6
Moreover I have:
So what should be the 'correct' path?
- /usr/bin/automake
- /usr/local/bin/automake  ?
Thanks in advance,
