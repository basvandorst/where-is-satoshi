@_subject: pgp5 doesn't like my gnupg signatures 
Hi all
I've just decided try GnuPG, now that 1.0.0 is out. Unfortunately I can't
seem to get it to sign messages properly. When I sign a message and then
check the signature using pgp5 I get:
[-- PGP output follows (current time: Thu Oct 14 08:59:22 1999) --]
BAD signature made 1999-10-14 06:52 GMT by key:
  1024 bits, Key ID 61F2637C, Created 1999-10-14
   "Martin Lucina "
This signature applies to another message
[-- End of PGP output --]
However if I check this signature again using GnuPG, it says it's correct.
This is all using mutt as my MUA.
What is the problem here?

It turns out this was because mutt was using MD5 as the MIC algorithm,
which GnuPG detected OK but PGP5 refused to accept. Setting it to SHA1
solved the problem.
This should probably go in the FAQ.
