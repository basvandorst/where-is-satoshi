@_subject: question regarding using gpg to verify a file from a .sign file 
I am trying to follow the directions on the page
for verifying authenticity of CDs (meaning the iso files downloaded from
debian's page). The page has iso files then SHAxSUM files and SHAxSUM.sign
I have already run sha512sum command to verify the iso file. But I am
having difficulty in the next step... which is
" To ensure that the checksums files themselves are correct, use GnuPG to
verify them against the accompanying signature files (e.g. SHA512SUMS.sign).
The keys used for these signatures are all in the Debian GPG keyring
 and the best way to check them is to use that
keyring to validate via the web of trust. To make life easier for users,
here are the fingerprints for the keys that have been used for releases in
recent years:"
quoted from the page when I run the command
gpg --verify SHAxSUM.sign SHAxSUM
I get the following message
gpgv: unknown type of key resource 'trustedkeys.kbx'
gpgv: keyblock resource '/home/user/.gnupg/trustedkeys.kbx': General error
gpgv: Signature made Sun 10 May 2020 03:17:55 AM +03
gpgv:                using RSA key DF9B9C49EAA9298432589D76DA87E80D6294BE9B
gpgv: Can't check signature: No public key
How should I proceed to check signature.
Thank you in advance for your help
