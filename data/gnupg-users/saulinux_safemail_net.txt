Hi, ?the following is the command for a Cron job to ?run chkrootkit
and email me the report. Any ideas how I could get GPG to encrypt
this output before it is mailed ?

Thanks Werner, that works fine. When I run the Cron job it gives the following message after it has done its job, gpg: WARNING: unsafe ownership on homedir "/home/simon/.gnupg/"
Is that a problem??
