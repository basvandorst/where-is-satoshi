@_subject: Too Many Keys 
I'm new to GPG. Over the years I've toyed with PGP, etc. Now, I'm trying to integrate keys I've created in the past into GPG. Should I do that? Or should I just start with a fresh new set of keys? If I do integrate them into my GPG install, what's the best way? Should I re-sign them with my new GPG set? If I don't integrate them, should I revoke the old ones? Any pointers will be appreciated. -- Clint
My new public key block:
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: GnuPG v1.4.1 (MingW32) - WinPT 0.9.92
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
