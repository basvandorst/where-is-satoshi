See  for a random password selection system that, IMHO, is far easier to use than diceware. (That's why I thought it up...)

Thanks for the recommendation of Diceware.  It's a very neat system.
I'll use it.
The website recommends using dice instead of a computer program unless
you know what you're doing.  I think I know what I'm doing (and I don't have
the patience for generating several passwords using dice).
On a Linux box, I am using /dev/random as a source of random bits, which
I turn into digits with Perl's unpack().  I chop off all digits outside
the range [1-6] and use those to get the words.
Can anyone detect any error here?

@_subject: Making WinPT Part of GnuPG/Win Distro 
I strongly agree with your idea  WinPT is a compact, easy to use, and very powerful tool. I'll take the proposal a step further: I believe WinPT deserves to be a part of an official, installation-based Windows distribution of GnuPG 1.0.7. (Of course, only supplementing the separate command-line binary-only distro of GnuPG.)
Timo is pretty modest in his version numbering -- I've distributed his version 0.5.12 with about 20,000 PRIVARIA downloads and have heard no issues coming back regarding it. (It is the default key generation UI for new PRIVARIA installations.) Timo has been talking about a version 0.6 for a while now, which I think would be a good start for inclusion in the "official" GnuPG/Win 1.0.7 distribution. And yes, WinPT is fully As we've been saying in the U.S. a lot since last fall, "United We Stand..." :-)

@_subject: [WINPT USERS] Announcing PRIVARIA 0.9.8b (GPG-based secure networking) 
I am cross-posting this message to the GnuPG and WinPT users' lists in
hopes that it is of interest to members of both. -Ed
Version 0.9.8b of the PRIVARIA Secure Networking Suite is now available at
This is a very significant release. Here are some highlights:
* You can use your existing GnuPG/WinPT installation and keys
* Install to the directory of your choice
* Reliability fixes to the FTP command core
* Uses a "safe" TCL interpreter for the Remote Command Shell by default,
with option to open it up for all functions (e.g., for telecommuter access)
* Many more bug fixes
* Some cosmetic improvements
I'm immensely gratified at the tremendous response to PRIVARIA. In the
first three weeks of its release, it has been downloaded over 12,000
(yes, twelve thousand!) times and has risen to the top 2% of projects on
Thanks again to Werner et al. for providing GPG, which provides the
authentication and secure symmetric key exchange foundation for
PRIVARIA. Looking forward to an official Win32 build of 1.0.7 to include
in my release 0.9.9.
P.S. - Anyone with TCL skills and CVS capabilities who is interested in
helping to port PRIVARIA to Linux, please contact me.

@_subject: GPG 1.0.7 Official Win32 Build (?) 
Can anyone (Werner?) explain why no official Win32 build of 1.0.7 has emerged after two months? Is it political, technical, or economic, or a combination thereof?
I know GPG is free software, Windows is not, etc. but as an open-source developer who has distributed 15,000+ copies of Win32 GPG 1.0.6 with my own software, I'm just curious...

@_subject: PRIVARIA: Open-Source, GPG-Based Secure Networking Suite 
GnuPG users may be interested in my new open-source release of PRIVARIA, an encryption and authentication platform I've developed for firewall-friendly, peer-to-peer networking with my clients and colleagues. PRIVARIA builds on some excellent open-source tools, including GnuPG, WinPT, and Zebedee. My goal was to make secure communications effective, convenient, and intuitive, and I hope the results of the hundreds of hours of effort I put into this project helps to achieve this goal.
For more details, please see  I look forward to
your feedback, bug reports, and making secure, peer-to-peer connections
with you via PRIVARIA! And thanks to Werner Koch, Timo Schulz (WinPT),
Neil Winton (Zebedee) and others for providing the important and
valuable crypto tools on which PRIVARIA builds its security and
authentication platform.
P.S. - Help with porting to Linux would be greatly appreciated! TCL is
cross-platform and all the bundled tools come in Linux flavors, so it
should be a reasonably easy project for a volunteer to take on, once I
figure out the mysteries of CVS and get my source committed to CVS on

For Windows 9x, 2000, etc. you will like WinPT ( It is a very nice piece of software, and GPL'd. I distribute it along with GPG 1.0.6 in PRIVARIA.

@_subject: E-Mail Encryption: Why Isn't Everyone Doing It? 
I agree with this comment and the others like it. I've quit relying on GnuPG/WinPT for much encryption per se, simply because people don't want to be bothered with it.
When I have to send or show something sensitive to a colleague or an existing client, I try to do so via a tunnelled connection using my Privaria software. I wrote it for ease of use, and it's literally a one-click connection (no Amazon, this ain't online shopping...) once you've set it up. Perhaps the 25,000 downloads of the software since its May 2002 initial release says something about the value people place on encryption that's (relatively) easy to use.

@_subject: gnupg 1.0.7 compiled for Windows 
Sorry for being blunt, but the attitude Eugen Leitl expressed (shared by many others) is one of the biggest turnoffs to "outsiders" now looking at the free software community as an alternative to the Redmond, Washington "beast." Which is doing more to get free software in front of the actual *users* and business decisionmakers: (1) telling users who don't know (or care) what a compiler is to just go build it themselves, or (2) distributing the binaries for use on an OS that (for better or for worse) people are actually *using*?
Perhaps it's good to remember that the ultimate destination for all software, free or not, is on the computer of an *end user*. That person, in all likelihood, doesn't much care what Richard Stallman thinks or consider Microsoft inherently evil. He or she is going to switch to free software (and thus help the movement crawl out of the pizza-stained developer's den) because it has some benefit, in costs or features.
And I say all this as the author of both an open-source software package and an OSI-approved license for that software.
I guess the flames will start now, but I felt it needed to be said...

Before offering further insults, please get your facts straight. I have picked up programming. I have offered my own open-source software to the community. I have written software that uses GnuPG for the Windows platform. It's called the PRIVARIA Secure Networking Suite, and it's in the top 3% of SourceForge projects, with 23,000 downloads in the last few months.
