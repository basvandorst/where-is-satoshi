@_subject: gpg + smartcard ?s 
When GPG 1.4 came out a few months ago I noticed smartcard support was now officially included.   For the last few months I've been hoping good documentation would pop-up on the net to guide me through the steps to use a smartcard with GPG.  So far I haven't been able to find much.  I would appreciate it if I could get some help getting answers for specific questions I have.
 From what I understand GnuPG1.4 can access smartcard readers in two ways.  Through gpg built in drivers and through the PC/SC drivers.  Is there a list of what drivers are built into gpg? or a list of devices that are officially supported by gnupg?
Is it possible to use generic smartcards and not just the OpenPGP card from g10?  For example, I want to try and use those 'usb token' size smartcards on desktop computers and regular smartcards (pcmcia reader) with laptops.  If only the OpenPGP card is supported, what  is so special about the OpenPGP card?  Can generic smartcards be programmed to be the same as the OpenGPG card?
And the most important questions I have is, does the gpg smartcard implementation support 2048~4096 bit keys?  I've only found reference to 1024 bit keys.  1024 bit is simply not enough for the paranoid like Forgive me if some of these questions have been answered on the list, I'm new to the list and did search through the list archives first ;).  Any help will be appreciated.  Thanks.

Thanks for the help Robert.
That HOWTO was very helpful.  I hope more documentation like this will  pop up on the net.  It's been really hard to find info on the OpenPGP  card implementation.
I've been searching around the net for an answer to whether it's  possible to use large keys on smartcards with GPG (2048+).  Anyone on  the list know whether it's possible to import off-card generated keys  into OpenPGP Card which are larger than 1024bits?  I now know that the  card is only capable of 'generating' 1024bit keys on the card, but  there should be enough space to store off-card generated 1024bit+ keys?

@_subject: PKSC#15 support 
I remember reading about GnuPG supporting PKSC (ISO7816-15) compatible cards for the smartcard support.  I know currently only the OpenPGP Card is supported, but does anyone know if PKSC support is what the developers are still thinking about for future version of gpg?
