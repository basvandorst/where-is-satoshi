@_subject: full path instead of filename in encrypted file 
Files received from some end user fail decryption because the embedded file
name contains a path
Here is the full response (from gpg shell)...
gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit ELG-E key, ID 21E81243, created 2/25/2003
"MYCOMPANY "
gpg: error creating `/SAPINTERFACES/E-SERVICES/OUT/ZEA270_XXXX_FILE1': No
such file or directory
File: D:\temp\TESTXXX986OUT.PGP
Time: 6/22/2009 7:50:22 AM (6/22/2009 1:50:22 PM UTC)
Line 3 shows that the path is being included in the embedded ?filename?.
The above test was run entirely on one machine, just to eliminate network
paths as a factor.
What can we do (or what can we tell the end user) to circumvent the problem?
Note that we need to preserve the internal file name for audit purposes.
THIS user is also using GnuPG but on occasion we have seen this in non-GnuPG
generated files.

Using GnuPG 1.4.4 we occasionally receive truncated files, but gpg decrypts
them anyway.
Is there a way to force the decrypt to fail on a missing 'END PGP MESSAGE' ?
Thank you!

Thanks David, that does give a 'fatal' error indicator, which we can test
