Debian's tool is called apt.  This has been ported to RPM based systems, I believe Mandrake has it as an option.
Note that most installations of RedHat will automatically include gcc.
I suspect in the future RedHat will the resolution feature too.
I love debian, so I am not about to take it as criticism ;-)
