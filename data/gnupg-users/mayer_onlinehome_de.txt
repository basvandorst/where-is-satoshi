@_subject: How to disable/delete key from keyservers 
i have generated a key with one additional subkey and 4 I have played with all the options like adduid, sign, trust, revoke and expire for test purposes and to become familiar with the functions. I also updated sometimes the keyserverdatabase, to see what happens.
Now the key looks very confusing.
Is there any way to delete the key from the keyserverdatabase, or to get rid of the garbage that the key now contains?
Do i have to create a new key?
What's up with the expiration date? Does the keyserver delete the expired keys after a distinct time to clean up the database. Yours sincerely
