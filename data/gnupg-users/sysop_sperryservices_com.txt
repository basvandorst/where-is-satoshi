The error report dump won't show in one screen.......  even if you did pull the ram dump... which means we would have the files to
send.  -----Original Message-----

When ol2003 dumps it should dump files to a temp dir.  I am attempting to make it dump to get you those. I am a non-checked XP Pro
SP2. With non-checked Office 03 Pro SP1
Also Richard is on a corp. network, which I am assuming has GPO's in affect.  So even if they allowed him to be a LOCAL (Machine)
admin, it would not allow him to write to some area's of the registry that the DOMAIN or GPO's specify as restricted.  I can do some GPO research if you can give me a list of the .94 keys it want to write.
In my last test of the plug-in that your version from your site of GnuPG would work, but the main stream does not. Will get more info when my Outlook behaves, it keeps asking for c:\windows\system32\gpgexch.dll as not present.  Grrr

Then it's propably a bug. But I never got such a message so it is
propably a combination of some 'events'.
I'm not sure about the details they present. Useful would be a
'stack backtrace'. But I'm not sure how they call it and if they
provide it at all.
I guess this is the information I need. And something like CTRL+A
CTRL+C does not work?
You already did a lot, thanks.

Have him use something like winpt and decrypt current screen.  Or since it's a web based solution, have them add the extentions for gnupg.  Ie; blah.pgp and blah.gpg -----Original Message-----

  I just tried this to 'my' hushmail account, and it worked fine, but my friend still can't decrypt mine for anything. I've uploaded
*all* my public keys to the hushmail server and tried all my addresses and still no go for anyone but my own account.
  Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?
