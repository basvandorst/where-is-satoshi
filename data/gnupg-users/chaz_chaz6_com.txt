Hypothetically, if a key is signed using another key which contains a jpg image of something illegal in the keyserver's location, what then? It would seem to me that the only option would be to remove the keyserver from the keyserver network.

The configure script said:-
*** You need libassuan to build this program.
*** This library is for example available at
***   ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/pub/gcrypt/libassuan/
*** (at least version 1.0.4 is required).
*** Note, that libassuan must have been build with Pth support.
However, the ftp server said:-
550 Directory change failed; directory does not exist
I think the correct location is ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libassuan/

In addition, I was missing libksba which was detected by the configure script. It is available from ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libksba/.

I am looking for a tool that to export a GPG private key to a Data Matrix 2d barcode for long-term archival. I have been searching but have yet to find any existing software to do this. I have looked at PaperKey but it only produces an ascii representation which is not optimized for machine-reading. My preferred output formats are PDF/EPS/SVG. If such software does not already exist, I would appreciate a pointer on how to make something myself, perhaps using the binary output from PaperKey.
Apologies if this has been discussed before but I could not find anything relevant.

Thanks David, that is exactly what I was looking for. For some reason after I compiled libdmtx 0.7 the PDF and SVG formats are not available, but I can manage with PNG.

Scratch that; SVG output does work, it is just not listed by `dmtxwrite -l`. Trying to use PDF on the other hand gives 'dmtxwrite: Illegal format "pdf"'.

I grabbed an up to date copy (6.5.0-6) and now I have a lot more file formats available - including PDF. Thanks for the help!

There is thread in the archives with the subject "TPK Archival" that may

The best thing you can do is to upload the revocation certificate for
each key. Keys cannot effectively be removed from a keyserver.

My apologies for the late reply. I just re-subscribed to the group and
it was right at the top. I forgot to change the sort order. Oops!
