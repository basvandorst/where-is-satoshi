Hi List,
I'm trying to simulate a NAI PGP Keyserver with OpenLDAP with only basic
features like searching and retrieving keys from LDAP.
So far I sat it up right and other clients I use don't have problems
searching for keys but GnuPG always states that it's no valid Open PGP data
I recieve there.
Anyone any idea?

Hi again,
Well I just found out that THIS SEEMS TO BE A BUG in the GnuPG Win32
The Linux version works just fine.
The key was stored with CR/LF in LDAP. While the Linux client didn't have a
problem with that the Win32 version stated no valid Open PGP data.
When I store the key only with LF it works for Linux and Win32, too.

Well, in the first place I used ldif-files and ldapadd(OpenLDAP) to store
the info in the OpenLDAP-Server.
Then I sniffed network traffic with different clients and different servers.
With this info I found out that the Keys coming from
ldap://keyserver.pgp.com don't have CRLF but LF to separate the lines and it
The keys coming from my OpenLDAP had CRLFs and WinGnuPG complained but Linux
Version didn't.
Then I used ldp.exe from the Windows Support Tools to browse and edit the
LDAP entries. I copied and pasted the key from the server to a file and got
rid of the CRs. Then uploaded it again with ldp.exe and then it worked.
Btw importing the file with the key I copied/pasted from ldap was no problem
for WinGnuPG.

Sure, that's no problem at all. It's like generating one with GnuPG,
exporting, and then importing it again.
Well, that works. I used keys from CAs, too and it worked. Even, like I said
if I copy and paste it from an LDAP-Browser it works.
Only when directly trying to import it via LDAP it doesn't and only with
WinGnuPG. This seems really bizarre, doesn't it.
Could it be a compiling problem?

Did you try
gpg --passphrase-fd 0 --decrypt  < password.txt
where your password is stored in the password.txt-file?
I had problems when the --passphrase-fd parameter came after the
Having the decrpyt-parameter always last on the line worked.

Yeah, I know about that having to sign the root but once I signed it the
whole trustpath should work, right? But if sign and trust the RootCA the
UserCA/SubCA becomes valid but not the users itself, same if I sign the
SubCA then all users become valid. But I want this done in one step. And if I do that I still have to go through all the keys manually.
Actually what I want is all this done by just signing the Root CA key
and nothing else.
Anyone could test this with the demo .asc-file I sent in my first mail?

Well, I'm pretty new to all this but if I import the ChainNAI7.asc I
sended with my first mail into a PGP-Client and sign the RootCA as
