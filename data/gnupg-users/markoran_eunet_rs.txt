@_subject: Revoke a key 0E84608B 
I tried to revoke this key since after changing a passphrase on 2012-01-28 and using it with new passphrase immediately after, after a few hours I could not again be successfull (bad passphrase).
But revkey also askes for a passphrase. Is there any way to revoke this key?
Best regards

Thanks all to your suggestions.
I just got one idea. I have a backup. Can I unpack my secret ring file
backup and use it to generate revocation certificate, since in that file
it's still old passphrase that I typed many times?
Best regards

I send five variants (but the best is all of them :) ):
I use GnuPG because I care and because I was taught it was a sin to open other people's letters.
I use GnuPG because there was a country where people used to say "OZNA comes to know anything".
I use GnuPG because ?I don't trade with my independence.
I use GnuPG because ?I don't trade with my freedom.
I use GnuPG because ?I take critical attitude towards possibility of abuse of my data.

Of course, no problem.

All the time I read suggestions on using USB sticks and I must say
people are crazy about USB sticks. It is more convenient to use optical
media then USB stick because they are read only. Boot from Live CD, not
from USB stick and use USB stick only for data. In a desktop PC you can
put two CD devices and boot Live CD from CD1 and write your data to
CD2. You can use write-once media or rewritable media so you do not
waste to much plastic.
If you write your data to CDROM, then it is much more safer to transfer
data to another PC. It is much more complicated to make a virus that
will insert itself into a CDROM then into a USB stick. Furthermore,
such action would be odd and could be blocked by a security software
like SELinux.

Bug is a bug. It is not simpler to craft the filesystem than to insert ordinary virus.
The problem is in that more you have better protection, more you become interesting. That way, if you try really protect yourself, you will prevent weak/moderate players to get your data, but instead strong players, like security agencies, who otherwise wouldn't be interested, *will* get your data. That makes all our efforts to protect our privacy absurd. I think NSA and similar organizations are dangerous and even if now they do not abuse to much their information (such as destroying dissidents), it can change in future. They store all data indefinitely and it is enough that only in one moment in future someone can and would abuse it to happen disaster.

Of course it is not safe. If you realy need a smartphone, use some of those that are supported by Replicant OS.

@_subject: Getting Passphrase From Encrypted and Unencrypted Secret Key 
If an attacker got my secret key while it wasn't encrypted (no
passphrase) and then I put a passphrase, and then the same attacker
gets encrypted key, can he find out my passphrase based on difference
between non-encrypted and encrypted key?
