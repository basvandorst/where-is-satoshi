Hello, we are creating a new VM Windows 2003 server and are trying
to mirror it like our old VM Windows 2000 VM server. We are currently
running Active Perl 5.8 to use for our PGP Encryption processes and the
encryption is not working properly on the new machine. We downloaded the
version from the web. Is there something additional we need because it
has a different OS?  2000 vs 2003.

(GPG), not Pretty Good Privacy (PGP).  The two programs are
interoperable, but they are not the same, and their setup is totally

We need to know a lot more details.  Let's start with:
1.  What version of GnuPG are you using?
2.  From where did you get it?
3.  What errors are you getting?
4.  Does it work from the command line?
