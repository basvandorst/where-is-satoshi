@_subject: Is it possible to encrypt file symmetrically with 1 (one) command 
When I enter:
gpg -a -c data.php
gpg asks for the password, I enter it, and it asks to repeat.
Is there something like:
gpg -a -c data.php --password MyPassword
I call from VB2005:
Shell("c:\gnupg\gpg.exe -a -c " & fileToEncrypt, AppWinStyle.NormalFocus)
And console window opens and asks twice for the password.
I would prefer to send the file path and password in one command. I can not use GPGME library because the program, which I write is for Windows, bur GPGME seems to be for Linux. Or is there the GPFME version for Windows XP?
I need for the moment only the symmetrical encryption.
Thanks. brgds O.M.
