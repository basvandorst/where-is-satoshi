@_subject: Adding keys 
As far as I know there's no way to "merge keys".  Each encryption key is tied to a particular primary key, so there's no way to move that key to be "under" a different primary key.  You could create a second UID on the "Machine B" key that has the same email address as "Machine A", but the encryption key used would still be different -- encryption keys are tied to the primary key, and not to a particular UID or a particular email address.  [I hope that makes You can /import/ the secret key for "Machine A", which is what Robert was explaining.  This will let you use that key as well as the one that you're currently using for "Machine B".
At least that's my current understanding.

@_subject: Error compiling GnuPG 1.4.10 on Sun Solaris - "stdint.h: No such 
Disclaimer: I haven't compiled code for Solaris in a long time
I'm assuming you're trying to compile the code from here:
   I've found a discussion on trying to compile another program on Solaris x86, and what's interesting is that depending on the version of Solaris the stdint.h header either is or is not available:
   With version:
   SunOS aequitas 5.11 snv_138 i86pc i386 i86pc
the stdint.h header is there, but with version:
   SunOS titan 5.8 Generic_127722-03 i86pc i386 i86pc
it's not.  This isn't the same architecture, but this at least gives me a clue that the lack of the header/library is likely version-specific.

@_subject: Modified user ids and key servers and a possible security risk? 
There's a problem with this idea, which is that there's no opportunity to notify the client that there was a problem if the check is done /later/.  If instead the computation is done at the time of the uploaded modification, then there's an opportunity for the server to notify the gpg client that there was a problem.

My definition of "later" is "after the client-server connection is closed".  It is unusual for any specification to require decision to be made later than while the client-server connection is still open.
This now increases overhead by requiring the client to make several connections to the server to ask "did you do that thing yet?", also forcing the client remember what request was made in order to go check up on "half-
done" transactions.
This also messes up human feedback.  "Made the request, check back later" is not an actual answer.
Humans need feedback of what the problem was.  "General Error" doesn't All these problems become far simpler if the final response from the server is made during the client-server connection.  Without this there are state issues to remember and handle on both the client and the server side.

@_subject: How to use the gnupg card with an akasa smart card reader? 
What version of gnupg are you using, and what Linux version/distro are you In the meantime... someone was able to get this device /almost/ working:
   Note that this was done using a Linux kernel version 2.6.31 on Ubuntu 9.10
Apparently this same RTS5161 chip is also in some IR remote control devices.
I did some digging to try to figure out when the device was supported by GNU/Linux, which seems to happen on Debian/Ubuntu via the 'usbutils' package.
As best I can tell, device 0bda:0161 was added to Greg Kroah-Hartman's git usbutils repository (at URL git://github.com/gregkh/usbutils.git) in commit f7c66c505dc470c841792f19901ef901308168a7 by David Brownwell on Jun 5, 2008.
So since it's been in the usb.ids since June, 2008, any relatively recent usbutils package that's newer than that should at least support the chip... at least in theory.

Huh.  Yeah, not even a 'recommends' for it in the control file for pcsc-tools.  Interesting.  You might consider writing a 'wishlist' bug for pcsc-tools to list the pcscd package under 'recommends'.
Was easy for me to check, as I'm also running Debian Sid.
Definitely a start.
When it comes to drivers it's useful to know /when/ support was added especially when it comes to which particular Linux kernel (or package) versions support a device.  I know I didn't have to go that far -- but once I found the git repo for usbutils I wanted to see that I could go through the history for a particular file and find the commit where the change was added.

@_subject: Confirmation for cached passphrases useful? 
This reminds me of the Yubikey, which is a one-button USB stick that
registers as a keyboard, and "types" your password when you press the
button on it.  In other words, you don't necessarily need there to be a
IIRC this wasn't the particular use case meant for the Yubikey though -- I
think it was meant to be used in combination with online sites.  There
might be a similar device meant for GPG... or one could be made if it
doesn't exist yet.
Anything beats copying a password to a plaintext file, which is insane. Seems to beg a Spaceballs quote: "12345?  I've got the same password on my
luggage!  Oh... and change the password on my luggage."
I think it reminds some people of an "Are you sure?" prompt.  I realize
that's not exactly meant to be what this is for, of course, but that might
ultimately be what it "feels like" unless there's another outward purpose
for the prompt.
Now, that said, I'll just say I'm not against adding it if there's a
particular security case deemed worth defending.

@_subject: how slow are 4Kbit RSA keys? [was: Re: multiple keys vs multiple 
There are GUI operations that can routinely take several seconds to complete, such as sending an email via authenticated SMTP over TLS, opening an .ogv file, converting a document to a .PDF, adding a picture to a big presentation, etc.  My personal threshold before I think something is wrong is somewhere between 3-4 seconds for when I don't know something is computationally Encryption using a 4096-bit key is something I /expect/ is computationally expensive, so if there's a few second delay there I wouldn't personally be worried about it.  In fact if I was using old or slow hardware and it only took a couple of seconds to complete, I'd be pleased it was that fast.  I'm personally pleased at the performance I get from 4096R key encryption.
It's a good thing for speed be considered nonetheless, but there's also only so much that can be done about it.  There are organizations that have deemed 1024-bit DSA keys not to be secure enough [due to SHA-1 collisions], and some have stated in this thread that encryption using 2048-bit and 4096-bit keys "takes too long".  To reconcile this, there are basically two choices in my mind:  A) grow patience, or B) tolerate being less secure... because I don't think there's going to suddenly be a wild advance in code efficiency.
