@_subject: "write failed" when retrieving from keyservers 
I'm a new user converting from PGP 6.x. Everything is going well
except that I cannot receive keys from keyservers. This is the error
message I get:
C:\>gpg --keyserver certserver.pgp.com --recv-key 0x57548DCD
gpg: requesting key 57548DCD from certserver.pgp.com ...
gpg: write failed: ec=87
gpg: can't get key from keyserver: No such file or directory
I get the same error from the Linux version, too.
I should be grateful if anyone could offer any suggestions.
