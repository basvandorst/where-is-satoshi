Hello! One should not send out one's revocation certificate to the world, as
anybody can revoke the key with it (and then upload it to the keyservers).
In this actual case it doesn't matter, as the key is to be revoked anyway.
IMHO not. One of the purposes of a revocation-certificate is to give you the
chance to make the key unusable if you have *forgotten* your passphrase.

Even if this was true, it is probably not wise to furnish Windows users
with an 'old' version of GnuPG. People may have the impression that it
is not maintained as well anymore. Obviously, this is a marketing
perspective (and may even be incorrect) but depending on the goals of
the GnuPG project, this point should not be overlooked. If you want to
reach end-users (I assume so), Windows still is *the* market and will
remain so for the foreseeable future. I'm not sure that "we will keep
maintaining 1.x because it's still useful" (GnuPG 2.0 announcement) is
the right message here.
Apart from this soft reason, a replacement for pageant (Putty's SSH
agent) that does support the OpenPGP smartcard is *definitely* something
I would want under Windows. :-) Also, not every GnuPG-GUI does
passphrase-caching (which is AFAIK a slightly different thing than what
the agent does, anyway).
Not so definite about S/MIME but would surely be nice to have as well
(sometimes, one may want to use it outside of a mailer program or just
have a central certificate storage independent of the mailer).
Developers will be more qualified to comment here, but I imagine that a
"well defined API" to manage the configuration would also be a nice
thing compared to the various rather ad-hoc (I think) methods currently
in use by the available GUIs. Same could be true for scdaemon and the
other development-focused features.
Summarizingly, I hope that there will be a Windows version.
If nothing else, there should be a clear commitment as to the future of
1.4.x (i.e. not only maintaining but active further development) to
avoid the feeling that Windows users have a "second class" GnuPG.

--gen-random /0|1|2/ [/count/]

So you would need to issue something like "gpg --gen-random 2 32 >

to be used as a key by your other tool.
Note that I do not have an idea whether "0" or "2" is the highest

Apart from the *very* good point of Robert, your ?rivate key is still
protected by its passphrase after you run "gpg --export-secret-key". It
therefore cannot be used by someone who does not know the passphrase

installing a keyboard sniffer should not be too difficult).
The export only gives an attacker convenient access to the key file. But
if he can run gpg commands, he could just copy your secring.gpg anyway,
so he already has access to the secret key. Asking for a passphrase to
export the key would not change anything.
In fact, if you do not intentionally share your user account on your
machine, accessing the secret keyring file itself might be achieved far
easier (i.e. via insecure file permissions on ~/.gnupg) than running
GnuPG commands under your user account.
So, make sure that nobody except you can execute "gpg

Actually, predicting possible advances in fields like quantum computing
is very hard, so it would be far easier to follow the news on this topic
rather than decide *today* when your current key might become insecure
(to make a sensible decision about the expiry-date). Consequently, your
choice would have to be over-conservative (which is not necessarily a
bad thing).
Key expiry, to my understanding, is more of an automatic fallback

you cannot take care of revoking the key yourself.
This does very well justify the short lifetimes that we see on keys today.

I second Robert here. With 4GB of data, the hashing / symmetric encryption takes so long that it is almost totally irrelevant whether you use RSA/DSA/ElGamal. The amount of time for the asymmetric encryption/signing is constant and does not depend on the size of the data.
About the only scenario where you would be seriously concerned with asymmetric processing time would be a rapid exchange of very small data packets such as in an instant-messaging session. However, reducing keysize is far more effective here than changing algorithms (according to my experiences with Miranda's GnuPG plugin).

If you have *completely lost* the private key, you are screwed. Only the
public key is stored on keyservers and obviously, one cannot recover the
private key from that.
Without access to the private key, you cannot even designate the public
key on the keyserver as invalid (everyone could make such a request). I
assume that you did not create a revocation certificate (or at least,
that you formatted it along with the private key).
The passphrase does not help you at all, as it is only used to encrypt
the file containing the private key on your local harddisk. Without the
file, the passphrase is useless.
Take it as a lesson to make backups of important things from now on ;-/
GnuPG keyrings are very small and can easily go on USB drives, floppy
disks, your mobile phone or whatever. You could even *print* them on paper.
btw, would be cool to have GnuPG generate a special text output format
for the purpose of hardcopy-archiving. It could include additional
redundancy / parity information that makes recovering from typing / OCR
errors easier.
The ASCII output apparently already has some CRC information embedded,
but I am not sure whether that is able to give more information beyond
"incorrect data". Something like line-checksums to get "error in line
xy" would be nice.
I realize that this is a rare use-case, though, so don't take this

Others won't be able to encrypt *to* the revoked key anymore and you

Revocation isn't so much technically "destroying" the key, it is more an

If you still have access to the secret key, you do not have to use your

This may be true, but mind you that the "message" the ElGamal (or RSA)

minimal. (Mostly the same goes for performance issues.)
The size of the key has a vastly greater impact on performance issues
than algorithm choice, IMHO.
Anyway, keys are free. Go ahead and create two "test" keys: One RSA and
one ElGamal and write a little script that simulates your intended use
and makes a protocol of ciphertext sizes and performance measurements.
This way, you will probably get the most detailed information for your
intended application and make your own assumptions whether each
algorithm satisfies your (unstated) requirements.
I don't think that this is a theoretical limitation. It is definitely
not for RSA (there are larger keys around).
The current implementations do not generate larger keys because larger
keys don't bring real advantages.
Well, without going into the algorithm details, this is probably as
detailed an answer as you can get.
4096 bit RSA is as secure as 4096 bit ElGamal - both are "unbreakable"
(in practice). Then, if you are worried about an attacker that might
break 1024 bit RSA, you won't be safe with 1024 bit ElGamal, either.
One might add that (it is my impression that) more research goes into
factoring algorithms (hence, into breaking RSA) than on the discrete
logarithm problem. But as far as I understand the math, both problems
are rather related, anyway. So, if factoring research yields practical
advances in algorithms for attacking RSA, ElGamal breaking might become
easier as well.

GnuPG (and practically all other implementations) use a "hybrid"

A hybrid system first generates a random key for a symmetric algorithm

"session key").
The session key is then encrypted with the public key of each recipient
and all those encrypted session keys are sent along with the message.
The recipient then finds the session key packet that was encrypted for
his private key, decrypts the session key and uses the session key to
decrypt the message itself.
Apart from the nice property that you can encrypt for multiple
recipients, this has major advantages in efficiency:
The bulk of the data is encrypted with a relatively fast symmetric
algorithm and only the short key for that (say, 256 bit = 32 bytes) is
