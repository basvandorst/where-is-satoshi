Yes, you can get it from the homepage of gnupg. There are to files rsa.c
and idea.c which you need to fetch. Then you compile them and put them
in an appreciate path, where gpg can find them. Now you put
"load-extension rsa" and "load-extension idea" int the options file and
you are able to check RSA-Signature with gpg.
