I figured out that I have an older version of gnupg installed.
That is probably what  was causing the error.
I have installed gnupg-1-2-1 a whole bunch of times
I get no errors, but it doesn't seem to overwrite version 1.0.6

Hello all,
I am developing a small automated data exchange program and I am trying to get gpgme working.
I have gnupg-1.2.1 and gpgme-0.3.15 on a Mandrake 8.2 system
Everythings seems to work when I use gpg from the command line or gpa
but when I try gpgme I get errors.
Invalid Engine
Can anyone tell me what I am doing wrong?

Thanks Todd, I removed the version in /usr/bin and then it worked.

@_subject: What is 'invalidRecipient' error ? reason 0 ? 
Hello all,
I keep getting the following extended error info when I try to encrypt with a key I've just imported:
I thought the problem might be the validity of the key I'd just imported,
so I found out how to view it and change it to ultimate, but that did not
solve the problem.
I am writing an automated data exchange program via email using gnupg and My system setup:
Mandrake 8.2
gnupg 1.2.2
gpgme 0.3.15
The program runs on two or more machines with a single server and many For now I am testing with only one client and a server.
When I reverse the two machines, the error goes away.
I completely removed and reinstalled gnupg and gpgme, but the error persists on one machine only. The machine that fails used to work before I installed gpgme 0.4.0 to try it out, before reverting back to gpgme 0.3.15 I am just learning this stuff, so any help or pointers would be greatly Michael Weiss

Sorry, I should have sent this to the list...

I am not using any command lines to gpg at all,
I am using gpgme with my own C++ code
No, but I probably should have erased them too when I did a (what I thought
was complete) removal and reinstall.
I can't copy them across because the machines are supposed to
generate and exhange keys automatically.  They cant have the same keys.
I think it wouldn't compile due to some changes or something, sorry I don't
remember any better...
I mostly went back because I thought 0.3.15 was more 'stable', am I right?
Thanks for all the input...

No, you have not wasted my time, this could be just what I was looking for.
I will try it and see...

@_subject: Help importing non-self-signed keys 
Hello all,
I am developing an automated secure data transfer system using email and gnupg (gpgme)
I get an error no-user-id somtimes when I import a key, and somtimes I dont.
I cannot tell what causes it to fail somtimes and not others.
I read previous posts in this list and found that the error 'no user id' is because the key is not self signed.  The post mentioned an option that
could be passed to gpg to override the default behaviour of not accepting
non self signed keys, but this does not help me as I am using gpgme and
can't pass options to gpg (that I know of!).
What really gets me is that it works fine sometime and not others.
Should it not fail consistantly or pass consistantly?
I am using:
Mandrake 8.2
gnupg 1.2.2
gpgme 0.3.15
I am trying to figure out how to sign the key when I am exporting it as this seems to be to correct way of fixing the problem...
This is my new high level algorithm so far (It doesnt work) On the mobile end:
------- I decrpyt the file with my public key
Then I run verify to convert the signed file to plaintext
Then I import the plaintext
Could anyone tell me if I am going about this the right way?
Am I doing things in the wrong order?  Is there a better way?

Hello All,
I can't seem to figure out how to sign a key with gpgme.
Is it possible?
