@_subject: Wrong key usage (0x19, 0x2) on key 
Hello all,
I noticed my key has started throwing this warning in new versions, it may
have been related to me trying to add an authentication key for my YubiKey
so I'm hoping I didn't mess it up.  I've done some Googling to see if
there's a way to restore it to normal operation without much success:
gpg: bad data signature from key : Wrong key usage (0x19, 0x2)
Secret key is available.

[ultimate] (1). Chris Horry [ultimate] (2)  Chris Horry [ultimate] (3)  Chris Horry [ultimate] (4)  Chris Horry The two revoked subkeys were from my YubiKey experiments, I've since
created a separate key for that device and it's working just fine.
Any help appreciated, I just want to remove the warnings and hopefully get
reassurance my key is working.  I just use it for signing, certification
and encryption (and decryption).  Creating a new key is an option, but
would be inconvenient :(

@_subject: PGP Authentication with gpg4win+ssh 
Hello All,
I'm trying to get this to work with gpg4win.  I have a Yubikey with a PGP
key stored and it works just fine.  I connect with PuTTY, it connects to
the GPG agent and  it pops up asking for my Yubikey PIN and away I go.
My config looks like this:
Linux side: authorized_keys file has the converted PGP key as RSA keys
Windows side: PGP key is in the Kleopata keyring.  gpg-agent.conf has
enable-putty-support, gpg-connect-agent is running.
I also created an Authentication subkey for my other PGP Key, the only
difference being it's not on my Yubkiey but in my regular keyring with
Kleopatra.  This same key works just fine on my Linux boxes when I use it
for authentication between them but not in Windows.  PuTTY shows no keys
available in the agent and thus my login is rejected.
Is there some setting I'm missing or does gpg4win only support PGP
authentication with SSH via a smart card?

Yep did all of that, my auth key is in sshcontrol.  Pagent simply doesn't
see it, and ssh-add -l is blank.  If I connect my PGP smartcard it works
just fine.
If I do a gpg --list-keys my keys all show up just fine.
'Tis a mystery.
