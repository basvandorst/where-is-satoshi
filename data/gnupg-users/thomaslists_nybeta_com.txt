@_subject: GPA Clipboard encrypt dialog shows expired keys 
Should the GPA Clipboard tool be displaying expired encryption keys when you go to encrypt the buffer?  There's no indication of expired status for the public keys listed in the "Encrypt documents" dialog.
Seems like that dialog should either show you the "Expired" column or hide keys that are expired and can't be used to encrypt.
