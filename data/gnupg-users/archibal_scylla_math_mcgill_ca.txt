@_subject: Non-self-signed keys 
I use GnuPG to communicate with a friend who has only PGP2.6.  She
sent me her key without self-signing it.  I have confirmend the
fingerprint with her and I am confident that it was not modified in
transit.  However, I have not been able to get GnuPG to trust it.
As I understand it, all that should be necessary is to sign it with
my secret key.  I have done this.
Is it possible to convince GnuPG that I really do trust this key, or
do I absolutely have to get a self-signed version from her?
PS. These keys live on multi-user machines, so they are not very
secure to begin with.

@_subject: Assembler problem on Irix 6.5 
I recently attempted to install GnuPG on an Irix 6.5 machine.  I encountered
some problems.  The symptoms were infinite loops and occasional
segfaults.  In particular, attempting to import the attached file
"gpg-low-security-key" into an empty public keyring (the private
keyring had only the corresponding secret key, impored from another
machine) would fail with a "Bus Error" when GnuPG was compiled with
$ env MAKE=gmake ./configure --enable-static-rnd=egd --with-included-zlib --with-included-gettext --disable-nls --disable-dynload --prefix=/home/s2/archibal/software/gpg --enable-m-guard
My GDB (which I think is broken) would report the error as occurring
in "md_enable" at the line "*ac = *r":
    /* and allocate a new list entry */
    ac = h->secure? m_alloc_secure( sizeof *ac + r->contextsize
   *ac = *r;
    ac->next = h->list;
    h->list = ac;
When I recompiled with $ env MAKE=gmake ./configure --enable-static-rnd=egd --with-included-zlib --with-included-gettext --disable-nls --disable-dynload --prefix=/home/s2/archibal/software/gpg          The software hung, appearing to loop indefinitely in "mpi_invm".
Finally, when reompiling with
$ env MAKE=gmake ./configure --enable-static-rnd=egd --with-included-zlib --with-included-gettext --disable-nls --disable-dynload --prefix=/home/s2/archibal/software/gpg --disable-asm
The operation appeared to succeed.  In particular, it did not hang or
cause a bus error, and gpg --list-keys conatins the new key.  I have
not yet successfully tested encryption since I am having trouble with
egd.  When I recompiled gpg to user the rndunix generator, it appears
to work; I can encrypt and decrypt files. The final configure line is:
$ env MAKE=gmake ./configure --with-included-zlib --with-included-gettext --prefix=/home/s2/archibal/software/gpg --disable-asm --enable-static-rnd=none
Thank you.
