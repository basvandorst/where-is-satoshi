I just got it to work, after having failed the same way Micah did.
Here's what I did:
* I visited the web page with Netscape.
* I dragged the mouse over the key blocks, thus copying the keys into
  the X select buffer (or whatever it's called)
* I used GNU Emacs to visit a new file, and yanked the keys into the
  file's buffer by typing control-Y.
* I saved that file as /tmp/keys, then at the shell, typed `gpg
  --import /tmp/keys'.  This failed with this message
        gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
        gpg: Total number processed: 0
* Then I had a brainstorm: I deleted the trailing whitespace from the
  file by typing, in Emacs,
        M-x replace-regexp RET         [ SPC tab ] + $ RET RET
* Then I saved the file, and re-did gpg --import.  This time it
  worked.

A word of pessimism: GnuPG is indeed meant to be a replacement of PGP,
but (*sigh*) that doesn't mean it's a transparent replacement.
Specifically: its command-line options are quite different, and I'd
expect any program that was designed to use PGP would fail miserably
if given GnuPG, because the program would pass command-line options
that work for PGP, but don't work for GnuPG.
Now, it would probably be reasonably straightforward to re-write the
program to deal with GnuPG, but it would require work.
Note that I've never actually seen pgpdomo; I'm just being a
pessimist.  And another thing: GnuPG (by default, at least) doesn't support the
IDEA or RSA encryption algorithms, yet those are the only algorithms
that PGP 2.0 for MS-DOS uses.  So unless you get some GnuPG extensions
for those algorithms, you cannot add PGP 2.0 keys to your keyring, or
encrypt for PGP 2.0 users, or decrypt messages from them.

This should really be a FAQ.
If you're using Debian GNU/Linux, then all you need to do is install
the packages `gpg-rsaref' and `gpg-idea'.  Then add these lines to
        load-extension rsa
        load-extension idea

@_subject: What does `sig!3' mean in the output of `gpg --check-sigs'? 
In particular, what do the exclamation point and the 3 mean?  As you
might guess, I checked all the documentation I could find, and even
looked at the source (which wasn't illuminating).
