@_subject: Signing MS-Excel spread sheets 
Just my two cents worth: isn't it true that most Windows zippers can  open a file "from inside a zip archive", i.e. uncompress it  transparently to a temp directory and open from there? One easy-to- use solution could therefore be to store the Excel file inside a zip  archive, and then sign that archive? When the second person opens the  spreadsheet, all the changes Excel wants to do are done to the  temporary copy -- not the actual spreadsheet itself.
