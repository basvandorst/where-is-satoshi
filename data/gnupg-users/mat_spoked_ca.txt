Hash: SHA256
I have recently generated subkeys to use with a GPF Cryptostick. I
decided to make full use of the ability to use 4096 bit keys with
recent versions of GnuPG ( > 2.0.18 I think). Everything is working
except when trying to decrypt a file or message encrypted to my
encryption subkey.
On this topic, I have found the following thread on the GPF forums,
which lead me back to this list.
The error output is the same as in the above thread, with no more
detail than:
gpg: public key decryption failed: General error
gpg: decryption failed: No secret key
Somehow, gpg2 is not able to read the key from the card. Is this a
known bug? I have not found anyone else documenting this.

Thanks for the references. After reading them, I come to the same
conclusion. I enabled the debug log for scdaemon and can attest to the
same behavior. There is no interaction with the card in the log when
trying to decrypt.
