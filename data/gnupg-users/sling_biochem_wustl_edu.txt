Thank you for the message.
I am also new to GPG, my question is: Is there a Windows version of GPG that I may apply to encrypt a file before sending it with Outlook-Express as attachment?

Could you please give us more details or point us to some sites about running Outlook with GPG or PGP or something else free?  Windows users need to be supported.
Thank you.
