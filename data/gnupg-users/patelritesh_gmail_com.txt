I was using GnuPG 1.4.5.
$ gpg --list-sigs
pub   1024D/2BD18395 2009-12-11
uid                  Test2 (Testing 2) sub   1024g/474B7E93 2009-12-11
$ gpg --keyring test3 --no-default-keyring --import
gpg: keyring `/home/test1/.gnupg/test3' created
gpg: key 7D6F8608: public key "Test3 (Testing 3) " imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
$ gpg --keyring test3 --list-keys
pub   1024D/7D6F8608 2009-12-11
uid                  Test3 (Testing 3) sub   1024g/636851B8 2009-12-11
Now I signed first test2 at test.com key with my key (test1 at test.com, which is
untimely trusted key) and able encrypt message using keyring test2,
test2 at test.com key.
$ gpg --keyring test2 --sign-key -u test1 at test.com test2 at test.com

@_subject: GnuPG 1.4.5 brokes my trustdb.gpg 
I was using GnuPG 1.2.1. I have 15 keyrings setup using GnuPG 1.2.1 and I
singed those users public key my my private key. I can successfully encrypt
a message and send those user, if I use GnuPG 1.2.1.
Now I upgraded GnuPG to 1.4.5. I can encrypt message using GnuPG 1.4.5 for
those old keyrings and trustdb.gpg
But when I try to setup new keyring for a new user (by importing client's
public key in a new keyring), my all previous keyring and their trust gets
broken. When I try to encrypt message for the previous client (who's keyring
and trust are setup using 1.2.1) I get following error message:
gpg: F5255893: There is no assurance this key belongs to the named user
gpg: [stdin]: sign+encrypt failed: unusable public key
Please help. thanks
