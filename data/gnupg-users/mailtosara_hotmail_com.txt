@_subject: GPGSM with x.509 Certificate 
I have created a self signed certificate(x.509) from the site  and imported it to GnuPG. Then I tried to encrypt a file using the imported x.509 certificate, I got an error "Line too long". Couldn't get much details from
 forums.
Please share your ideas/suggestions on this.
