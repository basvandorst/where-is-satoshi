@_subject: gnupg 1.0.2 does not compile 
(CC: wiz  gnupg-users
gnupg 1.0.2 has some trouble with gettext functions. Although the
configure script discovers the system-provided libintl, it does not use
it.  At least in the subdirectories "util" and "g10", compile options
must not include -I../intl, and link options must include -lintl. If I
change this manually, everything compiles fine.
This is unfortunately also true for the newer version 1.0.3...
Note: I am not subscribed to gnupg-users, so please Cc: me any replies.
