@_subject: bug? gpg --version and gpg --help do not show same modules 
I'm still running GnuPG 1.0.0 with the rsa and idea modules loaded.
When I run gpg --version, I get:
Supported algorithms:
Cipher: IDEA, 3DES, CAST5, BLOWFISH, TWOFISH
Pubkey: RSA, RSA-E, RSA-S, ELG-E, DSA, ELG
Hash: MD5, SHA1, RIPEMD160
When I run gpg --help, I get:
Supported algorithms:
Cipher: 3DES, CAST5, BLOWFISH, TWOFISH
Pubkey: ELG-E, DSA, ELG
Hash: MD5, SHA1, RIPEMD160
Can someone with GPG 1.0.1 check to see if this bug is still around?
Just curious...

@_subject: Email authentication?? 
Hash: SHA1
I wonder if the next RFC for PGP will add a protocol that only counts
printable characters and IGNORES ALL WHITESPACE characters for the purpose
of calculating checksums.  I bet that it would alleviate (or mask?) a lot
of problems with mail programs that try to "pretty-up" messages, do
CR-CRLF conversions, etc...
Does anyone know if this idea has been discussed before?
