@_subject: make problem 
Hi all -
(2.2.6 kernel) on an I686
system. When I run the following:
./configure --with-included-gettext
Both the configure and make (compiles) seem fine until:
making all in gnupg-1.0.0/doc/gph
g10/gpg --yes --dearmor -o ./signatures.jpg ./signatures.jpg.asc
g10/gpg:  can't resolve symbol '__register_frame_info'
Am I missing something obvious? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.
