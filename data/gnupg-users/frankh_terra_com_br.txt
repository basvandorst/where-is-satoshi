@_subject: Password on command line? 
Hi there,
I work occationally on some text files ciphered symmetrically, which
involves the following steps:
So I wrote a script for that, but I have to type in 3 times the same
passphrase: for deciphering, ciphering and confirmation.
Passing the passphrase as command line parameter would solve the problem,
because the script could read it and pass it to gpg, but according to the
man pages such a gpg option doesn't exist. The option --passphrase-fd gave
me some hope first, because I thought I could write the passphrase in a
file first and wipe it out at the end, but my linux book only told me
about the standard file descriptors 0, 1 and 2, which don't help me.
Any suggestion?
