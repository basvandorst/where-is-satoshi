@_subject: v1.4.22: re--importing --export'ed key from 
Last saturday i search/stumbled over an interesting Debian page
(Subkey.html) which describes how to generate a dedicated siging
subkeys, and how to create a new key pool via
--export-secret-subkeys which does not contain (all parts of) the
real private key, so that the secret key can be stored "somewhere
else" but the newly reimported secret (sub)key can still be used
for signing purposes.
I did not know about that yet, unfortunately, and have started to
use the "normal" key, so that possible users will have to reimport
the updated key.  But because it is a really great thing to be
able to move the complete private key somewhere else, and to have
the remains with a different password at hand, i did that.
So despite the fact that noone is interested in that long story
(sorry), i cannot find a bug in the bug-db that corresponds to the
behaviour i see, and that is that i neither can --export the
public key from that mutilated private key and use that one for
--encrypt'ion, nor can use the key itself for that (the encryption
key seems "hidden", but if i "toggle" --edit-key then i can see it
still).  But i can use it for signing purposes.
My question: is this a bug that --export does not yield a valid
public key that can be used for --encrypt'ion, and that the key as
such cannot be used for that, too?  Shall i open a bug report.

It seems that there is no better way than scripting it. My "--edit-key +
clean" script is below. It can be changed to "minimize".
gpg --batch --with-colons --list-keys | awk -F: '
$1 == "pub" {pub = 1}

Can you give more details?  I know that some older systems did rely on X
or startx or something being setuid, but i think more modern systems
don't require that.  On a debian testing (buster) system, for example, i
don't believe that any of the binaries are suid.
..because some packagers do CRUX to avoid it, maybe because they
do not want to violate some policy.
For example, for the MUA i maintain, Debian ships with the
privilege-separated "dotlock" helper, but does not install it
SETUID.  This is good enough for the shared mail directory the way
Debian does it, in fact the package maintainer is pretty clever,
right, but of course this is not how it is designed; today: it was
a SETGID helper in the past, but that does not work on eg. OpenBSD
where only root can write in the mail spool.  And since this MUA
supports multiple mail spools, it will not work unless they are
setup in exactly the same way.  But only normal file-locking, as
is the chosen approach on OpenBSD (for my MUA), is not the way the
Debian maintainer wants to go.  Well, this is his choice.
(Besides i am in total favour of not having SETUID, not only
because i had a CVE myself.  Here Xorg still is SETUID, but i have
never looked too deep.  For graphics hardware access, you need to
have access to hardware, no.  Ie., whether hardware is designed so
that this becomes possible, i do not know.  Being able to start
a program SETUID, open some files, and then enter a restricted
mode which has lost root rights, i do not feel bad about.  Like
the FreeBSD capsicum thing, or even CloudABI.  Maybe i even prefer
being able to search SETUID and have a list, instead of having
very complicated configuration settings, and CRUX, hidden here and
there.  But i am not a security researcher, i just try to do
a little thing right.)

1.  How should we handle the SKS keyserver attacks?
  ...
Another says, "with a recent GnuPG release SKS may be used productively
and we should keep the current advice."
I am using them, and have had the sks-keyservers.net in my own
cacert pool for a long time.  I do only import rarely, very
specific keys, and only with supervision, however.  It has always
been like that, and i also always clean keys, since i personally
never really had a glue onto the PGP approach of that web of trust.
I still whimper that the new German passports did not ship with
SSL and PGP keys/certificates.  But that is something different.
  ...
2.  What should be done about the FAQ's guidance to use RSA-2048?
First, I think everyone agrees it should be removed, as it's just not
accurate any more; we've defaulted to RSA-3072 for some time.
One option is, "remove it and update the text to refer to RSA-3072, our
current default."
Another is, "remove it and update the text to refer to ECC, which will
be our next default."  (If so: which curve and which lengths do you
think should be the default?)
(Again, third, fourth, and fifth ways are welcomed.)
This mail only because i want to point out that, if i remember
this correctly, the majority of FreeBSD committers who had a PGP
key used RSA 4096 already in 2002, or around that time.  (4.7
times i think these were.)
3.  What should we advise people about their existing RSA-2048 keys?
"There's no rush, but migrating them to [whatever our new guidance is]
at a deliberate pace is advised, since RSA-2048 isn't expected to be
generally safe past 2030"
"Your existing RSA-2048 keys are fine, you don't need to take any action"
(Again, third, fourth, and fifth ways are welcomed.)
You know, i would say people should be advised to use the most
compatible, most secure keys available for their "very key".
Regardless of computing cost that is.  And use specific "weaker",
"faster" or whatever keys for specific purposes, like tarball
signing, or whatever.  I have never understood any other advise,
actually.  I have vague memories of a very "conservative" sentence
on the use of PGP keys on the mentioned FreeBSD handbook page, it
must be more than 15 years, and i have only read it once.
I adhered to that, and i now that all the RSA 4096 things i have
produced ever since will be safe for quite some time, maybe even
until i die (which could happen anytime though), unless the
quantum thing explodes somehow (not a mathematician here).
I still have to log into SSH hosts which do not support anything
but RSA (i have only ever used RSA keys, not DSA i think it was,
and am using ED25519 for an increasing number of other hosts).
(P.S.: personally i am also still using GnuPG v1.4.23, in my
private path, even though i have 2.2.17 in /usr here, and the
rotating head of ArchLinux also ships the new one, etc. etc.)

If you absolutely, positively, _need_ the most bits of security then
RSA4096 shouldn't be your go-to anymore. RSA4096 doesn't actually
provide 4096 bits of security. The _key_ sizes may be 4096 bits, but
you must understand the security comes from the the cardinality of
prime numbers, so the actual amount of security is only 131 bits of
security. Compare this to RSA's 3072 bit keys providing 125 bits of
security. Unlike RSA, ECC keys don't scale logarithmically. For ECC,
the fields need to be a prime modulus, but that's about it. As a
result, the key sizes scale linearly with the bits of security by
a factor of 2. So, if you want the most security possible with GPG
_today_ you won't beat curve P-521, which provides ~261 bits of
security, and to get an equivalent in RSA your key size would need
to be at least 15360.
But you have to understand, even 128 bits of security is so
I might a bit if i follow this road long enough.
incredibly large that even the combined computing power of every
processor we have now won't be enough to crack it. See:
 for just how effort
it'd take.
By the way, 256 bits of security isn't twice the amount of 128 bits.
129 bits is twice the amount of security of 128 bits. Get it?
If you are curious just how much effort it'd take to break a 256 bit
key, I'd argue that it's physically impossible because there simply
isn't enough energy in the universe to break it... see:
My download is excessed until the 22nd.  But will throw an eye.
But I digress. It's not the bits of security that matter anymore.
For me the fascinating thing in this area are all those ideas
which human minds had to not have a need to do brute force
searching.  Regarding my GPG passwords i think nothing much can be
done about that though, except restricting the search to the bytes
that pass "tr -cd 'a-zA-Z0-9_.,= but which is already
a significant reduction.
You have a far bigger chance of being insecure with side-channel
attacks etc, than you are with not enough bits of security. That is
a far bigger security hole... Being on a device that is exposed

to the internet. That's where you'd get cracked. Not the key size
being too small.
Actually i do not think that is really true, or only by accident.
I think the problems are theft, trojan horses, threat of force,
and that unfortunately includes coercive detention also (maybe
also only and even) in our western first world.  So even with what
for example FreeBSD has, where you can have some space on your
harddisk which looks like random data but actually contains an
encrypted partition, (i am pretty sure in the Linux world this is
also doable somehow), there are drugs and other specialists which
can make you talk and reveal that presence.  At some later time
i would expect a court order to access log etc. data in and of the
brain implant will increase personal rights and freedom.
And not the key size being too small may likely be true, but
shortly after Y2K i am pretty sure to remember right that the
"usual defaults" where 1024 bits for RSA or so, and whoever
followed that advise and had some records protected by such a key,
and there are records which are of real value, might have or look
forward to problems if they got lost.  Which thus brings me back
to the FreeBSD developer handbook entry which talked about 4096
bit keys around that time.
So yes, an excursion like yours is pretty cool and of value, and
experts do know, but for "normal people" i would always favour the
best thinkable default.  For that audience that EC stuff may also
just work, then.  I mean, the thing is that "normal people"
usually never get to use GnuPG directly anyway, and having the
best defaults if gpg gets used indirectly by application programs
is possibly better than having lots of configurations in this app
and that app.  (Like the central OpenSSL configuration file that
is now possible, with sections for individual programs.  Though
programs need adjustments to use that.)
Btw., you use autocrypt headers, in this mail of yours there are
thus two certificate keys included.  Unfortunately my MUA not yet
can either of them, and will not before next spring.
At that time we will support PGP/MIME and inline signed/encrypted
messages (even though it will not be nice until some later
time).  And will have a look into OpenPGP: headers.  But not
autocrypt, no.

Not exactly. Actually, this is precisely why I find public key cryptography so cool. If you do not explicitly add your own address
to the list of recipients, you will not be able to decrypt the message!
But wait, that is a frantic scenario.
This may sound silly, but you may want to write something to someone
that you cannot ever possibly be compelled to decrypt. It will be impossible for you to decrypt, even though you wrote it and encrypted
it and even if you have the file in your possession and even if you
have all your secret keys and you know all of your own passwords
and have them written down. You can smile serenely while they're

a straitjacket hammering the back of his head against the pad in
some cave cell, trying to get rid of a lot of side channel attacks
(my impression, entirely others may have seen a man gone grazy).
securely communicate in a way they cannot prove who sent what
terrifies them. It's also what lead to the US trying to classify
such crypto as a military munition, which was later repealed in court
in Bernstein vs US Department of State. They're trying to bring it
back though (hah, fat chance)!
Oh yes, i also have the impression that hysteria gains currency.
A lot of which surely is tactics to gain momentum against chinese
made and designed communication hardware, nevermind the extra

I didn't realize there were people in this mailing list who didn't

"Thank you" ^_^.  I think yes!  No, i would not, i think it is
a strange thing, of course public keys must come from somewhere,
but passing several hundred or so bytes in each and every mail
message seems like a weird thing to do.  Especially if the key is
shipped alongside the message already, and then headers can be
spoofed, so autocrypt makes sense alongside dkim and such third
party signing environments, which i also dislike, in the form they
come.  (I would prefer a CMS message envelope i think, but sure,
this requires MIME messages.)  I mean, if i want to have signed
communication with someone, i could very well just send her or him
a signed message saying so, and then the key is also where it
belongs, no?  Strange thing...

I'm no expert but their Certificate Policy reads to me that the

I think it is common that S/MIME and SSL certificates are
delivered via PKCS12, including the private key.  You then seem to
extract the individual things like

  $ openssl pkcs12 -in cert.p12 -out key.pem -nocerts -nodes
keys are generated on the subscriber's device and only the public key
goes to the CA to be certified.
This is possible via CACert.org, at least still (out of money).
You create your local signing request, and the private key.pem never
leaves your own box:

they want to do it like that?  They could very well just offer the
one-liner and allow pasting of the signing request, then the
private key would never have been exposed to anyone but the user.

With StartSSL it was like that, the browser generated the signing
request i hope.  But i do not know.
And, the above i inherited in the manual of the software
i maintain.  I have not seen this in the wild on my own.

That i have done myself.
Comodo does not offer this any more. At the beginning of the year they
reduced the smime cerificates validity from 1 year to 1 month, now they
withdraw it all together.
I did not know that.  It was the only free service that i found
when i searched for a free S/MIME certificate last, but i kept
using CACert.org.  (Until i support PGP, when i will switch.)

Well yes sort of, but I can tell you from my own experience PGP is more for
hackers while smime is not. I have convinced 6 of my friends to use
smime, but only one to pgp.
Self signed smime certificates are basically useless, because then you
have to tell the other user either to install a root certificate or to
trust the certificate, in which case smime looses its convenience
(compared to pgp)
Well, hm, yes.  What should i say.  It depends a bit, once you
know a certificate is correct some software allow to just agree to
the checksum of a certificate, for example, no need for a root
certificate no more.  To know it is correct you need the
certificate which signed it in what you use as your local pool of
certificate authorities, of course.
I do have GPG keys in may keyring which were not signed by anyone
(when i downloaded them), too, i saw the fingerprint in some
announcement mail or on some website, searched SKS, and downloaded
the one key which did match.  (I think Postfix releases are still
shipped with a gpg1 key sign that is revoked, last i looked,
i always have to look how i can actually use a revoked key
Personally i like S/MIME more, because it comes from the same pool
of standards etc. that TLS uses, and the same library can be used
to deal with it, than what i use for TLS anyway.  In theory file
signing and all the other things would be possible via it, too,
the primitives are there, it is just not used in that there are no
omnipresent tools available, like GPG is.
There is no other reason really, except that for mail different
standards for MIME are used, and here i like the PGP one more ;)
That is just how it is, and having said that, i do use PGP since
many years, but only very rarely and mostly automatized (after
having had immense loss due to lost passwords of encrypted

Nope, that is the wrong way round. The correct sequence to obtain an
S/MIME certificate is as follows:
1. User X creates a private key *locally*. This private key must never
be handed to anybody else.
2. User X creates a certificate signing request (CSR) and sends it to a
certificate authority (CA).
3. The CA uses the CSR to create a signed certificate, and sends that
certificate back to user X.
Ok, but that is exactly what i have written a few lines later for
the CACert example that i posted, right.  So not nope, Mr.
Where "user X" meant "browser of user X" when i did so for
a StartSSL certificate.  I assume it did the right thing.  But
i do not know.
4. User X can then optionally combine private key and signed certificate
in a .p12 file to ease importing the data *locally* in his MUA (it is
usually more convenient to deal with a single file that combines both
private key and certificate).
If the process is altered in any way in which a third party gets hold of
user X's private key, security is broken, no matter if the private key
is password protected or not.
That is surely right.

This is actually only half true.  The original manual only

Because it's outside the scope of what Let's Encrypt exists to do, which
is make it easy to provide HTTPS support to small websites.
SMTP is *totally* outside of Let's Encrypt's mission.  If you've got a
problem with that, take it up with Let's Encrypt.  They're pretty
responsive on Twitter at If i recall correctly Melnikov made a draft how the ACME stuff
could be extended to S/MIME, but it never left draft state.  I do
not listen to the according IETF working groups, ...  Wait, it is
still an active draft, version 6, last updated this year July: [1]
Unfortunately it wants DKIM/SPF/DMARC and a single MIME message
body, which counteracts my desire to vanquish that in favour of
a nice CMS thing that puts list addresses in From:, or so.  Sigh.

Because CACert hasn't been able to comply with Mozilla's Root Store
Policy.  Chrome has its own root store policy, as does Internet
Explorer.  CACert hasn't been able to dot the is and cross the ts for
any of them, AFAIK.

This is maybe the wrong list, but only here i am subscribed and to
me this is one project in the end, but i apologise for that.
Yesterday i installed an OpenBSD 6.7 VM here, and was not able to
start it with my default config (-device virtio-rng-pci) because
libgcrypt failed with
  Fatal: no entropy gathering module detected
(Was quite a journey to find the source of this message...)
Long story short: i finally realized that if i run qemu without
-chroot everything is fine even with virtio-rng, as a workaround
i have created a minimal /dev/ in this chroot so libgcrypt can
access ?random devices.  But i wondered why the fd is not kept
open, you see quite some server related problems if you search the
above.  But further more, is there usage of the system call or the
C library backend on the road?  Shall i even open a bug tracker
Thanks in advance, Ciao!

That is pretty standard except for the --disable-padlock-support - why
do you use this?  Padlock is only used on VIA CPUs and has an auditable
design in contrast to RDRAND (which is used by Libgcrypt be default).
I am overasked why this is done.  I have not looked for how RDRAND
bugs are handled by libgcrypt either, Werner.  Wait.  Sigh.
Looking at the source it seems libgcrypt knows about the Linux
getrandom systemcall.  Yet it does not seem to know about glibc's
getrandom library function.
Hm, so why does random/random-csprng.c:getfnc_gather_random() look
out for NAME_OF_DEV_*RANDOM at all .. hmm .. i must admit
random/rndlinux.c:_gcry_rndlinux_gather_random() seems strange to
me.  :)  Two possible calls to getpid, could be "((apid = XPID) !=
my_pid || !add)"; ah i see the FDs could become cached (until
fork), .. and then the getrandom syscall is tried even though FDs
have been opened despite its presence.  This, excuse me ;),
i would change quite a bit.  I would not do any FD related thing
at all if getrandom is available, and i, for the MUA i maintain,
simply look for getrandom, library or syscall (the latter came
first; users can explicitly specify via VAL_RANDOM what they want,
Looking at the development version now it finally seems to me that
the library call is supported.
I still would not do it like that, because if software cannot rely
on what has been detected at configuration time all bets are off.
I must admit i do the NOSYS check myself for this thing, but only
for it, not for anything else.  Also not for "system calls" which
change behaviour dependent on library symbol version
(realpath(2/3) comes to mind, exclusively).
Anyhow, unless i am mistaken from this five minute looking, that

Are you running in FIPS mode?
Can you run the Libgcrypt test suite?  In particular
$ libgcrypt/tests/version
$ libgcrypt/tests/random --verbose --debug
Well i could.  Is this still of interest?

So with the attached patch libgcrypt solely relies upon getentropy
if available, no FD handling is done no more if at all possible.
The test suite passes, a short review makes me think it is alright.
- The setup could block when the OS cannot serve 1 byte of strong
  entropy.  This is different to before, access(2) does not.
  (On the other hand neither on OpenBSD nor on newer Linux (5.4 or
  5.6 i think) this should matter.  And it is likely it does not
  elsewhere, either people seem to have used things like my
  entropy-saver or even hammers like haveged which reveal how
  strange entropy counting was, imho.)
- Some tests aka code places directly reach into
  _gcry_rndlinux_gather_random() and thus only give errors in
  open_device() not the warning that initiated this ML thread.
  This i did not get at first, the tests suite passed nonetheless.
- P.S.: even if this patch is not used, i would suggest an audit
  of this file.
- RANDOM_CONF_ONLY_URANDOM lost its meaning in the past, and this
  patch does not reinstantiate that.  It cannot be done portably,
  except for OSs which provide getrandom(2).
- I shortly thought about using "extern", but i think doing so in
  an isolated fashion is surely wrong.

Maybe, but it was not.
Please find attached a second one to be applied on top, it fixes
some preprocessor problems.
Please just feel free to take those, and commit under your name or
any way you like it.  Joining them into one would be nice...
Thank you, and Ciao,

I think it does not matter.
Professional businesses and their customers can use the mentioned Mailve\
lope key server,
to protect their keys or use for anonymity purposes Hagrid, in combination \
with sequoia
pgp, while the geeks can use WKD.
The only thing SKS, so it seems, is currently good for is decentralized \
file sharing or
for chat purposes, when using SKS chat software.
SKS served me very well for many years, and it is a shame that
even national/related agencies with quite some funding, or
universities with that immense pool of students did not stood up
trying to keep this decade old community driven infrastructure
alive.  I guess they all were eating burger, and at that level.
