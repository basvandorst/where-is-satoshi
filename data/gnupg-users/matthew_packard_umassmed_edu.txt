Thanks for your quick response - I compiled 1.2.2 (BTW had a weird issue with make and the ./tools/Makefile - complained about libcipher.a - I did a make clean and reran configure and it went OK). I'm in the process of decrypting the ~8G file right now (1.2.2 seems to decrypt a lot faster and with less CPU consumption - nice work), and I'll let you know how things turn out.
    But my new question is this - I searched through the man pages, the FAQ, Google, etc. and did not find any switches relating to the partial length headers option you mention. So, does that mean that GPG performs this under the hood, or do I need to supply a switch on encryption/decryption that will enable this? Also, is my current ~8G file no good after ~4G, since it doesn't look like I used partial length headers for the original encryption (not a big deal if the file is unusable, but it'd be nice to recover it)?
Thanks in advance,
Matthew Packard

Werner / Everyone,
    Well, I just got finished with the decryption (GPG 1.2.2) - it failed again:
            :symkey enc packet: version 4, cipher 3, s2k 3, hash 2
                salt 50cddd890017df06, count 96

            gpg: WARNING: message was not integrity protected
            gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=3a)
    Any ideas would be most welcome.
Thanks in advance,

David / Everyone,
    Thanks for info - sad to see that I can't recover the file, but, oh well. Is there another way to handle a large (>4G) file in the future within GPG? Or should I just split each large file into ~3.5G files and then GPG them?
Thanks in advance,
Matthew Packard

David / Werner / Everyone,
    Thanks for the info - I'll stick with the newly installed 1.2.2.
Thanks again,

@_subject: Interesting issue with 1.2.2/1.2.3 and decrpyting files > 4g 
I was hoping someone may have run across this issue - I compiled 1.2.2 and 1.2.3 again on my box in an effort to fix the following issue, but without success. I have a large file (~8g) and am trying to decrpyt it with a symmetric key. However, when the file decrpytion gets to about 4g, I get the following errors:
        with 1.2.2:
                block_filter cdf38: read error (size=12085, a->size=12085)
                gpg: packet(6) with unknown version 5
        with 1.2.3
                block_filter cdf18: read error (size=12085t,a->size=12085)
                gpg: [don't know]: old style partial length for invalid packet type
                gpg: packet(7) with unknown version 1
                gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=0f)
                gpg: block_filter: pending bytes!
    OK, so I've searched the archives, and have found no immediately useful answers (hope I didn't overlook something), and I would really like to get this data back. The data was written with 1.2.2 and burned to DVD - I've tried to copy to disk and decrypt, and to decrypt right from the DVD. Did I miss something with LFs in the compilation, or is there something else?
    Thanks in advance for your advice, suggestions, and time.
