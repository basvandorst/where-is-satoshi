@_subject: Managing Subkeys for Professional and Personal UIDs 
I?m looking for best practices in creating and managing multiple subkeys and uids.
In my scenario, I have a personal computer and personal email address. In addition, I have an employer provided computer and employer email address.
I?d like to create a key architecture where if I?m ever compelled to compromise, revoke, or lose access to the signing and encryption keys on my work computer, the security and integrity of my personal files are preserved. The easiest solution seems to be generating separate primary keys for both identities. However, I believe this would undermine the WoT when I move to a new employer by not having all signing and encryption keys originating from the same primary key.
Is it possible to assign an encryption and signing sub key to a specific uid so I can separate the keys used?
Is there a better way to achieve this goal through other signing techniques?
