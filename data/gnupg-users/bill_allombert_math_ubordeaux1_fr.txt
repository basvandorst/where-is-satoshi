Maybe this due to the version of gpg I use (1.4.12 from Debian sid)
but I get an error
$ gpg --batch --no-options --no-default-keyring --trust-model=always \
     --keyring "$KEYRING" \
     --armor -o "$POPCONGPG" -r "$POPCONKEY" --encrypt "$POPCON"
gpg: keyblock resource `/root/.gnupg/secring.gpg': file open error
gpg: fatal: /root/.gnupg: directory does not exist!
secmem usage: 1408/1408 bytes in 2/2 blocks of pool 1408/32768

Dear GnuPG people,
I am the maintainer of Debian popularity-contest
I would like to encrypt reports with a public key provided by the package
before sending them. Currently I am using the following invocation:
(Currently gpg used is 1.4.12)
gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring debian-popcon.gpg --trust-model=always \
    --armor -o "$POPCONGPG" -r "$POPCONKEY" --encrypt "$POPCON"
where debian-popcon.gpg contains only the public key.
But there is two issues:
1) This creates spurious empty files in /root/.gnupg
2) I was told --keyring will be removed in gpg2, and obviously I cannot
use gpgv.
So I would appreciate any suggestion for improvement.
Thanks in advance,
Bill

According to the submitter of
this is not sufficient. Maybe I am doing it wrong, though.
Yes that would be nice.
