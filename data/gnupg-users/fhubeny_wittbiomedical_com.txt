@_subject: gpg141rc1, and rc2 home directory problems 
Hello Group;
I have found a possible problem with the two release candidates for
It has to do with the home directory.  If I uninstall 141, and then
remove the home directory.  When I reinstall the program and try to make
a key I get a error about no directory available.
I found that the uninstaller does not remove the registry entries for
141.  If I uninstall gpg141, remove the home directory, then remove the
registry enties for gpg141.  Then I can reinstall gpg141 and the home
directory is installed at installation.
Small problem I know.  But many Window users will not clean up their
registry, it is sort of a no no for most users who are told not to do so
unless they know what to remove, and how to do so.
The work around I found is to just add manually the directory and then
all is well.

@_subject: gpg version 1.40a on w2kp and winxp 
Hello All;
I hope that I am not just missing something here.  But I have been
getting a renameing error with the latest version of gpg for windows.  I
have tried on three separate pc's running W2KP, and Win XP.
I have also downloaded the version multiple times, and someone who
compiles gpg sent me a copy.  All do the same thing anytime I do
anything that changes the trust DB.
I have not seen anyone else post this problem.  It must be hard to debug
a OS that you all may not even use.  Is there a debug feature that I
might enable then send you the output.  If I am doing something wrong,
please let me know.  I have since reverted back to version "1.25 for

We have several such reports but not yet figured out the problem.
Frankly I have not yet replicated it as there are other tasks as well.
I have a Laptop running W2000 close to my keyboard and use this one
for testing.  Debugging is not a problem as gdb runs fine on that
My Response:
Thank you I thought I was going nuts.  If this helps out.  I run Windows
2000 Pro with service pack 4, and Win XP has I believe service pack 1a.
I was perhaps unclear about the debugging.  Is there a debug feature
that I may use on my PC to help ?  If so I would be glad to do so.
Thanks again for your response !

@_subject: Bug reporting question 
Hello Group;
I would like some information on what to send you all in a bug report.
It perhaps would be a aid to people like myself who are just not very
helpfull with what we do send.  Then get upset when we do not get any
I ask this because if Window binaries for release candidates do start
comeing out.  I would like to test them.  If problems do occur I sure do
not want to send in alot of usless stuff.
I do appreciate the Windows binaries you all do, and just sending in a
understandable bug report, if any, would most likely help.

@_subject: Windows GUI recommendation for USB disk 
Hello Robert;
I got your e-mail from gnupg user group posts.
You can use gpgshell on a USB drive.  You have to have a installed copy of both gpg, and gpgshell on your pc first.  Then down load a utility called copy2usb from the gpgshell web site.  There is a link to it in the documentation for gpgshell.
It works fine I am using it now and have removed all encryption tools from my pc.  The file manager in gpgshell works fine. For me to do encryption and decryption.
If I can help please send me any questions in plain text.
