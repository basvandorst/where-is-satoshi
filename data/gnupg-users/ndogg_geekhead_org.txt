@_subject: EudoraGPG frontend? 
Hash: SHA1
Has anyone used the EudoraGPG frontend?  I don't used Eudora, but some of my friends do and I would like for them to start using some sort of encryption.  I don't want to use PGP since it's not free and I don't understand all the implications of its redistribution.
How easy is it to install this on Eudora?
