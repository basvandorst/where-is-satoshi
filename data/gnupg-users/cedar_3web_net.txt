What the whole GPG WOT needs is the definition of "the user": an
assumption that a user (of any computer system) has a one-to-one
relationship to a living organism of Homo Sapiens kind is naive and
never works well in practice. In the absence of such definition it
is perfectly reasonable to use whatever definition seems "right" to
you under the circumstances. Signing a key of someone who you don't
know but who has presented you with a piece of paper you have no way
of authenticating is certainly no better or worse than signing a key
of someone whom you have met and conversed with online.

So it seems that - as the opening of your fine page suggests, it might be
"back to the future"; i.e.,
...One of the earliest versions of PGP, 2.6, is still highly regarded...
 From what I know, 2.6.3ia-multi06 would be the version of choice.
In contrast to USB drives, "in nasty places" the old floppy has one very
important advantage: it is the only r/w medium cheap enough to make practical
protocols which call for copies of both the software and the data to be
destroyed after each use. I was wondering if your proposition that [2.6]'s
"...cryptographic security has been in doubt for some time now..." really
applies to 2.6.3ia-multi06? (compatibility with the current crop of
PGPGs aside).

Of course. (I just re-used the expression from a previous post).
Let me thus rephrase:
Is there any reason to believe that with the right choice of
cipher and key length 2.6.3a multi 6 would be cryptographically
less secure than the current PGPG's?

There have been many discussions on this forum - a lengthy one just a
couple of weeks back - about the problems faced by many users who need
to run GPG in 'media-centric' (as opposed to 'computer-centric')
"modus operandi". It was my impression at the time that the developers
of GPG were convinced such use should be discouraged.
While I do not believe that whatever U3 consortium will hatch will
necessarily be the best way to go about it - for instance, there is no
multi-OS "statement of principle" in what was published so far - the
project does demonstrate a computer usage trend that GPG development
team should no longer ignore.

I was off in my timing, and I am in no way inclined to criticize
GPG developers. All I was trying to point out is that "media-centric"
use is becoming so common that it should not be left to hacking by the
"aftermarket" - it should be part of the design, sanctioned and put in
place by those best in the position to do so: GPG developers.
I would assume operation without booting, under "host" OS, most often
one of tthe Win32 variants, but see no reason not to include Linux and
OSX. The filesystem would have to be VFAT; and it would contain all the
software and data required to operate POP/SMTP mail and encrypt/decrypt
text, thus no writing to the file system of the host should be necessary.
In such operation GPG would be self-contained and strictly isolated from
the NET, only the mail client would be net- aware (note that the announced
Thunderbird variant, mentioned in the original post, already assumes
this would be possible - if not always, then in a sufficient number of
instances to make it practical).

Whatever you are doing, you should take into account one simple
fact: if you write data in one program to later on read it in
the next one, *you* have (some) control over what and where
remains on that disk. If you "pipe" data from one program into
another using the shell, *the system* writes pieces of "pipe"
on the disk, and you have little or no control over what and
where will be left on that disk.

Agreed, TC is not FS. I use "open source" as a colloquial term and not
as a designation of a particular application distribution licensing model.
In this case it satisfies the most important "open source" test: a user
can build his executable from the inspected source in his possession.
*This* is a "sine qua non" for any crypto application; all other rights
are - for the vast majority of users - of lesser consequence.
 > Frankly, I don't understand why the authors go this way.
I believe I do, but it's not for me speculate in public. As long as
the above condition is met, the authors of any crypto application should
be free to opt for whatever licensing model ~they~ feel will provide the
best solution for ~their~ application.

Zeljko, deniability has its place. It could be semantics, but perhaps you
are not be making sufficient distinction between deniability and deception.
Depending somewhat on the circumstances, with such file in your possession
you may not be able to deceive anyone but the most naive attacker. However,
you can deny, and, unless broken cryptographically, such file can not be
*proven* to be ciphertext. This can help you, but only in instances where
there are "rules of the game" which state that you are innocent until
proven guilty, that (as in, for instance, traditional 'common law'
criminal proceedings) this proof must be "beyond reasonable doubt", and
that you can be sanctioned for failing to produce the key if and only if
it can be proven that you are in possession of encrypted material. (Note
however that your case would be weakened by the presence of strong
circumstantial evidence to the contrary - for instance, possession and
evidence of previous use of software that produces such ciphertext).
In jurisdictions where such rules do not apply (even Canada, for
instance, recently suspended habeas corpus, you can be held indefinitely,
incommunicado; thus it is reasonable to assume you can also be tortured)
deniability is of no particular value in conflagrations with the
government, but it will probably be of some value if one is fighting
with one's employer.
In short, deniability is a valid claim, and can be a useful characteristic
of ciphertext in specific, well-defined instances.

Public key systems that attempt to provide a tightly inegrated
solution to the key authentication problem require, no matter what,
very good understanding of the concepts behind their "automated shell",
and are consequently ill-suited for the adoption by the general user
population. The sad reality of a decade of their (at best) marginal
adoption, restricted almost entirely to computer professionals,
demonstrates that beyond a trace of doubt.
Encrypted e-mail will become the norm, if and when, one of the following
two things happens:
a) There is a public key system which leaves key authentication
outside of its scope, to be performed by separate means and procedures,
by the tiny minority that actually needs it. If that was the case, the
system could be made simple enough for effective use by those that have
neither the time nor the inclination to develop the ability to use the
current system.
b) There is a general acceptance of the fact that the needs of a vast
majority of e-mail users would be adequately served by a simple
symmetric system.
