@_subject: Protecting IDs at a key signing party 
I moved to a small town in a new state for personal reasons.  For work I telecommuted as an independent consultant.  A computer user group I joined recently is going to be holding a key signing party.  NOBODY has met me more than three times, once a month.
Should I take more than two government issued IDs?
If the answer is to take more IDs, how should I organize, and protect them?
I could also bring a birth certificate, high school yearbook, URL to a college yearbook, US Army BCT yearbook, a photo of my US Army BCT platoon (signed on the back by 80% of the platoon), several college student IDs, four or five business cards from employment at two major computer manufacturers, three expired passports, URL to Linkedin, and an URL to Facebook.  All of it would seem like overkill.
What should I take?  How should I organize, and protect the IDs?
