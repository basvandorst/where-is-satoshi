@_subject: How to sign mail and news under Windows system by using GnuPG? 
Hi list,
Could anybody tell me how to sign a email under Windows by using
GnuPG? I've done some google, but could not find any Windows mail
client support GnuPG. Furthermore, I also want use GnuPG in Outlook
Express to sign mails and news, could anyone tell me how to do it?
Any suggestions is appreciated.

Thank you. I'm using GPGshell now :)
A newbie question: how to better use GPGshell in OE? Because I found
it's a little hard for me to understand how to sign/encrypt a mail
after I composed it.
The way I do right now is, "save as" the mail first, go to the windows
explorer to sign/encrypt the mail, drag the result .gpg/.asc file back
to the OE and send it.
So..is there any GPG plug-in for OE exists can do all these jobs
along..without switch between OE and other applications?
Thanks a lot.

Thanks Laurent, John and thank you all!

Hi list,
My question sound dumb, but I've notice that anyone have the right
access my computer can use command "gpg --export-secret-keys username"
to export private keys, without need to enter passphrase. This is very
dangerous to a multi-user computer.
How to better protect private keys of GPG users?

Hash: SHA1
Hi list,
I want hash some strings by using GnuPG, I know GPG have hash
function, but I can't find how to do it in the manuals or other
documentations on the official website. What's parameters used by GPG
for hash?
Furthermore, I would like use sha-512 hash strings from standard
input, rather than from files, is it possible? If not, is there any
other app can do this for me?
Thanks and best regards.

Hash: SHA1
Thank you for your reply, it works. But hash results that I got from
GPG is different from some web based hash calculator, such as,
 or
e.g. for "AAA",
web based SHA1 result is:
, and SHA512 result is:
but GPG's result is:
1AE0 9EE3 43FA 9C61 8DE7  C5C1 770E F4E4 90B2 4ADA
1CD99029 6017D85F 8B909505 21AE360D C8D907C3 A09B14AB 5B273F85

0D966F54 25036FDB
Due to I have try more than one web-based cryptographic hash
calculator. I don't think online results are wrong. All of them
generates the same results except GPG.
Did I miss something? Or it's a issue of my GPG installation?
Best regards.

O...I see.
I've get the correct hash on Linux..., thank you all! :-)
The problem remains now is how to get the same hashing on Windows,
because echo on windows does not have -n flag:
     > echo -n AAA
     -n AAA
so, on windows "echo -n AAA | gpg --print-md sha1" is actually hashing
"-n AAA\n" but not "AAA"...   :-\
Is there a easy way to get rid of the newline on windows system?
Best regards.

@_subject: Can't run GPG --recv-keys under Windows Vista. 
I've installed gpg on Windows Vista recently, but seems not all the
functions work well when I try to receive keys from keyserver. Here is
the command I typed:
       gpg --keyserver subkeys.pgp.net --recv-keys xxxxxxxx
After hit RETURN, I got errors immediately like this:
       gpgkeys: hkp fetch error 1: unsupported protocol
The same command works well on Windows XP.
I've checked the environment variables %PATH%, and gpg's directory is in it.
Any ideas?

@_subject: Why the "--export-secret-key" switch is not listed in help screen? 
I've notice the switch "--export-secret-key" is not listed in the help
screen (i.e. gpg --help) and I spend a lot of time to find it. It
seems to be one of the most used switch for backup private keys and
sync keys between machines. Could the developer add this switch to the
help screen? It would save users a lot of time.
