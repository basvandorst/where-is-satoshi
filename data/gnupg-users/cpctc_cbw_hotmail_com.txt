@_subject: Using only one public key; no way to sign it 
I want to use gpg with only a single public key.  I know the key is correct
and trusted and not compromised, but I can't find a way to tell gpg to trust
the key.
I don't have a private key to sign the public key with, and I don't think I
should need one.
I've found some relevent posts:
but nothing since then that's applicable.
Basically, I want to do the following, starting from a fresh installation of
gpg --import mypubkey.pgp
gpg --encrypt --recip "mypub" hello.txt
.. without any user prompts.  The closest I've come is:
[c:\temp\gpg]gpg --encrypt --recip "mypub" --armor --quiet --batch --yes
gpg: abcd1234: no info to calculate a trust probability
gpg: no valid addressees
gpg: hello.txt: encryption failed: no such user id
If I take out the "--batch", I get a prompt:
Could not find a valid trust path to the key.  Let's see whether we
can assign some missing owner trust values.
No path leading to one of our keys found.
It is NOT certain that the key belongs to its owner.
If you *really* know what you are doing, you may answer
the next question with yes
Use this key anyway?
I tried "--trusted-key", but it said:
gpg: key abcd1234: no public key for trusted key - skipped
so I don't understand what it's good for.
I'd like the "--strong-yes" or a "--force-trust-key", or a workaround that
does not require any console input... commands that can all be run
with --no-tty.

A few responses suggested the "--always-trust" option; this worked.  Thank
you for your help.
Some responses also suggested the "--trusted-key" option; this sounds better
as it's targeted directly at one particular key, but it didn't work; I'll
make a new post detailing those problems.

@_subject: --trusted-key not cooperating/what's a "long key ID" 
Supposing gpg --list-keys gives me:
pub  1024D/aaaaaaaa 2001-11-30 myname myaddr
sub  2048g/bbbbbbbb 2001-11-30
My secret keyring is empty; all I want to use this installation of gpg for
is to encrypt to the public key above.
If I do the command:
gpg --output testenc.enc --recip "myname" --encrypt testfile.txt
I get the big warning about an untrusted key.  I can overcome that by using
"--always-trust", but I want to use --trusted-key to explicitly bypass the
message only for this one key.
So I tried the command:
gpg --output testenc.enc --recip "myname" --trusted-key
"0xaaaaaaaabbbbbbbb" --encrypt testfile.txt
gpg: key BBBBBBBB: no public key for trusted key - skipped
-same warning as before-
gpg --output testenc.enc --recip "myname" --trusted-key
"0xbbbbbbbbaaaaaaaa" --encrypt testfile.txt
gpg: key AAAAAAAA: no public key for trusted key - skipped
-same warning as before-
So, my questions:
- what does "--trusted-key" want from me?
- what's a "long key id"?
- what am I doing wrong?
Thanks again...
