@_subject: GPG Passphrase Caching 
I am using the binary version of GPG for Windows, version 1.47.  Everything works fine, but I have a need to automatically decrypt  files through a script. The hangup that I have right now is that GPG  wants me to enter in my passphrase when decrypting files. Is there a  way to cache the passphrase or save it in a file so that it does not  prompt me to enter my passphrase for my secret key?

@_subject: GPG Output Files 
I am using the binary version of GPG for Windows, version 1.47.  Everything works fine, but I have a need to automatically decrypt  files through a script. The hangup that I have right now is that I  need to decrypt multiple files and send the output to a file and NOT  . I know I can use the --output  command, but I  don't want to specify a static file for this script because there are  multiple files. I would also like to just retain the original filename  after decryption. I have looked through the man pages for this and  just can't see an option for this scenario. Has anyone encountered a  situation like this?
