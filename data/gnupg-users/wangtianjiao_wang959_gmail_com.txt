@_subject: Huawei manual about Gnupg 
Hello, everybody as the Gnupg user
I download the Huawei manual about Gnupg from
The English version is the OpenPGP_Signature_Verification_Guide.pdf
Could you please take a look at it and make some suggestions to
Huawei to improve it. Thank you!

@_subject: Is there an easy way to create an Android application? 
There is an old project for porting GnuPG to Android, by the Guardian
Project, but is no longer maintained. The old website is in
 , But this project recommends
an Android APP called OpenKeychain. It is an OpenPGP implementation
for Android. It is hosted at
 .  It is open source in
the license of GPLv3.
If you would like to develop an application based on OpenKeychain, you
have to open source in GPLv3, too.

@_subject: How to change the protect cipher algorithm and the digest 
Hello Gao,
Your question could be stated more clearly as in this bug report:
1. The solution is also in this report. Just install gpg version
2.0.x, which prior to version 2.1, then run the following command to
generate the key:
Then export, using the s2k options in case they're needed here instead:
Then you can see the algo changed to AES256 and digest changed to SHA512.
2. To modify the existing key, you still have to install gpg version
2.0.x first, which prior to version 2.1, then add the following
options into your gpg.conf:
Then reset the passphrase of the private key, using the above
settings, then export the private key to file. Here is the output of
command of --list-packets :
This idea comes from the links:
,  3. There is a small tool along with the command of --list-packets,
called pgpdump which is available at
 , to provide more details of
the private key file.
Best regards

@_subject: GPG Encryption/Decryption Failing 
Hello Sirisha,
I read from Mozilla's official documentation which states that SOPS
command-line client is preferred, the SOPS library should be used only
for decryption.
The link is here: My two cents.
