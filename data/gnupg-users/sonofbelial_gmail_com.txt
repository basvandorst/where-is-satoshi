Hi folks,
I wonder if any of you can help with this problem
on Enigmail? I'd appreciate it and promise I'll post any solutions into
that forum thread!
Many thanks in advance,

Thanks to you and Robert for getting back to me. However this
unfortunately didn't solve the problem. I ran:
chown alastair:alastair ~/.gnupg/
chown alastair:alastair ~/.gnupg/*
Then I tried root:alastair and alastair:root but still no go.
Any other ideas? In the meantime, I'll try and chown each file in
~/.gnupg individually and see if that changes anything.
Incidentally, when I chown'ed everything in the folder, gnupg gave a
warning when I ran it in the terminal:
WARNING: unsafe ownership on configuration file
Thanks in advance for helping me solve this.

As per Werner's email below, please find the issue pasted out below:
I'm using Seamonkey on Lubuntu 11.10.
Basically, any time I try to decrypt an email from Enigmail (Seamonkey
2.4.1/Enigmail 1.3.3/GnuPG 1.4.11) I get the following error:
Error - secret key needed to decrypt message; click on 'Details'
button for more information
So I do this and get:
OpenPGP Security Info
Error - secret key needed to decrypt message
gpg command line and output:
gpg: failed to create temporary file
`/home/alastair/.gnupg/. Permission denied
gpg: keyblock resource `/home/alastair/.gnupg/secring.gpg': general error
gpg: failed to create temporary file
`/home/alastair/.gnupg/. Permission denied
gpg: keyblock resource `/home/alastair/.gnupg/pubring.gpg': general error
gpg: encrypted with RSA key, ID 2260F69E
gpg: encrypted with RSA key, ID B25CD7DF
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
The output of:
ls -dl ~/.gnupg/*
# ls -dl ~/.gnupg/*

# ls -dl ~/.gnupg/
drw------- 2 root root 4096 2012-03-06 19:59 /home/alastair/.gnupg/
I have also tried:
# chown alastair:alastair ~/.gnupg
# chown alastair:alastair ~/.gnupg/*
# chmod 700 ~/.gnupg/*
None of those have worked.
Enigmail debug tells me that things are working properly... Can anyone
Oh, I'm running a torified system using Tor and Polipo. I'm not sure
if that is significant - I doubt it.
Anyway, I'd really appreciate some help, it's a big problem for me!
Many thanks in advance or your attention,
P.S. I know this is signed just fine - I'm on another PC ;)

I fixed the issue with a little help from one of the IT gurus at work.
I ran the following:
sudo chmod -R 700 ~/
sudo chown -R alastair:alastair ~/
This fixed the issue although now any command I run from gpg spits out
the following complaint before executing:
gpg: WARNING: unsafe ownership on configuration file
Maybe not ideal however but given that everything else seems to work
and my system is pretty darned secure as it is I'm not overly worried.
Many thanks!
