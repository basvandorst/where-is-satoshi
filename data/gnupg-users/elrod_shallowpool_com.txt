@_subject: ELG-E key requires IDEA cipher? 
I have an ELG-E key which refuses to work completely with gpg. I can encrypt to it but when I try to unencrypt the data I get the following:
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
gpg: please see  for more information
gpg: protection algorithm 1 (IDEA) is not supported
gpg: the IDEA cipher plugin is not present
gpg: please see  for more information
gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit ELG-E key, ID 46748B13, created 1997-06-04
      "Mark B. Elrod "
gpg: public key decryption failed: unknown cipher algorithm
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
I created this key a while back (probably with PGP 5) and would like to still use it. My understanding is that EG/DSA keys did not use IDEA. If this is the case then why am I getting this error? When I list the info on this key here is what I get:
pub  1024D/40C97C30  created: 1997-06-04 expires: never      trust: u/u
sub  2048g/46748B13  created: 1997-06-04 expires: never    Anyone have any thoughts?

Ahhh... That was the ticket. After changing my passphrase I no longer get the IDEA warning on my machine without IDEA. Thanks!
