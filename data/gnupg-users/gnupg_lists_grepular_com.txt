If I try to run any admin commands like "passwd" after doing a gpg
--card-edit, I get the same sort of error, eg:
gpg: verify CHV2 failed: general error
The only thing that I can think I've changed is that I added an

and signing subkeys. I'm sure it worked for at least a little while
after that though...

@_subject: pka-lookups and dnssec 
Can anyone explain to me the purpose of "--verify-options pka-lookups" ?
I have successfully used "--auto-key-locate pka" when encrypting
messages, but I can't see how to use "pka-lookups".
I assumed it would automatically lookup/download the key in order to do
verification, but if you don't have the key already, it doesn't know the
UID associated with the key used to sign and therefore can't do the PKA
lookup... Is there some additional command line option that I should be
using to specify the email address from the UID when verifying this way?
Or have I completely misunderstood something?
Also. Would it be useful to add a feature to GnuPG so it displays the
fact that a PKA record it retrieved was DNSSEC signed, when true? Just
for informational purposes. It strikes me as useful information to have...
Here is my DNSSEC signed PKA record that I've been experimenting with:
mike at server:~$ dig +short txt mike.cardwell._pka.grepular.com

@_subject: pka-lookups and dnssec 
I tried signing something like this: (minus ".NOSPAM")
gpg --sig-notation
"pka-address at gnupg.org=mike.cardwell.NOSPAM at grepular.com" --clearsign
I then tried verifying the output from the above command, by piping it
into this, using a gpg homedir that didn't contain my key:
gpg --verify-options pka-lookups --verify
The result:
gpg: Signature made Mon 05 Dec 2011 14:25:17 GMT using RSA key ID C1D1E704
gpg: Can't check signature: No public key
Where have I gone wrong?
Yes, it displays that the key was retrieved using PKA. It doesn't
however state that the PKA record was DNSSEC signed. Knowing that the
fingerprint retrieved from the DNS was signed with DNSSEC is worthy of
being announced IMHO...

If I have more than one signing subkey in my keypair, is there a way of
advertising the purpose of each subkey with the public key that people
download? Eg:
This subkey is for signing email only
This subkey is for signing sourcecode only
I've considered generating an entirely separate keypair and then
cross-signing them, but that seems inelegant.

I understand that once you've uploaded something to the keyservers, it
can't be removed. Eg, if I sign someone elses key and upload that, it
will be attached to their key permanently?
What if someone were to generate say, 10,000 keypairs with "offensive"
uid names, and then sign my key with each of them, and then upload that
to the keyservers? Is there anything to stop that? Is there anything to
stop a spammer generating a key with their URL in the uid name and then
signing every key they can find and uploading that to the keyservers?
Has anything like this happened before?

@_author: gnupg@lists.grepular.com 
@_subject: keyserver spam 
You could still successfully mess with someone by signing their key with
offensive or spammy content ten times a day.
I find it strange that the keyservers don't do any sort of email
validation before accepting key submissions and that they just allow
anyone to upload signatures for your key without verifying if you want
to allow them first.
This sort of problem just seems inevitable to me.

The system can be easily abused, therefore it will be abused. It's just
a matter of time. How much time, depends on if/when PGP becomes more
popular. It doesn't strike me as unreasonable to want to put defences in
place before an attack begins.

@_date: 2011-12-17 13:54:00
@_author: gnupg@lists.grepular.com 
@_subject: keyserver spam 
For the first issue regarding uploading keys, you wouldn't be able to do
email validation on a key that doesn't have an email address in the UID.
At the same time, for those keys, you wouldn't need to, as no email
spoofing has taken place, so that's not an issue...
For the second issue regarding uploading signatures. Email in the UID
isn't required. You just need to differentiate between signatures that
the owner of the key has allowed, and signatures that they haven't. The
owner of the key can prove that they are the owner of the key and accept
the signature using normal public key crypto. An email in the UID of the
key owner would be useful so you can contact them to let them know that
somebody has uploaded a signature. Not required though.
Nothing. The subject at hand is problems with the keyservers. Any other
distribution mechanism is irrelevant.

So you agree that there is a point where putting security measures in
place is a good idea. Where you disagree with me, is you think it is
unlikely that the keyservers will be abused in this manner in the near
I guess neither of us can see into the future, but the prevalence of
this sort of abuse on the Internet, always places me on the side of caution.
It would only take one troll.

@_subject: How secure are smartcards? 
I just ordered an OpenPGP smartcard from Kernel Concepts as per
Does anyone else have one of these?
At the moment, my secret key is stored on my hard drive and is encrypted
by a long passphrase. When I transfer my subkeys to the smartcard, will
they actually be encrypted whilst they're on there?
I understand that you have to enter a PIN between 6 and 32 characters in
length in order to perform crypto operations on the card via the
smartcard interface, but I'm just wondering if somebody with sufficient
skills could read the data off the smartcard chipset by looking directly
at the circuitry?
Are the keys on the smartcard perhaps encrypted with the access PIN?
That still wouldn't be perfect, definitely easier to bruteforce than a
long passphrase, but it would be better than nothing...

@_date: 2011-07-25 11:21:31
@_author: Mike Cardwell 
@_subject: How secure are smartcards? 
Yes, I agree that smartcards have several advantages. The major one
being that if your laptop is compromised by a trojan or something, even
if it has a keylogger installed, your keys can't be stolen.
However, it is important to note that if you have a rich/powerful
adversary, and the key isn't encrypted on the smart card. Then they can
just "read" it off, if they get hold of it. In that circumstance, you
*might* actually be more secure leaving the key on your laptop encrypted
with a strong pass phrase. It's a judgement call.
When I say a rich/powerful adversary, this could include industrial
espionage as well as governments.
Ideally the key would be encrypted on the smartcard. I haven't found
anything specifying that this is the case, so I have to assume it's not.

@_date: 2011-07-25 18:18:29
@_author: Mike Cardwell 
@_subject: How secure are smartcards? 
That is reassuring. Although, I'd be happier if I could find a technical
description of the feasibility of such an attack. But if one doesn't
exist, it doesn't exist.

@_date: 2011-07-29 09:30:20
@_author: Mike Cardwell 
@_subject: How secure are smartcards? 
This is where my confidence fades a little. If the key is on my laptop,
as long as my laptop hasn't been compromised, the key is secured by
math. If it's on a smartcard, I have to trust that when people tell me
it's prohibitively expensive, that they are right and up to date, and
then I also have to trust that my adversary doesn't have the
money/inclination to do it. I'd *expect* lots of organisations to have
worked on processes to quickly and "cheaply" pull PGP keys off various
brands of smart card, just in case they need to. And I'd expect many of
them to not publish their results.
There is another attack vector here. If someone observes me entering my
pin, they can obtain my smart card at a later date and use it to decrypt
my files. I am thinking of hard coding *part* of my pin into gpg on my
primary system, so I can only be observed typing in part of the pin.
Every little helps.

@_date: 2011-07-29 09:38:29
@_author: gnupg@lists.grepular.com 
@_subject: How secure are smartcards? 
The point of these smartcards is that once you write a key to them, it
can't be read off. When you want to decrypt or sign some data, GPG sends
the data to the smartcard, which does the cryptographic operations it's
self, on the card, and then sends the result back. So even if your
machine becomes infected by a trojan and has a keylogger installed, the
attacker *still* can't get your key.
The problem is, even though you can't read the key off using the
smartcard interface, if you have the correct machinery, you can
potentially physically read the key directly off the chipset.
My suggestion is that it would be better if the key is encrypted whilst
it sits on the card, using the pin that is needed to talk to it. Then
even a physical attack would be impossible (assuming a long/secure pin).

@_subject: STEED - Usable end-to-end encryption 
I think there are two major technical problems which would make things a
lot easier if they were solved.
1.) A system of mapping email addresses to public keys
2.) A system of distributing private keys between all of a users email
clients automatically.
These can be tackled independently.
For  I'd like to see an IMAP extension where the client can upload and
download password protected private keys. The security of the keys would
rely on a strong passphrase (different from the IMAP passphrase
obviously) but it would solve the problem of copying the keys between
clients/backing them up. It would also mean that the clients can handle
the key generation/management without the user even knowing it is happening.
For  I'd like to see two options. First of all, the DNS solution
described in the STEED proposal. Secondly, as a backup, if the DNS
record doesn't exist, and somebody emails me with a header containing a
link (*) to their key and its fingerprint, or even just the key it's
self, I'd like to automatically use that. Initially major email
providers like GMail/Hotmail wouldn't implement the DNS solution, but
that wouldn't stop people using GMail/Hotmail with supporting IMAP
clients from automatically looking up keys and encrypting.
I can imagine these two solutions being implemented natively in Dovecot,
Courier IMAP, Evolution and Thunderbird if the right people can be
convinced. Maybe a few other widely used open source IMAP servers and
MUAs. At that point, getting noticed by Microsoft/Google/Yahoo should be
Web browsers would need to be upgraded to make functions available for
webmail providers. I'd imagine this coming later once average users are
using encrypted email without even realising. Each new implementation
would simply lead to more and more encrypted email. We don't need an all
or nothing approach.
We might even end up with MSAs that accept mail from clients without
encryption support, then look up the recipients public key, and encrypt
it before passing it on.
(*) there's a nasty privacy issue when you're able to trigger a
receiving email client to do arbitrary http lookups. It means the sender
is able to determine when the recipient downloaded the email, and what
IP address they were using at the time. Perhaps MTAs could look up the
public key on delivery and add it to the email headers.
If somebody pulls this off, the spam fighting industry is going to have
a lot of fun. It becomes a lot more difficult to identify spammy content
if you can't read it. I guess all of that filtering tech (bayes/uribl
lookups etc) would end up having to be pushed to the client. Those are
problems to be solved by other people though.

@_subject: OpenPGP smartcard, how vulnerable is it? 
Hash: SHA512
Obviously, if malware is in control of your machine, one of the many
things it can do is talk to the smart card reader. It can't force you
to enter your card though, and it can't read the keys from the card
when it's inserted, and if you're using a hardware pin pad, it can't
intercept your pin either. It can attempt to initiate
decryption/signing, but it still requires the user to enter their pin,
so some sort of social engineering is also required. It could wait for
you to try to decrypt/sign something, and then send some alternative
data to sign/decrypt to the reader instead, but at least the user
would see that something went wrong, and that would only work for one
sign/decrypt operation.
So using a smartcard prevents an attacker from getting access to your
keys, and severely limits the amount of decryption/signing they can do
even if they completely own your machine. However, if they completely
own your machine, you're probably screwed anyway.
On the other hand, this is not what was originally asked. The question
is, can an attacker with physical access to the card, either use it,
or read the keys off it. And the answer is: With a lot of money, probably.
Personally, I think that remote attacks against my system are many
orders of magnitude more likely than physical attacks where an entity
with lots of money steals my card and reads the keys off it. So I'm
happy to put my keys on a smart card.

And if somebody uses the same key to sign mail repeatedly it builds a

using a fake key, but that person can't successfully claim to be the
same person who signed all the other mail. Not if the person who

I've posted using the same key on probably a dozen mailing lists, I

Figured out my problem. SSH_AUTH_KEY environment variable was being
overwritten. On Ubuntu I went to:
System -> Preferences -> Startup Applications
Found "SSH Key Agent" which runs the command
"/usr/bin/gnome-keyring-daemon --start --components=ssh" and then
disabled it. Logged out and back in again, and SSH_AUTH_KEY was set
correctly, and "ssh-add -L" started to show my authentication key on the
smartcard. ssh works fine now.

@_subject: Using root CAs as a trusted 3rd party 
I've taken a different approach. Rather than trying to build up a WOT by
getting people to sign my key, I've just made sure that the fingerprint
of my master key is spread wide and far over the Internet, and that I
sign everything.
The front page of my website  is signed. It
displays my fingerprint, and a Google link next to it:
You can see my fingerprint mentioned all over the place. I also sign all
of my profiles on different sites whenever possible. A couple of examples:
My fingerprint is also stored in a PKA record in the DNS:
mike at Fuzzbutt:~$ dig +short txt mike.cardwell._pka.grepular.com
mike at Fuzzbutt:~$
And the DNS for grepular.com even uses DNSSEC. I don't think you need to
meet me in person to be confident that the key you've downloaded is mine.
I sometimes wonder if the traditional public web of trust is even a good
idea. Are you happy to be associated with everybody you've signed the
key of and those who have signed yours? Are you sure that none of these
people will do anything in the future which might cause these public
associations to become a problem for you?

I've got myself an SPR-532 smart card reader. It's working fine on my
Ubuntu laptop with my OpenPGP card. It makes very noisy beeping sound
effects when using the pinpad though. I was planning on using it in an
office environment, but the noise would draw unwanted attention and
annoy people...
I haven't been able to find any information on disabling the sound
effects it produces. Maybe that's simply not possible. Would it be
possible to use this reader and enter the pin in software, using
pinentry, instead of the hardware pinpad? The pinpad part of the reader
was a bonus, but it's not essential for my purposes...

@_subject: FAQ, take two 
Hash: SHA1
FWIW, until I read somebody complaining about people uploading key
signatures, instead of sending them to the key owner, it never
occurred to me that it could possibly be a problem for anyone. My
immediate thought on reading it for the first time was that if it's a
bad thing, then the keyservers should prevent it. Even if it was
obviously a bad thing, people would still do it. So if it's completely
morally ambiguous, and possible, it's going to happen. No amount of
documentation or education will change that.
I mean, technically it should be easy for the keyservers to email the
owner of a key to ask if a signature should be accepted. Or to refuse
uploaded signatures unless they are themselves signed by the owner of
the key. If it really is a problem, then it can be fixed with code.
Doesn't matter what the FAQ says in this regard. It will continue to
happen unless the key servers actively prevent it.

It's a complete ball-ache. I've done this myself on my front page

different things in the clipboard when you select text and copy it.
They usually mess with white-space and line endings. I originally used
 myself for that page, but ended up using a  and lots of instead to make it play nicely with more browsers. To stop the
white-space collapsing in on it's self, for alignment, I replaced
every other consecutive space with a unicode no-break space character
instead. That might not be obvious to you if you just do a "view
source". Also, to make things difficult that page is "compressed". Sorry.
I don't have any hard and fast rules to make this work, but I've
messed with it long enough to have a feeling for what to do when
something doesn't.

pushed them back to the main repo. Details here:

Hash: SHA512
If you use GnuPG on a VPS, your provider *can* gain full access to your
decrypted private key; the host has full access to the disk and RAM of the
VM. However, just because they can, doesn't mean they will. Only you can
decide how likely this is, and whether or not it's an acceptable risk,
based on exactly what you're doing.
Also, it is potentially possible for someone with access to a different
VM on the same host to be able to gain access to your decrypted keys when
they're in use, via a side channel attack.
This is definitely a good idea.

@_subject: PGP/GPG does not work easily with web-mail. 
Roundcube plus the PGP plugin:
The way it works is pretty cool. You paste your private PGP key into
a form, and it doesn't get submitted to the server, it just gets stored
in the browsers localstorage using JavaScript. So all PGP operations
are done locally in the browser, rather than sending the key off to the
server to do it server side. It's based on openpgp.js, which is basically
a free javascript library for doing OpenPGP:
The only problem is (and it's a big one), you have to trust the
JavaScript that the server sends. The server could always send some
evil JavaScript to you which reads the key from the browser storage
and then sends it back to the server or elsewhere. Also, if there are
any XSS flaws, there's another potential way of losing the key.

And when those students finish University and get jobs, do they use
Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat at work, or do they use Email at work?
The fact that alternative communication methods exist that are more
suitable for certain types of conversations between certain people,
isn't that interesting. Email does not need to be used for even the
majority of online communication in order for it to be successfull.
I don't find, "kids don't use email for casual conversations" to be a very
convincing argument that email is on its way out. In 20 years, Facebook
will be a footnote on wikipedia, but people will still be using Email,
in some form or other.
There will always be a system for pushing messages around electronically
that isn't tied to a single provider. If email is replaced, it will be
by something similar to email. Not by whichever social network the kids
are currently using.

I'm pretty confident that for every firm using sharepoint as their primary
means of communication, there are hundreds if not thousands using email
instead. And each of those Fortune 500 firms are almost certainly also
using email too. Email isn't just a communication mechanism, it's also the
basis of your online identity.
That's not what I'm seeing at all. I see people using instant chat protocols
for instant chat, and I see people using Email when it is appropriate for
them to use Email.
The future has spoken. Kids know about email. They know what it's for.
They use it when it's appropriate to use it. They use it more the older
they get. the World is only becoming more and more reliant on it as time
goes on. I am 100% confident that the future very firmly has Email, or
something very similar in it.
Gopher was replaced by a similar but better protocol (HTTP). I would be
happy to see Email replaced by a similar but better protocol. It will
probably still be called Email though. I think it's more likely that
various Email protocols will be extended and refined rather than an
outright replacement though.
