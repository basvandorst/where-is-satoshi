*You* accusing *me* of not having real arguments is just precious. :-)
At last, we can agree on something.

work within closely knit groups of people where contributions are
limited to a select few who genuinely know what they are writing about.
I do not want amateurs, be it well-meaning or malicious, write about
security related subjects in a Wiki, because that might (in the eyes of
casual visitors and search-engines) cause their scribblings to be
confused with facts. The amount of BS that can be found on Wikipedia is
case in point.
A Wiki about encryption with write access limited to people who
demonstrably understand the math sounds like a good thing to me, but a
"Community Wiki" does not. Community usually (and sadly) means too many
loud-mouthed, attention-seeking bozos.

I try not to rely on Wikipedia, in particular when searching for
sensitive subjects. Besides, if that was unclear, I mentioned Wikipedia
as a general example of the good concept of a Wiki colliding with
humanity, not for any particular subject matter. Too many cooks, and
some without training or taste buds.
Used to be that compiling an encyclopedia took a huge number of
competent researchers and authors. No wonder the things were so damn

Whining about a design detail of free software? Get a grip.

Are there now? GnuPG is software that has evolved since its introduction
in 1997. Can you show me any meaningful software of yours that has been
evolving over 23 years and has what you consider "good design"? It
should be interesting.
Ha, now you're trying to teach your grandma to suck eggs. ;-) Besides,
quoting ESR is a somewhat risky business. He said and wrote a lot over
the decades, much of which I consider nonsense.
What insight do you have in the design and development of GnuPG; in its
goals and restrictions? There is a difference between you not liking
something for a personal reason, and objectively "bad design". You are
entitled to your opinion of course, but unless you can demonstrate the
skills to come up with a better design for free software that offers the
same functionality as GnuPG, that opinion does not mean so much.

Universal principles, oh my. In other words, you don't know nearly
enough about the finer points of GnuPG design goals, don't know much
about the challenges of evolutionary software design, and thus don't
know too well what you are talking about, universally speaking.
Show us a body of your work which proves you have the necessary skills
to critique the GnuPG authors' work. Until you do, your "judgment" is
Unrelated nonsense. Was that really the best you could come up with?

What "idea" would that be, exactly?
I am not attacking you. Read what I wrote in this thread. I just doubt
that you have enough knowledge about the motivation behind and the inner
workings of GnuPG to offer your "critique" (which I consider personal
dislike for certain behaviour) until you convince me otherwise.
Based on what you wrote so far, you are just some random person behind a
pseudonym. What are your credentials in this field? What qualification
do you have that would enable you to call the work of other people "bad
design" with actual justification? Have you designed and maintained
software on the scale of GnuPG, for decades, with a worldwide user base,
dealing with security, usability and compatibility issues, having to
find some compromise between the various aspects?
You can either tell people why your opinion should matter, or live with
being called out for not doing so.
