@_subject: adduid questions 
I'm new to GnuPG and trying to setup my private/public key.
I have 2 email addresses that I would like to add to the key. I used 'gpg --gen-key' to generate the first uid and that works fine. I then used 'gpg --edit-key' and 'adduid' to add a 2nd email address to the key. This also completed just fine.
However, the problem is that I can't figure out how to select which email address to sign/encrypt outgoing email.
In some cases I want to sign/encrypt with my work key and in others using my home key.
How do I do this or am I just totally off base?
