@_subject: Can't compile gnupg-1.0.2 on SOlaris 2.7 
when I try to compile gnupg-1.0.2 on a Sun Sparc 5 running Solaris 2.7,
make will stop when processing the Makefile in the directory "po" with the
error message: "Fatal error in reader: Makefile, line 125: Macro
assignment on dependency line".
I have installed the gcc 2.95 on my solaris machine. I think, I need the
gnu make, is this right? Isn't the gnu make installed with the gcc
