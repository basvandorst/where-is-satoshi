gpg uses only(?) 40 chars for the fingerprint.
(I mean the output of: gpg --fingerprint --keyid-format long.)
How difficult, i.e. how much computing power and time is required to
create a key, which matches the very same fingerprint?
Isn't 40 chars a bit weak?
Are there plans to provide a longer fingerprint which in theory can't be
broken with computing power expected in for example 100(0) years?

@_subject: please give us safer defaults for gnupg 
Hash: SHA512
[This was originally planed as an open letter, but I thought it might
be better to hear your arguments beforehand.]
We think gnupg still is the most used and most important encryption tool
in the Free Software community. [1] But there is a big problem with
gnupg's default config values. As an analogy, it is a somewhat usable
racing car but it unfortunately comes with a limiter and you need to
find out how to get rid of the limiter first. As a result many users
mess up and use only the limited secure version. gnupg comes with poor
defaults and since it is of that much importance, that is a problem.
We even have a recommended gpg.conf in torbird's git repo. [2] [3] The
fact that we even need such a thing is bad.
For example cert-digest-algo why is it in gpg still sha1 and not sha256
or sha512? Now that a few people know, that short key ids can be easily
forged [4], why isn't the keyid-format set to 0xlong by default?
Update: now that long key ids can also be forged [8], why not show the
full fingerprint by default? And why does gpg still create 2048 bit
keys, if creating 4096 keys just takes a few seconds longer and
virtually make no difference when using these keys?
For the sake of argument, let's take it for granted, that 2048 bit is
still secure enough and can not be broken with brute force. That doesn't
take into account, that we now know, thanks to Eduard Snowden, that the
NSA infinitively stores encrypted data until they develop methods to
decrypt it. [5] Other organizations probably do that as well in case
someone wants to make an argument "you can trust the NSA". Also that
doesn't take into account, that the NSA is building a giant new center
in Utah spending billions just for decrypting such messages (also
verifiable in mainstream press [6]). Let's imagine, someone finds a
vulnerability in RSA being able to reduce the difficulty for brute force
by 1024 bit. In that case, we're much better off with a 4096 bit default
rather than with a 2048 bit default. Having the advantages of such a
change at hand (many) and comparing them with the cons (almost none),
we think it's irrational not to crank up the default value to 4096 bit.
Maybe let's add another weak argument to the mix. Part of using
encryption software is reducing anxiety. Even if using 4096 bit instead
of 2048 bit does little more than reducing anxiety, we'd argue, that
reducing anxiety is a one of the tasks of encryption software. It also
lets us focus on discussing more important things than this dull 2048 vs
4096 bit discussion. Those teaching others how to use gpg [at crypto
parties etc.], won't have to understand why 2048 bit is the default, why
some recommend to use 4096 bit or keep defending 2048 bit etc.
Well, perhaps we understand little about interoperability and ignored
that argument against cranking up the defaults. This is what we think
about that...
We do not care about closed source PGP compatible software, namely,
well... Good question, it's difficult finding alternative
OpenPGP compatible software at all. Probably there is only one product
not based on gnupg, namely "Symantec Encryption
Desktop". As long it was still called PGP Corp. and Philip Zimmermann
was in charge, there was probably no backdoor. Now, that Symantec is in
charge, a US company, and looking at the recent news... Quote guardian:
"Through these covert partnerships, the agencies have inserted secret
vulnerabilities ? known as backdoors or trapdoors ? into commercial
encryption software" [7]. We don't see why, the Free Software community,
should care about Symantec's OpenPGP.
We are suggesting to just crank up the defaults - now. Maybe gpg should
add a --compatible switch, where it uses weak default to be as
inter-operable as possible. Oh, gpg already has switches such as --pgp6.
Even better. We're all for Free Software / Open Source. Writing
specification is even better. However, the specification process should
be a bonus and not needlessly block improvements in security for years
while we urgently need it. Alternative implementations (probably only
Symantec) should be free to cope up. They can be even given a
notification and few months to update their clients to the latest
developments. But the pure existence of those shouldn't prevent us for
years from getting secure defaults with no hope of improvement in sight.
An argument against interoperability is, that using cranked up defaults
creates few support requests. TorBirdy, Tails and Whonix are cranking up
the gpg defaults. How many support requests of the type "recipient can't
decrypt/verify my messages, because using an alternative OpenPGP
implementation" do we have? Can't remember having this seen anywhere ever.
We, the singers of this letter, are not all necessarily experts in
cryptography or as knowledgeable about gnupg as the authors are. We give
you the benefit of the doubt. It could very well be the case, that our
hypotheses are totally wrong and that in fact defaults such as SHA1 and
2048 bit are totally fine for now and for ever. If that is case and/or
if the interoperability argument is your standpoint, please remind the
emotional argument of reducing anxiety. In that case, also consider
cranking up the defaults just because security isn't worsened but due to
popular request should enough people sign this letter.
Rather please consider cranking up the defaults just for the sake of
allowing (eventually in your view) paranoid and/or wrong people to
reduce complexity of instructions. [7] That alone would probably help
with a greater adaptation of gnupg. There would also be less room for
conspiracy theories, why gpg is still using SHA1 and 2048 bit by default.
We, the singers of this letter, are very thankful for everyone having
contributed to gnupg and greatly respect them. Please take our positive
criticism and crank up gpg's defaults, so people can make their
instructions simpler (example [7]). The more there is to explain [7],
the more difficult it becomes, and the more likely it becomes to mess up.
All the best,
[1] That is hopefully beyond questioning. For example gnupg is used by
major Linux distributions for package download verification, for the
trust chain between developers and used by man Free Software developers
to sign their releases.
[2] [3] [4] [5] Quote EFF "[...] More appallingly, the NSA is allowed to hold onto
communications solely because you use encryption.  Whether the
communication is domestic or foreign, the NSA will hang on to the
encrypted message forever, or at least until it is decrypted.  And then
at least five more years. [...]" from

Understandable. At the moment it's just one person sharing that opinion.
[Didn't ask many more yet.] I asked if I am allowed to tell names,
probably yes, soon.
We don't use OpenSSL to encrypt our mails. I'd suppose, OpenSSL is
mostly used by users not being aware of it. While OpenSSL is probably
great, the CA implementation is not. And that's another story. I'd
always trust gnupg more than OpenSSL, but that's mostly for usability
reasons and because no contacts I know are waiting for OpenSSL encrypted
I agree, it's not a good analogy. I'll try harder next time. However, I
trust you got my point.
When I searched for this on search engines, I haven't found one in a
project's character. (I.e. were it's open for debate/pull requests/changes.)
That's the point. I argue, that "we" [hopefully soon telling you the
other name and if not, other supporters sharing my standpoint]
prioritize working solutions which are as secure as possible rather than
waiting for some RFC to finish.
[Let's forget about the we until I maybe finished the letter after
clearing up some points.]
I'd also suppose [okay, I am risking false consensus here] that users of
other messengers with security in mind, such as bitmessage, pond,
retroshare, OTR [and probably others I am not aware of or have
forgotten] have a similar view on this.
This is very unfortunate.
In my opinion, training users to get accustomed to insecure things and
then expecting them to do the right thing when necessary seems likely to
result in many users doing the wrong thing.
Too short for me. I don't want anyone to dig up what I did 30 years ago.
Stuff that hasn't been deliberately stored in meanwhile should be forgotten.
I certainly know too little about mobile/emended devices to be sure it
really doesn't matter for them. But where should be the border? You're
not supporting MS-DOS users either and they're still around. So what is
the criteria here to say what the minimum system requirements should be?
In my opinion, users who're still using slow systems should choose the
"faster but less secure opt-in option" unless there are too many of them
in favor of the majority (?) of users who don't see any disadvantages
with 4096-bit keys.
Or just just someone having a clever idea no one else had before? Happens?
I don't know. Why where there 2 bit breakthroughs (happened for some
other algorithm) and not 4 bit?
scifi-gpg? ngpg? For Next Generation gpg? ;)
It's not like you suddenly start selling snakeoil. For one, you wouldn't
have this discussion. ;)
What about liberating ourselves by forgetting about compatibility at
some point and starting fresh and most secure? By never breaking
compatibility, you can never reduce complexity. Less complexity means
more simplicity, thus perhaps more usability. In my experience, projects
that were created long after gpg are much more usable, probably because
they could learn from gpg which things do not work so well. And I am not
cynic here, because without gpg we wouldn't have that knowledge and also
not those other clients being so usable.
Robert, Werner, let me say that I value a lot, that you're discussion
these matters in public without taking offense even though our
standpoints are quite different. (Most likely due to our different
histories, knowledge, believes, etc.)
Please tell me, what kind of argument would you accept? I guess you'd
like to see loads of happy gpg users, gpg for the masses, etc. Would
numbers convince you? I mean, What if alternative projects such as
Bitmessage etc. managed to get far more users while gpg passes into
oblivion [while they objectively provide more/less security]?

refresh their signing key against keyservers? Could keyservers cope up
with the load?

What in case the apt signing key gets compromised. What is the
mechanism of invalidating the client's keys so they can't fetch
malicious files from any mirrors.
Certainty is what sometimes makes the world an unsafe place. I would
have supposed that this is the case as well, but after verifying such
suppositions I was often quite surprised.
It is non-existent. See my original question [1] and also in my
current discussion [2] someone would have stepped in and said "we
already have this". Since this didn't happen and since I also looked
through apt's sources, I am certain this thing doesn't exist. Can't
prove it though, Russell's teapot you know. ;)
When there is reason to believe, the apt signing key has been
compromised, the revocation certificate can be spread through a
channel other than apt updates (which are compromised).
It's not important. I didn't mean to say that. It's just simpler to
code (for me, in the draft in my head). And if they don't mind, I'll
go the easy way, if they mind, I'll come up with another solution.
They could of course re-use their existing mirror network for this.
Will do.

@_subject: Possible to combine smartcard PIN with key password? 
is it possible to somehow combine gpg's private key password protection
(gpg --edit-key; passwd) and smartcards?
Or in other words, is it possible to store an already encrypted
(password protected) gpg private keys on a smartcard? So the smartcard
never gets to see the plain key?
I've learned the hard way (by buying the equipment even with external
PIN pad), that when "keytocard" has been used, that only the PIN has to
be entered. No password. Unfortunately.
The smartcard has been bought by me to improve security. Not to
substitute one security mechanism with another. I believe gpg's software
encryption is more trustworthy than a card I got by snail mail. I
haven't heard that any cards have been compromised yet, but how do I
know if I really received an original (untampered) card in the first place.
In my opinion both attempts, password protection and smartcards, on
security are worthwhile. When using smartcards I am trusting hardware, a
small group of card designers, producers, post office... And when using
gpg's software key encryption, I am trusting the software producers and
the programmers actually looking at the code.
The idea was to take my chances. If smartcards work, that's great. The
key can be abused when a malware infection happened, but at least the
key can not be extracted. On the other hand, if I loose my smartcard and
smartcards don't do what they promise (i.e. someone ever comes up with
some exploit to extract the key), I fall back to gpg's software key
I am ignorant about the technical details. Maybe there is a technical
reason why it's not worthwhile to combine these things? Or are
smartcards just too limited at this stage of development to support that?

@_author: adrelanos 
@_subject: Possible to combine smartcard PIN with key password? 
This would be lucky, if one could enter the PIN using an external keypad
(possible) AND a password using the keyboard (not possible).
Checking the applet is difficult. Only few people are skilled to do. I
am a user of gnupg. I can't be auditor-like type of person for all
projects I am using. And let's say the applet is fine as is. It will be
much more difficult to find out if the smartcard really wipes the key as
soon someone is trying to dismantle the card to directly read its
memory. It is my understanding, that understanding such hardware design
is even harder than understanding the applet. And knowing/searching for
vulnerabilities in the hardware design is an art in itself.
Also the hardware design?
Well, the smartcard/pin could protect one "part" of the key and the hdd
could contain the other "part" of the key. By "part" I don't mean split
one key in halves, but rather use two keys. I am proposing, the
signature could only get valid if it got signed by both, the
smartcard/pin key and the password/encrypted/hdd key. Or messages get
encrypted twice, once with key on the smartcard on the smartcard and one
with a key on the hdd.
One could do it manually already. First encrypt a message using the
smartcard and the encrypt the encrypted message again using a
password-protected/encrypted key. And you could tell contacts, "my
signature is only valid if it is signed by both signing keys".
Manually doing so just seems to inconvenient to get it right. Technical
challenges should only be implementing that feature but not conceptual

Scenario Adversary capabilities:
- Can physically steal the smartcard.
- Capable of dismantling a smartcard to extract the key its holing.
[Maybe not now, but maybe in a few years the tool required to so so will
be available. Only making up the scenario here.]
- Not capable of breaking gpg's key encryption/password protection.
- Not capable of rubber-hose cryptanalysis.
- Not capable of installing a miniature camera and/or hardware keylogger.
- Password of gpg key has sufficient strength (length, entropy, you name
- Power of computer holding the key is off long enough.
- No data left in RAM (hence no coldboot attack possible).
- Adversary hasn't done an remote/online attack, therefore the password
of the gpg key is still secret.
- Adversary obtained smartcard and hdd by using a one-time physical
attack. (For example a robber could steal a notebook and smartcard.)
- 1) smartcard only: fail [adversary extracts key from smartcard]
- 2) smartcard + gpg/encrypted/password protected key: ok [adversary
extracts key from smartcard, but fails to break gpg's encrypted private key]
- 3) gpg/encrypted/password protected key only: ok [adversary extracts
key from smartcard, but fails to break gpg's encrypted private key]
I'd prefer result 2) and 3) over 1).
Scenario Adversary capabilities:
- Not capable of stealing/dismantling a smartcard to extract the key its
- Not capable of rubber-hose cryptanalysis.
- Not capable of breaking gpg's key encryption/password protection.
- Adversary compromises the victims operating system using a
remote/online attack.
- Adversary reads the password while it is in RAM.
- Adversary downloads the victim's private gpg key from hdd.
- 4) smartcard only [there is no key the adversary could download from
hdd]: as usual, key can be abused as long as smartcard PIN is cached, at
least the smartcard key can not be extracted; no further abuse possible
once detected, smartcard removed [and operating system reset to
clean/immunized state]
- 5) smartcard + gpg/encrypted/password protected key: as usual, key can
be abused as long as smartcard PIN is cached, at least the smartcard key
can not be extracted; no further abuse possible once detected, smartcard
removed [and operating system reset to clean/immunized state]
- 6) gpg/encrypted/password protected only: whole key can be extracted
and abused as long as not revoked
I'd prefer result 4) or 5) over 6).
We can't be sure of adversary capabilities. To archive the best possible
outcome in both, in scenario  and  it seems to be, that it's
worthwhile to combine the security properties from both, smartcards and

The latter often requires breaking into a flat or an office. While
smartcards are carried around. Breaking into a a flat/office and
installing a hardware keylogger and/or miniature camera requires much
more criminal energy than theft/robbery of a smartcard.
That is also my point. If you enough capabilities to the adversary,
anything can be broken. I only believe, the combination of unique
security advantages, which both hardware protections by smartcards and
key encryption have, leads to a combination of these advantages and thus
defeats more adversaries than not having a combination of these security
Indeed. That's a necessary assumption I didn't write down.

compare our fingerprints", that'd be awesome.
There could be issues, but perhaps nothing you can't solve. As far I
understand OTR is more designed for low latency, but I don't see why
it couldn't be tweaked. Only the dh key exchange happens with low
latency? You could add one button "new session" (or so) and another
one "End this Subject". With each new subject, use another dh key. And
with each new subject, prepare one, two or a few dh keys (in e-mail
text or header, hidden from user). Of course it requires more thought.
Might be useful to propose it on the OTR list in case you find that

@_subject: How to verify X.509 signatures? 
TrueCrypt.org says [1] they are signing "TrueCrypt Setup 7.1a.exe" [2]
with a X.509 signature. How can I verify such a signature?
(On Debian Wheezy.) I tried:
gpg2 --verify "TrueCrypt Setup 7.1a.exe"
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: the signature could not be verified.
Please remember that the signature file (.sig or .asc)
should be the first file given on the command line.
gpgsm --verify "TrueCrypt Setup 7.1a.exe"
gpgsm: ksba_cms_parse failed: End of file

I don't care so much about that truecrypt.exe, but want to know how it

@_subject: gpg for anonymous users - Alternative to the web of trust? 
As a brief introduction, I am adrelanos, the strictly pseudonymous
(anonymous) maintainer of Whonix, an Open Source Anonymous Operating
System. [1] I gpg-sign binary releases and source code (git tags) in
order to authenticate Whonix to users, and prevent adversaries from
distributing altered versions in my name.
Given that I can't meet with other Linux or Tor developers who could
verify my identity and sign my key, how can I establish a web of trust
for potential Whonix users to rely on? More generally, how can strictly
pseudonymous people establish webs of trust?
In an attempt to bootstrap my public key from the Web, it's available on
keyservers, in Whonix source code and binary releases, and on my
homepage and project page. [3] By mirroring my key to many http, https
and/or .onion sites, it becomes harder and harder to impersonate me.
However, that hasn't worked out very well, because search engines
apparently don't index keys, and so there is no way to verify my list of
public key mirrors.
How can I establish a pseudonym that no one can easily fake while
remaining anonymous?

There is no person who knows who is behind this identity/activity.
Until now, no one, never.
What's the alternative? Using my real identity? Does it make it any safer?
I am more interested in development and documentation rather than
building binaries, testing and uploading. Having deterministic builds
and/or some creditable individual or organization (such as eff) creating
binaries, signing an distributing more than welcome, but at the moment
there is no implication that someone will step forward.
It only proves I made a mistake and hopefully others can learn from it.

Why would that be a scandal? I've never claimed to be superior, perfect
or acted otherwise arrogant about being super secure. Neither I claimed
Whonix to be an unbreakable system. The claims the system makes are
modest. Discovering me as high profile target (if I become that) would
only demonstrate the limits of the system, show mistakes one can make
and/or and show which improvements are waiting to get implemented.
If one system fails, another one may get born and I am glad if I can be
a part of this process of innovation.
I think things like NSAKEY [1] ought more to be a scandal, not many
people did care, did they?
Thanks for the suggestions. At the moment this won't work for my case,
there is just one maintainer (me) and users. The other creators remained
anonymous as well and lack time.

Maybe many people don't know, that it also has a text editor with handy

I find it quite good, there are just some usability glitches here and
there and perhaps some bugs (never could get symmetric encryption to work).
Personally I don't mind the "crap dependencies". Ok, it's for non-KDE
users ~ 100 MB for graphical gpg key management and gpg text editor. Our
hard drives are so big these days, I am sure regular users don't mind.

Fixed that.
I agree with that. Originally intended to write "compromise" instead of
"loss". When I write "compromise", that sentence should be correct.
The whole context is:
key length. As computers get more powerful and storage gets cheaper,
it?s conceivable that a nasty person could archive a message that?s
unbreakable today, then in the future break it using a more powerful
computer. Using the highest possible value for key length helps protect
you from that scenario. Don?t use GPG?s default of 2048!
Why doesn't tbhat make sense?
I don't understand.
Probably not that important. It's not required anymore. When later new
subkeys are created, that file would have to be updated. Removing it to
avoid confusion.
yes. Above I am suggesting to store the key backup on a fully encrypted
disk, so the passphrase for the mainkey doesn't matter if you assume,
the full disk encryption of that disk is safe.
I added this as a footnote.
That would be advisable.
This is most interesting.
