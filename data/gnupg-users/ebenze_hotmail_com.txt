@_subject: Encrypting / decrypting without importing keys? 
I'm new to GnuPG and was wondering if it was possible to encrypt and/or
decrypt without needing to first import the keys into gpg.  I'm looking to
use gpg to encrypt data from a web page, where the user specifies the public
key to encrypt data, and then eventually a private key to decrypt it.
Additionally, is there anyway I can specify the keys to use as coming from
standard in or standard out instead of being file based?

Thanks!  That was just what I needed.  However, have a followup question
though.  I now need to programatically convert the ascii key to a binary
key.  Doing a quick export of a key in binary format and in armoured format,
I noticed that I can base64 encode the binary key and get an almost exact
match to the armoured format.   However, there seem to be five characters on
a newline (=oge7) that appear in the armoured key which are not my base64
conversion of the binary key.   I can only assume them to be some form of a
CRC check, but am not sure.  Is there armoured version of the key always
followed by a CRC check?  If so, is it a CRC32 check?  CRC24? etc?  How can
I tell when/where the key ends and the CRC checks starts?   Does a armoured
key always end with a specific character?  Is there a doc which specifies
the format of the armoured key somewhere?
