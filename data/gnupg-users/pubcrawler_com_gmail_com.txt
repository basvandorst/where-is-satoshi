@_subject: Offloading encryption to crypto card? 
We are new to GnuPG.... started using this in the past few weeks.
We have large hundred and more megabyte files that we are regularly
encrypting and decrypting as needed.
Obviously, this takes time- more time than we sometimes like.
Will something like the Rainbow Technologies CrytoSwift card help with
speeding up GnuPG? Are these cards
supported or similar cards from other manufacturers?
