@_subject: Help adding the idea extension... 
Hi group,
    We recently got gnupg to compile on a SCO 5.0.5 box (No flames please. I wouldn't work with SCO if it were my choice). But I'm having a problem getting the idea extension to work.
I've downloaded the idea.c.gz file and compiled it. I added the line to the ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf file that reads "load-extension idea". I had the compiled module in /usr/local/lib/ and in the ~/.gnupg/ directory and have put full paths ect....
I've tried to use the --load-extension option at the command line.
I have some clients have been using idea to encrypt files they send us and would like to get this working.
can anyone help with something I've missed?
I've been through the FAQ and guides looking for my mistake but can't find it yet....
please help...

Thanks for the reply Dave,
    By saying "won't work" I was meaning IDEA dosen't appear under ciphers when gpg --version is run. with or without (only in the .gnupg.conf file)  the command line --load-extension. I'm thinking it must be a SCO problem but wanted to hear from the list to see if anyone else had had a problem.
Here is the output:
OK oper> gpg --load-extension /u/oper/.gnupg/idea --version
gpg (GnuPG) 1.2.3

I really wanted to avoid rerunning configure and recompiling. We ran into problems with the assembler and the mpi files.
again thanks for the quick reply.

Hi Dave,
grep USE_DYNAMIC_LINKING config.h
shows the line commented out.
must be a SCO thing. ( this is our theme song around here.).
we run about 20 linux servers and two SCO boxes. and the majority of my time is unfortunately spent fixing the SCO machines.
I did get it to recompile and it is working just now.
for some reason the mpi/$files were "broken" (sorry I know that's not correct lingo but I'm an admin)
one of the developers here know assembly and had to go through and fix about 6 of the files to have correct syntax. Luckily I had made a tar-ball of the files before I ran "make clean".
If you'd like to see the tar-ball and the "broken files" let me know.
Thanks for all your help,
