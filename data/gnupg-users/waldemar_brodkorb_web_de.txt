@_subject: key problems 
Hello MaD,
We can't yet set the primary key id flag.  I think this ugly
workaround should help:
 1. Make a local copy of your public and your secret key.
   (use --export and --export-secret-key)
 2. Use deluid to remove all non-primary user IDs
 3. Use expire to change the expiration time of the main key
 4. Save
 5. Optional: Edit key again and change expiration time back to the
    old value.
 6. Wait one second (in case you are using a script)
 6. Use --import --allow-secret-key-import to import your
    backup public and secret key from step 1 again.
The newer signatures should take precedence over the ones from the
backup key and therefore you have one user ID with a newer timestamp
and in absence of a primary key flag, this one will count as primary
I have not tested this and I know that it is ugly.
The plan is to have a self-signature update capability per user ID
which can the be used to change such things.  This will probably not
update the timestamp of the self-signature but just set it one
second ahead.  I am not sure on this point, though.

Hello Evan,
Take a look at the archiv. What about adding this point to the FAQ?

Hello Christoph,
mailfilter_pgp_attachment atached.
I hope 0.8 kbytes is not to much.

@_subject: Q: gpg on windows w/ removable media 
Hello Ben,
Have you tried this?
The problem is gnupg wants to write trustdb.gpg.
I've configured the automounter
to use my key's from floppy-disc, but it doesn't work,
if I make the disk write-protected. gpg --list-keys
gpg: fatal: /misc/floppy/.gnupg: can't create directory: Permission
secmem usage: 0/0 bytes in 0/0 blocks of pool 0/16384
# killall -USR1 automount
Write enabled:
waldemar gpg --list-keys

Is there a solution for this?
thanks in advance

@_subject: [Announce] GnuPG 1.0.5 released 
Hello Werner,
Is it possible to change the primary uid?
Or have I revoke a sign and make a new for the uid i want to be the primary?

@_subject: LDAP? 
Hello *,
are there any plans to integrate LDAP support to GnuPG?
So you can save public-keys in a LDAP-server and fetch them directly with GnuPG ?
Anyone knows a official schema-file with attributes for storing public keys?
        bye & thanks
                Waldemar
