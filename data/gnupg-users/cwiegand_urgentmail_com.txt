Geheimnis uses only a file-based setup. In time, I may explore pipes if I feel
inclined, but generally I use files. Sadly, KMail *does* use pipes (I know, I
wanted to write a wrapper around it for geheimnis). I don't believe the version
of KMail released with KDE 1.1.1 supports gpg (appears to support pgp 2.6 and
pgp 5).
