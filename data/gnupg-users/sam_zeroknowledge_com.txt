@_subject: Can't import keys -- link() failed 
Hi folks,
I just started using gnupg a couple of weeks ago.  The other day, I tried
to import a key that I got off of kernel.org using
but I get the following error message:
[sam linux-2.4.3]$ gpg --import kernel.org.pub gpg: lock not made: link() failed: Operation not permitted
gpg: fatal: can't lock `/mnt/floppy/.gnupg/pubring.gpg'
secmem usage: 1408/1408 bytes in 2/2 blocks of pool 1408/16384
As you can see, I have stored my key rings on floppy disk.  It is not
write protected, and I have the correct permissions.  In fact, I
successfully imported and signed another key a week ago.
My GNUPGHOME environment variable is set to /mnt/floppy/.gnupg/
There are no lock files in that directory.
I can't even successfully export and re-import my own key without getting
this message anymore.
I've scoured the FAQ and this mailing list's archive to no avail, can
anyone help me?

Yes, I am running on linux.  Unfortunately, I'm running gpg 1.0.1, and it
doesn't seem to understand the --lock-never option, so I'm going to try
moving my public key ring onto hard disk.
I realize that there was no need to keep my public ring on a floppy, it
was just simpler to keep all my keys in the same place.
Thanks for the help, I'll see about upgrading my gpg version as well.
