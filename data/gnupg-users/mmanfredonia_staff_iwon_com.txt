I have someone using  PGP 6.5.8.  I am running gpg v1.0.4 (I know, two
behind).  All the docs I find are PGP5.x and that has always worked.
However,  with this person, when I encrypt the file, the decrypt it and see
garbage (a mixtue of binary and ascii characters)  Are there any known
problem here? This is the command I am using
gpg -v --yes --output $BASEDIR\/$OUTFILE --compress-algo 1 --cipher-algo
3des --encrypt --recipient "recipient" $BASEDIR\/$INPUTFILE
I found one person online who said with 5.5 he needed --no-armor
--no-comment so I tried that but with no luck.
Will upgrading help? Are there new flags for 6.5.8?
Separate Bug:
I installed 1.0.6 on my staging environment and on solaris2.6 I run into the
same problem with 1.0.4, in the po/MakeFile after ./configure
, in the list of POTFILES, the last element has a trailing \ which  breaks
anyway....its no big deal to manually edit this but thought you should know
