For my ?0.02 I think the above is mostly valid bar 2 small details:
1. Seldom we do find the FBI breaking security of anonymity tools. Only
if a high profile case shows up or someone leaks it. I think it is even
more rare for the FBI to outright disclose the vulnerability they used
so it can be patched. I don't even know if the other 3 letter agencies
do it.
2. Crypto arms race also implies stock piling vulnerabilities -
something Bruce Schneier is very vocal about [1][2]. I think the answer
here is to find a balance of some sort - i.e. keep vulnerabilities in
rare cases for short periods of time and then disclose and patch them.
However for that to work we need to trust the govt. to do the right
thing. Which I think is pretty much the core issue that started this
[1] Hacking Team, Computer Vulnerabilities, and the NSA -
[2] Disclosing vs. Hoarding Vulnerabilities -
