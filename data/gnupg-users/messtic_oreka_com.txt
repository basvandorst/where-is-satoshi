Hello Michael,
    Mutt half-recently began to force outgoing traditional inline PGP
messages to UTF-8, disregarding the $send_charset list (in fact acting
as if $send_charset="us-ascii:utf-8"). This change was done to improve
interoperability, but can unfortunately reduce it in some cases. It is
not configurable. And Muttng is based on most recent CVS Mutt.
    Takashi Takizawa has done a patch to allow other charsets in inline
PGP mails. Look at for it.
    Which ones exactly? How do they behave?
    If your system locale is correct, which is preferable, you could
remove this statement. GnuPG will automagically deduce the charset from
whatever the current locale is.
Bye!	Alain.

Hello Johan,
    What are you talking about? Mutt works very well on a CP-850
terminal, automatically converting on-the-fly between the MIME charset
and 850 code page. No need to suid root for that. And there is nothing
lost when compared to a Latin-1 terminal.
    More explanations would be off-topic here, but you are welcome on
the mutt-users mailing list if you need assistance.
Bye!	Alain.

Hello Bruno,
    Much thanks, Bruno!
    BTW how is a Win32 console app supposed to use libcharset? I mean
libcharset uses GetACP() only, getting graphic mode default charset
(typically 1252), while console apps use a usually different text mode
default charset (typically 850, given by GetConsoleOutputCP()).
    More complicated yet for apps like GnuPG, usable both directly in
console with 850, or thru a graphic frontend interacting in 1252. GnuPG
doesn't use libcharset, but on Win32 uses directly GetConsoleOutputCP(),
unless it fails then GetACP(), then canonicalizes names (28591 ==>
ISO-8859-1) with the same table as libcharset. There are still cases
where forcing charset with --charset option becomes necessary.
    I keep the crosspost gnupg-users, because I believe it's not way
off-topic, being a continuation of an old January 2005 "current charset
guessing" thread.
Bye!	Alain.

And this app needs to know which Windows specific Get*CP() to call,
then how to canonicalize charset name. So a Win32 console app can't use
libcharset, but must more or less duplicate it? There is no text/graph
mode hint an app could give to libcharset, to directly obtain the wanted
    I seem to understand GetOEMCP() gives fixed system default OEM CP,
while GetConsoleOutputCP() gives current console OEM CP. After a user or
app has done a "chcp 28591" on a French Windows, GetOEMCP()=850 while
    I should add that the frontend calling GnuPG, and wanting us to
output ANSI text, has the duty to make GetConsoleOutputCP() fail for us
returning 0. The Bat!? makes that, I don't know how.
Bye!	Alain.

Hello Patrick,
    What about the types Mutt generates since version 1.5.1:

Hash: SHA1
Hi Sascha,
    With pleasure (out of pgp-keys). And this list mail is also signed
inline with Mutt 1.5.9. This format has 3 advantages:
 ? PGP nature can be detected without costly body parsing, unlike in
pure text/plain.
 ? It's text/plain, without the interoperability problems of app/pgp.
PGP unaware mailers will ignore x-action parameter, and display the
inline cleartext. No one should fail and show an unknown attachment,
like happened with application/pgp.
 ? Other parameters of CT: text/plain are possible, especially charset.
Note straight Mutt forces sending either US-Ascii or UTF-8: No Latin-1
nor other charsets. This has pros and cons. Patch exists to permit
sending any charset. OTOH reading any charset always works.
Bye!	Alain.

[copy to libiconv author]
    The name mapping between 65001 local CP and UTF-8 standard name is
lacking both in GnuPG util/strgutil.c, and in libiconv-1.9.2
libcharset/lib/localcharset.c. This lack should be easy to correct.
    In the meantime you can use the gpg --charset=utf-8 option when used
on a CP-65001 terminal.
Bye!	Alain.

@_subject: unavailable conversion (was: Help on information with Gnupg) 
Hello Gbenga,
    On HP-UX? Then: In fact the said conversion *is* available, but a
bug makes GnuPG request it under a wrong name, unknown by the HP iconv
library. GnuPG says "utf-8", while HP expects "utf8".
    There may perhaps be a workaround on the system: Creating an alias
utf-8 to utf8 in /usr/lib/nls/iconv/config.iconv or something like that.
There is an alias section, and comments about the expected format.
    Or install libiconv 1.9.2 to replace HP iconv.
Bye!	Alain.

Hello David, Satya,
    That's not a good advice: If Satya is using an HP-Roman8 terminal,
he will get corrupted UID creation and display.
    A suitable workaround could be to alias "utf-8" to "utf8" in
deal itself with system-specific charset names.
Bye!	Alain.
