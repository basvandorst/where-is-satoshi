@_subject: changing order of uids 
please, how to change order of uids
(Please CC me, I'm not on the list. Thanks)
I mean I have a key eg.:
(1) test-01 test-01
(2) test-02 test-02
(3) test-03 test-03
ut I need this order:
(1) test-03 test-03
(2) test-01 test-01
(3) test-02 test-02
I know that it is possible with some hack
(and is planned for next release of gpg as regular option)
(I even did it in past),
but I fool lost the page describing it :-(
Just an URL describing it will be fine.
Thanks for help M. Zadnik
