According to the PGP Corporation, you can compile a working version of=20
PGP from the source code, but the distributed source code does NOT=20
include the code for the GUI which is an integral part of PGP 8. =20
=46riends of mine who use Windows have tried it without success, however.
Also, the source code in the version I saw is undocumented.  How are you=20
going to check it out for bugs in that case?

Thanks for that Ingo.  I can now send PGP/MIME messages if required :-) =20
However, the documentation says that with the OpenPGP plugin I can use=20
S/MIME encoding as well as OpenPGP.  I sometimes have to do this, but I=20
can't find out how to set up S/MIME in KMail.  If I've missed it,=20

No.  Kopete also carries GPG encryption and you can connect it to=20

When you compile a new version of GnuPG, the files go to /usr/local/bin/=20

I am using Libranet 2.8 (a Debian derivative).  Anybody know where I can get the crypto plugins for KMail (eg. PGP/MIME, etc)? The official page refers you to a Debian resource which is no longer maintained and searching on kmail + "crypto plugins" in the Debian Package Search search engine in Mozilla results in nothing.
Any help would be appreciated

front end. I'm looking for more than just a GUI that organizes/manages
the keys, but one that would encrypt/sign/decrypt/verify the clipboard.
If it would also do the same with an active window (ala PGP in Windows
and Mac), that would be superb! I got enigmail going with my Mozilla
mail, but I need the features above for my newsreader, Pan...
Sorry, there's nothing yet in Linux that will encrypt/decrypt/verify to
an active window, but the nearest that comes is KGPG, but you have to be
running KDE to use it.  As RedHat defaults to Gnome, you might look at
Seahorse and GPA.  All these are listed in the front ends list on
Personally, I prefer KGPG (its a good reason for running KDE!) but there
are dependency problems in Debian/Libranet which I'm now using.  A right
click on any file in Konqueror and you will see a menu item to encrypt
the file via KGPG.  It has full sign/encrypt/verify from its own editor
and the clipboard.  Plus I found its MD5 verification option very good.

Unless there's been a new version of the BkGPG plugin recently for=20
Becky2, that plugin recognises PGP/MIME to RFC2015 only and NOT to RFC=20
3156 as well.  This causes a verification error in those messages=20
produced by MUAs that support both RFCs and the BkGPG plugin used to do=20
just this.
Again, unless there are some MUAs with an updated PGP/MIME=20
compatibility, the only two in Windows that I know that supports=20
PGP/MIME to RFC2015 and RFC3156 are Mozilla Mail with the Enigmail=20
plugin, and Pegasus with the appropriate GPG plugin.
RFCs are the internet standards in this regard and when I last looked,=20
only Pegasus and Mozilla Mail could be regarded as standards compliant=20
with regard to PGP/MIME.

This has already led to confusion of laws for agricultural matters=20

I checked this with a lawyer since digital signatures are allowed to=20
authenticate documents as if they were signatures by recent legislation=20
in the UK.  Apparently, the *type* of digital signatures is not=20
specified in the Act of Parliament and the guidance notes states that=20
signatures generated by PGP are allowed.  This follows a recommendation=20
by a Committee dealing with e-commerce and is written in to the=20

So if PGP signatures are allowed in UK law to authenticate documents,=20
then it follows logically that OpenPGP signatures are allowed.

@_subject: [Q] "sign" vs "sign-locally" 
Hash: SHA1
This is the equivalent of the exportable signature and non-exportable=20
signature in PGP.  If you locally sign a key that signature cannot be=20
exported to another person or keyserver: in other words, it is a method=20
of allocating trust to a key on your keyring only.
Correct, and this in fact the purpose of "key signing parties".
If you sign a key and then export the key, the signature goes with that=20
key.  If you locally sign the key and export it, the signature does not=20
go with the key.
Some keys are used for specific purposes, and one such purpose could be=20
to sign documents.  Having a non-revocable key stops anybody revoking=20
that key and therefore stops the invalidation of the documents.
