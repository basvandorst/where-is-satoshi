@_subject: how to get private key  
I have general question regarding private key security.
If a user creates its private public key pair by using some passphrase on a system. Can this pair be taken to a different system and decrypt files that were generated using its public key? My guess is no, but needed to confirm with you guys. If it is possible, then how it will be done, any command to list private key etc. Also how can we protect where no one can steel this private key from a system other than restricting users access to the system?

Thanks, that was exactly what I was looking for. I followed the instructions in the doc, and it works on Ubuntu host as user, but if I chroot to a filesystem within this host, I get the following error within chroot'd filesystem:
user at ubuntu-host$ sudo chroot ~/target/fs
root at ubuntu-host# cat >foo <Please read the section "Unattended key generation" in doc/DETAILS.

Ok, I was able to resolve this issue. I have to set HOME=/root inside the shell to get it going. Now I have new problem, script runs ok from within this chroot fs, but when keys generation process just hangs with statement:
"Not enough random bytes available. Please do some other work....(Need 284 more bytes)"
How can I force it to complete it?

@_subject: why we need passphrase 
In order to understand GnuPG, I tried to create private keys on two ubuntu systems. Here are my steps and I would ask my question at the end as I need to show what I did.
1. System A: Created private and public key by using 'gpg --gen-key' and then
        'gpg --export --armor -out userA.asc -r 'USER A'
2. System B: Created private and public key by using 'gpg --gen-key' and then imported public key of userA
        'gpg --import userA.asc'
3. System B: encrypted a file for userA using userA's public key '
        gpg -o file_from_userB -r userA --encrypt file_to_encrypt
4. System A: Tried to decrypt file_from_userB
        gpg -o decrypted_file --decrypt file_from_userB
at this point, it asks to provide passphrase of userA. Is it possible to avoid where I need to provide passphrase at all? My understanding was that the file was encrypted with userA's credential to begin with, and userA should be decrtypt it without providing any passphrase? How can do this procedure where I don't have to provide passphrase in decryption?
Thanks a lot.

How can I remove this restriction where I don't have to provide passphrase and public key itself is good enough?
