I am trying to install the gnupg 1.4.10 on solaris 10 server, I have
received the below error
configure:3550: /opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc --version >&5
./configure: line 3551: /opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc: No such file or directory
configure:3553: $? = 127
configure:3560: /opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc -v >&5
./configure: line 3561: /opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc: No such file or directory
configure:3563: $? = 127
configure:3570: /opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc -V >&5
./configure: line 3571: /opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc: No such file or directory
configure:3573: $? = 127
configure:3596: checking for C compiler default output file name
It seems, I need to install C compiler by installing SPROcc 9(unbundled
SPARCworks Professional C compiler)
Please advise on this.

Thanks for your reply.
I checked the package GCC, it is showing that it was already installed.
$ pkginfo | grep -i gcc
system      SUNWgcc                          gcc - The GNU C compiler
system      SUNWgccruntime                   GCC Runtime libraries
$ which cc
But I am not sure why GnuPG software is looking for cc in
I gave CC location while configuring, but it throwed error message again
$ ./configure CC=/usr/ucb/cc
PATH: /usr/ccs/bin
configure:3278: checking for gcc
configure:3305: result: /usr/ucb/cc
configure:3550: /usr/ucb/cc --version >&5
configure:3560: /usr/ucb/cc -v >&5
configure:3570: /usr/ucb/cc -V >&5
configure:3623: /usr/ucb/cc -Xc -xstrconst -xcg92 $(INCLUDE_FLAGS) -O
-DSUN_OS5 -DNLS_ASIA -DAFSTUBS   conftest.c  >&5
Please provide me some inputs to proceed
