Hi !
WinPT seems to be unmaintained, and GPA is not really mature, GPGShell is
not GNU,....
Does anyone have thoughts on a Windows GUI Frontend ?

AFAIK it is not open source. In addition it fails to decrypt files sometimes, just tells me that the key
is invalid. No idea why, WinPT decrypts them fine.

Hi again !
I think at the moment there is no really nice frontend for GnuPG in
Windows, which IMHO really is a problem.
I was thinking along these lines:
If GPA is progressing nicely it will become the key manager of choice,
although it looks a bit weird on windows.
So all the keyring manipulations can be done with GPA.
All the windows frontend would need to do is:
Provide tray icon with decrypt+verify/encrypt/sign for clipboard and
current window.
Provide explorer integration for Right-Click | GnuPG |
decrypt+verify/encrypt/sign for files.
Maybe some keyboard shortcuts for these.
These are things which are very windows specific, so they will most likely
not find a coder in the linux world.
I do not speak C, so I cant help per se but:
I have done some work with P.Gutmanns Cryptlib, for which an API interface
for Visual basic was derived from the c header file of cryptlib.
So if someone here could help in compiling GPG-ME into a .dll and maybe the
author of the API for cryptlib or someone else creates an interface it
should be possible to do all these things in VB.
I am doing some work in Visual Basic and would like to give that a go. (I
do not promise anything !)
If this is a stupid/impossible idea let me know,

Hi !
Thanks, I am glad to hear that.
Yes the site is a bit outdated.
Will have a look.
Has the problem which is discussed on the winpt forum about the GnuPG
binary been resolved ?
Timo, let me say that I am very grateful for your work on WinPT.
It is a lot of unpaid, and very often unthanked for work, and I am sure you
have a real life as well ;-) .
Be assured we appeciate it a lot, and special thanks for making it open
There are some things which drive me mad in WinPT though:
If I try to delete keys in the keymanager it crashes. (WinXP)
It failes to capture text from websites in firefox.
It does not allow to do symmetric decryption of the clipboard.
Is there any way we/I can help ?

Hi !
Capturing text works in 0.9.14 Thanks !
I found the problem, sorry for blaming you !
The encryption was done with IDEA, which is of course not supported in
I am just trying to figure out how to get IDEA loaded as module. Any hints
Bugger, this is really annoying.
Could it be because I imported all keys from PGP into my keyring ?
Should I maybe export and reimport them into a new keyring ?
As regarding your website:
This is really helpful, I maintain a website at would you object if I mirror or link to your site ?
And: There was discussion on the sourceforge WinPT homepage that the newest
GnuPG binary which is required for WinPT was not available for windows.
Could you please also provide a download for the latest GnuPG binary ?
I am also really confused about the various versions of WinPT and
WinPTTray, in conjunction with GnuPG versions and so on, which is mainly
caused by the outdated website at  and the sourceforge site. Can we in any way help you with updating these ? If the graphical installer
is the way you want new users to install the whole package, what are your
thoughts on updating the various components ?
I run a public WiKi at  should we try to get some
WinPT info in there ?
Eager to help,
panta-admin

Hi !
I am the administrator of a public nym server providing anonymous email
addresses via the remailer network.
I use a perl script for all nymserver manipulations, and have a severe
problem with PGP 2.6.x users.
They can not decrypt the messages made with GnuPG in the script.
I think I would be able to modify the nymserver script to create valid
2.6.x signatures and encryption packets, the problem is, how do I know that
the users RSA key was created by PGP 2.6.x ?
So my question is, is there any way of finding out if a key has been
created by PGP 2.6.x ?
Thanks a lot,

Hi !
Thanks, thats what I feared. As I would not like to break it for GnuPG
users (IDEA) I will request all PGP 2.6.x users to have "PGP2" in their
userid. (Or is there any other textfield in the key that I could use ?)
Then the script can check for that and use pgp2 compatible encryption. As for PGP2 compatible encryption/signing, is  still up to date ?
I wonder because it does not mention the --pgp2 option.
Is the method shown in this document still the recommended one to get PGP2
compatibility ?
All I need is: encrypt or sign + encrypt messages with an RSA v3 key so
PGP2 users can decrypt it.
Thanks a lot for your help,
