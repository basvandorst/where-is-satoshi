@_subject: Encrypting already signed messages. 
I'm hoping this isn't a dumb question.
Is it possible to encrypt a message that is already signed without breaking the signing?  I use gnupg as implented by gpg-mailgate to encrypt all incoming and outgoing messages.  Currently it tests for pre encrypted messages and ones that have been signed.
Thank you.
