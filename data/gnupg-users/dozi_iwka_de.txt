@_subject: gpg im CGI Script 
In a CGI-Script (named gpg.pl, e.g.) I have called:
system "gpg -se -r dozi /tmp/TEST";
After   I got in  error_log des httpd:
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
gpg: fatal: ~/.gnupg: can´t create directory: no such file or directory
secmem usage: 0/0 bytes in 0/0 blocks of pool 0/16384
What should I do in order to get /tmp/TEST.gpg
which I got when running the CGI script directly from command line?
P.S. My idea is, to make an "upload"  of plain text via an SSL secured browser
an encrypt the uploaded file /tmp/TEST immediately after the upload, then
deleting  the plain file /tmp/TEST
I know there is a securty hole, but as long as WIN-gnupg doesn`t work ......
Thanks Bodo Zimmermann
