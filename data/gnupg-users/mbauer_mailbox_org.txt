@_subject: email verification as casual checking? 
* Nicolai Josuttis wrote on Fri, 22 Aug 2014, at 18:13 (+0200):
this has already been implemented and improved by CAcert:
Fundamentally, CAcert is known for (a) issuing X.509 certificates
to its members and for (b) building and operating a large Web of
Trust.  I think, (b) is more important.  Also, CAcert offers the
possibility to certify the user IDs of its members' OpenPGP keys.
This basically works as follows:
- First, you have to create a CAcert account.  This requires an
  email address which is verified to be under your control.
- Then you try to get your identity assured.  You meet
  face-to-face with at least two assurers and present them at
  least one (two are preferred) photo IDs issued by a
  government.  Depending on the assurers' experience you receive
  so called assurance points.
- If you have collected 50+ assurance points, you could get your
  OpenPGP key's user ID(s) certified automatically.  This
  certification expires after one year and is a generic one
  (0x10) instead of a casual one (0x12) (RFC 4880).  See my key
  for details.
- Of course, you can add additional verified(!) email addresses
  and also get them certified.
I think, this process is far better than any mere email address
validation service because OpenPGP certificates do cover the
whole user ID.  And it does *not* contain an email address only!
Usually there is a name, too!  The downside for this automatic
process to work is, of course (but not really), that a user ID is
forced to have a certain format.
Have a look at  and for further details.

There are several points worth considering before using the above
procmail recipes:
a) The latest Mutt-GnuPG-PGP-HOWTO is quite old (Feb 2000) [1].
b) RFC3156, which defines PGP/MIME, originates from Aug 2001 [2].
c) The current procmail v3.22 has some issues with the B flag [3].
and most important
d) You can't catch all curiosities automatically.
Therefore I suggest using some modified/extended recipes instead:
* ! ^Content-Type:[ \t]+message/
* ! ^Content-Type:[ \t]+multipart/
* ! ^Content-Type:[ \t]+application/pgp
  :0 f w
  * B ?? ^-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----
  * B ?? ^-----END PGP MESSAGE-----
formail -b -f -i 'Content-Type: application/pgp; format=text; x-action=encrypt'
  :0 f w
  * B ?? ^-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
  * B ?? ^-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----
  * B ?? ^-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----
formail -b -f -i 'Content-Type: application/pgp; format=text; x-action=sign'
But as Bob already mentioned, further details should better be
discussed on mutt-users at mutt.org.

* Sudhir Khanger wrote on Fri, 25 Jul 2014, at 23:10 (+0530):
Usually it's *one* passphrase for the whole GnuPG key material.
And even more usually this one is stored in one's human brain.
(Some special scenarios may handle this differently.)
Maybe human brain is not ready for storing a great and still
growing number of passwords, but it is capable to store at least
a very small number of important passphrases.  For all those
other passwords using a password manager may be just fine.
So, if you're using a password manager for your GnuPG passphrase,
you will either run immediately into a chicken egg dilemma as the
manager needs a password, too.  Or you might not be concerned at
all about security and might ask yourself why using GnuGP anyway.
I'm sorry, there are only these two possibilities.

I don't want to sound harsh, but at this point you should hold on
reading.  "Using the same passphrase" should nowadays lead to big
red STOP signs flashing up.
Solving the problem of memorizing/storing the GnuPG passphrase by
using another layer of software means adding further complexity.
Although this possibly may not tear down security completely, the
general level of security is not improved.  Most likely it will
decrease.  Whether this is acceptable, depends on your scenarios,
the known present ones and the possible future ones.
Being more aware of the consequences of these small actions like
"using the same password" surely belongs to the lessons learned
at least in the past year.  And, of course, how to prioritize
security in contrast to, e.g., usability.

No, usually not.  If you generate a key using some GUI or if you
are working on some terminal and use the command
  $ gpg --gen-key
you will be asked for one passphrase only.  Although this will
create a main key and a subkey.
There are more sophisticated scenarios which may use multiple
passphrases.  For example, if you want to use a so called
"offline key", you will have at least two passphrases: one for
your offline key and one for your "daily working key".

You know your working scenarios, we on this mailing list don't
(at least as long as you don't give more details).  So it's only
you who can evaluate these and who must decide finally.  As
always, the evaluation of the scenarios comes first, the
selection of the means (software) to face them comes afterwards.
I think you should invest some time to go through the man pages
of all the commands you intend to use.  For example gpg-agent(1):
  --default-cache-ttl n
      Set the time a cache entry is valid to n seconds.  The
      default is 600 seconds.
  --max-cache-ttl n
      Set the maximum time a cache entry is valid to n seconds.
      After this time a cache entry will be expired even if it
      has been accessed recently.  The default is 2 hours (7200
      seconds).
If unsure, keep using the defaults.
