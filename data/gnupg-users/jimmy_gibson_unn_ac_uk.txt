@_subject: Unable to build egd 
I am having problems building egd on a Compaq Tru64 Unix platform.
When I try to build the makefile using 'perl Makefile' I get a segmentation
fault and core dump.
Perl is version 5.005_03 built for alpha-dec_osf (reported by perl --version),
this is this version shiped with the OS. OS is Compaq Tru64 Unix version 5.1
I have been able to build egd on an old DEC osf v4.0 system without any
problems, but this system is officially decomisioned and unavailable to my
users.  So I need to build on my 'new' system.
Other perl modules and applications have built OK so far.
Any help is greatly appreciated.
Thanks in advance
