What is the simplest way of integrating GnuPG with the Pegasus Mail client?
Is there a plugin for Pegasus?  Many thanks.

Yes, I found this on Google. However, when I try to download, all I get is a
0-Byte long zip file?
Is there another location for this file?
Many Thanks!

No, the link works, but the download is slow. The file I was able to
download was 189 KB. I think you should just keep trying.
Thanks Nick, I think I had a poor setting in star Downloader program. I got
the file OK today via Firefox.
Wish me luck :-) LOL.
