@_subject: compatibility with PGP-5.0 
I'm new to the list; is there a FAQ?
I'd like to know how compatible gnupg is in respect with PGP-5.0.
I had a .pgp directory in my home, and did gpg --import .pgp/*
Howver, gpg does not seem to recognize my passphrase...
Did I miss something?
Than-you, jean-marie sulmont
