@_subject: A bug in version 1.2.1? 
When I try to encrypt a message within Kmail, I get a window for verifying/selecting keys. Even though I have that person's key on the keyring and even though it shows that person's key in the window, I can't encrypt to that person or even select the appropriate key. However, I can encrypt from the CLI. Is it a Kmail 1.4.3 (KDE 3.x) bug or a GPG 1.2.1 bug?

@_subject: rpm --checksig problem 
No, but the public keys are required.
I won't do that until I can verify the signatures on the packages.
I tried that plus rpm --import. I still get the error message that the keys are missing.
I've never had this problem in earlier distros. Why is 9.2 different?

In case this hasn't been reported, I got this message when verifying the following tarball:

@_subject: OT? rpm --checksig problem 
Even though the public keys are on the keyring, running rpm --checksig on packages tell me that the key is missing. I tried downloading the packages from a different mirror but get the same problem. I even tried rpm --import  but that didn't help either. This began after a fresh install of Mandrake 9.2 (was running 9.0). GnuPG 1.2.3-3.1.92mdk.

I added the %signature line. The /etc/rpm-keys doesn't exist anywhere on my Adding the one line didn't help. As for /etc/rpm-keys, not sure of what to do about that. I don't even know if that'll help even if it is created.

@_subject: rpm --checksig problem 
I couldn't get to that url. I got an error message about port 443.
I modified the /etc/rpm/macros with the path to my keyring and it still don't work. I don't believe that was the problem because I downloaded rpm's from rpmfind.net that checked OK even prior to making any configuration changes. None of the rpm's from the 2 Mandrake mirrors that I used checked out OK.

Yeah, these things don't fool me anymore. But, the average Windows user hasn't got a clue.
