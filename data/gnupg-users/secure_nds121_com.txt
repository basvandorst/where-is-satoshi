@_subject: Are you hack and virus protected? 
Please do not reply to this mail as it was sent from an unattended mailbox.
BE AWARE  It seems that a lot of virus and harmful applications make it through the security net via email - WE got here, didn't we? Fortunately we are on YOUR SIDE. Natural Defence Systems is mailing you because you are either on an opt-in list or your defences appear to be a little low. If in the unlikely event you are neither, please accept our apologies - but do not ignore the fact that you may be vulnerable to external attack AT ANY TIME.
VIRUS ALERTS
What is even more unsettling than the destructive payload a virus can carry, is the fact that a virus can now alter itself to tiptoe around some traditional virus scanners. This just underlines the importance of not only having anti-virus software, but also making sure it is UP TO DATE. For example, those that have heard of the 'Love Bug' virus will remember that the damage it caused ran into the BILLIONS.
WE'RE HERE TO HELP
Natural Defence Systems needs to know if you are CONFIDENT with your current security measures, if your are - and you should be VERY sure - just fax us back to say so and we will not bother you again. If you are uncertain and would like to have a FREE, no obligation, in-depth security check, or even just a chat, just fax us this form.
WHY USE FAX?
We specify fax because we are acutely aware of the security risk and you CANNOT infect us or anyone else via a fax machine. Simply print out this message and fax it back to us.
FAX TO: 090 6664 1110. Our admin costs are built into the call. Calls cost maximum of £1
