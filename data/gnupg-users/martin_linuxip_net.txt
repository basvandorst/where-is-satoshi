Hash: SHA1
 : I've got a bunch of directories in /tmp that are like this:
 :
 : and so on, about 25 all together. What is their purpose and can  : they be safely removed? What is the purpose of the S.gpg-agent  : socket file that is 0 bytes?
Look for other UNIX sockets on your system.  They should also have a filesize of 0 bytes [0].  There are probably better scripts than the attached for cleaning up the temporary socket files, but this will do the trick.  When you fire up gpg-agent, it creates a new mode 0700 directory in which to store the socket itself.
When gpg-agent is allowed to exit gracefully, it should clean up its sockets (see atexit handler called cleanup in gpg-agent.c).

@_subject: how to create a symmetric cipher 
Hash: SHA1
Greetings Wei Wu,
 : Well, my ultimate goal is to encrypt data, but I don't want to  : use passphrase to do it as I believe it is not secure enough.
 :  : So my questions are:
 :  : 1. How to create a symmetric key or cipher? With that, I may use  :    another tool to encrypt/decrypt.
 :  : 2. Can gpg be used to do key based encryption? Not passphrase  :    based.
There is a utility (outside of the GnuPG family of encryption tools) called aespipe [0], which is very handy for exactly the above sort of tasks.  This tool can be used with 1, 64 or 65 encryption keys, which themselves are protected using GnuPG's public key cryptographic mechanisms.  So, your stream of data is encrypted with (for example) randomly* generated encryption keys, which themselves are encrypted using your conventional public key cryptography.
I wrote a wrapper script [1] (which has never been audited), which makes aespipe a touch more friendly to use on the command line.
Best of luck,
- -Martin
  *  Beware the wonderful word "random" when speaking to those who      are professionally engaged in cryptography.

@_subject: ANN: pine-gpg-filter: another pine + GPG filter utility 
Hash: SHA1
Greetings GnuPG and Pine users,
I'm announcing a newly developed pine and gpg wrapper utility, which accommodates encryption, clear-signing, decryption and verification, specifically integrated with pine to handle multiple roles.  I am releasing pine-gpg-filter [0] under the GPL.
I have been using gpg and pine for many years.  Until recently, I found the functionality of the pinepg package [1] adequate.  Now, however, I am using multiple roles from the same pine session with increasing frequency.
  Brief description
  =================
  The distinguishing characteristic of this package (when
  compared against similar pine and gpg wrappers) is its ability
  to handle multiple roles or identities automatically (i.e.
  different keys for different email addresses). Unlike some of
  the other pine and gpg wrappers, this one performs no
  passphrase caching (consider using gpg-agent in gnupg2).
Once I started using roles within pine a bit more extensively, I found the integration of pine role and key ID management more difficult.  Thus was born another pine and gpg wrapper script (see links below for a collection of other such tools).
The utility is available as a tarball, source RPM and noarch RPM, and I welcome any feedback or bug reports.

@_subject: Upgrade from 1.0.4 to 1.4.6 
Hash: SHA1
Greetings Scott,
 : Can anyone help with an upgrade from 1.0.4 to 1.4.6 on AIX.  We  : have installed the new version, but are running into issue with  : the keys on the existing key rings.  We are getting errors that  : gpg is questions whether the keys actual belongs to the person  : named in the user ID.  We have run the --rebuild-keydb-caches,  : but are still getting that error.  Can anyone provide some input  : on what we need to do to fix this issue?
It has been several years since I performed the update from the 1.0.4 series to the 1.2.X series (or was it 1.0.6?), but I recall encountering a problem very similar to yours when moving keys from the 1.0.4 series.
I believe that you'll want to make sure you have trusted the key   shell$ gpg --edit-key "$KEYID"
  Command> trust
  Command> 5      # -- for ultimate trust of the identified key
  Command> y      #    yes, you want to ultimately trust this key
  shell$ gpg --update-trustdb   # -- not strictly required
Then try using the key again.
Good luck,
- -Martin
