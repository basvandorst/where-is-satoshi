Dear Sir,
I have a question to ask about gnupg.
Currently I am doing to create a Gnupg for Tandem OSS. I downloaded the
source codes from your site and compile them.
I made some changes to pass the compiler. Now it runs ok in OSS and can
create, import, export keys.
What I found is that I couldn't import keys between Mingw32 version (PC) and
Unix version (OSS).
The error message is "a missing self-signature" "User id not found". That means the public keys created in OSS only be exchanged in OSS, not even
for OpenPGP.
Any your opinion is appreciated.

Recently I uploaded Gnupg1.0.6 to Tandem OSS system, and compiled them.
I can run gpg in OSS  for encryption and decryption.
I installed same version of gpg in my PC. I test them together.
What I found is that I couldn't import and export public keys between them. The error message is " user id not valid, this may be caused by missing
I use the command to print MD for same key for MD5 and SHA1. The results are different too.
Now I was lost totally.  Any hel is appreciated.
