I'm trying to install gpgme-1.3.0. But now I get an error with the make
*Error: *

Anyone know what this could be? And even better how to solve this?

I installed the libgpg-error the same day (libgpg-error-1.10). So its the
latest version I guess. Also I'm trying to install it on Linux Suse.
I installed in this order:
- libgpg-error-1.10 (Went OK)
- libassuan-2.0.1 (Went OK)
- gpgme-1.3.0 (ERROR)

Im having problems migrating from version 1.2.4 to 2.0.9
I have transfered all my keys from the old envirmoment to the new
enviroment. Now our applications can't use the api in the software to
decrypt a file anymore. The passphrase does not work any more. If I want to
remove the passprase I get this error:
You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: ...........
2048-bit RSA key, ID 182D0209, created 2011-03-30
can't connect to `/home/user/.gnupg/S.gpg-agent': No such file or directory
gpg-agent[22946]: command get_passphrase failed: Operation cancelled
gpg: cancelled by user
Can't edit this key: General error
How can I fix this?

Im running Linux Redhat. The current version come with the installation of
the OS.
But is seems we have now problems with the agent process. We could decrypt
data when I imported the key but now not at all. And when I tried to run the
socket (agent) process we crashed the complete server and we had to
hard shut-down it.
Is it not possible to not use the agent?
We also now trying to create a key on our production server and also this
giving problems.  It hangs when you have to type random letters after the
password prompt.
