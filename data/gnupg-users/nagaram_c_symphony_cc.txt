@_subject: gpg encryption failed no public key 
I am new to gpg command line utility for file encryption/decryption. I have
installed gpg4win v 2.0.2 & trying to encrypt a file with a key that I
imported which is also listing while typing list-keys command
The issue is that I am getting encryption failed no public key while typing
in the below command
In one of the posts I found that this is due to not specifying keyring
location with using -keyring option
But while I used below command with specifying keyring as below
Settings/username/Application Data/gnupg/pubring.gpg -encrypt abc.txt
I am getting below error
gpg: keyblock resource 'C:/Documents & Settings/username/Application
Data/gnupg/C:/Documents' no such file or directory
usage: gpg [options] [filename]
Please help

Thanks for the response, the command
I used has double dashes still I gives the same error.
I think I am using the default keyring as I didn't change its location -----Original Message-----

The first command isn't working because you need to double-dash the
options.  "--recipient" and "--encrypt".
You really shouldn't need the -keyring option if you're using your
default keyring.  But for the option to work, you would need quotes
around the filename since it has spaces in it.

I figured out the issue....
Need to sign the key after it is imported.
