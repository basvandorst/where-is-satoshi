GnuPG uses hkps://hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net as the default dirmnger key server. But this domain does not exist. From  I see no server in the pool supports hkps. I wonder if this is the reason for the non-existence of the domain.
I understand that user can always use --keyserver option to specify a working key server. I'm just asking if we should change the default value, if it is not working anymore.

Thanks. Good to know that it is just a temporary issue and me being unlucky.
