@_subject: RfC 2440 Signature Types and Web Of Trust 
Hello *,
reading the GnuPG documentation and sikimming through the source I
found that, while signing Keys support RfC 2440 Signature Types 0x10
to 0x13[0] the Web Of Trust management doesn't take the Signature Type
into account.
Is that true, or am I missing something?
Is there any way of making use of Signature Types with GnuPG other
than just displaying them?
[0] As described in RfC 2440, Section 5.2

Thanks for the insightful reply.  --min-cert-level seems to be what I
were missing...  ;-)

It isn't part of the standard GNU Emacs distribution yet, but it is
part of GNU Emacs CVS, and will be part of GNU Emacs 22.

Disclaimer: as suggested in rule c) I did _not_ look at the app files an
therefore did not verify my theory.
Here is my idea:
The signature provided is a text mode signature, therefore CRLF and LF
are handles the same and all files only differing by these sorts of
line breaks match the same signature.  Even worse: the used type of
line break doesn't have to be consistent within one file.
Proof of concept:
The attached files (using my favorite language) both match the same
textmode signature (attached for reference, too) but yield different

True.  So it seems that whitespace[0] programs are the ideal target for
forged signatures of this kind...
From your POC:
  appname=`basename "$0"`
  if [ "$appname" == "app4.sh" ]; then
Actually this was my very first thought when reading the riddle, too.
But Bernhard told me that it is not the solution and that he would
considers this a breach of "do not depend on external factors" (part of
rule b) ).
Maybe it should have been added to the description, that the two app
files differ (have different md5sums).

Sweet!  Sure enough I had to write a version in common lisp, which I
attached (including sig of cause).
New features/changes in the lisp implementation:
1. It's a real quine -- so it generates its source in stead of copying
   from the source-file.
2. Instead of printing a simple string the generated app can execute any
   arbitrary lisp form.  :-)
Ok, here is the usage example:
wilde at kenny% sbcl --noinform --no-userinit --load app-generator.lisp >app2.lisp
(dotimes (n 10) (format t "~a~%" n))
wilde at kenny% sbcl --noinform --no-userinit --load app2.lisp
And of cause one sig fits all:
wilde at kenny% gpg2 --verify app-generator.lisp.sig app-generator.lisp
gpg: Signature made Sat Jan 26 19:55:27 2008 CET using DSA key ID 69115024

gpg: Good signature from "Sascha Wilde "
gpg:                 aka "Sascha Wilde "
And here are the files:
