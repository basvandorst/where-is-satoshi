@_subject: ow to create secret key stub 
Good time of day,
I have a smart card, which I successfully use on the computer I first
initialized it on.
I have another computer, and I want to use my smart card on this one too.
The question: how do I create secret key stub for my existing smart card key
on new computer?
Thank you in advance!
