This is a bit off-topic but is there a easy way in Gnome, to encrypt and decrypt files by a double click or a right click?
I have a lot of encrypted files and going to the terminal everytime ...

@_subject: GNupg not working on tru64 
We have installed gnupg-1.0.7.Tru64-v5.1A on a HP True 65  5.1 and it won't encrypt, it starts but never ends.
We have tried precompiled sources, compiled the source itselve but the result is always the same.
I don't seem to find a random_seed file coud this be the problem?
I have the idee that gnupg is something missing.
