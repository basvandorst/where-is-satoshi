@_subject: Encrypt with public key from stdin/file possible? 
I have a public key of a recipient in ASCII or binary form and would
like to feed gpg w/o importing it first in its public keyring and
afterwards specify the ID of the public key. According to my
researches on the net and on the gnupg.org site, there's no way to do
this though.
Can anyone confirm this?
Kind regards,
