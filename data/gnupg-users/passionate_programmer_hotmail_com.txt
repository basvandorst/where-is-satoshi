@_subject: Why GnuPG encrypted file has no icon? 
When you encrypt multiple files in a folder, GnuPG encrypted files have no icon. It is difficult to immediately identify which are the encrypted files.
Any specific reason why encrypted files have no icon?

I am using Windows 7. Icons are there on all files. What I actually meant is when a file is encrypted with GnuPG, the resultant .pgp file has no icon.

I don't know which operating system you are using here, but icons are usually set for files that have known data types or file extensions.  It has to do with your operating system or desktop environment not GnuPG.  Apparently your operating system (probably Windows) does not have icons assigned for these types of files.
Hope that is helpful.

I guess .asc extension is only when you select "ASCII Armor" option. If you don't select this option it is .pgp.
Not sure.
I tried "Open With", but don't know which .exe to select to associate .pgp extension.

If Windows has an application associated with the file extension, the
file will be shown with that application's icon. And double-clicking
the file will cause that application to perform a default action on
that file, for example double-clicking a .txt file on a Windows
machine will usually open the file using Notepad.
You could try right-clicking one of your .gpg files and selecting
"open with", keeping the "always use this app" box ticked, click "more
apps", and select GnuPG. (It might show as "GnuPG's OpenPGP Tool".)
Not sure why you get .pgp files; I get .asc.

@_subject: RSA 4096-bit Key 
I am using latest version of GPG. I noticed there is no option to generate RSA 4096-bit key. The same goes with DSA.
In older versions of GnuPG, this key size was supported.

@_subject: GnuPG vs. GPG4Win 
In Older versions of GnuPG, a system tray icon used to appear with an option to encrypt text on current window.
Newer versions of GnuPG has no such option.
I am not understanding the difference between GnuPG and GPG4Win. Are these one and the same thing?
Windows binary is not available for download from GnuPG site.

I downloaded the second item from the link you provided. It has no front-end and the readme file says it can be run only from command-line.

That would come from some frontend or Explorer plugin, not from GnuPG
GPG4win is GnuPG 2.0.x bundled with a choice of certificate managers,
plugins for Outlook and Windows Explorer, and the Gpg4win Compendium
documentation. They also have "light" and "vanilla" downloads that
eschew some or all of the extras.
Windows binaries for GnuPG versions 2.1.x and 1.4.x are the second and
third items listed at .
The first list item points you to the GPG4win download page.
