@_subject: One Private Key for several users 
Hi all
Is there any other way of using one and the same private-key by several
users, except exporting the priv-key?
We are decrypting some csv-files on a virtual machine. and it's for us not
so appropriate to share private-key through exporting. maybe there is a way
out, like giving/taking the right to/from the group of windows users to
decrypt the files.
If someone knows from you, would be very thankful. any help is also
thanks you in advance,
lema (new to GPG/PGP)

thank you all very much.
i'll follow the way from NdK. if it not works, than i set a right for users
to the folder with decrypted files. but to decrypt the files, there is one
account with which priv-key is created and with which they log in to
virtual machine (win2008) to decrypt files.. i do not see any other
solution, do you..
best regards,

hi guys
i am just beginning using gpg/pgp, so my apologies in advance for my
confusions. i've read and tried several times to encrypt csv files with a
private-key, and to decrypt them back with public key.
actually, these different csv files should be encrypted by several
different users, and sent to only one mail-adress. there are also several
other users on a virtual machine, who should be able to decrypt them. we
have to do these with private-public-key case.
What i now did is, i created a key-pair, have sent public-key to those, who
will encrypt files. i am able to decrypt these files with my private-key.
the problem is, i only can decrypt the files.
is it possible to do it in any other way, but using also priv-pub-key? i am
like stuck..
I appreciate any of your help and suggestion,

Hi Werner
let's say, user_1 created public-private-key_1. then senders should encrypt
it with public-key_1 but for all user_1, user_2, etc.
with which private key will user_2, user_3,.. decrypt this file.csv, which
is encrypted with public-key_1?
thanks in advance

It is not appropriate for us to have several public-private-keys.
Can GnuPG be downloaded on a virtual machine so, that, if one user on VM
generates a pair-key, this pair-key will be also the keys of other user of
this VM? So they all will be able to decrypt files using one private-key..?
How to set it like that, if this is possible.

hi Diego
We need encryption, because  the files are sent via Email from other
organisations. These files are then decrypted internally, that's why
all/several Win-Users of us.

i've made this robot: it receives mail, decrypts files with my private-key,
and saves them in a folder. But, someone should click on run.. This is me
only. i need, that some others will be able to run it also. But it doesn't
decrypt files, as the priv-key for decryption is mine.

@_subject: Generating/Exporting under another user-account(Log on as a batch job 
hi all
I have to generate a key-pair using another user-account (which is given
right in local security settings to log on as a batch job) and export its
public key.
i did generate on windows cmd, but after i taped the passphrase, cmd window
just dissappeared. and if i type to list keys, a window appears and closes
immediately, so fast that i can't read what it writes.
What would you suggest, ho can i see what it did and which keys it has
under this another user?
Any of your help is appreciated, thanks in advance.

hi Henry,
i followed your suggestions, i tried to open kleopatra under another
username (using runas) on command-line, but it doesn't open it. i wrote the
exact path to kleopatra.
i tried also gpg2 --list-keys, didn't help. i can't write pause, where i
shoul. i am not using BAT-file, i am directly running gpg in pub folder of
but what i could do is, to generate keys under this another username. but
the window at the end disappears.
under my own username i can open kleopatar, which is in main folder GnuPG.
but under another user it doesn't.
pls help asap,
thanks in advance

Could you please help me, how i *silently* generate key-pair, and import
other's public key and then certify this public key on command-line of
windows(cmd.exe)? i mean, setting all as default, and asking only for

or is it possible to import and certify someones public-key without

@_subject: unattended signing key 
I am writing a batch file, where i install gpg4win, generate keys, import
public key, and sign it. Could anyone help me, how i silently(unattended)
sign imported public-key?
i did edit the key, fpr, signed it but it is asking my passphrase.
or should i generate my secret-public-key without passphrase? i need just
encrypt files with someone's public-key sent me through email. which kind
of key should i generate for my own to do that?
Appreciate your answers.
