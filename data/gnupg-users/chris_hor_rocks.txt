@_subject: Key expiration question 
I have a question around key expiry that I can't seem to find any thorough documentation on; & the  twitter account pointed me here.
What purpose does key expiration have?
At first I thought it may be a mechanism for revalidating private key ownership but key expiration doesnt appear to impact on trust or validity. So I thought it may be a mechanism for time constraining key use but there doesnt appear to be anything in the RFC to mandate the handling (or not as the case may/should be) of expired keys.
Have I completely misunderstood?
