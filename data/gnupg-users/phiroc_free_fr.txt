@_subject: Using an old .gnupg directory 
I recently reinstalled cygwin from scratch on my Windows machine, after copying
the .gnupg directory and its contents to an USB key. Now, I would like to
decrypt files encrypted with the private key in that .gnupg directory, in my new
cygwin installation. Obviously, I should copy the .gnupg directory to my new
home directory. But what should I do next?
Many thanks.
