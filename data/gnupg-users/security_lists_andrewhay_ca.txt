I just started messing around with gnupg and was wondering what I'm supposed to attach to the bottom of my email?  Is it the:
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: GnuPG v1.0.6 (GNU/Linux)
Comment: For info see -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
part or is it something else?
Also, would I just enclude the key in my signature or what?  (i'm using Mozilla 1.0 if that makes a difference).
