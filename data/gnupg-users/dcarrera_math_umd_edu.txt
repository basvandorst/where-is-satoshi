Hash: SHA1
IDEA is an algorithm, not a program.  Plus, IDEA is patented.
However, you can install gnupg on your computer to get strong encryption.  GnuPG does not provide the IDEA algorithm because of the patent, but it provides several others that are about equally secure.
I would suggest that you install WinPT which is a graphical interface for GnuPG under Windows:
Hope that helps,

Ooops, sorry.  I just realized that you are using GPG already.  I just re-read your email and now I understand what you mean.
Sorry for the confusion.
I think that what you are asking is how to get GPG to use the IDEA algorithm.  I know that this is possible, but I don't know how.   Sorry for the

Hello all,
I've been looking at ING, and I think that they should be using GPG.  ING is a huge bank, but they deal with their customers entirely through the phone or the Their website says that personal account information can only be given over the phone because email is not secure.
I want to suggest they use GPG, but honestly I'm not sure how they'd go about doing that.  Authenticating the user is not a problem.  They can ask for a physical letter with my fingerprint and physical signature (which they have on file) and then have me phone them, authenticate myself, and then verify the signature over the phone.
The problem lies in how the user would authenticate ING.  Would ING have a corporate-wide GPG key?  You can't just have a single common passphrase for every employee in the bank.  And they can't have a different key for every employee, since that would be an authentication nightmare for users.
Does GPG have a solution for this kind of problem?  Is there a way to have a corporate signature?
If there is one, I will send a suggestion to ING.

Uhm... it is likely to be *more* secure than email:
  -  Snail mail is much more difficult to scan en-masse than email.
  -  I don't know if it's 4 digits, but even if it is, the fact that they
     have to be pressed by a person makes a brute-force attack difficult.
This doesn't make phone baking secure.  It makes it less insecure than email.
So, the decision is somewhat sensible.  But clearly, GPG would be much better.
The thing about ING is that they have almost no branches anywhere.  The whole point of ING is that they have minimal infrastructure, which allows them to save money, and so they can offer better rates.
This is why they do everything through either the phone or the internet.  This is also why I think that GPG would be great for them.
I think I'll write to them.  I just need to put some thought into the email, and ideally find someone who can make a decision.

Yeah, I know what you mean.  It'd be good to have your voice there too.
I'm also trying to find the most effective way to do this.  For once, I've been speaking of ING because they have a much greater interest than any other bank.
Most banks can argue that for secure information people should just come to the branch.  ING doesn't have any branches, it's 100% on-line, so it makes sense that they be at the "fore-front" of on-line security.  That's why I want to talk to them in particular.
I also want to find the most appropriate person I can reach.  I don't want just write to some low-level underling who has no decision power and no interest in this sort of thing.
We'll see.

Yes, it's the same ING.  I was exagerating when I said they didn't have any branches.  Of course they do, but they have very few.
ING is one of the largest banks in the world.  Their selling point is that they have minimal infrastructure.  Therefore, they have very few expenses and so they
can offer a better deal to their customers.
For example, they only have four branches in all of Canada.
ING is from The Netherlands.  That's probably why you see more branches there.

@_subject: Diminished Disk Space after running file encryption 
Hash: SHA1
This definitelly has the looks of a swap file problem.  That's not the same thing as a temp file.  The swap file is used when you run out of RAM As for why you can't find it.  I'm not sure that the swap file shows up in the Windows file system.
Notice, I'm not entirely familiar with Windows and swap files.  I'm more used to Linux and swap partitions (a swap partition won't change size and it is optimized for swapping).  Therefore, you should take my comments with a grain of salt.
You cannot delete the swap file.  Nor would you want to.  You need it for the extra memmory.  I think that there's a way to set a maximum size for the swap file.  I'm not sure how.  Maybe someone else does.  This should help.  I guess you can try to free-up some space on your computer, or you can zip the file before encrypting it.
Sorry I can't help much.

How is that different from what gpg currently does?
GnuPG compresses files before encrypting them to reduce redundancy.

Sure you can.  You can create a TAR archive :)
Serisouly now, no I don't think you can archive with gpg.  I think that gpg uses gzip, which doesn't do archives.  If you encrypted archives you'd use gpg combined with tar in exactly the same way that people use tar combined with gzip to make compressed archives.

I'm been trying to learn about "how secure" some encryption algorithms are, but I haven't found what I want.  Perhaps someone can point me to a I'm most interested in Blowfish, IDEA and RSA because I understand that they are the most powerful and on DSA and ElGamal as I understand that they are used by GPG.
I want to get an idea of the computing power needed to break those.  As well as any other security concerns that I should be aware of.  I am a mathematecian, I'm not afraid of doing some calculations to get the answers I want.

Does the information here also apply equally to GnuPG?
The FAQ says that GnuPG is OpenPGP-compliant, so I guess it does.

Greetings all,
I want to create my key-pair.  I've done this before, but I have a couple of questions:
1) What key size should I pick for the asymmetric key?
The OpenPGP FAQ (
says that 2048 bits is best, but the GnuPG default is 1024.  Why is that?
2) The GnuPG FAQ says that I can improve the random number generation by using the  --enable-static-rnd=... option, but GnuPG doesn't seem to recognize that option.
I'm on a Solaris system which does have a /dev/random device.
Thanks for the help,

I guess I'll need to recompile.  If that is the case, how should I use that option in my case?  I'm on a Solaris system but it has a /dev/random like Linux.  Does that mean I should use --enable-static-rnd=linux ?

Yes, I'm on Unix.  I'm not really familiar with revision control.  At least, not beyond using CVS a few times.
Tell me if I understand RCS correctly:
RCS would keep track of all changes made over a period of time.  So I could bring my keyring back to a previous keyring with the old password.
Did I get it right?
In that case, doesn't that miss the point of changing the passphrase?
Since my hard drive would still contain a copy of my keyring with the old Or... can I use RCS along with some removable media?
Where can I learn about RCS?
Thanks a lot.
