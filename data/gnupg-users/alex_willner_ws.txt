Hash: SHA256
Dear (OS X) GnuPG users,
since Werner suggested to post a short explanation to this list and users asked why the GPGTools are not linked at gnupg.org:
As you might know different (GUI based) software packages are needed to use OpenPGP on OS X. Some of them are no longer developed, were updated years ago or fixed versions could be found in user forums and similar sources. In conjunction with their authors, we, the GPGTools Project Team, started to update some applications and established an infrastructure for all GnuPG related OS X software. Including but not limited to:
 * MacGPG2 - author: Benjamin Donnachie.
 * GPGMail - former author: St?phane Corth?sy.
 * GPG Keychain Access - new author: Roman Zechmeister.
At  we provide an all-in-one (un-)installer and a web page for each project that links to:
 * Signed binaries including installer, uninstaller, and beta versions / release candidates.
 * The git source repository, license files, and wiki pages.
 * An unified issue/ticket system.
 * A single mailing list and twitter account.
 * The change log, including an app cast news feed and partly Sparkle integration.
Some questions you might have could already be answered in our FAQ at  Please do not hesitate to get in touch with us: Best regards, Alex
on behalf of the GPGTools Project Team

@_subject: OpenPGP and iOS / JS 
Dear list,
I just read the headings "Gpg for iPhone or iPad" and "checking gpg-signatures in JavaScript" in the archive - so I've decided to join this list.
I also wanted to use OpenPGP on iOS so I decided to have a look what is possible in JavaScript. I think it is generally possible (with some limitations) to use OpenPGP on any device using modern web browser features. So this page might be interesting for you and if you've fun in doing some development: a prototype and some unit tests are available.
Best regards, Alex
