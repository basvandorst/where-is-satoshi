You could also search  to see if there are keysigning events in your area (e.g., through your local Linux Users Group), or if you can find an individual who will meet with you one-on-one.

it's good that you're having fun and psyched on GnuPG, but to go through
with a key-signing, the Kurt persona won't cut it. You'll have to create
a key associated with your real name, so you can offer up an acceptable
photo ID with that name during the meeting.

@_subject: public key different between keyserver and exported file 
Hash: SHA512
I just created a new primary key and subkeys, and uploaded them to
keyservers. Then I exported my public key in ascii-armor, and copied
that file to my website. I noticed that the very last few characters
were different from what the keyservers had. Each version begins the
same, but somewhere they end up different. Did I mess something up?
Should I be worried about this?
You can compare the two here:
At the top of this link is my uploaded public key:
(It is also different at pgp.mit.edu, and at
The public key as I exported it from the command line is here:
Any help would be appreciated.

Hash: SHA512
I'm now confused about creating a separate subkey for encrypting, as
opposed to creating one keypair that signs and encrypts. The example
I've seen around is that if you're set up the subkey way and the police
demand the private part of your key, you don't have to sacrifice your
primary key, which carries all your signatures. (I hope I said that
Well, I understood that as meaning I would have separate passphrases for
the subkey and the primary key: Apparently, that's not possible. So then
how would this police scenario play out? If supposing then that TSA or
some entity forces me to give up my passphrase for decryption purposes,
then I've compromised everything, no?
Trying and thinking,

Oh, okay. Thank you for clearing that up; I tried searching and found nothing close to addressing this.

Gnupg-users --
I apologize for the double posting of this question. I originally sent it using Nabble, but while waiting for post approval I deleted and canceled them. Then I signed up for the list and posted them directly.
I assume that one more question of mine will be double-posted, too. Sorry.

Hah, good point. And should it ever come down to that, I hope access to a lawyer is possible (and worthwhile) at that point. But both your and Matt's suggestions are good to have in the playbook. The border trick is a pretty good precaution (groan).

Ah, and there's the fatal flaw -- not the part about "civilized"
countries, but simply "country." Airport immigration and customs is
viewed as outside the borders, a middle ground where the laws of the
destination nation don't apply.

I said it's "viewed as." It's an interpretation and being taken
advantage of as such. I might've tended toward hyperbole and implied an
uncivilized Wild West of airports, but for some specific instances, yes,
basic expected rights are sometimes no longer operable pre-entry.
For instance, in the U.S., if a non-citizen is being questioned about
entry status, he or she is not entitled to have an attorney present. (A
U.S. citizen is, for any questioning.) Yet, if a noncitizen is detained
in the city, he can have a lawyer present for questioning by police.

@_subject: info in sigs, comments and header 
Hash: SHA512
I have a question about style, etiquette, and practicality with
disseminating GnuPG info in an email. Hope this question isn't too
silly, but I assume that over years of use,  general customs have
developed, and I have no idea what they are.
Is there any customary practice for including GnuPG/PGP information in
an email -- whether to put it in your sig file, or in the comments of
your GnuPG signature? Is it  useful (or preferred) to have the GnuPG
version in the GnuPG signature comment, or frowned on to use/not use the
comment from Enigmail or FireGPG?
I'm playing around with my email sig now, wondering what to include, but
aiming for something short, useful and not redundant or "tacky." It
feels silly to put my keyID and a URL to my public key there and also
have it tucked away nicely in the header, but who looks in headers? (For
all I know, having that in header information is useful for other
people's spam filters.) I had a link to my public key in the GnuPG
signature comment, but then just moved it to my sig. I made a DSA
signing key partly because I wanted a relatively short signature, so I
thought it was better to leave that block mess as short as possible. I
didn't include a fingerprint, figuring instead to put that on new
business cards.
I did do a search for this, and the best I found dealt mainly with forum
postings and lists:
What are your practices for this? Is anything seen as useless or gauche?

Sorry for the confusion. Clarity is good, yes, but what I was saying is
that practicality is good, too. Add to the disjointed subject areas the
legal protections that people are going to get. Those could differ
because some areas are unwritten as law or regulation, or various
interpretations of existing law have not been fully tested in court.
I wasn't trying to push my politics. I was just highlighting that a gray
area could exist, and that this kind of interpretation is not limited to
whether a country is civilized or not.

No worries, man, I understood you. I actually omitted from my last post
"and not all border guards are the same."
