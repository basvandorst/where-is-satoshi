@_subject: Can't remove 'lock' 
I'm new to using GnuPG, and I am getting a puzzling error.
I can list the keys with no trouble, but if I
try anything else, I get this error:
This continues indefinitely. It sounds to me like
it somehow thinks another copy of gpg locked the
keyrings somehow. In the manual and FAQ, I can't find
locks anywhere, let alone how to remove them.
Does anyone know the fix for this?

@_subject: Can't send complete key to servers 
Hash: SHA1
I have a public key which includes an image (like the copy of Phil Zimmerman's key which is distributed with PGP).  The key was made with GnuPG 1.0.4.  I have no trouble using it under PGP 7.0.3 or GnuPG 1.0.4, and if I hand or email the *.asc file to someone, they get the picture as well.
The problem is that when I 'send' to a server, or cut and paste, the server takes the key without complaint,  but then when I download the key later, it appears without the image. I've tried this from PGP's GUI, GPG's command line, Geheimnis's GUI, cut and paste, and to four or five servers.
If you download Zimmerman's key, you get one WITHOUT an image. So it is not clear if the OpenPGP protocol supports it.
Is there a way to put keys on a server so that people get them with the picture?  If the protocol allows it, then what am I doing wrong?

Thanks for the clarification. The public keys returned by the server do not have any invalid signatures in them, so far as I can tell.
Is there any discussion of Photo ID or Biometric ID becoming part of a future

@_subject: Format of signed-and-encrypted documents 
This is a fairly detailed question of how GnuPG, and the OpenPGP standard, does the sign-and-encrypt operation.
Suppose we designate the following symbols:
m: my message
p: your public key
q: my secret key
e(m, p): encryption of my message m to your public key p
s(m, q): signature operation, on message m using my secret key q
[m|n]: the concatenation of two messages
Does the 'sign-and-encrypt' option sign the message,
then encrypt both the message and the signature together,
or does is simply output the encrypted message and the
signature side by side?
That is, does the standard specify
     e( [ m | s ( m, q ) ], p)
     [ e(m,p) | s(m,q) ] And where could I find an explanation of why it was done one way rather than the other?
Thanks in advance!

@_subject: Semi-off-topic - Netiquette ? 
My two cents worth:
I also think it is worthwhile to include one's key ID, if only to let people know you participate in and support such things.
Signing early emails is not intrusive or obfuscating (as would be encrypting them) - but signing w/o posting your public key somewhere obvious defeats the purpose.  Some people (e.g. Lionel) post the key on their own website, which leads to follow on Netiquette question:

@_subject: Q: gpg on windows w/ removable media 
Andy et al,
I do this on Linux, by having a soft link from ~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg to the corresponding thing on the floppy (similarly for secring). But if you modify either one, it overwrites the link and you have to copy it over by hand.
The question is how to establish a softlink in Windows. Will a simple 'shortcut' do the trick?
NB: having the secret ring on a write-protected, removable floppy appears to be a good protection against the recent Czech attack.

@_subject: Kmail and gpg freeze 
I've encountered the same. The problem is that KMail waits on gpg, until gpg returns from a search of your favorite server. So, to be literal, KMail is not 'freezing', just 'waiting'. Killing gpg is one way to end the wait; waiting a few minutes until gpg times out is another.
Having KMail run gpg in the background would be a better solution - but that goes to the KMail mailing list!

@_subject: discussion on increasing amount of gpg signatures... 
Johan et al:
The "web of trust" is not meant to determine honesty, reliability, discretion, etc.   It is meant to be a web of certifications that the keys
are actually in use by those who appear to be using them. The difference: I may know with absolute certainty that the key belongs
to John Doe because of the web of trust. Therefore, I know with absolute
certainty that he'll blab my secret all over town as soon as he knows it - because he really is the John Doe whom I distrust.
