@_subject: verify CHV1 failed - not able to sign 
Hi all,
I just figured out, that I am not able to sign with my OpenPGP
fellowship smartcard any more. The error message is:
    gpg: signatures created so far: 274
    gpg: verify CHV1 failed: invalid passphrase
    gpg: signing failed: invalid passphrase
    gpg: signing failed: invalid passphrase
I don't know what the problem is as the card worked quite well the last
weeks without any problems. En- and decrypting files is working without any problems.
Here on the machine GnuPG 1.4.2rc1 is installed.
I am running Debian sarge. And the only change I can think of was
running aptitude update and upgrade during the last days. Thank you,

Hi Wolfgang,

Hello Werner,
* Werner Koch  [2006-01-02 15:01:45 +0100]:
Yes, that was the problem:
    PIN retry counter : 0 3 3
I unblocked it and now it works again. Thank you very much,

Hi Adrian,
* Adrian Friedli  [2006-04-30 16:08:07 +0200]:
have you build your own GnuPG? I had the same problem. Werner noticed,
that I've to install libusb-dev before building GnuPG. After that it
worked perfect.
Best wishes,

AFAIK the problem is, that you will loose your old sigatures.

* Dirk Zemisch  [2007-03-17 10:09:22 +0700]:
Or you can support FSFE by joining the fellowship
 and also get a OpenPGP-Smartcard which works
nice with gnupg :)
Best wishes,

Yes it is. No problem here compiling it with an ibook G4 on Debian
GNU/Linux; there are also packaged version of GnuPG for Debian.
Best wishes,

Dear Robert,
long time since you wrote this, but I did not have time to reply
earlier. * Robert J. Hansen  [2006-12-05 16:06:56 -0600]:
First of all, I would like to thank you for your e-mail. I think it is very important that we pay money for Free Software. (There
is a good article in German on
 about
this topic.)
But considering your motivation ("grateful [... to] have a Free Software
implementation of the OpenPGP protocol.") you donated your money to the
"wrong" address. IMHO you should have donated to GnuPG directly, give it
to Werner as one of the main developers or to g10code
IMO you should have another motivation to donate to the FSFs. The Free
Software Foundations are working to secure the legal, political and
social future of Free Software. That is important for all Free Software
projects and companies.
So if this work is important for you, you should support the FSFs. There
are different options for this:
In the US:
- if you want to have the focus on the US you should donate to the FSF
  in Boston (
- or become an associated member
  (also on In Europe:
- if you want to have a European focus you should donate to FSFE
  (
- or become a Fellow of FSFE (
In Latin America:
- if you want to focus on Latin America you should donate to FSFLA
  (
In India: - and the same for India (
With best wishes,

@_subject: I love Free Software: Thanks to all the GnuPG contributors 
Dear GnuPG developers and contributors, today is ?I love Free Software?-Day. A day to thank all the hard working
people behind Free Software. So instead a bug report, a feature request,
or discussing a problem today I want to thank all the people involved in
GnuPG coding and promoting.
This is for you:
Thank you! I love what you are doing!
