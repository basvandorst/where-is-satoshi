@_subject: Sylpheed can't verify signature? 
I'm still using Pine with gpg filters, because to date, I have not found a
decent mail/news client that doesn't require GNOME or KDE libraries for it
to run. A client that gives you the choice of using the underlying
toolkits such as QTK, QT or just plain Xlib would certainly be a big win
for me. Is there anything like that out there?
