I'm using gnupg 1.2.2 with gpgshell 2.81. I use idea.dll because of an issue
with one particular correspondent. I had this installed on a Windows 2000
system, where it worked well.
I've now migrated to a Windows XP (SP1) system, and re-installed there. I
now find that I can't decrypt email from that correspondent, and the error I
get is consistent with idea.dll not being installed. When I try using
regsvr32 to register idea.dll, I gett "DLLRegisterServer entry point not
Any ideas on how to fix this situation? (Apart from the obvious one of
getting my correspondent to change his RSA key, which seems to be what
causes idea.dll to be required.)

I have found the G-DATA plugin to be adequate - see
   .
I had a bit of a problem uninstalling it, but I suspect this was an Outlook
installation issue more than a plugin issue.
