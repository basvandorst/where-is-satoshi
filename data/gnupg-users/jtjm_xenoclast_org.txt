Agreed absolutely - consequently, it would be nice if there were some
option to GPG to get it to display the trust-path (based on your own
keyring) to a key it found to be valid during a --update-trustdb, so that
you could easily make a considered judgment about whether you agreed with
the proposed validity of the key.
(There are some keys five or six hops from my own that I can be
very certain are valid, since I know all the signatories en route to
be highly responsible signers, whilst there others only three hops away
that I wouldn't actually want to trust for anything more than the most
casual of correspondence, since I've no knowledge of the key signing
habits of the signatories concerned. The marginal/complete trust model and
completes-needed/marginals-needed configurables are inadequate for
dealing with this.  Making calculated trust-paths visible would making
key-ring management both easier and more flexible.
pathfinder and other keyserver keyring based solutions to the path problem
are also inadequate, since they've no knowledge of the assigned

@_subject: ^M characters are embedded at the end of every record. 
This is nothing to do with GPG; Windows (and DOS systems generally) use
CRLF to mark end of line, whereas Unix system uses LF only.  The ^M
characters you see on the Unix machine are the 'spare' CR characters that
Windows introduces.
FTP's ascii mode deals with the translation from one format to the other
automatically, but clearly can't do this for an encrypted file.  The
easiest thing to do is to strip the spurious carriage-returns on the Unix
machine post-decryption. ( tr -d '\r' < file > cleanfile )

GPG isn't the right tool for this - have a look at CryptoAPI for
encrypted filesystem (and swap, if you wish) support on GNU/Linux:

Surely the solution is to refrain from making detached signatures unless
there's a very good reason to do so?
Or if you're the recipient of a message with a detached signature, stick
the message and signature in a tarball and store that.

@_subject: Determining the trust path to a particular key 
I'm wondering if anyone has written a tool (or if gnupg itself has a means
that I've not yet discovered) to trace the complete trust path from ones'
own key to a particular key on the keyring.
Sometimes it's useful to know precisely how a particular key has come to
be marked as valid, and whilst check-sigs gives you a clue, there are
times when it would be useful to see the exact chain (without having to
perform the backtrace manually).  For example, I might want to treat a key
differently if it had been marked as valid because three marginally
trusted users had signed it (when those three users themselves were only
valid because they'd been signed by someone else who I trusted fully),
than if the key was signed directly by someone I trusted fully whose key I
had signed personally.
A '--trace-trust-path' option might produce output something like this:
mykey -> keyA(f) -> keyB(m) -+-> targetkey
mykey -> keyC(f) -> keyD(m) -+
mykey -> keyC(f) -> keyE(m) -/
Does anyone know if there is a utility to perform analysis of this
sort?  (If not, I might write one in a spare moment.)

Thanks, that's the sort of thing I was looking for, but as you say, it
would be really useful to be able to run it on your own keyring honouring
the trust levels you assign.
Since the update-trustdb algorithm for gnupg must perform all the
necessary calculations, I'd have thought that it shouldn't have been too
difficult to modify the same algorithm to trace the path to a particular
key (theoretically, anyway ;-) ).
Do you know if the source for gpg is available anywhere?
All the best,
