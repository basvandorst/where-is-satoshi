@_subject: PGPFreeware and GPG 
This has likely been answered before, but I couldn't really find anything off hand in the archive.  I was able to import a PGPfreeware 5.5.5 key
from a friend, and it would appear that I can encrypt stuff using that key.
However I cannot decrypt it, like I normally would, with my key.
gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit ELG-E key, ID 5943481D, created 1999-10-10
     <.. id omitted ..>
gpg: no secret key for decryption available
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
Is it because the key is ElGamal (sp?)  I'm of course using:
gpg (GnuPG) 1.0.4
