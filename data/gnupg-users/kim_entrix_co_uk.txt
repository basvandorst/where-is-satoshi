@_subject: GnuPG compilation on HPUX 
Warning: I am a newbie to this stuff so please be patient!
We are trying to compile GnuPG on an HP9000 system running HPUX 10.20.
Configure was run with defaults (because at the moment we don't know any better).
Make produces the following error:
Making all in mpi                                  Make: Don't know how to make mpih-mul1.lo.  Stop.  *** Error exit code 1                              Stop.                                              *** Error exit code 1                              Stop.                                              Has anyone built GnuPG on HPUX 10.20 that could give some advice on how to
get it compiled and working. I should confess that we are not C programmers or
developers so we are stumbling around somewhat.
Thanks in anticipation

Werner suggested I use GNU make. This enabled a complete compilation and
install. The next problem is that anything I do, such as trying to create a key,
brings about a "bad system call". Anyone seen this problem?

@_subject: Insecure memory error -GnuPG on HPUX 
We now have successfully compiled gnupg on our HPUX 10.20 development
system and we are having some success in our tests. Thanks to those people
who wrote back with suggestions on how to resolve some of the compilation
We are looking at two problems at the moment. One is the lack of entropy
on the HP3000 and we are struggling with the egd module. The other is something which I don't know the cause of:
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!  This message comes up when we encrypt anything. I can't find any reference to it in the docs unless it is to
do with memory guard. The configure was run with but that doesn't make any difference. Can anyone help?

Thanks to Michael Roth and Dave Harvill for responses to this. I have now setuid(root) on /usr/local/bin/gpg but the problem
still occurs unless I turn off the warning. Obviously I would rather cure the problem than the symptom. I did a chmod +s gpg from root and it now shows as -rwsr-sr-x   1 root       sys        3795476 Sep 17 15:27 gpg
but I still get the error:
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
Is it insufficient to set the bits or is there something else I need
to do during the install? The make install was done from root.

) gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!  This message tells you, that GnuPG can't lock memory pages to prevent
paging for secret data. Quote from the GnuPG manpage:
       On many  systems  this  program  should  be  installed  as
       setuid(root).  This  is  necessary  to  lock memory pages.
       Locking memory pages prevents the  operating  system  from
       writing  memory  pages to disk. If you get no warning mes-
       sage about insecure memory your operating system  supports
       locking  without being root. The program drops root privi-
       leges as soon as locked memory is allocated.
Because your OS doesn't support locking without being setuid(root) you
will see this message. Their are two was to get rid of this message:
 1.) Install GnuPG setuid(root). This will make GnuPG more secure.
 2.) Use the option --no-secmem-warning. You can use this option in
     your config file. Please note: The danger will remain that the OS
     could page secret data to the swap partition!
--enable-m-guard are only for developers. This ist to help finding memory
leaks and errors. This configure option is not for end users.
