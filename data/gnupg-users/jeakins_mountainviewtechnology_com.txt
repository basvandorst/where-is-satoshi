Thanks for the suggestion.  Yeah I checked that.  Made sure I had access to the .Exe and to the directory with the files....  In fact can replace the .EXE with a program I wrote and it ran fine.  I think I have solved the problem - althougth I don't know the cause.  I went back through the running of my program got that working and started putting the GNU Pgp program pieces back in place and it worked.  I hate it when that happens... Well I'm happy it worked, just wish I knew what was wrong in the first place.
Thanks so much for the reply...

Problem solved.... For anyone else out there the GNU PGP with works fine with ASPmail .  You can use it in place of the command line version of PGP from NAI (Much less expensive since NAI now charges 10K for their command line version - yep that is $10,0000).
Make sure you use the command line I have outlined in my original email.  Put it all in the GNUPG directory.  Hopefully I can help other folks out there with Win2000 installations.  I really support the whole GNU effort.
