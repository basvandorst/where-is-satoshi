@_subject: [offtopic] OpenGPG Smartcard with keylength >1024 
Hash: SHA1
I know this is offtopic, but I ask nonetheless, maybe someone has an idea.
The BSI recently announced that it finds RSA/1024 bits not to be
considered secure enough from the 1st of January on[1].
Now I have this really cool RSA-Smartcard (based on G10's code, fab'ed
by ppc-systems) which does 1024 bits and I'm wondering if anyone knows a
source who sells cards with, let's say, 2048 bits. PPC-Systems don't.
- From what I heard, technically it's no problem to have card with bigger
keylengths, although it might become slow - otoh they're probably more
Not that I think I should abolish everything just because they say so,
but it's worth a consideration anyway if you want to deploy a whole new PKI.

Why didn't you say that like an hour ago?
Now I'm stuck with my wife, cleaning the house... :-)
Next time... Cheers!
You're with us on Tuesday?

@_subject: Strange decryption problem (block_filter read error) 
============================== START ==============================
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
I found the problem. It's not gpg's fault but apparently
Thunderbird/Enigmail truncates attachments every now and then. Haven't
found out under what circumstances yet...
Thanks anyway ;-)

@_subject: Generic question: Correct content-type? 
Hash: SHA1
this is a more generic question. I use Thunderbird + Enigmail on several
machines. I never touched any of the advanced features and never got
problems with someone until now.
I've sent an encrypted email - as inline PGP - and my buddy's Mutt
couldn't deal with the encrypted message. My friend claims this is
because I've sending inline-PGP messages with Content-type text/plain.
He says that I need to configure my MUA so that it sends something like:
 protocol="application/pgp-encrypted";
 boundary="------------enig
- From what I know (I'm just a user when it comes to email and I bribe
students with beer to set up my sendmails) this is just used if you're
sending multipart-messages, like a plaintext and a HTML-version of the
same email.
1) Am I correct setting Content-Type text/plain?
2) If I'm wrong and need to set application/pgp-encrypted, do I need to
tell that my MUA/Enigmail or do I need to give gpg some parameters? (I
bet it's the MUA)
Thanks for considering this pretty off-topic and crappy question.. :-)
Cheers, Alex.
P.S.: I already searched the Enigmail FAQ and haven't made it yet to
other FAQs... So if it's in the GPG-FAQ, just drop me a RTFM :)

...on a related note you can just export the Email to a plaintext-file
and try to run gpg --verify manually over that file to check if it's ok.
It bet it'll be ok. If it's ok, it's a problem with Enigmail. But
upgrade Enigmail anyway.

@_subject: pcscd, FC8, enigmail and plain gpg 
I migrated from Debian to Fedora Core 8 a while ago. I'm generally using
my OpenGPG Smartcard only with Thunderbird/Enigmail, but any now and
then I want to use plain ol' gpg.
However, doesn't work.
[alex at castor ~]$ gpg --card-status
gpg: detected reader `SCM SPR 532 (21250709203493) 00 00'
gpg: pcsc_connect failed: sharing violation (0x8010000b)
gpg: card reader not available
gpg: OpenPGP card not available: general error
[alex at castor ~]$ ps -ef |grep pcsc
root      2552     1  0 17:10 ?        00:00:00 pcscd
alex      5340     1  0 18:46 ?        00:00:00 pcsc-wrapper -- 1
Hm, any idea? I couldn't find a manpage to that pcsc-wrapper so I don't
really know what that does.
