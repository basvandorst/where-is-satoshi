How can I get gpg2 to detect my smartcard? Do I have to find out what
scdaemon exactly does and how to configure it? Or is that another problem?

As far as I understand it there are no such fields. User ID is freeform,
just a string.
So feel free to put in "Key: Value" or whatever you'd like to.

@_subject: signatures using S-Trust smart card 
The S-Trust card contains two certificates: one for "qualifizierte
Signaturen" and one for "fortgeschrittene Signaturen".
I suppose that's what he is talking about.
