Not sure how to send this to the right person, so please forward if you
I noticed that `GnuPG Shell` appears to be old.?
Debian doesn't have it in it's repository, or at least I can't find it.
Best package I can find is v 1.0.0
I recommend taking it off the list of gpg front-ends.
For Linux KGpg, gpa, and seahorse still work.
