"6.6 sha2 utilities: Print or check SHA-2 digests
The commands sha224sum, sha256sum, sha384sum and sha512sum compute
checksums of various lengths (respectively 224, 256, 384 and 512 bits),
collectively known as the SHA-2 hashes..."

The question was how to obtain these values with the commands listed in
the coreutils documentation. Could point me to where you obtained these
options since they aren't listed in the gpg docs(man gpg,info gpg,
etc)? In any event, thanks.  I'll just create some scripts to alias yours to
what I was trying to use from the coreutils manual.

Oh.......I never would have made the connection.  I can see what it
refers to now but when I read it, the algorithm "ALGO" was one I had
never heard of.  Realistically, I wouldn't have caught it even if it was
written as   "--print-md  [files]" Thanks again!

Yes, and supposedly it's causing problems for support departments.   On
the other hand, if you're looking for the command to calculate sha256
and sha512 hashes, what are the odds you will be targeting words like
"ALGO"?  "HASH" maybe, but "algo"?  I'd be curious as to how many users
even know that gpg can do sha256 and sha512 hashes based on what is
written in the docs.  MD5SUM and SHA1SUM are spelled out as clear as day
in contrast to the ones I was trying to use.  I had been using other
applications to get the values.  Still, does anyone know what the coreutils docs are referring to when it
implies that sha512 hashes can be obtained with a command called
"sha512sum" in the same manner of usage as md5sum and sha1sum?
(i.e "sha512sum file")

Yes, suse 10.1 with coreutils-5.93-20.  In the info manual, sha2 is
mentioned under section 6.6 (sha2 utilities) and all it says is "The usage and options of these commands are precisely the same as for
While this isn't a linux mailing list, md5sum is part of gnupg.  The
closest other choice was the coreutils bug lists and this didn't seem
like a bug related question.  I'll take your hint and drop the topic.
