@_subject: Is it possible to keep password cached for a whole session? 
I have been told that gpg-agent keeps password cached for the session
so that I don't have to constantly enter password to unlock gpg key.
My personal experience and a little research says there is nothing
like that being done automatically by upstream. I was wondering if
anyone could shed light on it?
I could get gpg-agent to keep the keys unlocked by adding following lines.
default-cache-ttl       34560000
max-cache-ttl           34560000
I am trying to track the following bug

@_subject: Where to save passphrases? 
I am slowly getting the hang of GnuPG. I was wondering once you have a
working setup where do you save your passphrases of your master and
multiple subkeys. Is it safe to use some soft of password manager? Not
really ideal but I use LastPass.

Do you not need to set different passphrase for each subkey?
If it is just one passphrase than I could probably remember it myself
considering it will be used for several sensitive purposes.

@_subject: Where to save passphrases? 
Is using some single-sign-on method, like keychain or pam, to keep gpg
passphrase cached in gpg-agent for the length of user session, so that
one doesn't have to enter gpg key passphrase every time one is sending
an email, considered a common practice? Or does that again fall in
risky behavior category?

I use those for an arbitrary 400 days to keep passphrases cached the
whole session.
I have been reading up on GnuPG but I haven't found good articles on
safe practices and workflow. So that is why I had start a discussion

I might simply delete existing ~/.gnupg folder from the new install and copy my presonal ~/.gnupg folder next time I have to do, like it says on several

@_subject: ssh-add -l like command in gpg 
Is there a way to tell if a GPG key's passphrase is cached or not? Just like ssh-add -l prints all the keys that are in current keychain ready to be used.

As long as ssh-add -l shows a ssh key, it doesn't ask for passphrase, at least that has been my experience. gpg -K shows list of secret keys which does ask for passphrase.

@_subject: Keeping .gnupg folder in cloud 
What are your views on keeping .gnupg folder in cloud? I am working on
a threefold backup system - a local external drive, a local nas server
and a third-party cloud service like S3/CrashPlan. Backup will be
fully encrypted client side. My plan is to avoid complexity by backing
up everything in home folder which would include .gnupg folder by
default. My threat level is non-existent. I use encryption and GPG as
a matter of good internet and security practices and not because of
necessity. What do you guys think?

Looks like there is consensus in not uploading .gnupg folder in cloud.

@_subject: Kleopatra Ultimate trust CA Cert Signing Authority 
I am not sure if this is related to GnuPG but searching for following text takes me to, from what I understand, a GnuPG commit [1].
Kleopatra keeps asking following.
Do you ultimately trust
"CN=CA Cert Signing Authority
 OU=http:\x2f
 O=Root CA
 EMail=support at cacert.org
to correctly certify user certificates?
