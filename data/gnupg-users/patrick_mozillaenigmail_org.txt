This should not happen. Enigmail wraps the text and then signs it -- at
least if you didn't ignore the warning messages (they only appear 3 times).
Maybe you should disable composition of HTML messages by default, then
this won't happen (Tools > Account Settings > Composition & Addressing).

You can't. If you have lost your private key, there's no way you could
revoke the public key anymore. That's why it's important to create a

that you could type it if all other means fail).

Hash: SHA1
I think this is a misunderstanding. gpg 1.9 is not about _migration_ to
S/MIME, it's about _adding_ S/MIME to gpg. There is no reason why gpg
2.0 would not support OpenPGP. What is true, though, is that so far, gpg
1.9 was only about adding S/MIME to gpg. But AFAIK it is the goal to
merge gpg 1.4 with gpg 1.9.
Why? The _only_ purpose of gpg-agent is to ask you for a password and to
keep that password in memory. You could use gpg-agent for _any_
application that requires a password.

The user interface may be nice indeed, and the whole extension seems to
be quite well-integrated into Thunderbird, but in the background I can
tell you there are many hacks and workarounds needed to get things
running. Still, after more than 6 years of development, there are parts
of the code in Enigmail that I would call fragile
The main problem is that Thunderbird is very open for add-ons related to
the user interface, but once you dig into the core of the application,
it's no longer so well extensible. This is especially true for some of
the existing core parts. Some bits date back to Netscape 4.0 (or even
earlier) and have not been redesigned ever since then -- you can imagine
 what follows now.
