@_subject: Trying to run GnuPG on OSF1 V4.0 
im finally able to compile v.1.0 on my DEC ALPHA running Digital Unix 4.0d. ive even gone so far as to install egd. however, whenever i try to do anything, including generating a key or running "make check" i get 20 of 23 tests failed and multiple "Blowfish selftest failed (1)."
im at the end of my rope. any ideas????

@_subject: Compiling on DEC Alpha 
thank you for the response. i have a few more questions. please bear with me, as im NOT a programmer, im a unix sysad and ive only taken three or four semesters of C(++)... and that is the extent of my experience.
do you mean i should disable any CFLAGS? or should i actually set it to "..."? ive tried disabling just about everything with configure.
one of the problems i ran into was any time a preprocessor command was indented, the compile bombed. ive fixed a lot of things, and now i only get 14 of 23 tests failed (a 6-test) improvement. however, i still get many many messages saying i dont have "secure" memory (what is that?) and blowfish selftest failed (1).
any other suggestions?
