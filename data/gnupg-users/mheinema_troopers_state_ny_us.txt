Does anyone know why --no-secmem-warning does not suppress the
insecure memory message on a Compaq True64 Alpha machine?
Thank you for your consideration.

Thanks Sam.
Is there more to running GnuPG as setuid root than chown root
Incidentally, the make check fails 2 out of 24 tests (the ones using
pipes) because of the inclusion of a secmem warning in the output file
being compared to the original. I felt this was more of an error with
make check than with the compile so I went ahead with the
The options are parsed  AFTER the first secure memory is allocated,
which makes it a fairly useless option. I asked for this to be
changed. It seemed to me that there was no particular reason to
allocate the memory so early, and moving the allocation to after
the options parsing would be safe.
I think this option doesn't get any use, because most people just
make gpg setuid root to fix this, but that doesn't work everywhere.
What do you think Werner? Should I resubmit a patch against the
latest, or has it been fixed since 1.0.1?
