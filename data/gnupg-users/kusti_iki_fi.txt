@_subject: Comments on a small script please 
Hi all,
I wrote a smallish sh-script to help me store my private
text files encrypted. The script is called "gpge" as in "gpg
edit" and is supposed to act as a simple frontend to
gpg. I'd like to use it on a multi-user unix machine, so
I'd really welcome some comments on its safety; how easily
it breaks? What should be changed?
The script is available at .
Thanks for yor time,

Yes, the README was not very clear there. I wonder, however,
how big a threat would it be if the shell script actually
did read the passphrase to a variable? What means would an
outsider have to read it from there (without root
That is true. If the file is not encrypted it is not
safe. Still, I believe that to work with any computer one
has to trust the computer operator. If a malicious attacker
had root priviledges on the system, even the gpg binary
could not be trusted. Therefore, I think that as long as a
file can only be read by me or by root, it is safe enough
(well, maybe I would still think twice before storing my
most private data this way). I just hope I got the script
right, so that root really is the outsider, who can access
those temp files.
Thanks. That one is fixed now. So (hopefully) is the temp
file creation. The temp files are now created in a
newly-created private directory to prevent any symlink
attacks. Hope I got it right.

Another possibility is to use packages.debian.org to search for
package contents. That way you'll find that gpgsm can be foind in the
package "gpgsm".
