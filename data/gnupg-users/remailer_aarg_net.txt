@_subject: Please Help - how do I unsubscribe to this mailing list? 
Frank Derichsweiler [12/12/2001]:
The problem seems to be that some mail programs hide the headers
of _every_ list message from the user ;-)
The Masthead of the mailing list's digest on the other hand clearly says:
  [-- Attachment  Masthead (Gnupg-users digest, Vol 1  --]
  [-- Type: text/plain, Encoding: 7bit, Size: X.XK --]
  Send Gnupg-users mailing list submissions to
          gnupg-users
  To subscribe or unsubscribe via the World Wide Web, visit
            or, via email, send a message with subject or body 'help' to
          gnupg-users-request

You can always pre-process all incoming mail (with procmail or maildrop)
and fix the Content-Type: header...

@_subject: Keeping keyrings in different locations 
C Chadwick [24/07/2002]:
(Assuming that you work on a unix computer, and that your CD-R media
is mounted under /cdrom)
Make your ~/.gnupg/secring.gpg a link to /cdrom/keys/secring.gpg
Unix is fun!

@_subject: Encrypt and Sign - strange problem to open on Windows 
Joseph [26/07/2002]:
Use  '-r your_key -r his_key' instead of '-r xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
(ie. make sure that the message is encrypted to both your and his key)

@_subject: 106 -> 107 and incompatibilities 
David T-G:
No need for that.  Just run 1.0.7 setting the env. variable GNUPGHOME
to a temporary directory (after copying all your keyrings there from ~/.gnupg)

Tell GnuPG to use a different (secondary) keyring, which you might want
to clean up from time to time...

Are you sure that you can take GNU licensed code and then
redistribute it as public domain?
Me thinks not.  The GNU parts will have to be distributed _only_ under
