@_subject: GPG question 
Hi all,
In PGP I can select the symmetric cryptographic algorithm to use (e.g. TripleDES, IDEA, etc.).
How can I make this selection in GPG ? If not: what is setup at the moment ?
Note that I cannot find anything in one of the preferences (I'm using GPG4Win).
Kind regards,
Harry Lormans
