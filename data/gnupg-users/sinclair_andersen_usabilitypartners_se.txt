Hello Caro,
I'm afraid I don't have a solution for you, but since I have been looking for precisely the same myself for over a year now, I thought I reply anyway. I run GnuPG 1.4.20 from inside a Veracrypt volume together with a number other portable apps, like Pidgin, Thunderbird,  that is stored and back uped on a couple of thumbdrives and other media. I do this by having created a start.bat file that I start GnuPG from:
 setlocal
 set GNUPGHOME=.
 cmd.exe
 endlocal
Feeling that it is only a matter of time before one must leave 1.4.x behind (a feeling, mind you, maybe it will outlive some of us), I have been looking for a way to run at least version 2.0.30 from inside a Veracrypt volume and, as you say "don't want the host system to be altered in any way."
If by any chance someone on this list has an answer to this, someone mails you or you find a solution, I'd be more than happy if you'd share. If that happens to me, I be sure to do the same.
