@_subject: Invoking GnuPG from CGI under Windows 7 
I have a question regarding using GPG from a CGI script under Apache. I am
requesting a key from our keyserver. The command I use works fine from the
command line and from a Perl script in the regular user context ~\gpg.exe  --batch --no-tty --keyserver ldap://
--no-default-keyring --primary-keyring  --recv-keys If I run the Perl script from Apache as a CGI, I get the following error:
"gpg: can't create directory `C:\WINDOWS\gpg-4568AA': Permission denied
gpg: keyserver communications error: general error
gpg: keyserver receive failed: general error"
My question is two-fold:
1) Is it Apache or GPG that is trying to write a temp file into the system
2) Depending on the answer to 1), what can I do about it? If GPG is doing
it, can it be redirected to a temp directory where Apache has permissions?

@_subject: More CGI issues under Windows 7 
New thread as I think this is a different issue.
I am invoking GPG from a Perl CGI running under Apache 2.2 webserver on
Windows 7. Although I have set up Apache as its own user I need to have my
CGI call a helper Perl script to get a successful invocation of GPG, e.g. my $r = `perl GnuPGTest.pl 2>&1`;
This script has a single GPG command to retrieve a public key from a
keyserver. It returns the key information as I would expect. However, when I
try to expand this to include any GPG command by using a command line:
my $r = `perl GnuPGHelper.pl $cmd 2>&1`;
It is returning "gpg: processing message failed: eof ". A search of the
literature seems to indicate that GPG is expecting a message to encrypt or
decrypt, which leads me to postulate that for some reason GPG is not seeing
the command string.
Can you please explain the error message? Also, do you have any insights
into a better way to implement this under Apache? I have a standalone system
on a single machine working fine, so I believe I am using GPG properly.
Thanks for any help you can provide.

There is no such critter.  There are naked-tailed, long-nosed,

RFC 4880 really is the place to look for this stuff. All your questions can be
answered by carefully reading the relevant sections of that RFC. Key packets are
described in section 5.5. You showed a --list-packets for an RSA key, so section
5.5.2 tells us a public key packet, or equivalently the start of a secret key
packet, contains, in order: a version number, a creation time, the algorithm,
and a series of multiprecision integers describing the key material. For RSA,
these are the modulus n and the exponent e. It is easily seen that these
probably correspond to skey[0] and skey[1] respectively (or pkey), because the
first one is 2048 bits, which is a reasonable size for the modulus, and the
second one is 17 bits, and I believe that GnuPG always uses the public exponent
Section 5.5.3 goes on to explain what follows in a secret key packet. If you
would remove the password from the exported key, you could see that contents as
well; right now it's in the encrypted part. Let's take a look at a 2048-bit RSA
key secret packet without encryption:
:secret key packet:
        version 4, algo 1, created 1374835387, expires 0
        skey[0]: [2048 bits]
        skey[1]: [17 bits]
        skey[2]: [2043 bits]
        skey[3]: [1024 bits]
        skey[4]: [1024 bits]
        skey[5]: [1023 bits]
        checksum: 4527
        keyid: A1DAD4EC3E7F0306
Section 5.5.3 starts off talking about the encryption with an S2K
(string-to-key, the method to create cryptokeys from a passphrase). Then follows
algorithm-specific stuff, then a checksum. Since we didn't do encryption, the
output above just indicates the algo-specific stuff and the checksum.
Algo-specific stuff for RSA is described as: multiprecision integer (MPI) of the
secret exponent d, prime p, prime q and u, the multiplicative inverse of p, mod
q. The secret exponent's size is on the order of the modulus, so that would be
skey[2]. The others are indeed on the order of half the size of the modulus, so
those sizes make sense as well. It would seem justified to think that, like it
did so far, GnuPG is reporting them in the order they appear in the packet,
making p skey[3], q skey[4] and u skey[5].
If you look at the Wikipedia article on RSA, they define q_inv = q^(-1) mod p. p
and q are exchangeable in the definition, so q_inv is equivalent to u. u is
expensive to compute, so it is included in the secret key material. The two
derived private exponents modulo p or q are cheap to compute. At least, that's
how I always interpreted the presence of u and absence of the other two.
I don't know what you mean by "key value". It might be because...
I get the sense you don't know how the basics of RSA work. If you're going to
look at RSA key material, you should know what makes an RSA key and how it
basically functions. There's no need to know the mathematical proof of the
correctness of its functioning, but you do need to understand a bit of the math.
I think the Wikipedia article on RSA is pretty readable, but I think they don't
state clearly enough for the uninitiated that by choosing d and e as they are
defined, you get (thanks to Euler's theorem) the property that:
m^e^d (mod n) = m^(e*d) (mod n) = m (mod n)
m^d^e (mod n) = m (mod n)
Since you can do the (mod n) at any time you darn well like:
c = m^e (mod n)     -- creates ciphertext
m = c^d (mod n) = m^e^d (mod n) = m (mod n) -- message recoverable
s = h^d (mod n)   -- signature is based on hash
h = s^e (mod n) = s^e^d (mod n) = h (mod n) -- compare hashes
By comparing hashes, you've proven that the person making the signature knows d,
because only d would reverse the effects of raising it to the power of e.
Interestingly, the Euler's theorem Wikipedia article does mention the property:
Euler's theorem also forms the basis of the RSA encryption system: encryption
and decryption in this system together amount to exponentiating the original
text by k*phi(n) + 1 for some positive integer k, so Euler's theorem shows that
the decrypted result is the same as the original.
This can be seen from point 5 of "Key generation" of the RSA article:
Solve d for d*e = 1 (mod phi(n)) = k*phi(n) + 1
As indicated above: remove the passphrase from the key.
PS: I took the liberty to write = where it should be a congruence relation
modulo n. Keeps it ASCII.

Yes, it would. That's pretty much my whole point.
"Validity" is misleading, because it's commonly associated with dates

more-or-less intuitively that they need to verify or authenticate the

Hi Robert,

A few weeks ago on -devel I made a proposal for a FAQ change.  So far I've received feedback from three people, all of it fairly positive, all suggesting mild changes.  The following represents a final draft, which I'm now presenting on -users to get the most visibility/feedback.  If the community approves, I'll be submitting this to Werner for inclusion into the FAQ.
Q: Why does GnuPG default to 2048-bit RSA?
A: At the time the decision was made, 2048-bit RSA was thought to
    provide reasonable security for the next decade or more while still
    being compatible with the overwhelming majority of the OpenPGP
    ecosystem.
Q: Is that still the case?
A: Largely, yes.  According to NIST Special Publication 800-57,
    published in July 2012, 2048-bit RSA is believed safe until 2030.
    At present, no reputable cryptographer or research group has cast
    doubt on the safety of RSA-2048.  That said, many are suggesting
    shifting to larger keys, and GnuPG will be making such a shift in
    the near future.
Q: What do other groups have to say about 2048-bit RSA?
A: In 2014, the German Bundesnetzagentur fuer Elektrizitaet, Gas,
    Telekommunikation, Post und Eisenbahnen recommended using RSA-2048
    for long-term security in electronic signatures.
    In 2012, ECRYPT-II published their "Yearly Report on Algorithms
    and Keysizes" wherein they expressed their belief RSA-1776 will
    suffice until at least 2020, and RSA-2432 until 2030.
    In 2010, France's Agence Nationale de la Securite des Systems
    d'Information stated they had confidence in RSA-2048 until at
    least 2020.
Q: Is there a general recommendation that 3072-bit keys be used for
    new applications?
A: No, although some respected people and groups within the
    cryptographic community have made such recommendations.  Some
    even recommend 4096-bit keys.
Q: Will GnuPG ever support RSA-3072 or RSA-4096 by default?
A: Probably not.  The future is elliptical-curve cryptography,
    which will bring a level of safety comparable to RSA-16384.
    Every minute we spend arguing about whether we should change
    the defaults to RSA-3072 or more is one minute the shift to
    ECC is delayed.  Frankly, we think ECC is a really good idea
    and we'd like to see it deployed as soon as humanly possible.
Q: I think I need larger key sizes.
A: By all means, feel free to generate certificates with larger keys.
    GnuPG supports up to 4096-bit keys.

Fort Meade is actually closer to Laurel than it is to Baltimore.
Which shouldn't be any surprise, since NIST collaborates with them on
determining these numbers.  You'll notice that they exactly match NIST's
recommendations, except that NIST doesn't list a 192-bit entry.  Also, I
think your 521 is actually 512.  :)
Nope.  That's the computational complexity in a computational-theory
sense, not the complexity in a cryptanalytic sense.  Be real careful
about thinking the two of them are connected; they're probably not.  If
it scaled with bit length to the 1/3 power, and if a 3072-bit RSA key
corresponds to 128 shannons of entropy, a 15360-bit RSA key would only
have 211 shannons -- not 256.
Coming up with these tables is black magic at the best of times.  For
that reason, I hope you'll understand if I choose to rely on NIST rather
than your numbers.  :)

@_subject: Unable to encrypt file with private/public key 
You need to clarify your terminology: Key pairs are composed of public and private keys. Each person generates a key pair. You freely distribute the PUBLIC key to any and all, you keep your PRIVATE key secret. When you use asymmetric encryption, you encrypt to each separate PUBLIC key for whom you send the message. So if you have three people you are sending the encrypted message to, you will encrypt three separate times. If you have the keys on a keyring the process is automatic. When you receive an encrypted message, you decrypt using your PRIVATE key. If you generate a digital signature, you sign a message using your PRIVATE key.  If you use symmetric encryption, your key pairs are not involved. You generate a passphrase that is converted into a key used internally by GPG. Both encryption and decryption must use the same passphrase.
You can also generate subkeys based on your original key pair which can be assigned individual functions (signing only, encrypting, etc.). This is not required but in many instances recommended. Use the GPG default settings whenever possible.
Does this clear things up?

Thanks for the answers about the CRC error, i found what i needed, but it
took me now to other questions. Actually i got the CRC error when i modified
some strings of a public key and then i tried to import it.
I told to my self that it would be interesting as securing method to sign
stuff with a private key "with out having the public key". this would mean that only
the person who has public key would have access to the data with out needing
a password.
(and the person with the private key too i think, it would be great if only the person
with the public key can decrypt the data, maybe there is one option, i'll check for that.)
So why i was asking about the CRC error?
Well, i was thinking that storing such Public key would be insecure. but storing
a modified public key would be good. If the CRC error doesn't indicates where
there problem is, only the person who knows how to re-build the public key
would have access to the data.
To become this method secure,the public key should not be stored in the key
ring so people can not export it ( in case the computer get compromised )
when i was testing this method, i removed the keys from my keyring, and then
i imported only the secret key. For my surprise there was also the public key.
Is there anyway to only import the secret key?
Thanks again,
Pedro markov
I'm a new user to the GPG world, and i haven't find information about the "CRC" error when

Hi Hauke&Group,
I have been following this thread with a lot of interest. I want to jump in here to make sure that something implicit is made explicit: If a unsophisticated user is allowed too much latitude (or provided too much information and the way to dessiminate it), not only can they harm their own security posture, but they can also harm others. To use Daniel's analogy, I would put up the guardrails, because even though I may not care about the driver who intentionally goes off the road, I do care about the busload of children on the curve below him that he could kill due to his ignorance/stupidity. Whatever infrastructure changes are proposed and ultimately adopted, protection of the data must be the primary concern, not ease-of-use. There are a lot of tools available that take some time to learn. Sometimes this is ultimately a good thing. I would rather a child learn how to cut wood with a small hand saw than let them loose with a radial arm saw to start. Overhauling the WoT may (and probably does) make a lot of sense, but when designing a security infrastructure limiting the amount of information to the bare minimum to perform the task (or provide the correct amount of protection) is a cardinal rule.

That may be true but there is a level of complexity below which the infrastructure (of a complex problem) becomes useless. That is about the current state of the WoT.
Crypto is about protecting information. The level of required protection depends on the (kind of) information. In order to decide whether a key is suitable to protect a certain data you mandatorily need certain information about the key. Most of which cannot be taken from the certificate. That is not an opinion but a simple but broadly ignored fact. Ignored in order to protect the users from too much complexity...
That is correct. But there is a difference between "supports" and Disagreements are not a problem per se. It's perfectly OK to disagree on the recommendation whether to publish such information or not. And it is OK to debate how to present (or hide) this information to the user (e.g. via ??expert in gpg or "expert settings" in some GUIs).
That is a noble intention and I don't doubt it. But if ensuring turns into disabling then a line is crossed.
In my courses I tell the crypto newbies to forget the WoT. Not forever but until they have a firm understanding of the technology. That is a useful way. Crippling the technology isn't.
That would probably be a good idea if there is only one road. In contrast to rather expensive mountain roads we can build a second road more or less for free. I guess there wouldn't be a concensus that the better road should not be built just because some unqualified driver might use it though he has been told not to do so. If somebody deliberately endangers himself ? so be it. That possibility is no reason to prevent those users with a brain from improving their situation.

Weel the above is not a command but the way to set variables in the
shell.  Programs won't pick these variabales up unless you do either
  NAME=VALUE PROGRAM
or for setting it for the entire session you need to mark the variable:
  NAME=VALUE
  export NAME
after that all programs can access this variable.  Now to run the actual
binary you have to type the name of the program:
  PLAY/inst/bin/gpg2 assuming you are in the top build directory or you add it to your PATH
  PATH="$(pwd)/PLAY/inst/bin:$PATH"
(An "export" command for PATH has already been done by tye shell)
The parent directory.  I suggest that you read up a bit on Unix shell
use because all build instructions are written under the assumption that
is is known.
Yes, I know that this is the gnupg-isers mailing liste and we should not
assume that all subscribers are Unix gurus.  However, in the past that
seems to have been the case.    Werner

Hi Werner,
OK, thanks. I was using the wrong yum search string "gpg" not "gnupg". It showed up and I installed it. Looking forward to setting up the beta. Danke!

Fedora has a gnupg2 package.
If you want to try out the new 2.1 beta, you may use the Speedo system.
I am pretty sure that it will work on Fedora and any other Unix system
with gmake and some basic tools installed.  What may not work is
building a Windows version of GnuPG on Fedora.

@_subject: Splitting a GPG private key 
I don't have any personal experience with splitting the key. What we do at my employer is split the secret key passphrase. Yes, this is a manual process but very secure. For highly important keys we assign six trusted individuals, three have defined one half of the passphrase and three have defined the other half. The halves are backed up physically and stored securely in two separate locations. No one person knows the entire passphrase ever. When encryption is required, one person from each of the three people physically inputs their half of the passphrase. Decryption happens normally. Obviously this only works if you only encrypt a small amount of secret material or do it infrequently. We have found this to be a very secure method.

Just a thought: Have a "Star chamber" meeting for the technical group, invitation only. After that have a 1/2 to 1 hour session open to all where the technical people can present their progress and invite comment. This way you have a focused working session with the key people, but maintain community trust by allowing general input.

Hi, Just to add clarification:
Locke-ian  philosophy posits innocent until proven guilty. Napoleonic posits guilty until proven innocent. Both systems of justice are currently in practice in various parts of the world. The United States is founded on the Locke-ian philosophy which is the one I am personally more comfortable with.
To save you some reading:
The Hatfield-Mccoy feud took place in Appalachia in the United States at the time of and right after the American Civil War. It became iconic for Americans for conflicts involving family and revenge killings.

Aside from only demonstrating possible earlier intent rather later
actions, the fraction of comments of "I'll kill you" that actually convert to
murders is vanishingly small. If I were a juror, this evidence would
tell me nothing about guilt or otherwise.
I'm not sure the "why" matters, unless for mitigation. But connected
crimes makes sense.
The reference is lost on me. Neither is exactly an uncommon name.
I read recently that under Napoleonic law in France, the accused has
to disprove state accusations. But I never gave it any credence.
CRB checks (in the UK) also include non-public records held by police
forces and other organisations.
And of course it is a privacy invasion to go delving into records of
past events if the subject has not shared them with you and does not
generally broadcast them. When the penalty has been paid, the debt to
society is discharged and it is no longer anybody else's business.

This has been done mostly on requests from the Nitrokey (aka

specs and I will put them online soon.
If you do not use Windows I would strongly advise against Rainer
I never achieved to make them work for me, requests for technical
support were never answered, all requests for a sample were rejected or
they quoted unacceptable prices.  Further, the Cyberjack readers run a
lot of code not necessary for accessing the card and the firmware can
easily be updated from the host (if you know how to do that).  Granted,
other vendors also have easy changeable firmware but their
microcontrollers are smaller and writing malware for them is harder.  I
won't trust such devices - we don't know whether the BND has an
agreement with them not to fix exploitable bugs so to allow them
inserting code to track PINs.
Time to build our own pinpad equipped reader?
The size of the file does not matter.  The card only sees the public key
encrypted session key.

@_subject: Teaching GnuPG to noobs 
Hi All,
This is an interesting thread and I want to share my experience. Part of what I do is train people for a secure position. When I am explaining compartmentalization, I use a two-key lock metaphor to help describe classification levels and need-to-know. The metaphor only deals with 'opening' the lock. I think that may be where the inappropriate use  got 'appropriated'.
Bear in mind that my noobs are generally at least technically conversant. I first describe that the public and private key are calculated together and are mathematically linked. Depending on the audience I don't go over the modulus formulae but I do then describe what can be encrypted with one key can be decrypted with the other. Then I talk about the actual mechanism for doing so. I find that if they have a least a cursory understanding of what they are trying to do, it helps a lot in understanding the actual command line/GUI sequence
I leave signing until after I describe the public key/private key encryption paradigm. I find that combining the two topics leads to a lot of confusion. Once they understand assymetric encryption then I go on to digital signatures and why they are important (Man in the Middle is an excellent way to introduce this topic).

Native to what? Processor, OS?
I think Peter and the group already adequately answered this: If GPGME is not providing an interface that meets Android requirements, then look into how GPGME interfaces to GPG and emulate that interface.
For you to request that the interface be changed can be likened to someone requesting that I2C be changed because you have a hard time implementing it. This is pretty much a non-starter IMHO. Implementing interfaces to existing infrastructures is bread-and-butter to software development. Stop asking for fundamental infrastructure changes and start solving your problem. The group has literally hundreds of m-y that can be used productively to help you do this, but harness the group's power in a constructive manner.

In Android, you can't really have shared libraries.  Apps share functionality at a higher level (aka Activities and Services).  So GnuPG-for-Android _is_ the shared library in effect, since it provides OpenPGP via Activities.
No one is saying that each app should have a custom wrapper for GnuPG.  What I think mailpile is saying, and what I'm trying to say is that for programming environments where GPGME does not make sense, there should be the ability to easily make a native version of what GPGME is doing.

@_subject: Thoughts on GnuPG and automation 
Hi Hans,
Wanted to respond to your post wondering why you are getting the responses you are. In another thread you write:
"There are other C-Python wrappers of GPGME, like pyme.  I hope you're aware of those, and have studied them.  One thing that GnuPG suffers from is many people starting their own wrappers, but few people finishing them or contributing to existing ones.  That is not a sustainable situation."
This is the problem. You frame the dialog as blaming GnuPG and the design choices made in its implementation. Direct case in point: It is certainly not Werner's or any other principal GnuPG developer's issue if and when someone else independently took on a project to wrap GnuPG or GPGME. The fact that  these people might have bitten off more than they can chew is completely irrelevant to the canonical implementation and frankly should be irrelevant to this discussion. When I said approach this in a constructive manner I meant this: You have some requirements. In your estimation these requirements are not met with the current toolset. Then instead of explicitly expecting this group to implement a paradigm shift (and forgive me if I misunderstand you, but that is what I infer you are asking for) generate a proposal for an Android-centric API. Or, if you feel that the infrastructure cannot support it, take the completely open sources Werner and group have provided and generate your own system that meets your needs. If possible,  (and here again I am clarifying my original post) work with the people on this group to help you use the existing tools to get your requirements met. But speaking as a professional engineer of 25+ years experience, you will not get your desired results by starting the conversation impuning the work that went before and claiming that what you are asking for is far superior. If it is not your intent to convey that message then please review what you write before you send it, because that message was received loud and clear.
