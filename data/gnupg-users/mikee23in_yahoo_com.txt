hello, please could someone explain to me what --status-fd
actually does. i'm writing c++ application that calls gpg commands
using spawnl .  i have created a filestream and i want
to use the file descriptor with the --status-fd and
--command-fd so that i can check the different error
conditions.  Giving gpg --status-fd --command-fd 3 --decrypt abc.gpg (3 - file desc)
simply gives messages on the console (stdout)
i want to get the status messages to the file.
pls let me know if i have done something wrong there.
plus i would like to know what exactly happens using
the --status-fd and --command-fd
the docs have only a small definition. and the
doc/Details file.. contains only the format of
--status-fd output.
pls. help

sorry. I asked about --status-fd not --passphrase-fd
I want to read the different status messages that are
thrown out when my application executes different GPG
commands. Somehow , gpg --status-fd FD --decrypt file.gpg doesnt work for FD > 2 on Windows. Thanks anyway - that was the only reply I got.
