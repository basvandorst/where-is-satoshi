Hi all,
A newbie question for you all.  I did a gpg --gen-key and created a key that
expired after a few days. Then I realised I forgot the password, and so I
want to start all over again. However, gpg keeps asking me for my passphrase
and doing a gpg --edit-key to do a deluid or revsig doesn't work.  Any
suggestions, please?

@_subject: 1.2.3 and 1.2.1 compatibility 
Hi all,
We had GPG 1.2.1 humming along fine on Compaq Tru64 Unix V5.1A (our
development and test server). However, it failed to compile on our
production server that runs Digital Unix V4.0F (Rev. 1229). Since we are not
C programmers we decided to install GPG 1.2.3 on the production server.  I
had a feeling that GPG 1.2.1 and 1.2.3 might not be compatible, but we tried
to exchange files anyway (after exchanging our keys). The other party using
GPG 1.2.1 could import our 1.2.3 key (and we could import their 1.2.1 key)
but they could not decrypt our 1.2.3 file.
Is it possible to encrypt/decrypt in GPG 1.2.3 to and from a 1.2.1 (like
Microsoft Word 2000 can save files in Word 97 format)?  Is there any other
way to exchange files between these two versions?  Or is the answer a
simple: "No, these two versions cannot exchange files!"
