@_subject: How to delete key w/ duplicate id? 
I recently installed GnuPG on my Mac laptop, not realizing it was apparently
installed at some previous time.  After the install I generated a new key
but gave the same id as an earlier key.  My keyring now has three keys:
    % gpg --list-keys
    /Users/skip/.gnupg/pubring.gpg
    ------------------------------
    pub   1024D/D0AA36FE 2001-03-30
    uid                  Skip Montanaro     sub   1024g/88676B77 2001-03-30
    pub   1024D/B805F237 2000-04-04
    uid                  Neil Schemenauer     uid                  Neil A. Schemenauer     sub   1536g/90A32543 2000-04-04
    pub   1024D/A5F59887 2005-06-11
    uid                  Skip Montanaro     sub   2048g/B2FD262D 2005-06-11
Note that the first and last keys have the same uid.  Everything I've tried
always selects the first item.  How can I select and delete the last item?

Thanks.  I'm pretty much brand new to gpg.  I tried some other things (I
no longer remember quite what), but whatever I tried I kept getting the first
key and decided it was better to ask than to accidentally delete the key I
knew I wanted to keep.

@_subject: Can't suppress "good signature" status message 
I run gpg as part of a shell script which runs from cron.
I would like to suppress or redirect messages which are
"status good" and only emit messages to stderr which
suggest there was a problem with the script.  (I get
enough mail as it is.)  I have so far been unable to
suppress the "good signature" message:
    gpg: Signature made Fri Nov ...
    gpg: Good signature from ...
I am running gpg (v 1.4.11) like so:
    gpg --status-fd=4 --no-mdc-warning \
        --no-secmem-warning --quiet -d ...
The use of status-fd, no-mdc-warning and no-secmem-warning
suppresses or redirects everything else which I expect.
Replacing  status-fd with status-file had no effect.  The
"good signature" messages still appear.  The script is run
with fd 4 redirected to a file and we know to look there if
the cron job fails.
Reading through old posts I saw various recommendations to
use status-fd, status-file or to redirect stderr to stdout
and use grep -v to eliminate those lines.  The status-fd
and status-file flags don't work as far as I can tell, and
as also noted in an earlier thread from 2009 there is the
risk that using grep you might eliminate something useful
(low probability, but not zero).
It seems to me that the display of this message is somehow
not done through the proper channels.  GnuPG appears to
already have about 37,000 command line options, including
options to suppress or redirect all sorts of stuff.  Just
not this. Maybe it needs another option. :-/

No ideas on how to suppress the "good signature" output in

I finally broke down and searched around in the source.  Not only
is there a --status-fd flag, there is a --logger-fd flag.  I
don't know what the difference between emitting a status message
and writing a log message is, but setting both values to 4 now
puts all the GnuPG chattiness in my log file where I want it.
