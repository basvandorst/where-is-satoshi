@_subject: GNUPG Queries 
I have been task to work on feasibility of using GNUPG to encrypt some data
files so that it could be send over the network.
The following are some questions I have in mind (I have never used pgp or
gnupg before)
1) can gnupg be used to encrypt data files(database/binaries)?
2) If i am on an isolated network(WAN), can I encrypt the files and send it
thru ftp/scp?
Best Regards,
