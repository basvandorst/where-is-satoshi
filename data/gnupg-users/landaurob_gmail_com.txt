@_subject: advice please 
Good day,  I have just received my first Linux system (Ubuntu 14.04)  It
has Seahorse installed, but I don't see any GnuPG application.  How can I
determine if there is a GnuPG installed, and if so where to find it.
Searching the Dash for GnuPG reveals nothing, and there doesn't appear to
be any program in the Ubuntu Software Center
Cheers   ~Rob
