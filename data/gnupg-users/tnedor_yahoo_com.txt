Hash: SHA1
I have an automatic script that I call from mutt to automatically
retrieve signing keys from a keyserver.
The keyserver in my options file is set to pgp.mit.edu
I wanted to know if it is possible to use multiple keyservers in my
query, so if the key is not registered with one server, I can search
Not really sure if searching for keys in this fashion is a good idea. If
not, please advise with an explanation.
Script as below:

I get "^M" (without the ""'s) in mutt if i decode any messages in mutt
that use inline sigs.
Is there a way to fix this.

Does not matter who it comes from.. Usually, if the message has inline
sigs, it gives me this problem... your message was decoded correctly.
Linux. I recompiled a copy of mutt 1.5.5i to see if this would offer a
solution, but no.. it is still cauing problems.
My mutt information is listed below.

Yes... ^M at the end of every line... I am fairly certain that the mail
server is not modifying the message. My mail is pop'd off Yahoo Mail by
fetchmail on the local box. I even tried this by removing all my filters
and spam-assassin, and I still get the same output :(
The messages signed by mutt (I press 'p', enter my password, then hit
'y' to sent the message) works without problems.. I have a filter set up
that signs the message inline and if I send this to myself, I get the ^M
at the end of every line (after filter message starts with BEGIN PGP
SIGNED MESSAGE, etc. and finishes with END PGP SIGNATURE).
Yes.. Get this on both counts :(
I'll ask there.. Thanks
I'll change this...
