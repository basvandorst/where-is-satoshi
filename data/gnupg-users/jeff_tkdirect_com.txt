@_subject: Help please with windows NT and symmetric key batch processing 
I am trying to use GPG in a windows NT environment to accomplish batch
encryption, and decryption using a symmetric key.  I am having difficulty
setting my password using the --passphrase-fd option.  Any help would be
greatly appreciated.
