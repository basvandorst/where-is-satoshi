the key server ? The company I work for wants to enforce this (for an
internal keyserver with the keys of people in the company). I cannot
find the feature on gnupg.
I also tried the way to use a keyring with a hkp scheme, but it seems
that "scheme" in the --keyring option has not the same meaning as
"scheme" in the --keyserver option.
Another way would be to use the keyserver, but not keep the keys in
the local keyring, but I could not find if it was possible.

They can be technically separated, but each private key is assumed to
have one only user.
Thus if you use a key with ID A, then same key with ID B, people can
easily deduce that ID A and ID B are IDs of the same physical personn.
IDs are isolated inside th OpenPGP system, but you do not live in this
system, you live in real world, where people can deduce thing from
different sources.

for backup you only need the public key, so no problem to let a script use it.

There are 2 keys on keyservers which bear my name, but which I do not
own. Worse they are signed by several keys bearing the name of people
who know me, but those keys do not belong to them either.
However, if checks are done carefullly, nobody can trace those keys to
me through a sensible chain of signatures, leading to a personnally
verified key ownership.

Here someone created keys with name and addresses of all regular
participant to a french speaking computer security newsgroup. And
cross)signed them before sending them to keyservers...
But ther is a weak point : if someone signs without carefully checking,
those keys can be linked back to the real web of trust. Let's hope suche
a person will not be trusted more marginally by anybody, but I have
little hope in commen knowledge about the importance of key signing,
even if there was no catastroph since 1998 when keys were uploaded...
