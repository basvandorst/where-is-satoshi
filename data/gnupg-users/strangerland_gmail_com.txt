@_subject: Check integrity of gnupg-w32cli-1.4.7.exe 
I do not have a previous trusted installation of gpg.
I've checked the sha1 hash for the downloaded gnupg-w32cli-1.4.7.exe on the main page and it checks:
The main page says to double check against announcements in the mailing list I have found this last task impossible. Even searching for the hash it self turns up nothing.
How do I confirm the hash? Or specifically which posting contains this info?
