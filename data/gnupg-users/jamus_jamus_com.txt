@_subject: gpg 1.0.2 using expired key 
I have a key that has a expired subkey and a valid subkey.  When I
encrypt using this key with gpg, it uses the expired subkey.  I can use
the correct subkey by specifing the subkey ID (3A55B778) using -r, and
the main key ID (A5ACC779), but not by using "jamus".  Is this a bug?
screen dumps & gpg public key follow:
gpg -r A5ACC779 --encrypt readme.txt
gpg: using secondary key 3A55B778 instead of primary key A5ACC779
gpg -r jamus --encrypt readme.txt
gpg: key 2770CDE6.59: expired at Thu 25 May 2000 06:44:49 PM EDT
gpg: 2770CDE6: key has expired
