now that you've clarified that you're better than us 'normal' folk, perhaps you'd care to explain it in more detail. For the benefit of the list of course.

i apologize. That was provocative of me. I just think you come across very patronizing sometimes which isn't necessary. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

"Better" is a word I did not use and would not use.  Your attempt to put
that word in my mouth tells us a lot more about you than about me.
Given that your message appears to be an attempt to get a reaction from
me, the preceding is the only reaction you will get.  Goodbye.
