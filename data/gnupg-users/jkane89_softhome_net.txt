There seem to be several garbled versions of the formula
in circulation, but I gather the GNFS is supposed to be
   e^(   1.9223  *  (ln N)^(1/3)  *  (ln ln N)^(2/3)   )
where N is the actual number being factored, and not just
the 512/1024 size in bits.
The SNFS, with an exponent of 1.5262, is apparently not
able to factor RSA/DH keys.

This is second-hand information from the FSF, but since
it doesn't seem to be posted anywhere, here it is:
  >The Free Software Foundation is the assignee of the copyright
  of GNU Privacy Guard, which is software first published in
  Germany.  GnuPG is therefore software of non-US origin, and
  is not subject to US export controls.  In order to assure,
  however, maximum utility of GnuPG for US developers, the
  Free Software Foundation has filed on behalf of GnuPG's
  authors sufficient information with the US Commerce
  Department's Bureau of Export Administration to qualify
  GnuPG for export from the United States under current
  encryption export regulations if it were software of US origin.
  This allows free software made in the US and combined
  with unmodified versions of GnuPG to be exported from
  the United States without additional filings.<<

@_subject: --keyring /dir/??  Use --homedir instead. 
Q: I want to put my keyring in a different directory; why
    does gnupg keep making files in the old directory?
A: Gnupg keeps several files in a special 'homedir' directory.
These include the "options" file, pubring.gpg, secring.gpg,
the trustdb, and others.  Gnupg will always create and use
these files.  On unices, the homedir is normally ~/.gnupg;
on Windows, it's normally "C:\gnupg\".
If you want to put your keyrings somewhere else, you should
probably NOT be using the "--keyring" command. You should
use "--homedir /my/path/" to make gnupg create ALL its files
in that directory. Your keyring will be "/my/path/pubring.gpg".
Why not use "--keyring"?  It's not designed to allow you to
use a new keyring *instead* of the original pubring; it's
designed to let you use *several* keyrings in *addition* to
the default pubring.  All at the same time.
If the commands "keyring a.gpg" and "keyring b.gpg" are in
your options file, gnupg looks in your homedir for pubring.gpg,
a.gpg, and b.gpg.  It will search all three (in that order) to try
to find a matching key.  Gnupg will *always* load pubring
unless you put "no-default-keyring" in your options.

Sorry.  After exporting your key, you need to import it
into a new *.gpg keyring before you can use it.  Also, you
should transfer the public and secret keys toghether. Also,
it's necessary to use -a when making an ascii .asc file:
  gpg ... -a --export-keys me >mypub.asc
  gpg ... -a --export-secret-keys me >mysecret.asc
  gpg ... --import mypub.asc
  gpg ... --allow-secret-key-import --import mysecret.asc
with --keyring newpub.gpg --secret-keyring newsec.gpg

mm> echo -n ' ' | gpg --armor --sign --encrypt --textmode \

You're right.  I get the same behavior using gpg 1.0.6-2 + WinXP,
with a file consisting of one or more space characters and no
trailing CRLF or non-whitespace characters.  The problem goes
away if I drop textmode and do -sea instead of -seat, but then
it comes back again if I feed a zero-length empty file to gpg.
The hash and signature don't properly verify when the plaintext
gets canonicalized to the equivalent of zero-bytes-long.
Instead of 'Good signature...', I get only 'encrypted with...'
and 65 bytes of binary garbage to stdout.  In fact, I think
the sig packet might be getting parsed as bogus ciphertext
instead of being recognized as a signature.
Original 1.0.6 gives 72 garbage bytes instead of 65.  (?)

@_subject: deleting keys in batch 
We're able to force 'Yes' responses with this:
  gpg --command-fd 0 --delete-secret-and-public-key KEYNAME <YY
where YY is a text file containing:
(with linebreak / carriage-return after each "Y")
We found out the hard way that "y" doesn't work; use "Y"s.  This
should be portable across all systems which support stdin, pipes,
and redirection.
In general, you can use " --status-fd 2 --command-fd 0 " to make
GnuPG prompt you explicitly for confirmation, which you can type
interactively from the keyboard.  Once you determine the exact
sequence of responses, you can record them in a text file.

@_subject: seems to be a BCC mechanism (20010055396) 
Picture this:
 I write a program which takes a multiple-recipient OpenPGP
 file and 'splits' it into separate files, each encrypted-to only
 one recipient. (The sym-encrypted message body section
 will of course be identical across all the split files.)  My
 program then emails each single-encrypted file to its
 intended recipient.
That seems to be what he has in mind.
 From what I can tell, the 'novel' element seems to be that
he proposes automatic stripping of all the public-key headers
except the one addressed to the recipient, so that none of
the recipients knows who else got a copy; this is equivalent
to a Blind-Carbon-Copy system applied to multiple-recipient
encrypted messages.
NOTE: the anon/relay cipherpunk remailers already implement
a similar BCC option in their protocol; this might prove to
be prior art.
The other novel element might be the implied separation
between the symmetrically-encrypted message body part
and the list of public-key routing/decryption headers.
(Whereas PGP glues both of those together in one file.)

No, actually there's not going to be a GnuPG SDA, as a matter
of policy.  Aside from portability problems, it's considered a
very serious security hole to ask the recipient to execute an
unknown binary, and it's a no-no in the un*x world.
However, there are other password-based encryption packages

To the best of my knowledge, on your original system you'd do:
   gpg  --armor -o mysecret.asc --export-secret-keys  myemail
   gpg  --armor -o mypubkey.asc --export  myemail
and on the second system (if you have gpg) do:
   gpg  --allow-secret-key-import  --import  mysecret.asc
   gpg  --import  mypubkey.asc
Note that the 'mysecret.asc' text file contains only the secret part
of your key, and you need to transfer both the public and private
parts to make the key behave properly on the new system.

Sorry, but the output of --export was never compressed
in the first place.  It does a binary export of all public keys
in your keyring.  (compress-algo and -z have no effect in
this situation.)   You can do --armor --export  if you
want the output to be a non-binary ascii file (which you
can then compress), but --export already produces an
uncompressed binary file.  You would do:
   gpg  --export >mykeys.gpg
   gpg  -a --export >mykeys.asc
   gpg  -a -o mykeys.asc --export
