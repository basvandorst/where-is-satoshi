@_subject: Problem with PGP working together with GNUPG 
Hello everybody,
I have a problem with the exchange of encrypted messages between PGP and
PGP (I tried version 5.0 and 6.5.1 beta on linux) is not able to decrypt
any message I encrypt with GNUPG (I tried version 1.0.0 and 1.0.1).
I´ve tried different cypher algos on encrypting with GNUPG but PGP either
tells me, that it is not able to decrypt the message or it just ends with
an signal 11.
If I exchange messages only with PGP everything works fine, so PGP seems to
work allright.
Also the other way is no problem. Every message, that is encrypted with
PGP, I can decrypt with GNUPG.
I even searched dejanews for hints, what I´m doing wrong, but I haven´t
found anything.
But as I read, GNUPG and PGP should be able to work together. So if anyone
can give me an hint, where I can´t find a solution for this problem, it
would be appreciated.

Hi clemens,
many thanks for your hints.
Seems that I was missing one of these options. I also tried different
options for cipher and digest algos and the other things.
But I did´nt get the right combination.
Now I tried your options and everything works fine in exchanging messages
between GNUPG and PGP.
