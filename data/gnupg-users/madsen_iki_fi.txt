@_subject: case conversion in real name 
I just generated my keys. I know, from looking at what I typed and what was
was listed earlier that I typed my first name with a capital M but now it
suddenly shows up with a lower case m! How is this possible? and if it is
possible, how do I change it back?
(I'm not on the the list so a personal reply would be appreciated)
