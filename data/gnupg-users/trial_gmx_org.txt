@_subject: Encrypt a signed text 
Hi mailing list!
I would like to encrypt a signed (with ASCII armor) text. It should take
two steps, because I want to use two different machines, a local one to
sign and a remote machine which encrypts. The result should be the same
as the encrypted and signed one in one step. Is that possible?
Thanks to all experts!
Regards Walter
