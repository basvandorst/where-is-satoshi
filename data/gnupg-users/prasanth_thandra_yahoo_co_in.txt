@_subject: setuping local/standalone sks keyserver 
Start from I don't know if anybody has made an RPM of that; probably somebody has,
but I'm not familiar enough with the various RPM distribution channels
to check :)
First i want to thanks Mr.?Peter Pentchev for his first inputs.
i am trying to configure a local sks keyserver on RHEL4.
i downloded sks-1.1.1, ocaml-3.11.2 and Berkely DB db-4.6.21
i installed the prerequisites?caml-3.11.2 and Berkely DB db-4.6.21 as said in README of sks-1.1.1
then i  /../../sks-1.1.1
 dump
=== Running fastbuild... ===
./sks_build.sh: line 11: sks: command not found
Command failed unexpectedly. Bailing out
please help me in resolving the issue.
Thanks in Adv.

@_subject: recieving/updating Public Keys from SKS keyserver to pubring.gpg 
i configured gnupg 2.0.15 on RHEL4 to encrytp e-mail messages. Then i installed SKS 1.1.1-2 on the same mechine.?
now i am able to generate keys  --gen-keysand export/sent them to SKS ? ?  --keyserver hkp://localhost --send-key KEYIDand also recieve them through ? --keyserver hkp://localhost --recv-key KEYID
and i configured each users e-mail client (EVOLUTION) using their KEYIDes. When a user receives an encrypted mail from his peer ... he is able to read the mail only after receiving the KEY of sender to his pubring.gpg . But the problem here is each user has to receive KEYs of all the other one after another....which i dont think is the correct way.
??????? is there any way of receiving all the Public-keys that are available with the local SKS keyserver ???????
if it is ??
how to update users pubring.gpg periodically or ?when ever a new KEY is received by the KEYSERVER?
Please help me.. Thanking you
P K Thandra?

Thanks for the help. the commands suggested gave the following error messages.
Not quite right, but Faramir has already addressed this point.
It would be the usual way to download keys from the server as needed.
If all the keys on your local server have a common string in the
user-id, this would be trivial. Let's assume the common string is
" and try issuing the command
gpg --keyserver hkp://localhost --recv-key ^^[root at localhost ~]# gpg --keyserver hkp://localhost --recv-key ^^gpg: skipping invalid key ID " by questioner#
Doesn't that fetch all keys on that server containing that string?
Or maybe "gpg --fetch-keys hkp://localhost" might do it?
^^[root at localhost ~]# gpg --fetch-keys hkp://localhost
^^gpg: Invalid option "--fetch-keys" # by questioner#
Put the required commands in a batch file and schedule it to be run
periodically, perhaps?
"--auto-key-locate [parameters]" could be used to fetch new keys as
needed, rather than as soon as posted to the server
^^ i have added the line?keyserver-options --auto-key-locate?^^ in my ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf file
i have to see how it works

I have created .gnupg in my home dir, and gpg.conf using ?/usr/local/share/gnupg/gpg-conf.skel?i added?keyserver hkp://localhost (i configured local sks server for testing)keyserver-options auto-key-retrive.
i have generated a key-pair  --gen-keysand exported to local keyserver  --send-key KEYIDi have not faced any problem till then
BUT.. when i am trying to invoke gpg-agent, gpg2 or gpgsm iam getting errors
[root at localhost ~]# gpg-agent --daemon
gpg-agent: error while loading shared libraries: libassuan.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

i am clueless about what is happening or what to do to correct these errors... whether my installation was not complete ????

Dear Tom
i followed the instructions of you ... i worked for me too like magic... Thanks alot..?
Hello Prasanth Thandra
??? I had the same problem with gpg2 in Ubuntu 10.04 , my solution was as
in the folder /etc/ld.so.conf.d create a file called gpg2.conf (as root)
gpg2.conf contains one line
"/usr/local/lib" (without quotes)
reboot system or enter the command "ldconfig -v" (without quotes)
gpg2 was able to find libksba.so.0
