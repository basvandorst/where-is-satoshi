I installed gpg (win32) on my machine running NT. I generated my key
   with my passphrase. When I encrypted a file, it asked me for the
   passphrase. But when I decrypted it, it didn't ask me for the
   passphrase at all. This sounds scary to me. I can't seem to find the
   answer from various documents. Don't you have to type in your
   passphrase to decrypt a file?
Since when one encrypts files, one doesn't need to to access the secret
key (and hence, enter a passphrase), I think what you did in the first
step was sign your message, not encrypt it.  Signing a message requires
access to your secret key.
Also, since verifying signed documents does not require access to your
secret key, I think that this is what you did in your second step.  That
is, you didn't decrypt, but rather verify a signature.

1. Don't use telnet - it is ridiculous to send the passphrase in clear
They could be using IPsec, OTP, or Kerberos.
   2. If you need to do this on a remote machine, use SSH [1].
You mean a free ssh client, no? :)
   3. You should enable the random device on FreeBSD, I don't know how to
      do it, but with a proper confiuration the machine can collect
      enough entropy even without someone hitting on the keyboard.
      It should help to start some background jobs like "find / -type f

This is a FAQ.  The answer is to use rndcontrol(8) to add IRQ's to the
entropy-gathering utility.  Perhaps if GnuPG is used on a BSD, this could
be spit out when --gen-key is performed.
   [1] Entering passphrases over an SSH channel is not as secure as
   believed, it may be better to pipe the passphrase to the remote
   machine. See the recent Song/Wagner/Tian paper - it is in the news.

As a person who has written several programs that interact with GnuPG in
some way, many of which use automated test cases, I would find it very
useful if GnuPG had embedded in it a hard-wired public/private 'sample'
keypair.  A hard-wired keypair would allow me to create automated tests
using public/private key operations without having to worry about the
existence of a keypair on the system my software is being tested on and
having to ship a test public and private keyring and around all the time.
An example of where a hardwired key would be useful is GnuPG::Interface
(Perl module), which the distribution of carries around a keyring just so
the test cases can utilize public-key encryption and signing operations.
Another example is GnuPGInterface (Python module), for which the test
cases do not utilize keyrings (I only test with --symmetric), simply
because it would be cumbersome.
Anyways, it's a thought.  For any product that wishes to do automated
testing around GnuPG a hard-wired key would be very useful, I feel.

I also brought this up about a year ago maybe.  You might want to look
into "--always-trust" (not quite a nice option, since it applies to *all*
keys), or "--encrypt-to".  I don't see why we should have to use a

--trusted-key isn't necessarily a good option to use it still requires you
to still sign the key being used to encrypt.  I can think of a variety of
scenarios where this is not a viable option.  And you certainly don't want
have use --trusted-key directly on the key you are encrypting with,
because that introduces other problems, such as that trust filtering down
to other keys, validating them when you don't want to.

Actually, it's a little more complicated than that.  It's not simply *you*

If one of your recipients doesn't 'agree' to having message encrypted to
him (e.g., doesn't have a public key, publicly posts all of his/her mail,
etc), then there's nothing you can do.  You can only make a 'best effort'.

Ah. Here's a reason to have a wipe function in GnuPG, similar to

   not be enough for some people.
While this has been pointed out before (and I'm not picking on you, Len),
I don't think it would be a good idea of GnuPG to try to emulate
everything that PGP does.  What's next, PGPnet in GnuPG? :)
The idea of having a wipe command might intrigue some people, there are
many things out of the user's control that could totally eliminate the
possiblity of a wipe doing what you want.  For example, the filesystem has
to guarantee that you are writing over the same data, and not just writing
it out someplace else, and forgetting the old stuff.
So, the concept of a wipe is very system-specific, and should stay out of
GnuPG's realm.  There are several wipe programs out there, feel free to
choose one of many.  You aren't guaranteed any of them will work for you.
I should note that on FreeBSD there is "rm -P" which has wipe-ish
behaviour.  I expect you are sort of guaranteed that it works like you'd
expect due to the "whole system deal" you get with FreeBSD.

xmldsig is not an actual cryptographic protocol, but more of a means of
using helping defining what has been signed in an XML document.  The idea
is that an xmldsig document "I'm running a signature over these elements,
but not these, (they're part of form data)".  The actual cryptographic
signature comes from OpenPGP, S/MIME, or similar, and inserted into the
xmldsig document.
Part of the whole mess is the important concept of canonicalization; the
xmldsig-signed documents are canonicalized first before a signature is run
over them, so that the XML document can be transmitted in a variety of
different manners.  Once the message needs to be verified, the message is
re-canonicalized, and the signature verified.  This helps eliminate the
many problems of whitespace, etc, that have been a thorn in OpenPGP's side

the top page at   Furthermore, I'll bet it does
*not* pop into users' head to go to the website to check a FAQ.  They
expect programs to be self-explaining as much as possible.  Explictly
giving URL in warning is a great way to go.
Sorry Werner, but you haven't been a 'user' for a long time.

Nope.  Please look into using the passphrase-fd option.

@_subject: How should a front-end handle a stored passphrase 
First, I would highly recommend looking at using a program like
Quintuple-Agent to do passphrase-caching for you.  It is a generic
secret-holding program, and wraps nicely and transparently around GnuPG.
A lot depends on the language you are using.  If you are using a low-level
language like C on a POSIX system you might want to try memory-locking and
such.  But your users may not trust having your program be setuid root.
You also have strong control of actually wiping the memory-in-place if
need be.
If you are using a higher-level language, which abstracts the machine a
great deal, there isn't much you can do; they can have multiple copies of
data hanging all around the place.
You need to understand the threat models before you go off on a limb,
though.  Normally the threat is having the passphrase temporary swapped
out to disk, in a swap file/partition of sorts, or your program core-dumps
and is publicly viewable.  The swap partition problem is not too much of
an issue for most people; as long as the machine's superuser is trusted
(and the box is physically secure), even having the passphrase swapped out
isn't going to expose it.  And some OS's have encrypted swap so that
periodically (maybe only upon reboot?) all previous swap becomes
unavailable, so this threat is even minimized even further.

@_subject: Automation 
I automate it by using modules I've written for Perl and Python.  Each is
a fairly low-level interface, mainly doing the work of forking, execing,
and attaching filehandles to GnuPG.  You are then free to 'talk' to GnuPG
via these fh's.

GnuPGInterface (Python)

@_subject: signing keys 
The bit you are missing is the possible long-standing 'history' of signed
messages from a person.  Sure, you can spoof once or several times, trying
to get people to think your intended victim Vik uses the key 0x00000000,
but you can't erase the possible years of history Vik has of posting
messages to well-known lists using his true key, 0x11111111.  By analyzing
this history well, it will be much harder to fool people.
This is exactly why I'm creating a small tool which gathers signature
history from mail (currently processing mboxes), and provides simple yet
(I think) useful reports on what keys an email address has used to post to
mailing lists.  It's not a 'secure' means, but it is practical way to
complement the web of trust.

@_subject: wipe issues 
1) Wiping on most filesystems is quite unguaranteed at best.
2) Wiping has little to do with cryptography.  People just expect GnuPG to
have it because PGP did.  If PGP had an mp3 player in it they'd expect
GnuPG to have one too.

@_subject: Web of trust 
I agree that the WoT needs 'help', and that is the reason I developed
keystory, to help complement the web of trust:
The basic idea behind keystory is that you give it a bunch of email (e.g.,
by processing your incoming mail, or giving it an archive of a mailing
list), and it provides a bit of reporting about which email addresses sign
messages with which keys (keystory checks both clearsig and PGP/MIME
I keep a cgi-driven frontend to keystory available on one of my machines,
and every month I update it's database with the archives of the
gnupg-users and gnupg-devel mailing lists.

@_subject: double encryption 
Using the same cipher twice is one thing, but how about two different ciphers?  At best, you might get the benefit if twice the keylength (if you use different keys), and assuredness that if one cipher breaks, your message is still safe.

@_subject: double encryption 
The keylength might be that long, but the effective keylength of 3DES is
112 bits, not 168 bits.  For this reason, many implementation just use two
(alternating) DES keys.

@_subject: [Announce] Ann.: keystory 0.1.0 (initial) release 
Hash: SHA1
Announcing the 0.1.0 (initial) release of keystory:
keystory, by analyzing email history, gathers data on the usage of OpenPGP
signatures, and provides information to imperfectly, but practically
complement the web of trust, answering questions such as "What keys has
foo used, where and when?"
The homepage for keystory is at:
tar.gz's and RPM's can be found at:
I have put up a demo of keystory having a CGI interface at
The demo site contains information gathered from the gnupg-users and
gnupg-devel archives.
keystory requires Python 2.2 or later, GnuPG, and other Python modules
that are described in the README.
Noteworthy changes in 0.1.0

@_subject: Which keyring for Public Keys ? 
GnuPG follows your second description.  The 'keyrings' are inseparate
files, secring.gpg and pubring.gpg.
The concept of 'keyrings' is really an implementation issue, separate from
any specification.  An implementation could put all the keys in one
'keyring' (file/table/etc).
In common lingo a "my X keyring" is often used to mean "all the X keys I
have available to me".

@_subject: Re[2]: Licensing 
You don't epxect people to believe this trollish talk, do you?
First, there is no "free competition rule".
Second, if an author of GPL'd software sold copies to another party under
a non-GPL license, that party would likely have many more restrictions
placed upon them than the GPL does.  For instance, they likely wouldn't be
allowed to distribute any changes and would only be able to use it for the
purpose X and not Y.  The GPL grants both these freedoms.  The third party
would get a tradeoff of being able to resell/link to the product, but with
other restrictions put in place.
And you certainly don't seem to have a grasp of what the OSI is, and how
it differs from the FSF.

Searching on the terms "Pine GnuPG" instead of 'gpg' is probably better,
since the 'gpg' is just the name of the binary.
