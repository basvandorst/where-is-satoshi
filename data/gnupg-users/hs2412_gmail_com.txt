@_subject: Questions from a newbie 
Hi All
I need to travel a lot and send emails/proposals on the go. Mostly I
just carry my docs on a pendrive, rarely also carrying a laptop. So
even though I have known PGP for quite a long time and I tried my hand
at it, also at thawte, I never took it seriously since PGP needs to be
installed and all. Now I found GnuPG and liked it - its small and can
be carried on the pendrive easily. I have a few questions:
1. While creating the key, I noticed RSA is sign only. Does it mean an
RSA key cannot be used to encrypt? Why so - even RSA is now in public
domain I believe. PGP (the free version) also allows RSA keys. The
algorithm used instead by GnuPG is "DSA and Elgamal' which I havent
heard of and dont know if they are equally secure. Are these
compatible with PGP?
2. What happens if I loose the pendrive? They would not know the
password but they would have the secret key. Does it make it easier
for them to hack the messages I have already received, and possibly
the encrypted files I have stored on the same pendrive?
3. Is there a wipe function or a wipe software also available from Gnu
similar to the one offered by PGP? I need one that can be run from a
pendrive without installation.

@_subject: Decrypt only if signed 
I am writing a batch script and the basic requirement is that GPG
should only decrypt the file if its signed by using one of the keys in
the keyring. If it has not been signed, just encrypted, it should
leave it encrypted and not decrypt it.
The additional requirement, if possible, is that it should only
decrypt if signed by a specific KEY ID.
Please let me know if this is possible through GPG with some shell
scripting if needed.
Thanks & Regards

@_subject: Offtopic: Compiling a Windows program for Linux 
This is offtopic, but since all I am seeking is broad guidelines and a
lot of people here compile programs on Linux, I thought it easier than
to join a new list.
I have the source of a program about 2000 lines big, written for
windows. How much of an effort would it be, and what would be the
major changes needed in the source to have it compile for Linux. Also,
if someone could show me the command line needed to compile it, given
the source, the resource header and the .RC file that would be great
using GCC.
The following code needs changes in my opinion:
1. The program uses the registry to store persistent values. It would
need to change to use a config file.
2. The file access path needs to use the unix file structure
3. The code to access the save and other standard dialogs needs to change?
4. Can I continue to use windows.h? If not, what would it be replaced with?
5. The program allows saving a part of the screen to a bitmap. Can
someone tell me if that part of the code needs to change? And if so,
Thanks & Regards

@_subject: Social networking 
============================== START ==============================
Hi All
Current social networking sites have a major problem: anybody can
download your photograph and related details, edit them to his wish,
and repost on the same site.
I would suggest the following: building of, or using an existing WOT
and each person wishing to join the social networking site be asked to
get his profile (photo, name, DOB and some basic details) signed by
three people already in the WOT. Once this is done, a centralised
identity, sign the profile having verified the signatures by the other
three people. Uploads of the photo and profile to any social
networking site would then require a profile signed by the centralised
authority. An exchange of any secret can be done to ensure that the
person uploading the profile is the owner, and the basic details
entered by the uploader verified against those in the profile.
Does this make sense? Is there a way to make this work without the
centralised identity?

@_subject: PGP software pirated 
Hi All
Someone gave me a PGP signed message that unlocks the paid version of
PGP. Just to be sure it worked, I tried it and then uninstalled the
software (I dont use pirated stuff, GPG is much better for me).
However, does this mean that someone was able to find the private key
for the key PGP uses to sign licenses? If that could be found, then
probably our keys can also be cracked. While I personally find this
impossible, I want to know how the hackers were able to  give me a
signed message? Is it possible they tweaked PGP to use their private
key instead of PGPs and hence PGP is not really broken?

When a key is revoked using the revocation certificate, does it have
the same effect as reaching the expiry date of the key? In other words
if I set a key to no expire but generate a revocation certificate, it
is equally safe?

@_subject: Fwd: ECC - how does it compare 
Hi All
Thanks for your thoughts. I was also looking forward to your comments
on what NSA is saying. For one, they claim RSA is "old" even with
longer keys. Why are they making a case for ECC. Is it easier to
Another thing I could think of us that ECC key generation is like a
one-way hash. If you input the same password, given the same curve,
the key generated will always be the same. So, basically, there is no
randomness involved in key generation. Doesnt that make ECC more prone
to dictionary attacks?
---------- Forwarded message ----------
Hi All
I recently looked at software called 'seccure' which is available for
linux. Its a tool for public key encryption using ECC rather than
prime number factoring.
Here NSA is making a case for ECC.
One advantage that does seem to exist is that there is no need to
persistently store any part of the key - so the threat of someone
meddling with your key on the pen drive seems to be removed.
What do you all think about this?  Should we start building an ECC WOT? :-)

@_subject: SPOJ signature - may be offtopic 
The Sphere online judge is signing the certificates like this:
I am not able to understand if this is a simple hash of the contents,
or if this is a gpg-based sign (it doesnt look like correct format).
There is no public key on their site. Could anyone try and understand
what kind of signature this is, what hash function is used? Just
hashing the content doesnt prove anything - anybody could change both
the content and the hash.
Thanks & Regards

@_subject: Prime searching 
Could any one tell me the high-level prime search method employed by
GPG? Is it something like this:
- generate a random number
- is it prime? if yes, use it
- if not, continue adding ones to it until a prime number is found
Also, which algorithm is used by GPG for testing primality?

@_subject: playing with cryptography... 
Well, that may be true, but there are currently no options that are
significantly better. The WOT model used by GPG is better? Maybe, but
not significantly.
There is nothing that can prove who you say you are. State provided ID
cards only prove that you were able to convince the system that you
have a specific name.
Let me know if you feel differently.

@_subject: Use of gen-random 
I am sure people have still not explained at a level you would
understand. Hence I am having a go.
In physical terms entropy means the amount of disorder. Example, take
a square box and add some white marbles to it. then add some black
marbles. At this time all white marbles lie at the lower levels where
as black marbles are at higher levels. Which means there is order, and
entropy is less. Shake the box. Now entropy has increased.
In the same way, when you work on the PC, entropy generating processes
keep recording random data. For example each person has a different
typing speed/habbit. This is used as one basis for entropy. Another
way is disk access. When a process asks for random data, its given out
of the pool.
The story forward is well explained in the other replies.

Tried to figure this one out, but no direct clue. My suggestions:
create a shell script and call the shell script from perl, rather than
directly calling gpg with all the parameters. Second, try to print the
current user from within perl similarly as printing ~. These two might
give you some clue.

This is one way to avoid this. Have a "public" address and a private

Hi All
I need someone with a Safari browser to test something for me: it wont
take more than 3 min.
I have a webpage that unjumbles words, and which is somewhat popular.
I am building a new version which is AJAX based and the prototype is
ready. I have tested it on Opera, IE, Firefox (on Windows and Linux)
but do not have a way to test on Safari. Please do the following:
1. Navigate to 2. In the text box, enter 'llarec' (without quotes) and press enter. A
wait icon should be shown, and afterwards 'caller' should be
3. In the text box, enter 'otalt' and this time, instead of pressing
enter - press the Unjumble button. Same thing should happen, 'lotta'
should be displayed.
In no case should the form reload. Please let me know what happens.
