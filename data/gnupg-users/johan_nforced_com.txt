I think I see what your concern is, and I've thought about it a bit
myself.  My name is probably one of the most common names in Sweden.
There's probably several dozens of people named Johan Andersson in the
small city I live.
No documents I've read on signing keys and the web of trust have
mentioned this.  It's been on my find-out-more-list for some time.
Of course, the chance that my antagonist would be named JA as well, or
even find another JA to help, isn't that great.  And I'd sureley
notice if people sent me mail encrypted to the wrong key.  But then,
the damage could already be done.
