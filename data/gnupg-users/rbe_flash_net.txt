My files got corrupted so I had to fully reinstall.  Now I have a
new problem (same results) in that, no matter how often I point
it to my /.gnupg secret and public keyrings, they will not
recognize them.  Instead of error 512, I now get error 32256,
whatever that is.  I installed as root, but the /.gnupg
files were not removed in the full reinstall.  Any ideas on how
to correct this?

For some reason, after reinstalling my full system (which deleted
my old gnupg and geheimnis files) and reinstalling 1.0.4 and the
upgraded geheimnis, I have two errors.
(1) gnupg 1.0.4 lists my gnupg-1.0.3 secret key as invalid.
(2) geheimnis fails to list my key rings at all (GPA shows the
full key rings).  I DO have ~/.gnupg directory, as it was not

@_subject: Lost Secret Key 
I have asked this question repeatedly, but in response to something else, so here it is separated.  I generated a key pair using gnupg 1.0.3.  I recently upgraded to 1.0.4 (deleted 1.0.3). The upgrade preserved my options file.  When I run a check in 1.0.4 on the secret key ring, it gives "invalid key" as a result.  I am running eDesktop 2.4 (linux) on a 586 (200 Mhz), 128 MB system.
Geheimnis (perhaps Staatliche Geheimnisse would be a better name), can't find it at all and GPA finds it, but won't encrypt with it or decrypt files sent to me using the old public key.
Simple question: what happened to the key or what change in 1.0.4 would invalidate the key?  Can it be fixed, or do I need to regenerate a new Black Eagle

What kind of error are you getting?  I found that the ./gnupg/options file was set up without any " in front of the first three comment lines (commenting out).  The result was that it read the instructions as options and stopped at three "options" invalid.  Thanks to Armand, I commented them out (added " in front of those lines) and the program worked just fine.

I recently did an install on kde2.1 after crashing my linux system (eDesktop 2.4).  I had kde2.1 before the crash, but I had to reinstall everything except my user directories.  Now the encryption does nothing.  It asks for my passphrase, but does no encryption nor signatures. Any ideas what can be done?

@_subject: Identical session keys 
Hash: SHA1
For some reason, the gpg signature is identical for all emails I send out.  The only way I have been able to change it is to reinstall gpg.  It is my understanding that a sig is a guarantee that (1) the email is from me and (2) that it has not been altered.  If it's identical each and every time, then it's not a "session sig" and the email can be altered at will.
Any suggestions for getting different gpg sigs for different emails?  (For example, the one you're seeing in this email is exactly the same as it's been for the past week on all emails)
