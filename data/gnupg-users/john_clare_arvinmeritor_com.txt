@_subject: GnuPG Install Errors 
I am hoping that someone might have an insight into the install issues I am
First of all after downloding the source from the primary server I ran the
'fsum' utility
in 'md5sum' mode and got a perfect match to the checksum on the website:
83e02b4905dab34c4dc25652936022f9 *gnupg-1.2.1.tar.gz
My problem started when I untarred the source onto our UNIX Solaris
I received the following 'tar' error:
tar: directory checksum error
When I executed the./configure, after the 'tar', it aborted with the
config.status: creating checks/Makefile                           config.status: error: cannot find input file: checks/Makefile.in
Does anyone have any idea as to what caused my problem or where I can get
the missing file(s) ? John Clare
