@_subject: GNU for win32 
Just a quick Q. A while back (a year or so ago) it was mentioned in the
readme file that win32 version of GPG was nto to be considered secure
because its entropy generator was a bit ify. Now I can find no mention of
this either on the site or the Readme included w/ the binary. Can that be
taken to mean that its no longer a problem? Sorry if this seems a pointless
question, but better safe than sorry : )
PS: please CC me, I am not on the list.
    Thanks!
