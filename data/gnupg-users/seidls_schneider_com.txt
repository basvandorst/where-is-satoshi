@_subject: Key Expiration, need verification please 
About six months ago I began working with the GNUPG package for PGP
encryption.  When I first created the my key pair, I set an expiration time
for six months.  Shortly after creating the key pair I decided to update it
to a non-expiring key.  The original six month time frame is almost up, and
I need to know if there going to be any issues using that key pair.
Below is the output from the `--edit-key` option.  I am concerned that the
`sub` record still has the date of 07-28-2003 when it is supposed to be a
non-expiring key.  Can you please explain if that is a valid expiration
time, or if it is somehow left over from the initial key creation.

OK, can you explain what exactly the "sub" key is for?  I have received
keys from others that do not include the "sub" key, and
encryption/decryption works fine.

@_subject: Non-Zero return code on successful decryption? 
I'm not quite sure what you are looking for with your question.
What I can tell you is that in the shell script I am running, I check to
return code produced from gpg.  If this code is not zero, the script will
die and cause the team to get paged.
In the case originally describe, we were page and had to look into why the
particular file did not decrypt.  Running the same gpg command from the
command prompt appeared to run without issue (ie the file was decrypted).
What I was trying to determine by posting here is why the return code of 2
was issued, even though I could manually decrypt the file.
Can you please explain in more detail what would cause the gpg:
block_filter: 1st length byte missing message?   Did something not encrypt
fine on the sender side?  Was there an issue during the transmission of the
file?  What else can be done to determine the cause?
Thanks Everyone.

   It looks like you are using the program prngd to generate randomness,
   but prngd isn't running.  GnuPG needs a source of entropy, whether it
   is native to the OS, prngd, egd, or otherwise.  It won't run with no
   entropy source at all.

Also, a random_seed file was generated at compile time and placed into the

I have a couple questions around the maintenance/clean up of gnuPG key
1) We have gnuPG installed and used by 3 users on one Unix type server.
One of the 3 users was used for initial setup and testing of the gnuPG
software and is no longer used.  Is it possible to remove the key, and key
ring from this user?  Is it as simple as deleting the .gnupg directory
under that users home directory?
2)Is it possible to remove keys from the key ring if they are no longer
used?  Example: a key was imported for use a year ago, but is no longer
used for encryption/decryption.  Is there a way to remove it?

today handles text file, and some binary (read zip, or M.S. Office type)
files.  What will the impact be of adding the --textmode to the command, or
to the options file?

@_subject: Using subkeys to renew an expiring key 
I have been working on a process to encrypt data files and send it to other
organizations for processing.  As part of this process, we decided to set
our key to expire every year.  Last year we did not act before the key
expired and that same day added an additional subkey that would expire in
September, 2006.  We are now trying to be pro-active and work to "renew"
the key and distribute it before it expires.
I have two questions regarding how to "renew" this key.
1) Is the correct way to renew the key to add another subkey that expires
in September, 2007, or is there a better way?
2) If we do add another subkey that expires in September, 2007, how well
will the two subkeys work together?  It's going to be difficult to get
everyone to convert to the updated key in the same day, so we won't be able
to revoke the subkey at the same time we generate the new one.   Another
way to say this, we may be encrypting a file with the subkey added, while
one or more organization may be using the old key (without the new subkey)
and one or more organizations may be using the new key (with the new
subkey).  Will this work correctly??
Are there any other concerns that are being overlooked?

Your talking about document inbound to my process, encrypted by the other
organizations.  That should work without an issue as you pointed out, but
what about the outbound process?  In that instance we would be encrypting
the file and sending it to the other organizations to be decrypted... would
those orgainzations that haven't updated to the new key have problems
decrypting the file?

Good Point.  I wasn't thinking of that.  So for outbound documents, the
only issue that could exist would be verifying our signature if we are
signing the document?  Or is the signature part of the master key and
wouldn't be impacted by adding an additional subkey?

I have googled for the errors and have a work around in place (added
--always-trust to the options file), but am curious what would have caused
this issue, and what needs to be done to resolve?
Please note, this is using an older version of gnupg (possibly 1.0.6) on

@_subject: Trust Issue 
One of the options we tried to resolve this was to remove the key from the
key ring (--delete-key), re-import it, and then re-sign it.  We continued
to get the same error after completing those steps.  Shouldn't this have
removed any expired signatures?  Also, another user ID has the same key in
the keyring, and isn't having any issues.
Our key is setup to expire every year, and last year we added a new subkey
with a new expiration date.  So the key we use for signing does have one
subkey that is expired, and one that will expire in September.  Is this
contributing to the problem we are currently having?

We are beginning the process to upgrade our gnuPG installation from 1.2.1
to 1.4.4.  I have looked on the website, but have not found directions on
how to do this upgrade.  Can someone please provide me that information, or
a link to the site containing that information?
Also, what things should we be watching out for in the upgrade?  Are the
concerns or special steps that we need to take to be able to use the same

@_subject: gpg 1.4.9 (Unix) textmode file size limit 
I ran into an issue today when trying to encrypt a large file (18 MB) with the --textmode option.  We received the following error message from GNUPG: gpg: can't handle text lines longer than 19995 characters.  Can someone explain more about this error and if there are any other limits I need to know about?
I understand the cause of this error (18MB file without any CR/LFs), and that we really shouldn't use it.  I just want to understand more about this limit in case I ever encounter a need to have large records and the - -textmode option.

I am not a encryption expert, and need some help from the GnuPG user group.
We have a new software product that has the capability of encrypting
documents using SMIME.  How common is SMIME and used outside of email
clients?  Is it compatible with the OpenPGP standard, and thus GnuPG?  Is
there a good website discussing the differences between the two standards?

This works well if your willing to have the passphrase in the code base
calling GnuPG, but I'm not allowed to.  Instead I will be using a file with
the permissions restricted.   I will be able to get around this once
development is complete, as this is only being tested on my windows
machine, but will be deployed to Unix type server where the
---passphrase-file option is supported.

We use gnupg in an automated mode within the organization to encrypt/decrypt documents exchanged between companies.  The Key Pair we have is expiring soon and I am replacing it with a new key pair.  This new key would be provided to the other companies before the other expires.
I have a couple questions about the existing public keys we have imported to our key ring.
1 - it's my belief that I have to sign/trust each of the keys with the new secret key, is that correct?
2 - Is there any command to do a mass sign or must I do a gpg -u XXXXXXX --edit-key YYYYYY for each key?
3 - What other items am I not thinking of?

I am sending data to a vendor for processing and they are at times having issues decrypting our files.  We are ASCII armoring the file before we send it, and they are receiving a error of:
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=2d)
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=2d)
I've look at the file we sent to them and see no issues or extra data around the ASCII Armor header/trailer records.
Can someone provide more details on what would be causing this error?  I've seen this with Binary (non- ASCII armored) files.
I am using GNUPG v 1.4.9 to encrypt the files on a Linux box.  I can tell that the vendor is also using GNUPG from the error email I get, but I don't know the version.
