@_subject: Building pinentry on Windows 7 
I couldn't find any manual for building pinentry executables for Windows (specifically Windows 7/8). Also for Gpg4Win 2 in general. I know it should be cross-compiled, but there is not some up to date manual on internet, or I couldn't find it. Can you please give some detailed instructions on how to do it on Windows 7.
Since I am not subsribed to this mailing list, please add me to CC.

I've recently played around with MXE (  ) which is another cross compilation environment that aims to provide an easy way to handle dependencys for Windows.
To build a static pinentry-qt4 with it you can just set it up as documented on their homepage. Drop the attached pinentry.mk in mxe/src/ and do "make pinentry"
Worked like a charm for me on a debian wheezy system.

Thanks for reply. I have did all that you wrote in the previous mail. I have dropped the pinentry.mk that you attached in the email to the mxe/src folder, but it won't work. But, just some moments ago i have successfully built the whole Gpg4Win :), by following the instructions from the README file from the source code. I figured out that the package name for installer is nsis, and not makensis, it is also mentioned in the Basic requirements section of the README file.
Right now, by building the whole gpg4win i have succeeded in what i wanted, but i will certainly try again with MXE to see what is the problem there.
Thanks for your kind responses.
Best regards and cheers to all.

Ah, such things happen, i'll see to it that the download url is updated.
makensis is part of the package nsis, which can be installed with "apt-get
install nsis"
Yes pinentry is not included in mxe. I have written a .mk file for it and
attached it In my Mail from Wednesday. You should have dropped that
pinentry.mk file into the src directory of mxe.

There are no problems in building the whole Gpg4win installer. It was my mistake, i thought the name of the package was makensis as reported from Terminal, because at first i didn't look at the 'Basic requirements' section in README file. So, i installed all needed packages, and after that, successfully built the Gpg4win installer on Debian 7.2. I have tested the installer on Windows 7 and it works like a charm.
Best regards,

Unfortunately this kind of problems happen from time to time.  You may
delete the claws-mail tar package from the packages directory to avoid
all the Claws dependencies.
Configure should have listed stow as missing, or am I wrong.
Under Debian the package is "nsis".
Sure, that is due to NSIS?  If so it would be a Debian packaging bug.
