Hello List users,
I have recently added a new user ID to my keyring, and now all my message=
s are=20
signed with the new user ID... I would prefer to use my former id to post=
 to=20
some people ... is it possible to revert this behavior?
In the gpg interface when I "--edit-key" I see a dot before the new ID...=
 is=20
it to mark it as my default ID ? is there any way to mark the first one a=
the default ?
Thanks in advance.

First of all thank you for your prompt answer, but I use gpg 1.0.6 and do=
 not=20
see this option documented anywhere in the man page. When I try this opti=
it says :
Invalid command  (try "help")
Is this a new command from gpg 1.2.x ?
Is there any compatibility issues if I upgrade from 1.0.6 to 1.2.x ?
Thanks for your time.

you just need to select it as the UID you want to work on:
uid #
where # is the number shown on the photo line, it should add a star "*" jus=
after the number like that
(3)* [jpeg image of size 1798]
 and then issue a "deluid" command that's all..
