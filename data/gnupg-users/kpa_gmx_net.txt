@_subject: cipher 10 not found 
I downloaded GPG 0.9.3, unpacked it, and ran configure; make; make install
on it. Everything worked fine, I was able to start the program and to
clearsign files as well as signing them. But when I try to encrypt a
message, I get the error message
gpg: Ohhhh jeeee: cipher 10 not found
What does this mean? Is ElGamal support not compiled in by default? I
really can't imagine this... What can I do to make GPG enrypt my
I have Debian Linux 2.0 running here, that is, glibc is installed, if
this helps.
Although I get these ugly error messages, I think GPG is really great
because it can be used with PGP and is completely free. Thank you for
this great piece of work!

No MUA-battle, please, but mutt seems to be perfect when being used with
GnuPG. The program is written by Michael Elkins, a coauthor of RFC2440,
which describes the OpenPGP-standard, and thus mutt's OpenPGP-support
rules and, despite of this, is unique.
Other people like to use pine and pgp4pine, and there are a hell lot of
people who like this. The good thing - or, for the mutt user, the bad
thing - about this is that it doesn't use OpenPGP's MIME-types, and thus
you have no problems with reading the messages with any MUA (Outlook for
example has problems with OpenPGP).
There are more MUAs with PGP-support, as XFMail, which is easy to use,
and Emacs, which is, ..., I don't comment on this :) But pine and mutt
seem to be widespread, and I prefer mutt.
Maybe you look at the "X-Mailer:"-headers in this list, in my archive,
mutt is the leading MUA, followed by ELM, Emacs, XFMail and XCmail.
Wondering why pine is not in the list...

I guess you mean GnuPG 'cause this is the GnuPG list... Try this:
  gpg --encrypt --sign --armor --recipient  You have to replace  with your recipient's address or ID
("kpa for example), and  with the name of the file you
want to encrypt.

questions are not discussed.

Try to run configure with "--disable-adm". It works here on OpenBSD 2.5,
but it is a little bit slower. Another solution would be to use GNU
make, I haven't tried this yet.

Please send messages concerning GnuPG to the GnuPG mailing list at
gnupg-users Thanks!
There are two solutions for your problem: either you use gmake, or you
run configure with the --disable-asm.
Werner, this should be documented somewhere, maybe one can add the
comment that you should use this if you have problems compiling the
mpi-* files to the configure help.
