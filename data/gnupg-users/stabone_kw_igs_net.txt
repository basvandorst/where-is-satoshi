@_subject: binary RPM integrity 
kept looking at the release notes but couldn't find the right checksum for my RPM version which I downloaded from a mirror site.  If someone could tell me where I can find the output for the following RPM, that would be splended.  Thanks.
the rpm is:  gnupg-1.2.0-2rh72.i386.rpm
Please email me if you have the answer.  Thanks
