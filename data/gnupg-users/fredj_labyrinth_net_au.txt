@_subject: What is 'gpg: Warning: unsafe permissions on directory ' 
I keep getting this warning while trying to run GPG in
a Perl script in CGI on a remote Unix-type computer.
Changing file permissions makes no change and I am perplexed
by this message.
This message includes the directory the gpg files are in as well as the
files themselves.
gpg: Warning: unsafe permissions on directory
