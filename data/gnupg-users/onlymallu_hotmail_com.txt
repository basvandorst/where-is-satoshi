@_subject: RSA support in gnupg-w32-1.0.6 
I read that Gnu PGP has RSA support from 1.0.3.I have installed version 1.0.6 in windows 2000.I was able to import a RSA key and encrypt with this imported public key.
How can I create my own private and public RSA keys using version 1.0.6.When generating keys it does not ask for RSA.If this version does not support that, where can I find version 1.0.7 for windows.(I was able to find it for other OS)

How to bypass the passphrase while decrypting & prompt while encrypting.
I tried this for encryption,but did not work for me.
when I try ' gpg --lsign keyId ' , I am getting message
"key was already signed by key EF09865E Nothing to sign with key EF09865E Key not changed so no update needed."
But if I try to encrypt with command ' gpg -o outputFile --encrypt -r keyId test.doc '
I get this message "It is NOT certain that the key belongs to its owner.
If you *really* know what you are doing, you may answer
the next question with yes Use this key anyway?"
is there anyway to bypass this.
