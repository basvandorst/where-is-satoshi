@_subject: Analogien um das Prinzip von PGP zu =?ISO-8859-15?Q?erkl=E4ren?= 
da ich das gerade mit Matthias von der FSFE im Rahmen von  diskutiere, mal eine Frage: Welche Analogien benutzt ihr, wenn ihr Menschen das Prinzip von PGP/GPG erkl?rt?
Ich verwende ich meistens folgende Version:
Es gibt ein Schloss mit zwei Schl?ssell?chern. Jeder Schl?ssel
funktioniert nur in eine Richtung, also entweder Ge?ffnetes schlie?en
oder Geschlossenes ?ffnen. Daran kann man dann auch das signieren
erkl?ren, was ja bei der "klassischen Metapher" (?ff. Schl?ssel =
Schloss, priv. Schl?ssel = Schl?ssel) nicht funktioniert. Also:
Jemand verschlie?t mit meinem ?ffentlichen Schl?ssel, ich ?ffne mit
meinem geheimen.
Ich signiere mit meinem privaten Schl?ssel, jemand anders ?berpr?ft mit
meinem ?ffentlichen.
Anregungen, Meinungen?

I picked the wrong language / list last time...
So in English:
What metaphors do you use when explaining people PGP? Two examples:
1. A lock with two keys?
2. A lock (public) and a key (private)
Something completely different?
Problems with both:
1. Seems to be kind of hard to understand for most people, because a lock with one key to open and one key to close is rather special.
2. Signing emails is hard to explain this way. Signining by putting a lock on it?
Any ideas are appreciated.
An Interesting approach (Thanks Neal for the link): Using 4 items: key, lock, seal and imprint.

But how would you explain signing from that point of view?

You're right, the more I think about it, the more I like the idea of using  the terms "key, lock, seal and imprint". They differentiate between signing & encryption but are rather intuitive if you are not familiar with the technical details of PKI.

I think as a mascot some kind of animal is better, because it might be more attracting to new users that a rather 'cold' robot. unless you can crate a really cute robot of course! something like wall-e from that disney (?) picture.

Thanks for the new release,
Is there any further information you can provide regarding version 3
of the smartcard? Searching the web didn't give me any useful results.

Thanks for pointing me there. Really interesting. I wonder if "RSA

that they can't be transferred from an external device to the card.

Correct me if I'm wrong.

Hope this question is OK on this list.
What is the CA fingerprint on FSFE-Smartcard?
A gpg2 --car-status gave the information:
CA fingerprint 1 .: C485 A6CD 7EC6 6E9E EC33  65F2 70F2 75E4 C32F 6CA5
This is a smartcard issued by the FSFE. After reseting the card this
information is gone, so it must be applied by FSFE. I read the
openpgp-card-2.0 specification but I'm still not sure what this CA
data object is used for and what specific CA it points to. Maybe you
can help...

@_subject: How important are Admin PIN and Passphrase in this scenario? 
Hash: SHA512
I'm thinking about the following scenario:
There is a smartcard with subkeys for encryption, signing and
authentication. The secret primary key is stored encrypted (eg. a
truecrypt container) and only used on an airgapped, offline machine
when signing other peoples keys or changing the expiration date of the
subkeys. Assuming the truecrypt container uses a really strong
password (so bruteforcing is not an option), is there a need for a
strong admin PIN and a strong passphrase? I'm thinking about a threat
model for this and the attacker's options (BIOS/UEFI backdoor or
someone just 'looking over your shoulder'). In any case there seems to
be no really benefit of using extraordinary strong admin pin because
there are only three tries before the card get rendered unusable. The
passphrase is only used in the secure environment. So if the attacker
can find out the truecrypt password he probably can capture the
passphrase and/or admin PIN too. Am I missing something?
