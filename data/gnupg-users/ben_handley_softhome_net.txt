I don't know whether this is really a bug, or just says that it is. I
was playing around with the gen-prime command, and when i got to 10,000
bits i got:
gpg: Ohhhh jeeee: ... this is a bug (random.c:274:read_pool)
secmem usage: 0/0 bytes in 0/0 blocks of pool 0/16384
This happened repeatedly, it wasn't an isolated incident.
I'm not on the list, so if anyone feels like replying, send it direct.
