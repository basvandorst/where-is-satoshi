Hi David!

I could imagine that people would even create smaller keys, if the
restriction would be removed.
If you get suggested 1024 b and the limit is 4096 b I can understand that
people think "if 4096 is possible, it should work and why not use it?".
If you get suggested 1024 and there is no limit, there is nothing
that would give you the idea of generating 4096 b keys. Maybe you will
try a 10240 b key and notice that it's far to slow and you will then try
a key of the suggested size.
I guess it's just that if keys of 4096 b length are indirectly displayed
as possible, people will must more likely generate and use them.

This was a bit to fast. I can decrypt the message where I have the new
subkey ... but still I can't import this new subkey where I havn't had
it before.
At the computer I created the subkey I export it with "gpg

Stripe the unsigned data in your application yourself and you will also
know which part of the data you are processing has been signed and which
has not. If gpg stripes it you don't.

Hi Adrian!

If a MUA's MIME implementation is broken and can't display PGP/MIME,
it can be seen as a reason to use PGP/MIME as well ;)
An advantage I like as well is that PGP/MIME signed messages look better
in MUAs that do not support PGP at all (but support MIME).
