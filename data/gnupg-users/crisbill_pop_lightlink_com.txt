@_subject: executing from the web 
I'm certainly no expert, but I just got gpg working from the web.
When the web server runs gpg, it runs it under its username, which is
'nobody' on many
servers; on mine it's 'www-data'. Question: does that username, whatever
it may be,
have permission to write to /home/kinetec/.gnupg  ? gpg needs to write
to the directory
containing the public key, for some reason.
What does the error message say? It is stored in the file named after
Here's the command that finally worked from my perl script:
open (GPG, "|gpg --homedir /home/www-data/.gnupg --batch --always-trust
--no-secmem-warning --no-tty -a -r bill\ --encrypt -o
Hope this  helps,
Bill Carini
