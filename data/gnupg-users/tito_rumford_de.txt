@_subject: Is a secret key compromised by known cleartext? 
I'm sorry if this is a faq:
If I got an email with a message in cleartext immediately=20
followed by the same message encrypted to my public key --=20
would that change the status of my secret key (being secret)=20
abruptly to "being well known"?
