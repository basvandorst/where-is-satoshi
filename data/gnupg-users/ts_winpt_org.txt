@_subject: Windows Explorer shell extension 
I've started a new project with the aim to provide an easy to
use GPG shell extension for all Windows operating systems. And
the result is WinPTEE (WinPT Explorer Extension). It is a sub
project of WinPT but a standalone program you can use without
any additional programs (except GPG). Of course it is Open Source
and published under the GPL.
Currently only encryption and wiping are supported but this
will change soon. For the folks who want to test it, you can
download it here:  It's still
a beta version but it should be fairly stable.
If you've questions or problems with installing the package,
feel free to mail me.

@_subject: GnuPG Outlook Express plug-in 
a few minutes before I released the first version of GPGOE
(GnuPG for Outlook Express) and you can download it from  or the direct URL
With this plug-in you can easily encrypt or sign your messages
(OE version 5.0 or 5.5) without any detours or special programs. I only tested the plug-in on Win98 but I believe it should also
work WinME.
For more information how to use or install it, there is a README.txt
inside the zip archive. I know that OE is not the safest mailer,
but even so a lot of people use it and they should also have a chance
to protect their personal data.
Of course the plug-in is relased under the GNU GPL v2.

@_subject: GnuPG Outlook Express plug-in 
No, I said my plugin uses the S/MIME buttons to emulate GPG encryption.
And S/MIME is the secure variant of MIME (Multimedia Internet Mail
Sorry it was my mistake to tell something about S/MIME the plug-in
is PGP/MIME only and it only uses the OE S/MIME buttons to encrypt
sign messsages. The code doesn't produce any S/MIME signatures.

@_subject: GnuPG Outlook Express plug-in 
Hi Sascha,
My idea is to use a similar installer package like WinPT does.
That means it includes GnuPG, the GPGOE plug-in. Then the installer
do all the work and adds the registry entries so the user doesn't
need to do anything.
BTW, the plug-in also works with the new OE (6.0).
