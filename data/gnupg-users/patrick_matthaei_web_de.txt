Hello list,
I have got the following problem.
$ gpg --fingerprint "Patrick"
pub   1024D/7A5A6CC7 2006-08-15
      Key fingerprint = 1C54 FA0D 6F0F 5064 7A95  BBD3 D970 398A 7A5A 6CC7
uid                  Patrick Matth?i (Local Key) uid                  Patrick Matth?i sub   2048g/D6395C9A 2006-08-15 [expires: 2010-01-01]
sub   2048g/610BB46C 2008-11-11
In the past I added an expire to my key on --gen-key, which I later
changed to never expire.
A much more time later I saw, that my elgamal still has got an
expiration date and I can not find anything how I could change it.
Then I added a new elgamal, the 2048g/610BB46C one.
Is this right so? Can I edit the expire of the elgamal? What would
happen *now* if the elgamal 2048g/D6395C9A has been expired?
Please CC my while I am not subscribed and thanks. :-)

Hm the key 1 one was the right thing I searched weeks for!
I just thought I could select keys etc with 1,2,3 etc, with key I also
could select my elgamal :)
Okay now I understand it with the "key" cmd. Much thanks also for your
complete howto! :-)
