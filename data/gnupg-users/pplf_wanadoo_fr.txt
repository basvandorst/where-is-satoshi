I have upgraded from 1.0.6 to 1.0.7 and I have a problem with my trustdb.
My personal keys are untrusted !
I suppose it is neccessary to rebuild the trustdb ?
What is the best command to do that without losing my old 1.0.6 parameters ?

And Enigmail has some interesting advanced features (like : default=20
encryption with the "encrypt if possible" option).
And it is translated in german, french, polish and chinese :-)

But the freeware version has no plug-in at all (just PGPkeys and clipboard or file encryption). If you want use the e-mail plug-ins, you must pay for it... :-(

@_subject: 3 big problems slowing GnuPG diffusion 
For info, there is a controversy (particularly in France and in the pro-privacy non-governmental organizations) about the GnuPG strategy and the lack of PGP alternatives in Windows for newbie computer end-users.
I don't want to talk about the GnuPG team strategy, but I want to point 3 big problems slowing the GnuPG diffusion and which would be very easy to fix for them :
1) Rename the WinPT exe auto-installer "GPG for Windows" or "WinGPG"
-> The people don't understand why there is GnuPG, WinPT, GPGshell (!), etc.
2) Put the WinPT last stable version in the ftp.gnupg.org /win32 directory
-> The people try to download the win32 binary on ftp.gnupg.org and only find a command-line version, and they say :"GPG is an awful MS-DOS program, etc."
3) Delete all non-english pages (except german, I think) from  because there are outdated
-> The "tag" at the bottom of the page (in english !) is not enough. In the fren page, french people download a GnuPG 1.0.0 version and an alpha win32 binary :-(

@_subject: Is it *possible* to download GnuPG win32 GUI? 
I'm wondering : is it *possible* to succeed in downloading the GnuPG GUI for Win32 ?... :-(
I have helped a french Human Rights NGO (Reporters Without Borders / Federation Informatique et Liberte  to create a little french OpenPGP manual, easy to understand (as far as possible).
This french manual is at  and to help people who need strong *and* free encryption, this page has a link to the GnuPG GUI, called as you know WinPT (BTW, it is not easy to explain people why it is not called WinGPG or WinGnuPG or GnuPGshell, and what is GPG, GnuPG, WinPT, GPA, GnuPP, etc... :-(
Unfortunately, the link to winpt.org is... dead ! and the GPGOE (Outlook Express GPG plugin) page is also dead !
I would be nice to see the WinPT project hosted by a *real* web server with a *real* FTP server (lcsweb.net FTP has a ping very very slow).
Why not host WinPT at  and ftp.gnupg.org ?
You know, PGPfreeware 8.0 is coming, and I fear that users will be forced to use commercial softwares if if they cannot download free softwares :-(
PS : I have already said that 2 monthes ago, but the french pages at gnupg.org are completly outdated... Please, can you delete these old french pages (I can translate it and update the translation, I already purposed this to WK, and at least one other french people puprosed it also, but WK seems not interested, I don't know why...)
It is very sad that the french people coming at the home GnuPG page can click on a "french" link at  and discover that the last version is GnuPG 1.0.0 and the win32 version is 1.0.0c and is alpha :-(((
And sorry to be angry...

@_subject: Phil Zimmermann interview 
For info, Phil Zimmermann has done an interview here : But what he says about the GNU GPL encryption softwares can be understood by the professional users like a critic against GnuPG... :-(
Quotation :
" PRZ - I am familiar with the GNU GPL and the BSD license.
Q - Could they have been an alternative for PGP instead of making it PRZ - There is a place for products under different licenses. There is a place for products under the GNU GPL, also cryptographic products. However, GNU GPL is not enough for everyone's needs. Some software needs to be sold for profit. Some software can not depend on hobby-programming conducted on weekends and other spare-time by programmers having other day-jobs. There is a place for that. But PGP needs more focused development than that. "

@_subject: OpenPGP.org and GnuPG 
The web site  has no link at all for GnuPG versions on his page download : The links given to download OpenPGP are the pgp.com, pgpi.com, or web.mit.edu/network/pgp links.
The name "GnuPG" or GPG appears only at the "Members" page.
I think it is not a good thing : GnuPG is the most famous free OpenPGP version and it must be here.
Last week, I had a discussion by e-mail with Philip Zimmermann, and I said him some people may think he is misappropriating the name "OpenPGP.org", and that he done this because he sells PGP(tm)  and FileCrypt Philip Zimmermann replied me that the "Download" page at the openpgp.org web site was not updated since his beginning (2 or 3 years ago, I think), then he said me in another e-mail that I was "insulting" him.
Unfortunately, he didn't changed the "Download" page at  and GnuPG is still not there :-(
Do you think it is a good thing that GnuPG is not shown in the  "Download" page ?
I see by doing a whois that the domain "openpgp.org" is owned by the "OpenPGP Research Group".
