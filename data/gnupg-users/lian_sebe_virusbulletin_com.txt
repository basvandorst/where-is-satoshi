Hello Werner,
Thank you for your reply and apologizes for my slow reply.
The problem is that I am on CentOS 7 and this is the latest gnupg
version that comes with the distribution.
I can see there is no easy upgrade (no rpms or repository) readily
available and I am afraid that installing in from source might cause
some problems with any other parts of CentOS that depends on the other
version of gnupg or
libgpg-error, libgcrypt, libassuan, ....
Lacking any clear upgrade path I am forced to stick with the current
version and hope that my scripts will not receive another corrupt file.
Thanks again,

Hi all,
I have a python script that ran very well, each day decrypting files.
Few days ago the script has stopped at a certain encrypted archive and
the process was hanging since.
I have drilled down and what happens is that gnupg is actually tripping
on a encrypted file. Trying the decryption outside python, just with the
regular command line:
gpg -vv --decrypt 2018-06-14.tbz.gpg > 2018-06-14.tbz
after requesting for the passphrase it says:
gpg: 3DES encrypted data
:compressed packet: algo=1
:literal data packet:
??? mode b (62), created 1528912641, name="",
??? raw data: unknown length
gpg: original file name=''
gpg: block_filter 0x186f090: read error (size=13002,a->size=13002)
:compressed packet: algo=42
gpg: uncompressing failed: Unknown compression algorithm
and then it hangs like this for days!
Now, it might be a defective encryption with this file, I don't care
much. I'd just like gnupg to move over the errors, i.e. exit after
finishing processing or after unsuccessfuly trying to process the file.
So, 2 questions:
1. Is it "normal" to hang like this or it is a bug ?
2. Is there any option I can pass to gnupg in command line so that it
goes on in case of errors instead of hanging?
I use this version on CentOS 7:
