I have a question. I want to encrypt file that consists of one word for example 'home with AES'. When I did encryption I got file that is 49 bytes. How can I separate my encrypted 4-byte word from the rest of file. I need only encrypted part of my word, I don't want to implement AES on my own.
Best regards

I need clear encryption output not only for AES, but also for DES, RC5 and BLOWFISH so I taught that GnuPG is universal tool but in that case it looks I have to find separable encryptors for all of these methods.
Best regards

I think that OpenSSL is very good for my purposes, Thank you very much
