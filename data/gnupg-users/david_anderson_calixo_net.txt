@_subject: Using GPGME 
Hi all
First of all, apologies if this is not the right group to ask about GPGME. It seemed to be the best...
I am currently working on a projet which requires both authentication through signature verification and encryption of a session key.
I believe, through exploration of the texinfo manual, that I have managed to initialise libgpgme, create a working context. I also understand how to shuffle data through signature/verification and encryption/decryption. My only remaining obstable is how to retrieve the   keys!
Right now, our program is given the KeyID to use, and it must first look for it in the local keyring (with private section if required by the specific task), then search on a keyserver for the public part if all else fails. How would I implement this using gpgme functions? I can see that I must set the key location mode to either local or external, but the workings of the browsing/selection of a key elude me...
Thanks in advance for any help you can give me
David Anderson
