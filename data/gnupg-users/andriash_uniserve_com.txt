Hello Chad,
Why don't you come by and join our PGP-Basics Group. There are a lot of
Linux Users, and we don't just talk about PGP... but GnuPG as well. In
fact, I would say almost 50% of our Members are using GnuPG. Lately, on
our PGP-Basics-OT List we are talking about a lot of Members switching
over to Linux from Windows, so if you are so inclined, we could use your
help with Linux there. Here are the relevant links:
Hope to see you there...

You need to download the latest version of GnuPG, which is now 1.0.4(a) and
is now listed on the GPG Download page.

Hello Bo,
I presume he has a current copy of your Public Key? One problem may
simply be that he hasn't, or that he is forgetting to add you to the
recipient list when he encrypts.
