I'm afraid I have to disagree. From Wikipedia:
"Simple redundancy checks are known as checksums. They include parity
bits, check digits, and longitudinal redundancy check. Other types of
redundancy check include cyclic redundancy check, horizontal redundancy
check, vertical redundancy check, and cryptographic message digest."
"Checksums and Cyclic redundancy checks (CRCs) are quite distinct from
cryptographic hash functions, and are used for different applications. If
used for security, they are vulnerable to attack; for example, a CRC was
used for message integrity in the WEP encryption standard, but an attack
was readily discovered which exploited the linearity of the checksum

Patenting software in EU remains divisive - EP kills directive on harmonising
Using its muscle like never before, the European Parliament has thrown out
a controversial bill to harmonise patents on software. This was in the
face of a united position of the 25 member states. Such a rejection at
only the second reading for the EU legislature was unprecedented. The
assembly was too divided to muster the absolute majority needed to amend
the bill; And so the lawmakers decided 648 votes to 14 to kill it. The
European Commission warned that the result would cause fragmentation among
25 competing patenting systems in Europe.
The bill's main handler in parliament, Michel Rocard, said: "The argument
which brought about such a broad-based and firm decision to reject was the
parliament's wish to send the member states and the Commission a strong
signal: don't keep treating parliament in this way." Advocates for free
software had feared the Directive on the Patentability of Computer
Implemented Inventions would choke innovation... that this would let big
firms patent software that small operators feel should be publicly
available. But both sides drew some comfort from the outcome.
A leading policy voice among the main big firms said that at least
innovators' intellectual property protection was still in place, which is
critical for European competitiveness. One supporter of free software and
small developers said reverting to the current system was better than
having to accept a bad bill.

@_subject: Filename for digests 
Yes, I agree that the standard format is the best one to use, but I was
asking about the name of the file, not it's format. For example, if I'm
going to share a directory with 1000 files, it would be inconvenient to
save each file's hash as a separate file, and just add a .sha1 extension
(resulting in 2000 files). So therefore I would store all the hashes in
one file. But what should this file be called? sha1sums? hashes.sha1?
digests.sha1? Is the .sha1 extension important? If there really isn't a
standard for this, then if the user don't know if hashes are included or
not, she or he would have to open all the files witch she or he suspect
might contain hashes (like readme, info, important etc.), witch would be
very irritating.

Naming a file containing hashes CHECKSUMS would not be a good idea, since
a hash is not the same as a checksum. I think sha1sums, sha256sums,
sha384sums etc. would be a better option. Does any important applications
(i.e. Free Software) make use of the .md5 or .sha1 extensions?

@_subject: Additional self-signature 
Using the release candidate for version 1.4.2, I imported my public and
secret key, and just like with version 1.4.1 I got double self-signatures
on it. I then deleted the first one, exported both keys, deleted my
keyring, imported the keys, and the double self-signatures were still
there. I then did the same again, only this time I deleted the second
self-signature instead of the first, and this way I got rid of the extra
self-signature. With another keypair it worked the other way; by deleting
the first self-signature I got rid of it. I suspect that this depends on
if you import the public or secret key first, and that this sets the order
of the self-signatures. Anyway, is this the way it is meant to work? Would
it not be better to have the additional self-signature automatically
deleted when importing the keypair?

@_subject: Passphrase Encoding and Entropy 
If I'm not misinformed the passphrase can be encoded using different
character sets. Can I in gpg change witch one is used, or does it depend
on witch operating system I use? How does it affect the way you calculate
entropy if a character is encoded using 16 or 24 bits (as some characters
are in UTF-8) or as a 8-bit character, if at all?
Also, let's say it is known that the characters in a passphrase has been
selected from the 64 ASCII characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9, # and $. This will
give each character an entropy of 6 bits (log2(64)), witch if I understand
correctly means that 6 of the 8 bits used to represent the character are
unknown. But can you in real life tell witch six, for example for the
character A, witch in binary is 01000001? The first zero will of course be
known, but is there a second known digit?

@_subject: Passphrase Encoding and Entropy 
Thanks for your anwser, but I'm afraid you mostly told me what I already
know. What I don't understand is how this relates to breaking passphrases.
For example, say I use the passphrase foobar. It has 6 characters, each
represented by 8 bits, so it will be represented by 46 bits. These 46 bits
are then the key used to symmetrically encrypt/decrypt my secret key,
right? (Another question; is salt added to it, and/or is it hashed?)
Now if the attacker knows that I have only used the 23 characters a-z in
the passphrase, then she/he can represent all of them using 5 bits. But I
don't understand how this helps the attacker, since foobar represented
this way would obviously produce a completely different key (of only 30
I thought that all this was about time and the amount of data you have to
deal with. That, for example, when someone is brute forcing a passphrase
it would be 25% faster if all the characters used were represented with
only 6 bits instead of 8. I understand why this would be faster, but not
who it could possibly work.

@_subject: passphrase or random characters the safest 
If you want to use words, then I would suggest that you select them from
different languages. Then the attacker will have to use a very large
dictionary, one containing all words from all languages, if she or he
don't know or can't guess from witch languages you have selected your
words. This kind of passphrase will still be relatively vulnerable to a
brute force attack, since the attacker can limit the characters used in
the attack to letters, so throwing in a few special characters between the
words is a good idea.

It's hard to say what is the best solution for someone, without knowing in
what kind of situation that person is. The more security you have, the
more inconvenience it will cause you. You need to find a balance that is
right for you.
The secret key is already encrypted, that's why it needs to be decrypted
(using the passphrase) whenever it is needed. I would think that this is
enough security for most people. To encrypt it once more is really only
necessary if a person want to hide the fact that it is a secret key.
Personally I keep my secret key on my hard disk, because I find it more
likely that I will be arrested and have my USB-stick confiscated, than
that my computer will be hacked.

that doesn't seem to change the key, only the way gpg handles it (when
exported it's still the same). Included below is the output from pgpdump,

Re-signing the key was the first thing that came to my mind when I saw the
"this may be caused by a missing self-signature" message, but it doesn't
help (see below). As you can see, deleting the self-signature and then
re-signing the key, only changes the public key (sha1sums match for the
old and new secret keys). And it's the secret key that gpg has a problem
with, because I don't get this message when importing only the public key,
but it appears when importing only the secret key. The message reads "this
MAY be caused...", but can anyone confirm that this actualy is an issue
about the self-signature (or lack of) on the secret key? I suspect that
there is something else wrong with the key (why would the self-signature
have disappeared?). Any ideas?

I keep my case open, so I would notice that. There enough space for a

a keylogger would be placed?
Can you give me a few hardware related examples, that will work against
someone booting from a live CD/DVD (or better, booting from an USB-stick
and first checking the hash of the CD/DVD before using it)?
Well that is debatable, but I'm sure we all agree on that it is one of the

There are several, see  and
 for examples. These are too
obvious, and the police most likely will put the keylogger inside the
keyboard or inside the case of the computer.
I have my computer on the floor, and can easily see all sides without
turning it. Mounting a small mirror behind the computer might be a good
solution to this problem for some.
I choose to live alone (for security reasons) so what I worry most about
are keyloggers and microphones. Here in Finland the police have a special
group investigating us (animal rights activists), and we have caught one
infiltrator, so considering this I don't think that it's a sign of
paranoia for me to occasionally check for keyloggers.

keyrings they can see in what order I have imported the keys. It would
also be convenient if you would get a sorted list with --list-keys.

@_subject: Questions about generating keys 
I'm about to generate a new keypair, and got a few questions.
I have many e-mail addresses and change them frequently, and therefore I
don't want to have one in my public key. (Also because I'm afraid of
getting spam.) I think this would be easier than having to update a lot of
user IDs. Are there any any drawbacks in not having an e-mail address in
the public key? Are there any widely used applications that will expect
one, and not work if none is found?
Why is there no way to generate a RSA keypair in one step, like when you
create a DSA/Elgamal keypair? Why do I first have to create a signing key,
and then in a separate step create an encryption key? This is annoying.
"Name must be at least 5 characters long"
Why? There are probably many people who like to go only by their first
name, and have a 3 or 4 character name.
Is there any way to manually set the time that will be used for the
creation time? Or do I have to change the system time if I don't want to
use the current time? I'm a bit of a perfectionist, and think 00:00:00
looks much better than something like 01:42:57.

I prefer RSA keys because
- DSA does not have a hash firewall.
- They don't have a 1024 bit limit, like DSA has. I know "DSA2" can have
  larger keys, but last I heard PGP can't use them.
- The hash used is not limited to 160 bits, like it is with DSA.
- RSA is faster.
I can't understand why RSA isn't the default. The only argument defending
DSA I've heard is that DSA creates smaller signatures. Is this really so
important to people that they are willing to give up all the benefits of
RSA for it?
I understand, but surely an RSA keypair must be such a common thing
that it could have it's own option? What I find really strange is that
the archives mention a sixth option, "(6) RSA (sign and encrypt)", but
version 1.4.6 gives me:
Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) DSA and Elgamal (default)
   (2) DSA (sign only)
   (3) DSA (set your own capabilities)
   (5) RSA (sign only)
   (7) RSA (set your own capabilities)
Why was the sixth option removed?
By the way, is there a security or performance difference between a
RSA (sign and encrypt) keypair with no subkeys, and a RSA (sign only)
keypair with a RSA (encrypt only) subkey?
Nice! I'm curious about what these reasons are.
Sorry, I forgot to say that I don't use any keyservers. Only my
friends can get my private e-mail address and "private" public key.
That's ok, since they would have the same problem if the address
in my key differed from the one in their address book. Since
not specifying an e-mail address doesn't seem to go against the
OpenPGP specification, I think I won't specify one when I create
my new key.
I'll keep that in mind in case I'll ever need it.
Thanks everybody for your anwsers!

Robert J. Hansen wrote (regarding "DSA2" keys):
That's good news. Can it also create them? But there are probably still
many using older versions. I know some who refuse to update from 6.5.8.
I wasn't aware of this, thanks for the info!
Ok, so RSA isn't always significantly faster, as I thought it was. I had
read somewhere that it was, (probably on this list) and my own testing
with my 4GB backup files showed RSA to be notably faster.
So would it be fair to sum up the differences like this:
- for signing DSA is faster, for verification RSA is faster,
  but there's not much of a difference.
- OpenPGP implementations must support DSA, but supporting RSA
  is optional, but both gpg and PGP support RSA, so there's
  not much of a differance.
- original DSA limited to 1024 bit keys and 160 bit hashes.
- DSA signatures are smaller.
- updated DSA, aka "DSA2", equal to RSA when it comes to the
  lenghts of keys and hashes.
- Of PGP, only the newest version support DSA2 keys.
- RSA has a hash firewall
If there are no other significant differences that I have missed, since I
want a key larger that 1024 bits, it must be a DSA2 or RSA key. RSA gets a
minus for not being required by OpenPGP, but only a small one since it is
supported anyway. DSA2 gets minus points both for lack of support in older
versions of PGP, and for lack of a hash firewall. RSA still seems better
to me, but not by as much as I previously thought.
So they accepted RSA into the standard, while it was still restricted by
patents, as long as it wasn't made the default? I took for granted that an
open standard like OpenPGP would not have accepted any patented stuff into
the standard, and that RSA was added later, after the patents ran out. I'm
a bit sad to find out I was wrong, I was under the impression that OpenPGP
only allowed completely free and open algorithms.
If the IETF refused to make RSA the default, does that mean that the
people behind OpenPGP originally wanted it to be the default, but then had
to change it to DSA?
I would not say that just because someone doesn't willingly make their
address available to spammers makes them a believer in security through
obscurity. Full disclosure is not a good strategy when it comes to
personal information like e-mail addresses, credit card numbers etc.
Saying that going through a little trouble to greatly decrease the risk of
something bad happening is not worth it because it won't make you 100%
secure makes no sense. That's like saying that you can't get 100%
protection from dying in a car crash, so therefore don't bother using a
For example, this list has a public archive with the posters e-mail
addresses, so spammers can easily get them. Having a separate account for
e-mail lists that deletes everything not coming from the lists is not much
trouble, but it makes it a lot harder for the spammers to get your
address, if it is not available anywhere on the web. Spammers also find
addresses by sending out mail to common names at different domains, to see
if they bounce back or not. So mary at gmail.com will get spam even if she
never gave out her address to anyone. Adding a number to the user name is
little trouble for you, but makes things much more difficult for the

Well if you need to have an e-mail address available to the general public
then this is certainly true. Spammers have even been known to hire cheap
labor to surf the web looking for e-mail addresses and filling in spam in
forms, so even hiding your address in a blurred upside-down JPEG won't
If you have security unaware friends who type in your address on "send
your friend an ecard" type of sites, or have you in their address book on
their Windows box full with spyware, then the spammers will get your
address, no matter what you do.
But if you don't need a public address, and only have security conscious
friends, then I would think you have a good change of staying of the
spammers lists.
Yahoo! has a nice free service called AddressGuard. You just create a base
name (foo) and append an ID (bar) to it, and now you have a disposable
address: foo-bar at yahoo.com, witch delivers mail to your normal Yahoo!
address. You can have 500 different IDs, so you can give a different
address to each of your friends, and check who is leaking your address.
Those are all good things, but just because we have them does not mean
that it's not a good idea to try to stay of the spammers list in the first
place.  Personally I'd like to see more aggressive anti-spam measures,
like the ones taken by Blue Frog.
User IDs do not provide any authentication, so security wise they are
useless. The most secure thing would be not to have one at all, and have
my friends remember that key number xxxxxxxx belongs to me. This way, if
my friends get raided, it will be more difficult or impossible for the
police to figure out that it's my key. But since this is very
inconvenient, I decided to sacrifice a little security for convenience, by
putting my first name in the user ID. I don't provide an e-mail address
mainly because it's easier to change my e-mail address if I don't have to
update my key, but this undeniably also makes things a little harder for
spammers, since it's one less place they can find my e-mail address. It
might also help in a deniability claim. I don't however think that it's
too much to ask that people remember witch e-mail address goes with witch

@_subject: Questions about generating keys (hash firewalls) 
That was a very good explanation of what a hash firewall and a
second-preimage attack are. But I think it gives the impression that all
the hash firewall is good for is protecting against a second-preimage
attack, and therefore is of little importance, since a successful
second-preimage attack on SHA-1 is very unlikely to happen.
A much more real threat than the second-preimage attack is the birthday
attack. The attack is based on the birthday paradox, which deals with how
many people there need to be, for the chance to be over 50% that two will
have the same birthday. The answer is 253 pairs.
So if we start with Bob, we need to have 253 more people, to be able to
make 253 different pairs of which Bob is part of. This can be compared to
the second-preimage attack; trying to find a message that hashes to a
given hash. However, if we don't need to start with anyone in particular,
and just take 23 people, we can make the same amount (253) of different
pairs from only these 23 people. This is how the birthday attack works;
trying to find any two messages that hashes to the same hash, and as shown
by the birthday paradox, this is much more likely to succeed than the
second-preimage attack.
This is how it could be used. I take two pictures, one offensive and one
nice. The resolution is 2048x1536, which means they contain 3145278
pixels. If I change a pixel 5 shades darker or brighter, it will be such a
small change that it won't be noticed. So I have 11 (original+5+5)
alternatives for each of the 3145278 pixels. This means I can make
11^3145278 versions of each picture. That's so many that not even
calculators designed to show very large numbers can show the result. Now I
compare all the hashes from one picture to all the hashes from the other.
If I find one version of the offensive picture and one version of the nice
picture that have the same hash, I sign the offensive picture and send it
to someone, and can then deny I did so and show the nice picture with the
same hash as proof.
If I have signed the picture with a key with a hash firewall, the receiver
knows (in a perfect world) that in the attack I could use different
algorithms, but am limited to using only collisions between hashes made by
the same algorithm. If I don't use a firewall the receiver knows that the
attack would be much easier for me, since I could use a "collision"
between different algorithms.
Do hash firewalls have any drawbacks (performance decrease, difficult to
implement, patent issues etc.)? What's the reason DSA doesn't have one?

My first guess would be that you are in one of your friends address book,
and your friend has spyware that got it.
If the amount of resources are so small that even combined they are
insignificant, then why not use both?
Everyone who gets sent spam isn't on one single list, which all the
spammers use. Spammers get their addresses in different ways, so different
spammers will have different lists. Lists are valuable, you can make money
by selling a list of working addresses, so they are not likely freely
shared between spammers. The fewer lists you are on, the less spam you
will be sent. It's not an all or nothing deal. Just because you won't be
able to be totally free from spam, is that a good reason to carelessly
leave your address all over the Internet?
Yes, it's logical to use the measure(s) that gives the best results for
your amount of time and effort. It's also logical to use all of the
measures that gives you or you contacts no inconvenience at all.
You are confusing authenticity and trust. I you visit Bob and he gives you
his fingerprint, and when you get home you see that it matches the one on
his key, then the key is authenticated. If you now get Marys key, with a
signature from Bob, this does not make Marys key authenticated! Bob might
not know much about security, and have been tricked to signing a false
key. He might secretly hate you and have created "Marys" key himself.
Someone might hold his cat hostage and force him to sign false keys. The
point is that even if Bob is your best friend and a security guru who has
no cat, his signature is still not a 100% guarantee that the key really
belongs to Mary. All the signature provides is various degrees of trust.
I have an account on a server run by a trusted party, which has an
encrypted connection for accessing e-mail accounts. Most of my friends
have accounts on the same server, so our messages to each other never
leaves the server.
Traffic analysis will reveal what time you are active, and how much data
you are transferring. To only way to protect against it is to download and
upload all the time at a constant rate. Not worth it in my situation.
I don't think there's anything wrong with saying that I want to protect my
privacy. I think if asked if they care about privacy, most people would
answer yes. I have been sent letters by the police on several occasions
telling me that my phone has been listened to (by law they have to inform
you of this some time after). I had my car confiscated and searched. So if
I know they are interested in me, surely the strange thing would be if I
did not try to protect my privacy? I never said I was concerned about
getting raided, I said if someone else got raided it's not good if they
find info about me there.
Heh, I certainly don't think that only encrypting e-mail and signing
backups with GnuPG will somehow make all aspects of my life secure. I
don't know how you got this impression. I also use TrueCrypt for whole
disk encryption, BCWipe for secure deletion, TOR for anonymity, a good
firewall, and all my machines run Linux and my "supersecure" machine is
never connected to the Internet.
My needs are not high level, and I don't really need security for anything
other that paying bills online. But it's nice to have some privacy, and
security is a very interesting an inexpensive hobby.

I only meant to point out that a birthday attack would have a much better
chance of finding a collision than a second preimage attack. I'm sorry if
I made it sound trivial, I know it's not. I just tried to give an example
of how it works that would be easy to understand.
I'm pretty sure the process is called a birthday attack, weather it's
successful or not, and no matter how few hashes you use. So even if you
only compare the hash values of "a", "b" and "c" in hope of finding a
collision, it's still a birthday attack.

That the key is authentic means that it is the key Bob wanted you to have,
and has not been changed in a man-in-the-middle attack or by any other
means. That's all. You can be sure of this if the fingerprint matches. You
do not need to trust Bob for the key to be authentic. Bob can be the

you also need to trust him. Authentication can exist without trust, and
trust can exist without authentication, but only both combined creates

Or if you see someone you don't trust, can your eyes then not authenticate
to you that the person is who you think they are? Of course they can,

The point of certificates is for you to be able to verify that you are on
the site you think you are, and not a fake one. If you go to somesite.com,
and the certificate is ok, then the site is _authentic_. If the
certificate is not ok, then someone might have messed with your DNS
settings or hosts file, making somesite.com go to the wrong IP, and the
site you get is then fake.
To say that a site isn't authentic because you don't trust the information
on it or the people that run it makes little sense. Does McDonald's not
have an authentic site because we don't believe them when they say their
food is healthy? Is politician X's site authentic because we agree with
him/her, but politician Y's is not, because we disagree with him/her?

Yes you can trust your friend Trevor, and yes weather you trust him or not

I would rather have:
-This thing is authentic, because I have verified it myself.
-I trust this thing, because someone I trust and have verified claims it
to be.
Yes, that's logical.
No then it's only trusted. The signature on the key is authentic, yes, and
the public key you use to verify the signature is also authentic. But the
information, someone claiming that another a key is authentic, is only
trusted. You can't verify that your friend isn't lying to you by using any
kind of crypto. This is the weak link in the chain which brings everything
down to the level of trust.
The key would be authentic if you had verified it yourself.
It doesn't. Verifying the fingerprint would make it authentic.
If there are other people besides yourself involved in the chain, and they
are providing information which you do not verify, only trust, then yes,
trust is the weakest point. But that does not mean that everything in the
chain is only trusted. Somewhere in the chain we could have 5+5=10, and we
do not need to trust this, we can be 100% sure of it.
You can trust Trevor, but this trust is useless if you have no way of
authenticating that Trevor really is Trevor.
Trust is not needed for authentication. You can authenticate a lot of
things just by looking at them, your friends for example.

@_subject: RSA or DSA? That's the question 
There was a lengthy discussion on this list about the differences between
RSA and DSA a few weeks ago. I suggest you read it, it contains a lot of
information. The list's archives are located at:
One thing I forgot to mention in that discussion, is that since DSA is the
default, there are probably many more DSA keys in use currently than RSA
keys. (If anyone has any statistics that would be interesting to see.)
Therefore, if a government were to invest serious time and effort in
breaking public key crypto, they would probably attack DSA, not RSA, in
order to get the most for their money. I'm not saying either one is weak
and could not stand such an attack, but if there's less pressure on RSA,
then I would consider that to be a benefit.
I would recommend to never automatically use the defaults. Thoroughly
research the differences between all the options, and then decide what is
best for you. The defaults are not always the most secure. For example,
Rijndael was not chosen to become the AES because it offered the best
security, but because it was easy to implement in hardware, fast, and
secure enough.
