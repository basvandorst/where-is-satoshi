Hi Neal, Yes, but if people go in and fake complete signing networks that sign and revoke signs to make the keys appear sinister then it will be hard to argue around that your key underwent some sort of attack. It would be also very hard to defend such attacks, at last everybody is free to sign whomever key he wants to and revoke it with "key compromised" or such reason..
