@_subject: I don't get it - utf8 on Mac 
I'm new to gpg and I've recently compiled and installed gpg on my Mac and it seem to work. However, I don't understand how to get it to use UTF-8, what happens is that I launch gpg like this
    gpg --gen-key --utf8-strings
and start fill in the data I get
Comment:                      You are using the `US-ASCII' character set.
You selected this USER-ID:
    "H?kan ?berg "
The terminal is set to use utf8. So I'm doing something wrong but what?
