@_subject: use of multiple keys 
Hi Users-Group,
Recently, my hard drive containing my secret key side of the pair
crashed, with no backup.
I have created a new pair for encryption use, but that makes all the old
email others have of mine unusable.
Is there a setting which allows other recipients, who have both
public-key sets to use them interchangeably so that old and new
encrypted email are usable?
