@_subject: How to import a gnupg-key to theBat 
i want to import my public gnupg-key (generated with gpg 1.0.6 under HP-UX) into theBat, which is a fine little mailer runnig under windows.
TheBat uses an internal version of pgp. If i try to import the key (exported
as an ASCII-file), there is no error-message but the key is NOT in the
key-list of the bat (i hate systems which are not verbose).
Any hints?

ok i tried it with GnuPG 1.06 on HP-UX and Windows.
Mailer on Windows: TheBat
Mailer on HP-UX: mutt
Hurra!! I can en- and decrypt all mails in both directions!
But, whats that? Now the message from the Windows-Client looks like:
[-- BEGIN PGP MESSAGE --]                                                                 12345^M                                                                                   [-- END PGP MESSAGE --]                                                                   ~                                                                                         ~                       Look at the ^M-Sign.
Is this the DOS-UNIX-LF-CR-Problem?
Thank you
