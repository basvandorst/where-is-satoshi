is there an easy way to print your PGP-key on a piece of paper in a
nice way?
Like those business card creators in Word that you print on perforated
Best regards

ok, let me be a bit more clear about what I'm looking for. At a signing party like at upcoming 30c3 there's a compiled list of keys. But when you meet for a spontaneous signing at your local hackerspace, people pull out their keys (aka ID/Fingerprint/...) on little pieces of paper. Some are creative with OpenOffice/Word/LaTex, some just take the output of gpg. Others have their Infoseek on their real business card. So, what I'm looking for is something like this:
gpg-card -id=deadbeef -pdf -a4
It extracts the details from the key and puts together a PDF size A4.
A grid of 3x8 and lines where to cut.
