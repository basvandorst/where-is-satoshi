@_subject: libgcrypt: beginners question 
I'm new to this group. I hope you can give me some hints for using
My environment: we develop software ourselves, querying an Oracle-db and
preparing the data for printing by the German Post. We have a tradition of
portable software, so our software can run unmodified under Solaris, HPUX,
AIX, Windows NT, VMS etc.
For this application the software must run under NT, and its developped
using MS Visual C++ 5.0 (our usual plattform for development).
What I wanted to do: instead of printing the data I want to create a file in
PDF-format and send this file via mail. This problem ist solved. Additionaly
I want to create a digital signature, send this together with the PDF-file
and also store this in our database.
I tried this approach with gpg and it worked (created a signature, checked
it) but I prefer calling some code in a lib (or in a DLL) instead of
starting an external programm. So I found libgcrypt version 1.1.3. I assume
this code does what I want.
I can find some MAKEFILES but I did not find anything which I could use from
VC++. Has anyone used the code within VC++ and can give me a URL or an hint
to an FAQ or ....

I will check für libmcrypt and give it a try.
Thanks for the hint.

Hi Timo,
thanks for your tip.
A DLL would be fine. Can you please show me how to find this script.

@_subject: gpg-Msg: failed to translate 
when I call gpg.exe from a program I get the following message:
        failed to translate osfhandle 00000005
or a different number. What is wrong here?
What I did: I wrote a little programm which calls gpg.exe (via spawnl()) and
gave it the needed parameters. I put the passphrase in a file and called
gpg.exe whith the parameter "--passphrase-fd 5" (the number 5 is the number
returned from the previous open()-call).
The parameters are correct, I verified them via a BAT-file.
I changed gpg.exe to a file of my own, which simply read from the
filedescriptor given and I can read from the file.
Any ideas?

Hi Geoffrey,
you should put your password/passphrase in a file e.g. in pass.pr
Then you add to your parameters:                --passphrase-fd     0
At the end of your commandline you add:     <pass.pr
That should do it.
