@_subject: gpg symmetric to Java JCA decryption 
has anybody tried to decrypt a symmetric gpg encryption with Java
using Java Cryptography Architecture included in the JDK?
echo hello |  gpg -c --cipher-algo 3DES -a --passphrase "my pass" |
java MyDeCrypt --cipher-algo 3DES --passphrase "my pass"
should result in hello
This should be possible, I googled for a sample, but there seems to be none.
echo hello |  gpg -c --cipher-algo 3DES -a --passphrase "my pass"

No, I don't need OpenPGP, just need symmetric encryption done by a
standard command line Unix tool and decryption by means of the Java
runtime library.
Guess I'll take openssl, looks like this works with Java:
