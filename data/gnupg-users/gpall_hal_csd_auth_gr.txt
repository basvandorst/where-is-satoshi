I Cant get them work together. The files encrypted with PGP are handled
correctly by gpg but the files encrypted with gpg are not handled correctly
be PGP. I get a message : an error has occured : bad packet.
I use in options :
cipher-algo TWOFISH
What about compression? Should i de-activate it?
And what is the "best" from the available algos??
Thanks for your time

@_subject: cant encrypt to Werner Koch's public key! 
Hello all!
I must be missing something...
I have downloaded Werner Kochs public key
( i have imported it successfully. I
want to send an encrypted file to him (foo.txt).
I give :
gpg -r dd9jn -e foo.txt
and i get :
gpg: No key for user ID
gpg: dd9jn skipped: public key not found
gpg: opsys.cc: encryption failed: public key not found
I give
gpg -r 57548DCD -e foo.txt
where 5754... is the ID of Werner and i get :
gpg: 57548DCD: skipped: unusable pubkey algorithm
gpg: opsys.cc: encryption failed: unusable pubkey algorithm
I have gpg 1.0.4
What am i doing wrong?
Do i need to first sign werners public key before encrypting to it?

Nor GnuPG, GnuPG Shell or Mutt.
But DOS. It has to do with Line Feed and Carriage Return that are both
needed on DOS based platforms. Try this : Write with notepad a text, press
some newlines (enter) and open the file from a unix editor (joe for
example). It will be full of these ^M.
There is a command on unix systems which removes those Ms but i cannot
recall now.

To clear smth out, is there ANY way to encrypt something with GnuPG (1.0.4)
and decrypt it with PGP (7.0.3)
