@_subject: Compile without libiconv or libintl on Solaris 
Hello -
Has anyone been able to compile 1.4.8 or 1.4.9 on Solaris without iconv or
intl?  The only way I have been able to do it is with --enable-minimal and
that disables too much.  Or am I going to have to really learn Makefiles?

If I do a config like this, and ldd the resulting gpg binary, it still needs
libiconv and libintl.
./configure --prefix=/place/gnupg-1.4.8 --without-readline
--disable-gnupg-iconv --without-intl --without-iconv
I've tried a few variations on this.
I would like to compile statically but that fails to compile.  OMG I just
ran a static compile to get the error and it worked.  Someone sacrificed a
cat somewhere or something.  Well, my question mave have become a lot less

No, I had that pesky --enable-minimal in the configure command.  It can
compile statically with that.  here is the error I get otherwise:

said "do it anyway".

Someone sends us a big ~700MB pgp encrypted file and when we decrypt it the
resulting file is about half that size.  Anyone have an idea what they might
be doing to swell it up like that?

It looks like all digits and capital letters.  And some kind of spaces or
tabs.   It's not a bomb.  These file come in routinely.  All the ones I have
looked at (ftp'd size vs the unencrypted file sitting in archive) are right
about 2-to-1.
To get a still encrypted file, I would have to file a request to modify a
script and at least 3 groups would have to approve the request.  And I would
have to wait at least 1 week before I actually made the change.  I remember
freedom. . . . .

The vender told our trading partner their PGP software bloats the file and
that is just the way it is.  I do not understand how the encrypted file (or
the file that contains the encrypted file) can be over twice the size of the
original, when the senders believe they have used compression.
I also wonder why gpg doesn't report whatever extra junk exists in the file.

No Sir.  The files compress well. They compress to the same size as the
packet reported by --list-packets.   Ascii armor did what a previous poster
predicted, growing the file by about 1/3.
here is what should happen:
270Mbyte text file => compressed to 50 Mbyte => X 1.38 yielding 69Mbytes to
go over the network.
But for some reason, McA... er I mean the vender PGP does:
270Mbyte text file => 671MB to choke the network
That should be unheard of.

It sounds like you already know how to unzip them.  Are you asking how to
decrypt them?
Do you have any reason to believe the files were encrypted for a key that
you have in your possession?
gpg --list-packets will tell you the key that was used to encrypt.  If you do not have the
private key for it, you are out of luck.

I don't think the passphrase is needed for the encrypt command, since you
are not signing?  If you add --sign, do you get the pop up?
Does your pass phrase have double quotes around it?  Maybe more of the
command is being seen as part of the pass phrase than you expect?

Hi -
I liked The Code Book, by Simon Singh as a good start.  It covers various
(very various) code topics but it describes the PGP basics in plain talk.
And now I know how an enigma machine works.
