@_subject: Unusual (unintended?) behavor upon decryption of a message 
Upon decryption of the attached message, the program requests a new
passphrase. Then after any arbitrary string is entered (or nothing),
decryption of the message fails. It does not matter if any private keys
are held in gnupg (including the key of the intended recipient).
Here is the message in question. How is this possible?
