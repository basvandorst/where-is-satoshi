Are you sure you want to do that? The pass phrase is one of the 2 most=20
secret things you have in the whole encryption system. I would not even=20
save that into a file on my Linux box, not to think of a Windows box.
The passphrase is something you have in your biological memory or -if=20
that has occasional brake-downs (like mine) - you save it somewhere on=20
a floppy in your locker.
Sorry, I can't answer your question.

Yes. Would be nice to add a time limit how long passphrase stays in memory so that the passphrase will be wiped from memory even if user forgets to logout.
Sorry, but I already told that I can't. I just wanted to point out the security issues.

@_subject: Why CAs or public keysigning? 
** Kyle Hasselbacher (Mittwoch, 18. Juni 2003 18:44)
This is all true, also Peter's objections against third party trust.
But let's face the praxis:
1. What do I use keys for?
I use them for signing a message. This verifies that it was really I who wrote the message and the message was not changed after I sent it.
I use them to encrypt messages. This verifies the 2 points in the first chapter plus hides the contents from third party's eyes.
2. Who do I send signed messages to?
I send them to mailinglists, persons I don't know personally, any persons if I want to make sure named points in chapter 1.1.
For this a CA verification is enough because I sent those messages to mail addresses rather than real persons (although behind every mail address there sleeps a human being - almost).
If the recipient is in doubt he can always mail back for my fingerprint.
Or, as many users do, I put my ascii armored public key on my website where one can also find personal information about me (including 3. Who do I send encrypted messages to?
I send them to persons I either stayed in touch to for some time or persons I know in RL. In both cases there is already an established communication history which makes it easy to exchange fingerprints and/or public keys within signed messages or via phone or in RL.
I don't see any reason why I should send an encrypted message to any other person. At least I did not find any reason through my years of using the private/public key system (first pgp, then gnupg).
IMHO this discussion may be academical interesting but has only little relevance to real life.

Being fairly new in this I joined this list and received some messages=20
by people who signed their messages. I always imported the keys (using=20
the gpg option --auto-key-retrieve) and kmail tells me
"Message is signed by XY (blahblub) (Key-ID: 0x12345678).
Signature is valid but the key is not trusted."
When I want to send a private mail to somebody like that and I want to=20
encrypt the text I see the list of my pubring but all imported keys are=20
marked red and I cannot encrypt.
Only my own public key is marked green and I can use it to send=20
encrypted mails to myself (Big Deal!)
I signed one of those public keys because I know the person and my sig=20
is listed but still the same.
Could someone explain or point me into the right direction?

You may have a point there and your following ideas may not be bad.
But having read some more of the documentation (especially about the=20
overall concept) I agree with the current behaviour of kmail.
Who do I send mails to which should be encrypted so that only the=20
addressee can read the contents? Right, only to persons who I trust not=20
to reveal the contents of my private thoughts to any other person.
I can't think of a situation where I would send such private thoughts to=20
a person I don't know and/or have a kind of relationship with. And if I=20
have such a relation to that person there is a way to establish a=20
trusted communication to exchange trusted keys (via a known third=20
party, a trusted organization or institution, etc.).
When it comes to exchanging data which should not be sent in the open=20
there are organizations in all areas of the world where you can have=20
your key signed so that it is acknowledged by other people.
As an example, in Germany we have a computer magazine (c't) which offers=20
signing of keys when you show up at exhibitions at their booth with=20
your key and a official id card (passport, drivers license, etc.).=20
There are other possibilities.
I don't see any need to spoil the concept of the Web of Trust.

Using KMail with GnuPG.
KMail accepts my GnuPG key for signing and de-/encrypting and it also=20
shows signed messages with the proper Information.
Every now and then I stumble on messages in this list where KMail gives=20
an error message:
"Message is signed with an unknown key.
The key cannot be verified.
Problem: OpenPGP module not listed.
Use dialogue 'Settings->KMail settings->Security' to configure this=20

In KMail settings I *have* the tab 'OpenPGP' and the standard is set to=20
'OpenPGP' although I use GnuPGP. It works all the time except with some=20
of the messages. Example where I got such an error:

There is no blamk line - and there is no OpenPGP line as well. This may be the problem - but why do I have only some messages with this error then and not all? Yours is one of them, BTW.
And: What do I put in such a line?

Went there, done that, no t-shirt. Did not work.
In detail:
I downloaded all the files, did the 3-step waltz on them and the test
$ echo "test" | gpg -ase -r 0xDEADBEEF | gpg
worked all right (of course with my key-id).
All '.configure/make/make check/make install' returned no error so I=20
assumed the installation went allright.
Now I wanted to fill in the plugin into KMail but there is no plugin!
According to the website there should be a directory=20
isn't. slocate (after updatedb) returns nothing with this name.
I looked at the config.log in /misc/cryptplug-0.3.15 and found:
configure:7762: checking for gpgme-config
configure:7793: result: no
configure:7959: creating ./config.status
config.status:988: executing depfiles commands
        CryptPlug v0.3.15 has been configured as follows:
        CryptPlug GPGME: no
This may be the problem. But how do I solve it? I'm not knowledgeable=20
enough to solve this although I can do the normal installation of a=20

Before I added 'use-agent' in my gpg.conf
With this option I cannot sign any messages. Looks like with the agent active KMail needs the plugin to work.

The file gpgme-config really *is* in /usr/local/bin and:
