I tried to install the 1.4.6 update to my 1.4.5 GnuPG.  As I followed the
compile instruction I encounter an error.  When I do ./configure  an error
comes up at the end of the display and according to the logs:
configure:3397: checking for cl.exe
configure:3427: result: no
configure:3456: error: no acceptable C compiler found in $PATH
See `config.log' for more details.
I'm stuck.  Any help would be appreciated.  I'm using PPC Mac running 10.4.8

Thanks Ben!
Your binary install works good.  And thanks to Joseph and Robert for  letting me know I have to have developer's kit to compile.  But I may  have to put that off for a while now thanks to Ben.
