@_subject: Key Certificates in GNUPG 
Hi ,
  I am trying to generate some RSA keys and store them as
certificates. I am using libgcrypt library to generate RSA keys.
a. Is there any function in Libgrypt or Libksba to generate certificates ?
b. in the source directory of GNUPG, i can see certlist.c,
certreqgen.c etc under the 'sm' directory using structures defiened in
ksba.h file for creating certificate. Is there any format defined for
the certificate ? if yes, where i can see that ? also if i want to
store it  on my own format , what are the implications?
c. I am really new to this. Could some one tell me what exactly i have
to do in order to store RSA keys generated using libgcrypt as a
  Thanks in advance,
    rubis

@_subject: AES 256 bit key generation 
Hi all,
I want to create as AEs key of size 256 bits.is there any function in
libgcrypt to generate AES key ?
Now i am using libgcrypt random number generation to create an AES key
.is this correct ?
I am sedning my code
      printf("Setting the key...\n");
is this the corret way of generating AES key ?
what is the best mode of AES encryption ( like , GCRY_CIPHER_MODE_CFB, etc)  ?

@_subject: Creating Rsa Public Key self signature 
I am generating one RSA key pair using libgcrypt.As per the project
requirement ,i want to store the RSa public key as self
signaure(signed by corresponding rsa private key).
The rsa public key is of type gcry_ac_key_t ,but the input type for
gcry_ac_data_sign is of type gcry_mpi_t .so how can i create a self
signature using libgcrypt ?.
i trying like this ...is this correct
data = gcry_ac_key_data_get(KeyToBeSigned);
for (i = 0; i < gcry_ac_data_length(data); i++)
gcry_ac_data_get_index(data,0, i,&mpiName,&mpiTemp);
GcryptErrValue = gcry_ac_data_sign(GcryptRsaHd ,SecKey,mpiTemp,&KeySignature);
if i do like this , i will get the signature for each mpi value [ for
public key there will be 2 mpi (n,e) values].
so how can i create a self signature for rsa public key ?
I am using AES keys to encrypt some file contents.The AES keys used
for file encryption is encrypted using RSA Keys.I am creating RSA Key
pairs for different users.According to my project requirement i want
to encrypt /sign an RSA key of one user using Rsa key of other
user.How can i encrypt /sign the RSA private of one user with the
another RSa key of other user ?
I have gone through the Libgcrypt manuel.But I couldn't find ..Is this
possible ?

@_subject: Resend: Creating Rsa Public Key self signature 
I have generated  an RSA key pair using libgcrypt.As per the project
requirement ,i have to encrypt this Rsa key with another master RSA key.
gcry_ac_data_encrypt () expects input type as gcry_mpi_t. But RSA key
it self is of type gcry_ac_key_t. Now, I am planning to do the
convertion in the below given way..
data = gcry_ac_key_data_get(KeyToBeEncrypted);
for (i = 0; i < gcry_ac_data_length(data); i++)
gcry_ac_data_get_index(data,0, i,&mpiName,&mpiTemp);
GcryptErrValue = gcry_ac_data_encrypt(GcryptRsaHd
Is this a correct way of doing this ?
Is there any other way by which i can encrypt the entire key , rather
than manipulating with each encrypted MPI values ?
