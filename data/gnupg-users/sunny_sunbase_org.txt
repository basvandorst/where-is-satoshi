Not if the server displays a terse list of all the keys from which the
user can choose the desired key. Additionally there could be some cron
jobs running on the server once a week or something that searches for
duplicated fake keys and reports to the maintainer. But then we have
the "problem" of getting the same key back again when some of the other
key servers reinstall the key. If we were to get rid of obvious faked
keys, they should be disabled on the server, but I doubt this a big
enough problem to make any special arrangements for it.
IMHO the danger of DoS attacks due to duplicate 32-bits keyIDs is not
very big. If there were lots of keys showing up as duplicates, there
would not be a significant amount of resources needed from the server.
Waste of bandwith, yes, but I don't think it would result in a DoS
situation. But then, I have no clue of the inner workings of the server
software, so please correct me if I'm wrong. :-)
I think the option of specifying the fingerprint is a good idea. Not
necessarily the whole bunch of bits, just enough to make it unique.

This is where the fingerprint comes to use. To ensure you have the key
belonging to the actual user, there has to be some additional
communication to verify that it's not someone who has generated a key
with a false name on it. Even if a false key is used, the only problem
is that the receiver can't read the encrypted message. (I take it for
granted that the sender knows the receivers actual email address.) This
could lead to a mess and could be a problem. I don't know of any
methods to avoid this problem, except spreading your fingerprint
actively to make it easier for other people to verify the authenticity
of the key. The keys from a keyserver is genuine 99% of the time, but
there is always a chance someone has made his own key with the same
name on it.
Shouldn't the internal CRC routines help avoiding this? I doubt it
would be an easy task to duplicate the 64-bit key _and_ satisfy the
SHA1 checksum.
Not much of extra steps needed here, just a list of all the keys to
choose from. One extra step.
Another thing is when GPG itself gets the key from a server, for
example when verifying a signed text and you don't have the actual key
from before. Will GPG then use the 32-bit keyID to get the key from the

That seems like a good idea. Having an "always-stdout" option would be
a good thing to have, especially when thinking of how hard it is to
completely erase data from hard disks once it's written. After all,
it's easy to redirect the output to a file. I still think the current
behaviour should be the default, but I see no drawback in having an
configuration option to achieve this behaviour.

Yes, indeed. The GNU General Public License allows you to use the

the source in other programs or link any part of it into another

Hash: SHA1
Found a disquieting article at :
    1024-bit encryption is 'compromised'
    Upgrade to 2048-bit, says crypto expert
    According to a security debate sparked off by cryptography expert
    Lucky Green on Bugtraq yesterday, 1,024-bit RSA encryption should
    be "considered compromised".
    The Financial Cryptography conference earlier this month, which
    largely focused on a paper published by cryptographer Dan Bernstein
    last October detailing integer factoring methodologies, revealed
    "significant practical security implications impacting the
    overwhelming majority of deployed systems utilising RSA as the
    public key algorithm".
    Based on Bernstein's proposed architecture, a panel of experts
    estimated that a 1,024-bit RSA factoring device can be built using
    only commercially available technology for a price range of several
    hundred million to $1bn.
I guess this is the same thing that was discussed last week on this
list. I'm not into this level of cryptoanalytics, but what do you folks
say about this? I guess there is no need to get upset of this, if Big
Brother wants my bytes, I suppose he has other ugly ways to compromise
the key -- bugging my flat or setting up some kind of scanners to
analyze the keyboard radiation or maybe plain old violence. I doubt the
govs wants to use millions of euro to read my mail. But I admit it's
damn irritating to read this now that I changed my key only one month
ago. *grmpf*
The question is floating around among us -- would it be wise to upgrade
to 2048 bits, or is this just speculations? Now that they're talking
about this, I guess one should be a step ahead of the snoopers --
especially when it comes to the future robustness of the signatures.

@_subject: Problem importing a secret key 
Judging from the error message it seems as GPG also wants the public
key. The secret key contains no personal information, so GnuPG has no
user ID that refer to this secret key. Try to import the public key
first, then import the secret key the way you did.
