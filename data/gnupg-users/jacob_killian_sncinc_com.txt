@_subject: GnuPG and Key Recovery 
Hello all.  I am not a member of this list, but have a question about gnupg
which I have not found an answer to in the documentation.  Does GnuPG offer
PGP style key-recovery?  I am looking for an e-mail privacy/encryption
alternative which does not have a key-recovery mechanism, as the need to
protect data from being viewed by unauthorized persons is greater than the
potential of losing the data by losing the key.
If GnuPG does offer key-recovery, is anyone aware of a reasonably secure
e-mail PKI package which does not?
Thanks in advance!
