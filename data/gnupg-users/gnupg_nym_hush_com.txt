Unless I'm misunderstanding you, your friend is the one with the
hush account and you are trying to send to him?
For hushmail users to receive encrypted or signed emails from non-
hush users the non-hush users must upload their public key to the
hush key server. This cannot be done from ldap://keys.hush.com,
this is only to retreive keys. You must upload your public key at
 and click on the "Key Management" button
and then on your left you'll see a link to "Upload a public key".
Once your key is uploaded, all hush users can recieve your
encrypted emails. For hush users, the hush key server is kinda like
one big keyring for everyone.
This doc from hush.com about how to use GPG/PGP with hush would be
something to look at.
