@_subject: question regarding gnupg in my regular signature 
OK, more research has helped me to understand what I am looking for.  I think what I am wanting to do is send "clearsign" my emails.  Now, if I can only figure out how to get Mutt to do this automatically.

@_subject: Thoughts on having one key on two different computers 
I have an IMAP account in which I sometimes use Mutt on my own computer and
I sometimes use Mutt on another computer at the place where I work.  Just
curious, I have the same account name on both computers and the same email
addrss.  Is there a way for me to transport my private key to the second
computer (for when I am using that computer)?  Is that possible?  Would it
be advised that I not do that?  I would appreciate your thoughts.
