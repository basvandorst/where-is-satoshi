What about simply using gpg --import  ?

* Faramir  [2008-10-21 22:58:47 -0300]:
Well, keys cannot be identified by the 8 chars alone.
I've once been to a key-signing-party with about 150 people and guess
what: There were collisions with other existing keys if you only would have
looked at the last 8 chars of the fingerprint.

I double-checked. There were no collisions among the participating people
but some of the participating keys short IDs collided with other existing
short IDs.
So, to be sure, always use 16 digits.

* Ray Simard  [2008-09-16 20:23:06 -0700]:
This was discussed not so long ago on this list.
It does _not_ work.
Split your file into the right parts and use gpg on them.

Hi all,

I use pass [0] for this.
It uses gnupg under the hood and also has ansible integration.
Adding and removing users is a bit of hassle but it integrates much
better with git than e.g. keepass or the like.

I think it might be best to put that functionality into a separate
GnuPG version called gpg-legacy.
Make it clear in all man pages of this tool, the --version and --help
options that this only exists to decrypt existing but now obsolete
encrypted material and that it can't be used to create such material

Regarding breaking changes: Please study carefully the Python2 ->
Python3 transition. By keeping Python2 for 10 long years supported
after deprecation, only the haters became louder and louder, "Success"
stories of leaving the Python eco system exploded. Would they have
integrated a non-GIL switch into that breaking change, the work for
normal Python projects would not have been greater but the reason to
switch would have been.
Just 2 cents of a long-term GnuPG (and Python) user
