@_subject: Safe decryption with GnuPG? 
Sorry, but what you're asking for is impossible.
That's the business of the viewer.
This doesn't buy you much, especially since there's OCR and the computer generated bitmap is likely to be very regular.
How does the viewer know which information you need?
Updated automatically? Not sure I see what you mean here.
Scrambling isn't of much use. If someone can read your memory they can read the key, which must lie somewhere in memory as well.
This is impossible, unless you have: 1) trusted hardware, DRM style, or 2) a specifically built OS to ensure it.
Good luck, you're proposing an application that would have to take full control of video RAM to ensure noone can read it, that would have to do all sorts of graphical manipulation to generate a bitmap from a text, etc.

@_subject: Are DSA2 signing keys backwards compatible? 
I think you have some level of misunderstanding about what, where, and how different algorithms are used, and what prefs refer to. I'll try to explain it in short, and forgive me if this is old for you and I assumed wrongly.
A keypair contains (simplifying) a public and private key plus metadata. Among the metadata there is a self signature, by which the private key signs the hash of the public key and other key elements. This hash is NOT determined by key preferences, key preferences are means to signal to other people what hashes they should use when they issue signatures for you. Likewise, the private key is encrypted on secring.gpg, and the algorithm used to encrypt it has nothing to do with key preferences, it is a private matter. Key preferences are ALWAYS hints to someone else about what algorithms you are willing and able to deal with when THEY send you data. They have nothing to do with the algorithms you use for encrypting to others, encrypting symetrically, hashing your key, and so on, beyond the obvious fact that you should be able to deal with all algorithms you place in prefs, as well as those used for your own key. These decisions are taken mostly through defaults, although it is also possible to use modifiers on the command line or options file in order to determine which hashes, or which algorithms to use for encrypting the private key.

IMO there are two possibilities: 1) your users are forgetful but honest, 2) your users are dishonest.
For case 1, an equivalent of ADK can be obtained with a line on GPG's configuration file.
For case 2, you are screwed, and ADK is only going to give you a false sense of security.
Thus ADK is either pointless or unnecessary.

When in doubt, use brute force. So, the answer is, it depends on the strenght of your passphrase.

That's it then, if your key is not marked as trusted, or the keys which sign it, how do you expect GnuPG to consider it a valid key?

If you need to have this guarantee, you could try overriding the session key. Note you will lose security by the bucketload by doing so. I really would not advice it. If you're trying to have some kind of filesystem encryption (which is my impression, but not sure) gnupg is not the best

No, just revoke the ID. From the edit-key menu, choose the ID with uid n, and then revsig iirc.

With a certificate of this kind you can sign e-mail and decrypt e-mail encrypted to you on the basis of S/MIME, which is a different protocol from OpenPGP and incompatible with it. The pros of it is that it is supported by mainstream MUAs, Outlook Express and MS Outlook, and the Web of Trust issues are handled in a less flexible but simpler way (lots of money to become

Well, I'm pretty sure if GnuPG had the limit you suggest (2048) it would be legally unusable for some purposes, due to legal guidelines, "best practices", and all that tosh. Now you can say those things are misguided, but if they make it impossible to use GnuPG they're a real-world need just as the man page is. I don't know of any of these policies that require keys longer than 4096, but I wouldn't discard the possibility, certainly not in the future.

bothering with, and most people don't want their e-mail kept secret. Maybe under this logic GnuPG shouldn't exist. I assert that if GnuPG can serve a set of users without causing harm to anyone and complicating the design (which permitting longer keys wouldn't do) it probably should.
Because it is probably a fairly good lower bound.
1) Did you have to choose the iPhone, one of the most free-software-hostile platforms ever, to exemplify smart pohnes? 2) Are you sure RSA 16k would take that long to run? Those microprocessors are getting pretty decent these days. 3) Like it or not, smart phones are not to be considered, for now, general purpose computers. They can do many things, but not everything expected from a computer at this point.
Yes, and probably not too far in the future it will be able to do RSA 16k in reasonable time if it can't today.
Beware the SDK terms though.
RSA is more flexible. Easier to protect several documents, easier to have shared secrets, etc.
I don't think that's actually true. In the margin, we should be using 512 keys because that way we can focus more on human security issues. Reductio ad absurdum, but you see my point: deciding to have an RSA 8k key or RSA 16k key doesn't particularly detract from placing emphasis on other measures of human-related security.

@_subject: Anyone know what became of the Gaim-E Project? 
As far as I'm concerned signature semantics are indeed a bit problematic, not the least reason being that it isn't really the user who signs, but a piece of software, ideally by the agency of the user, but in actuality this is in itself hard to verify. I think an idea is that digital signatures should rather be regarded as seals, like in the ancient days when documents were authenticated that way. The reason I think this is a better metaphor is it follows more closely the reality of digital signing: it authentifies that the document passed through the hands of the seal-holder, but was not necessarily authored by them; it gives a clear feel of what happens when you lose your privkey (same as when you lose a seal, anyone can seal with it); and it detaches the idea of signing (which often implies active consent) from sealing (which is more like a mechanical act), which is good because a digital seal can end up there by accident (for instance if someone does not compromise your keys but compromises your mail client, they might be able to get you to send something with your seal).
Where I have a difference is in the I love you example. Clearly you could send the unsealed data (plaintext, whatever) to someone else and end up in trouble, but the reasonable thing to do would be to send the document sealed by the original sender, as you received it, same as when you forward an e-mail the headers are on top indicating it does not come from you, so the example is, I think, a bit contrived and inapplicable.

"There's a slight problem with the seal analogy. The seal has to be
broken before one can read the letter and once the seal has been broken
it does no longer prove anything."
I was referring to seals as in  and not in the sense of closing a letter with glue. The kind of seals you stamp on the letter (or other documents like laws) itself. It's true that these seals could also be used to impress over a closed envelope and assure confidentiality, so that once opened they could not be used to verify again. That would be the equivalent of opaque signing, where you encrypt first and sign later.

@_subject: Anyone know what became of the Gaim-E Project? 
Fair enough, but I think all these examples rely on faulty or insufficient metadata. For instance if the from, to, cc, bcc and subject headers were included in the sealing, things like this would not happen. (Not sure exactly what headers pgp-mime does include much less s/mime).

The same it has if someone wants to recover your data claiming to be you and that they forgot your password: nothing.
I suppose you could print out your unencrypted private key and keep it somewhere very, very safe. Or your password.
