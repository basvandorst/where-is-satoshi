Correct.  Directories need the "execute" bit set, although "execute" is
a misnomer for directories.  See the following for an explanation;

Hello Werner,
It always puzzles me why banking organisations send html email pointing
out that "we all need to be security conscious" since html is so easily
exploited for nefarious ends.

Hello Robert,
I beg to differ.  By sending HTML emails, it means they're likely to end
up *receiving* HTML mail because many people's mailer replies "in kind"
by default, and the users don't alter the default settings.
It doesn't look professional if they are talking about security.
Not when, like Werner and me, it gets consigned straight to the bin.
To be fair to one of the organisations I deal with, a credit card
company, they *do* only send plain text emails.  They also rang me to
query some odd transactions on the card.  It turns out they were not
made by me, and the card was immediately cancelled.
However, non of that has to do with GPG, so.......

Hello Mika,
Several people use PGP/MIME, all of which verify here, and include the
list headers you seem to be saying get removed.  Not only on this list,
but many other lists, too.
I have seen weirdness with *footers* and PGP signed messages, but that
is with footers not being displayed, rather than being removed.
Checking message source shows that they are still there.

Hello Mika,
Headers are outside what is signed, surely?
Changing, adding or removing headers should have no bearing on the
validity of PGP signatures.  If header changes were involved, nothing
would be verifiable, because every mail server an email passes through
adds at least on more piece of info to those headers.
TBH, I'd have thought the issues you're experiencing are more likely to
be caused by Hotmail.

The form address is hotmail. Message ID is hotmail, too.  gmail *is*
mentioned, but not in any of the transport headers.  Anyhow, Robert has
explained where and how the breakage occurs.
Short answer;  No.
Longer answer;  I'm not inclined to install another MUA (Thunderbird),
set it up for use, install enigmail and set that up, just to test for
this breakage.

Hello MFPA,
It's the same for me;  A re-import of your key still results in an
error(1).  I've checked some (locally) archived emails from you
(received via this list) and they verify fine.  Obviously, something's
changed, but IDK what.  Whatever the change, it occurred between 15 Nov
and 7 Dec.  I have a message from the earlier date that verifies and a
message from the latter date that doesn't.  Consequently, I believe the
issue is something other than your keyfile.
If it helps, I use a self-compiled (from GIT) Claws Mail as my MUA.
