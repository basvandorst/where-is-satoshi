@_subject: GPG Shell works but GnuPG commands fail 
I have been tasked with installing GnuPG and GPG Shell onto Windows XP
(then onto Windows Vista) to decrypt data files currently using PGP
Command-Line software.  I have installed GnuPG for Windows (version Version 1.1.4 ) from the
 website.  It appears to load successfully, but GPA
throws a fatal error "Fatal Error in GPGME Library.  (invoked from file /home/wk/src/gpg4win11/build/gpg4win-1.1.4/
src/playground/build/gpa-0.8.0/src/confdialog.c, line 1447) Unsupported protocol  The application will be terminated"
So, I continued on and installed the GPG Shell product from
  I loaded some public and secret
keys that were created from the PGP Command-Line software successfully.
I can decrypt a file using the GPG Tools function.  But when I try to
use the PGP commands with options from a DOS prompt (or command prompt)
gpg --decrypt C\DATA\CD.txt  --output C:\DATA\CD.icf --passphrase
my_pass  I get the following:
Usage: gpg [options] --decrypt  [filename]
If I evoke gpg first, I get:
gpg: Go ahead and type your message . . . Then enter:
gpg --decrypt C\DATA\CD.txt  --output C:\DATA\CD.icf --passphrase
my_pass  The command prompt hangs.
I would think it is a problem with the GnuPG installation, but would the
GPG Shell work?  Thanks in advance for any assistance you can provide.

@_subject: GPG Shell works but GnuPG commands fail - UPDATE 
Many hours of tinkering has given me a solution.
Although I haven't found an explanation for why the GPA product throws a
fatal error, I have conquered getting the GnuPG commands to work.  I
found that the order of the commands and options are significant, and
that I needed to surround the directory within "quotes".

@_subject: gpg: mpi larger than indicated length ERROR 
I have installed gpg4win version 1.1.4 with the following
GnuPG:  1.4.9
GnuPG2: 2.0.10
DirMngr: 1.0.3-svn310
GPA:    0.8.0
GPGol:  0.9.92
GPGee:  1.3.1
WinPT:  1.2.0
Claws-Mail: 3.0.0-rc2
Novices:        1.0.0
Einsteiger:     2.0.2
Durchblicker:   2.0.2
I have installed GPGShell version 3.7.2 on top to maintain the keys with
a gui interface.  I have created many keys without issue and have no
issues decrypting any files. Until yesterday; I created a key pair,
distributed the public key, and received a test file from my partner.  I
received the following error: 'gpg: mpi larger than indicated length
(258 bytes)'.
I have found the only references to this error back in the 2005-2006
timeframe and involving GnuPG version 1.4.2.  I assume that version
1.4.9 (that I am using) would contain the fix that was used to correct
this issue.
Any ideas?  Do I need to delete the key and create a new one?
