Could someone tell the differense between pgp -es and pgp -as ...
My problem we can encrypt mail using pgp -a, pgp -s and pgp -as.
As soon as we use the -e option it does not work. The key we want to
use is a DH/DSS key
What is the problem ?
Sorry for my poor english ... but you can answer in german :-)
