cncclubHello GnuPG users,
I need help once again.
I cannot run the Cryptix or Command Line version of PGP (GnuPG)
because I don't have execute permissions on the remote server where site is
hense, I need to find some kind of JavaScript, VBscript or CGI script to
encode my document. I wonder if somebody knows where and if such exists. I
think it should, since I don't need to do anything but encode a text file to
another text file and nothing else, I'm sure there should be some little
script or something to do this.
Much appreciate the help.
