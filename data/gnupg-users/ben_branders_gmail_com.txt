Today I wanted to do an update of the public keys in my list via Enigmail
(Refresh all public keys). I got this message:
I thought this was because I upgraded my Slackware Linux to another GCC
version so I recompiled GnuPG. Same problem.
Enigmail Keymanagement doesn't show any keys, not even the private ones.
Please inform me what I should do to fix this.
Thank you!
Kind regards

Oops, sorry.
I'm using GnuPG 1.4.3 on Slackware Linux (current tree).

I don't think Enigmail has anything to do with it. It is just passing the
gpg-error messages through.
Anyway, I tried you suggestion but it didn't work. I got the same error when
trying to reload the key cache.
I think something is really wrong with my keyring... :-(
