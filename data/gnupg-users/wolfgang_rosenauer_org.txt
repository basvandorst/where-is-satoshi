AFAIK that is not correct.
The pcsc-driver is either /usr/lib64/libpcsclite.so or
Also AFAIK (my knowledge is not up to date here) gnupg can only use so
called OpenPGP smartcards like those:
I'm sure others will correct me if I'm wrong.

Upgrading to 2.0.10 actually fixed this issue.

I've just changed my config from using pcsc-lite to the cyberjack ctapi
driver and it works for me.
I'm using gpg 2.0.10 though since I had other issues when accessing the
card a few days ago.
I have gpg 2.0.10 in my OBS repository built for openSUSE 11.1:
Feel free to try that.

I'm trying to use my OpenPGP smartcard on openSUSE 11.1 which has gpg2
I'm using a Reiner SCT cyberjack reader and pcsc-lite (for now) to
access the reader from scdaemon.
But I get the following error for a simple gpg --card-status:
wolfi at Hygiea:~> gpg --card-status
gpg: OpenPGP Karte ist nicht vorhanden: Nicht unterst?tzte
In scdaemon.log that translates to:
scdaemon[18495.0] DBG: <- READKEY OPENPGP.1
scdaemon[18495.0] DBG: -> [ 44 20 28 31 30 3a 70 75 62 6c 69 63 ...(165
bytes skipped) ]
scdaemon[18495.0] DBG: -> OK
scdaemon[18495.0] DBG: <- READCERT OPENPGP.1
2009-01-30 22:24:17 scdaemon[18495] app_readcert failed: Nicht
unterst?tzte Verarbeitungsaufgabe
scdaemon[18495.0] DBG: -> ERR 100663420 Nicht unterst?tzte
Verarbeitungsaufgabe What is the problem with that?
Another question is about the status of ctapi support. I failed to set
it up and read that it's deprecated. But my online banking software is
also using ctapi so I think having gnupg using pcsc-lite and the
onlinebanking software ctapi interferes somehow.
