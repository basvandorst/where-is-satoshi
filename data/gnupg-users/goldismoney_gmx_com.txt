@_subject: Help with GNU PGP - no password prompt when sending e-mails 
Hello everyone - I am using the following:
OS: windows 7 / 64-bit
E-mail client: Thunderbird3.1.6
GnuPG v1.4.10 (MingW32)
and Enigmail 1.1.2
My problem is that when I send encrypted e-mails, I never receive a
password prompt for the e-mail.  I do receive the password prompt when
actually opening up e-mails (received, or sent, or saved in some folder,
etc.) and mine is set up to remember the password for x number of
minutes, and that feature works fine.
The issue is obvious - if it doesn't ask me for my password when sending
e-mails, it means that anyone with access to my pc can go into
Thunderbird and send encrypted e-mails, using my identity.  Is this a
bug, or is there some configuration somewhere that I need to change?

Thank you for the quick reply.  You're right - I didn't realize the
thing about signing since I usually don't use it.  It makes perfect
sense though - so I know now that if I receive an encrypted e-mail from
a sender but it's only encrypted, not signed - all I know is that the
sender has access to the private key.. not necessarily the password. It
'should' be the sender, but not necessarily.
Thanks again!
