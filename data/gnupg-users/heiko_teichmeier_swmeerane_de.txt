GnuPG supports integrity protected messages which adds a hash (sort of
a mini-signature) inside the encrypted message to alert the user if
the message was tampered with.
That warning message means that the message you received did not have
integrity protection enabled.  PGP 7 does not generate messages with
integrity protection, though it does understand them when a GnuPG user
sends messages to a PGP 7 user.
This feature is to help combat message modification attacks such as
the one given in You can make the warning go away with --no-mdc-warning.

I'm updating section 4.15 (and others) in the GnuPG FAQ file and
wish to update the MUAs that support GnuPG either natively, or
with plug-ins or external tools as the list has grown
tremendously since 4.15 was first added to the FAQ.
I have the following information which I've collected on the

The information needs to be both confirmed for accuracy as some
MUAs may have added OpenPGP support since being included on this
list, or just plain wrong (my apologies), as well as possibly
So, if you know of a correction to this list, know a plug-in or
tool that isn't listed and provides GnuPG ability to the MUA, or
are perhaps using a MUA that supports GnuPG and isn't on this
list, please respond with an update!
BTW, the table won't be added to the FAQ... it's just to provide
me with accurate information from which to summarize from. Other
corrections and additions to the FAQ will be coming out this
week as well, so I certainly appreciate your help!

Hash: SHA1
Hi list,
my "auto-key-retrieve" with enigmail 0.71.0 and gnupg 1.2.1 over a
http-proxy (Squid) works now!
I would give a help to users with nearly problem:
- - first you must set following enviroment-variables (Win9x -
'autoexec.bat', WinNT/2000 - 'enviroment' or 'Umgebungsvariablen'):
    http_proxy=3D
                                               (*:3128 if you use squid)
    ENIGMAIL_PASS_ENV=3Dhttp_proxy
- - after this you must restart to activate the enivroment-variables!
- - in 'gpg.conf' must set:
    keyserver x-hkp://blackhole.pca.dfn.de
    keyserver-options honor-http-proxy
    keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve
- - in 'engimail->advanced' it must set:
    keyserver: x-hkp://blackhole.pca.dfn.de
- - next you must configure your proxy to accept connections from your
localnet *without authentication*! This whas my problem, because we use
http-proxy with authentication.
In 'squid.conf' you must set the destination-domain-names that can
access without authentication *before* the authentication-allow-line:
    Accesslist:
    acl xhkp-server-1 dest_domain_regex blackhole.pca.dfn.de
At the access-allow section it must follow:
    http_access allow xhkp-server-1
    *
    *
    http_access allow authent-user
If you would save your proxy against extern users you must add a acl
that allow only user from your net:
    acl xhkp-server-1 dest_domain_regex blackhole.pca.dfn.de
    acl my_net src 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0
    # allow IP's from 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.0.255
than you combine the acls ('and' combination):
    http_access allow my_net xhkp-server-1
    *
    *
    http_access allow authent-user
I has test the access with enigmail and everytime I has looked with one
eye to the squid-access-logfile. So I can see the 'TCP_DENIED'-message
and I know, that my enigmail would have a connection to the proxy, but
it get no access from http-proxy.
At your firewall you *don't must allow the port 11371* to get access to
the key-server - the www-port is enough. The request I see in the
squid-access-logfile looks so:
    Get I hope that now more user can access with 'auto-key-retrieve' over a
http-proxy to a keyserver.

You must set in environment too:

In gpg.conf must set too:
