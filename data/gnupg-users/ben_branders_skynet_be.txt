Hash: SHA1
Hi everyone,
I just switched from PGP to GnuPG.  I now use Mozilla with Enigmail. There is only one problem.  How do you download public keys from a keyserver with GnuPG/Enigmail ??
I tried several times and with different keyservers, but it just doesn't work...  .
This is what the error window says: (with a http server)
And this happens with a LDAP server
What am I doing wrong? Am I using the wrong keyserver?
Thanks in advance...

Okay, maybe I didn't make myself clear.  I have emails from people but I=20
don't have their public key.
With PGP I could just download the key from a keyserver.  This doesn't=20
work with GnuPG...
I tried all the other solution (from Ren=E9 Clerc and David Shaw), but=20
they didn't work at all... :-s
If it is some help, I'm running Enigmail 0.74.3 on Mozilla 1.3.1 on=20
Windows 98 SE.
Any ideas ??

Yes, I can do that.  That's no problem.

The same here.  An unknown signature gets a broken pen and a know but
untrusted signature a pen with an questionmark.
I can also click on the pen.  Enigmail _tries_ to download the public key.  Then it says it can't find the server or it can't find the key. But tried with different (working) servers and with different keys... At least one key has to be on a server, don't you think?

My firewall couldn't be the reason of this.  I even shutted him down and tried again.
Yes, I already noticed that.  My key is on pgp.mit.edu too.
I still have PGP installed and even PGP refuses to download the public keys.  Maybe it's just a problem with my computer (another one :(  ).
I will wait until Mozilla 1.4 comes out (shouldn't be too long, they ar now on Release Candidate 2).  Then I will do a fresh install and install the newest version of Enigmail.  I hope it will work then.

Hash: SHA1
Can someone please explain me why my OpenPGP-signature is so big? It used
to be about 3 lines, now it has doubled!
A couple of days ago I added a UID to this key. Has that anything to do
with it or is it just a wrong setting?
For the record: the signature verifies OK (here at least).

@_subject: KSP question: merge signatures? 
Hash: SHA1
We are planning to organise a keysigning party for Flanders (part of
Belgium) and the Netherlands, but we have a question.
Suppose person A signs your key at the same moment as person B. They send
the signed key back to you. Now you end up with 2 signed keys.
Does GnuPG automatically merge the signatures in the key? I.e. does GnuPG
copy the signature from A and the signature from B to your key or only
from A (or only from B)?

OK, nothing to worry about then. :-)
Thank you!

As already discussed in another thread, there will be a keysigning party
for Flanders (Belgium) and the Netherlands. This KSP will take place
online (via IRC) and the participants won't meet eachother in real life.
Naturally, the biggest disadvantage is that you can't verify that the
person really is who he says he is. You can check if the e-mailadres
belongs to him, but there is no way of knowing if he is an impostor or not.
But then again, you can never know for sure that someone is an imposter or
not. There are a lot of people who share exactly the same name. Even if
you check their identity in real life, one of them can mislead you...
There are also people who use nicknames in their key IDs and their email
addresses. You can't check their identity, because AFAIK your nickname
isn't on your driving license or on you passport.
Or am I missing something here?
And has online KSP other disadvantages?

Yes, of course. But even if you do meet them in real life, how can you
ever be sure? If, for example, someone uses a nickname for his e-mailadres
and his key, how can you check if he really 'owns' that nickname.
Suppose I know someone with the nickname X2. I also know that there is a
key signing party next week. I make a new e-mailaccount, x2 Then
I generate a key for that account, but instead of typing my name, I use
'X2' (which is of course the nickname of someone else).
I go to the KSP and someone wants to sign my key. Although he can check my
identity, he can't know if X2 is my real nickname or not...
How does OpenPGP take care of that? Or am I forgetting something in my
little story here?

Thank you for the information. I didn't know all that. I understand now
why those online keysigning are considered harmful for the WoT...
Maybe things like this can be made more clear in the Keysigning HOWTO, so
that everyone knows about the problems with those online keysignings (I
couldn't find anything about this in the HOWTO or in the FAQ).

@_subject: How to change gnupg quotation behaviour? 
Hash: SHA1
I always quote people when I send a reply back.  I use a '>' as the
quote character.  But when I sign an e-mail with GnuPG, all the '>'s
are turned into '|'.
For me it's no problem, but I would like to see that GnuPG signs the
message and keeps the '>'.
Is there an option to change GnuPG's behaviour so that it don't
converts my quotation characters?
I'm using GnuPG 1.2.4 and Thunderbird 0.4 with Enigmail 0.83.1.0.
Kind regards,

Apparently it's an Enigmail 'option'.  I turned it off and now my
quotes are ok (I think).
I has something to do with flowed text (RFC 2646).
