@_subject: adding a simple email address to a key 
I am new on the list, so point me to the right documentation. I am using Debian Lenny, and I have Kgpg installed.
right now I have a keypair for my main email address of paul (at) I wanted to add another email address to that key, ale (at) pcartwright.com
I'm not real sure of the sequence or path to take to accomplish this. I tried adding another uid, I tried adding a subkey. but both times I ended up with Kgpg showing the new email as the primary, instead of as uid

@_subject: adding a new email to a key 
got it.
yes, the edit key in terminal has primary. SO, I added a new email, selected uid 1, then said "primary".. too easy!
cosmetic, but it makes me feel better:)
thanks for the easy to follow instructions!
