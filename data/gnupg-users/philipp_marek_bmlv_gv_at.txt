@_subject: Importing certificates as keys 
Hello everybody,
I have a (possibly) stupid question.
If I have a certificate (eg. for use with SSL), which has also dataEncryption and keyEncryption as keyusages defined, is there a ways to import that key into gpg?
With openssl I can get the values by using a command like
which dumps my the information, eg.
I expect that this information should be more than enough to specify the key for gpg.
I believe I read something a long time ago about specifying the various values for generating a key - I just don't remember where and which product (openssl, gpg, or something else).
Nevertheless -. is there a way to import the pem- or pkcs12-file or some other information (text dump above) to use my key in gpg?
This would be easier than giving all users another key, which they would have to have with them. If it could just get generated from the certificate or possibly used directly ...
Thank you for all answers!
