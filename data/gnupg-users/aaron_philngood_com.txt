@_subject: different keys for different machine? 
I was generating a key the other day and then on a different machine, i
wanted to do it again..well, then i realized that i was going to have
the same name associated with different keys.  I have about 4 machines
that i will need to do this on.  Should i simply move my key pair to all
of my machines or make new one's on each machine?
Thanks in advance,

@_subject: different keys for different machine? 
Wow, this is way more in depth than i was hoping for...
Ok...lets say, for security sake..that i really only need one, no lets
say two..one linux and one window's box to send email from..I use an
imap server so i often connect to the server from one of the two
machines.  The rest of the machines are server machines.  My network is
set up as such.....
internet gateway/firewall/router----int. router/samba/fw/---internal net
               DMZ
(ascii art---not my forte)  The internal net is where my email boxes are of course.  on the dmz
currently i have one maching doing most work...SMTP, IMAP, HTTP, SSH,
WEBMAIL, the ohter machine is just a haylafax server.  and then there is
my internal router/firewall/samba server.  I'm not sure this clears it
up..but it sounds like what the best thing in this situation to do is
share the key on my two workstation machines..(can i share the key on a
windows and linux box?) and then create a seperate key for each of the
other machines for encryption purposes?  I suspect that for the main dmz
machine, i should actually get a key through a CA so i don't get the
dreaded "untrusted key" or worse yet, my customers?
Hope this clears it up..and thanks for the quick responses.
