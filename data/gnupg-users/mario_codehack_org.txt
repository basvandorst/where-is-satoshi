Hello everyone,
i just got my new smartcard reader and the OpenPGP Crypto Card (*1)
today. The installation went quite smooth as well as the
personalization of the smartcard itself. So crypting files using the
smartcard and GnuPG (version 1.4.1) works just as simple as going the
normal way with a locally stored encryption key. But unfortunately
sylpheed (version 1.9.10) don't seem to work with this new setup. It
just hangs up when i try to sent a crypted/signed mail. A `ps aux |
grep gpp` shows the following command, during the hang:
      gpg --no-sk-comment --status-fd 8 --no-tty --charset utf8 --
enable- progress-filter --command-fd 9 --sign --detach --armor --
Executing gpg manually with these switches gives me the following error:
      gpg: fatal: can't open fd 8 for status output: Bad file
descriptor secmem usage: 0/0 bytes in 0/0 blocks of pool 0/0
I don't know if it's an issue of gpgme (1.0.2), gnupg or sylpheed...
Are there any other sylpheed users using the OpenPGP Crypto Card or do
have an idea about what could be wrong with my setup?
Thank you in advance!

For me the whole issue seems to be a problem of gpgme. I came to this
view after trying several tools, depending on gpgme. Any application
linked against gpgme (sylpheed, gpa, usw.) seems to hang while other
applications which speak to gpg "natively" work just like a charm...
Other views or ways to solve my little problem are very appreciated,
because I can't use sylpheed with encryption currently...
Thank you in advance!
