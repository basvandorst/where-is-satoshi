@_subject: beginner to gnupg 
I am very new to PGP.  I understand the concept of a public key and a private
key. I worked with a client who sent me their public key which was a nice text
file. Im trying to export my public key to a text file but everytime I run
it I get a bunch of jumble garbage.
C:\GNU\GnuPG>gpg --export "key name" > C:\GNU\GnuPG\public.key
I tried to pass the -a parameter with a username but that didnt work either.
I guess im also not sure what user name should go there? Can you have more than one key with the same name and a different user name?
In my pubring and secring there are keys. I want to be able to extact them
so I can send someone my public key.

@_subject: GPG Home Directory 
I cna't seem to get the directory to change where gpg looks for the keyring
I ran the following
C:\GNUPG>gpg --homedir C:\GNUPG\
gpg: keyring `C:/GNUPG/\secring.gpg' created
gpg: keyring `C:/GNUPG/\pubring.gpg' created
gpg: Go ahead and type your message ...
Then when I run --list-keys its still points to the original directory.
C:\GNUPG>gpg --list-keys
C:/Documents and Settings/webmethods/Application Data/gnupg\pubring.gpg
