@_subject: anonymous clearsigned messages (was 'possible new feature'/'security concerns) 
you can do this now, if you really want to,
but it is a little *cumbersome*... ;)
[1]clearsign as you would normally
[2]use the throw-keyid switch to encrypt only the armored signature block
[3]replace the armored signature block with the encrypted signature block
[4]the intended receiver decrypts it, and pastes the decrypted signature block
back into the original signed message, in the correct place where the signature
block should be, and it verifies ok
{can send you some e-mail tests if you are interested}
but wouldn't it be simpler to just 'sign and encrypt' with throw-keyid switch,
as it is now?

@_subject: conventional encryption with passphrase remaining blank? 
is it possible to conventionally encrypt a file, but leave the passphrase blank?
the purpose of this would be to have a signed file, and the detached signature bundled as one
ordinarily, if one receives a signed and encrypted file, and then decrypts it,
the signature automatically verifies
in a signed file, with a detached signature, there is always the possibility
of the signature being lost / stored in a separate area, than the signed file,
with difficulties in verifying it at a later date
a signed and encrypted file, that would be conventionally encrypted with a 'null' passphrase, would serve to keep the file and signature always together,
and also speed the verification process.
would such an option be possible?
with Respect,

@_subject: conventional encryption with passphrase remaining blank? 
it is the only way to sign anything other than simple text.
word documents, pdf's, spreadsheets, images, etc.
all require detached signatures.
it can be accomplished now by signing and conventionally encrypting, and simply letting all the necessary recipients know the passphrase,
but what i was asking about,
is something analogous to 'armored signing' but for a file other than text.
armored signed texfiles decrypt without any passphrases,
and the signature verifies immediately
{with the added benefit that there is no 'whitespace alteration' in transit
that might invalidate the signature, leaving the recipient to wonder if there was 'tampering' or just 'e-mail client un-intentional changes'} it might be beneficial to have a similar signing procedure for 'files',
where the signature and the file are 'armored', but do not require a key or passphrase for decryption/verification,
{with the benefit that the detached sig is not lost, misfiled, etc.
and have the armored file instantly verified each time it is opened}.
with Respect,

@_subject: deletion of a photo-id 
is there a way to delete a photo id completely from a key? [ gnupg 1.2.0 ]
{can the deluid command  be used to refer to the photo id as a user id and remove it ?}

@_subject: lost public key 
ckt build 8 cannot recognize the new secret key format introduced in 1.0.7
but ckt 9 beta (1,2, and 3) does, and will automatically generate the public key when importing the secret key
you can confirm this on ckt build 8, by generating a test key in gnupg, while
using the option of '--simple-sk-checksum'
and then import only the private key to ckt build 8,

@_subject: throw-keyid modification 
Disastry has this modification in 2.6.3 multi for the fake keyid commands,
where each recipient (including the default encrypt to self) can have a fake or random id, and the 'real' recipient, the real id
{example: pgp +fake_keyid=123456789abcdef -e file sender recipient}
the message will be encrypted to the real key of the recipient,
and the 'fake key' of the sender,
gnupg will treat such an encrypted message as an ordinary one for the recipient,
but will require '--try-all-secrets' for the sender to be able to decrypt.
{requires an old v3 rsa key for experimentation, but can be generated in 2.6.3 multi 'without idea' as the preferred recipient}
a possible modification might be to repeat the 'throw_keyid' command in front of each recipient for the completely anonymous throw-keyid message,
and to just leave it out, before the sender's key, for the 'modified-anonymous- sender' feature
{would love to see it,  ;)  }
with Respect,

@_subject: suggestion for possible modification of throw-keyid switch 
Hash: RIPEMD160
have posted here {incorrectly :(  } a few days ago about how to
achieve selective anonymity in a message encrypted to more than
one key, by using the fake_keyid command in Disastry's
it 'can' be done, but is somewhat more involved than the way i
posted it.
for those interested, the explanation / sample message / pgp
are posted here:
the encrypted message, and the two sample keys, are all done
using '3des', and not 'idea', to spare anyone the inconvenience
of changing anyone's gnupg build/setup.
it may be a useful concept/tool for consideration as an optional
gnupg feature
with Respect,

@_subject: decrypting {verifying sig} without compressing 
a workaround could be possible, if it could be arranged that the messages would be encrypted and then signed {two procedures, first encrypt, then sign the encrypted message as a detached sig}
if you could request this of the people who send you signed and encrypted messages, this might accomplish what you are seeking

@_subject: follow-up : signing with a v3 rsa key in GnuPG 1.1.92 
have just generated a new v3 rsa key in pgp 2.6.3 multi 6
(default settings, nothing fancy, same as 2.6.3)
imported it to gnupg, made it the default key, and got the same error message as before
here is the key:
the passphrase is the same as the keyname:

can anyone else reproduce this problem,

@_subject: followup:  signing with a v3 rsa key in 1.1.9.2 
found the reason:
rsa v3 keys generated in 6.5.8 have the symmetric algo as 'cast-5' by default,
while in 2.6.x it is 'idea'
what is unusual, is that if the key is checked in 'key properties' in pgp keys,
the symmetric algo is listed as 'idea' for 'any' v3 rsa key, no matter how it was generated,
the actual algo used will be listed in pgpdump,
so, the 2.6.x keys need the 'idea' module installed,
while v3 rsa keys generated in later versions,
{or in 2.6.x Multi with the option specified as a non-'idea' algorithm},
do not

@_subject: followup v3 rsa key 
i 'thought' i understood, but now i am more confused  :(
please bear with me:
[1] am running 1.1.92a windows binary with the idea plugin correctly installed, and everything works as expected
[2] disabled the option of 'load-extension c:\gnupg\lib\idea'
[3] as expected, i cannot sign with my default v3 rsa key generated in 2.6.3
[4] i 'can' sign with another v3 rsa key that was generated in 6.5.8 ckt
[5] both pgpdump and pgpckt identify the symmetric algorithm for this other v3 rsa key, as idea
here is the v3 rsa key that 'can' be signed with, *without* the idea plug-in:

[6] here is the pgpdump result for the key:

this key was generated in 6.5.8ckt(build 5) with 'default' settings, without disabling idea
if it has idea as the symmetric algo protecting the key, why doesn't it need the idea plug-in to sign with,
and if idea is 'not' the symmetric algo ptrotecting the secret key, why does pgpdump (and ckt) identify it that way?

maybe not in 1.0.7,
try with the 1.1.9.2 windows binary,
here is an armored signed message using the same v3 rsa test key, without loading the 'idea' plugin

i do have the idea.dll in the windows system, and in the gnupg\lib
but have disabled the load-extension c:\gnupg\lib\idea
what is most puzzling,
is that (at least for me on the 1.1.9.2 windows binary)
it distinguishes between v3 rsa keys generated in 2.6.3
and in 6.5.8,
does not allow signing with the 2.6.3 keys, but does allow with the 6.5.8
have not tried to sign using 1.0.7 .
