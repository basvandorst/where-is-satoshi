@_subject: computing detached signature for a batch of files 
Hi people,
I'm using gpg to build detached signatures for packages.
When doing so, I generally have several files to sign.
For instance I may have to sign foo-1.1.tar.gz and foo-1.1.tar.bz2.
It's a burden to type my pass-phrase for each file I want to sign.
Is there any way I could do this and still type my pass-phrase only once?
I've already tried "gpg --detach-sign foo-1.1.tar.gz foo-1.1.tar.bz2",
but that creates one signature instead of two signatures (I assume
this is the signature for the concatenation of both files, but I haven't
Is there any option I'm missing?
