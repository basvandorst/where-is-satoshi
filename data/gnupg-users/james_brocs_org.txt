@_subject: Security Concerns 
Hello, I am a newbie and I have a few questions:
First, I am using GnuPG with Mandrake Linux 8.2.  90% of my usage is via Kmail.  This is working fine and I am able to send encrypted and signed emails and I have received encryted emails no problem.
I set up my gpg using the online manual, so I used all the defaults.  I have read a little about how GnuPG works and I understand that breaking the code on an encrypted file is pretty near impossible.  My question is about the signed files and emails.  If I send an email or file that is signed, but not encrypted, isn't this a little dangerous?  My concern is that don't you give out some information on your private key if you sign it?  I am not big on the math, so any pointers you have on how to do this safely would be appreciated.
Perhaps the fact that I have the primary key and the sub key assure my Also, I have never used an unattached signature file.  What is this and do I need one?
Thanks for the help.

@_subject: Problems with Public Key 
I am using Kmail with gpg.  I have been able to send encrypted emails to other recipients no problem.  However, I downloaded a new public key and when I try to encrypt with Kmail, the "show encryped results" window shows no encryption.  When I tried another key, it worked fine.  Another thing, this person was able to send me an encrypted email using my public key.
Her public key was generated via PGPfreeware 6.0.2i.  I am using Mandrake Linux 8.2 and I am a newbie.  The one thing to consider is that the holder of the key has a latin name so there is a "\"character in the key name for a special character.  Her name is Nunez and this is shown as "N\xf1ez" in the key name.  Perhaps this is throwing things off.  Please help.
