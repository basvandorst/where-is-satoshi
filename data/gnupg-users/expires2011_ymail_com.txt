The meaning and implications of "vouching for" somebody are massively
dependent on context and circumstances. In the context of a discussion
about openPGP certifications, in the abstract without any specific use
for those certifications lurking in the shadows, I see no difference
between "vouching for someone's identity" and "vouching for someone."
Whilst "vouch" is yet another term with the potential to confuse, is
it really any more confusing than "certification" or "assertion of
As an aside, I've always found "control" to be more helpful than
"ownership" in my thought processes about openPGP keys. Who "controls"
the private key has an obvious meaning to me, who "owns" a key seems a

Please describe how checking key fingerprints is in any way related to
email addresses.
My understanding is that there is a three-point check:-
1. checking the fingerprint to ensure you have the correct key.
2. checking identity documents to ensure it is the correct person.
3. sending an encrypted message to ensure somebody controlling that
   key can receive emails at that address.
Number 7 is a very rude thing to do. Much better to email the signed
key to John Smith and let him decide whether or not to publish it with
your signature on it.
Better still to encrypt that message to the key you have just signed,
so that only a person in control of that key has access to the copy
bearing your signature. Then delete the exportable signature from your
own copy of that key and replace it with a local signature, so that
you don't accidentally send it to a server bearing your signature,
potentially against John Smith's wishes.

addresses on domains they used to own...).
And an attacker may include an email address they are hoping/planning

A key's UIDs don't *have to* contain email addresses. But in the case
where they do, a verification email would be a useful addition. But
whether useful enough to warrant the increased complexity and server
load, I have no idea.
Since you don't log into a keyserver when you post, and keyservers
store data but do not perform cryptographic functions, this is pretty
much inevitable. The "keyserver-no-modify" flag could, in theory,
carry with it a requirement that modifications to a key were signed by
that key. But, once again, increased complexity and server load. And
what about propagating changes between keyservers?

A couple of years ago, somebody who had joined PGPNET started
a discussion about having a PGPNET signing key to sign the keys of all
the members, IIRC. He was adamant this was necessary and there was a
quite acrimonious discussion. Basically, nobody else wanted it, so he
left the group, created his own "PGPNET Signing Key," signed all the
members' keys with it, and uploaded them to a keyserver. Quite a few
of those keys had not previously been on the servers because not
everybody wants their keys on the servers. Shortly afterwards, the
"JBARSE" signature appeared on the rogue "PGPNET Signing Key." Which
means all those keys now bear a signature from a key that is itself
signed by a key with the UID of "Jane's bondage and rubberwear sex

Yes. Of course, it is pretty poor form to upload it yourself rather
than sending the signed copy to the person whose key it is, so that
they can make the decision themself to upload. Still, it is easy to
accidentally upload, or to deliberately but maliciously upload.

Unless somebody visits the link in the verification email, the key
will not be added to the PGP Global Directory.
Nor can the person who controls foo at example.com but your email has
just provided the service of alerting them of the existence of the
attacker's key.
Convenience. *If* you trust the signature from the server that says they
verified the email address for you, you don't need to do it yourself.
I would rather use hashes in UIDs, so that if you have my name or
email address you can locate my key but inspecting my key does not
give you my identity or contact details.
Why indeed. My government won't issue a passport that doesn't include

What's a "legitimate User ID?" My understanding is that, whilst the de
facto standard is a name and an email address, there is no compulsion
over what string to choose.
Isn't the User ID simply the string which the user has chosen as an
identifier for their key, which can be something more human-friendly
than the key id?
I thought the Key ID and the User ID both identified the key, the
certifications were an assertion from other people that the User ID
was consistent with the user's real-world identity, and that these
certifications in combination with the User ID identified the user.

Does this ambiguity cause you to not consider the string "John Smith"

Or might be a name the user has given to the key itself to enable easy identification, for example there are many called "Test Key."
Does it actually _imply_ that, or does that merely fit the de facto
standard of User IDs containing real names (and usually email
addresses)? The terms Key ID and User ID also reflect one being
mathematically derived from the key material whereas the other is
chosen by the user.

I think key UIDs generally reveal more information than I am
comfortable with. For example, why does your UID need to contain your
email address in plain text rather than as a hash? Searching for that
email address would need to return any keys that matched on the hashed
version in addition to any keys that matched on the plaintext version.
Somebody knowing the email address (or name or hostname) could find
the key but mere inspection of the key UIDs would not reveal all its
owner's names, email addresses, etc.
I'm usually told such an option does not exist because it would serve
no purpose and/or there would be no demand for it.

If the key has been sent to a keyserver or to another user while that
signature is on it, deleting the signature from your local copy
obviously will not remove it from their copy. You can "revoke" a
signature and send the key out again; the signature is still there but
marked as revoked. You can also revoke user IDs, subkeys, or the

The word list is there as an additional option to use in PGP, which
also uses hexadecimal (or did when I used PGP 8.x). I fail to see how
the word "biometric" applies, except as an extension of the metaphor
about key digests being fingerprints. The word list is an alternative
way of expressing the same information, and the word "biometric" is
(loosely) an alternative word for "fingerprint."
The word-list might present issues for non-English-speakers, as
discussed a decade ago in the thread at
Reverse directory information is available here only for law

Because the signature time means nothing, unless there is
corroboration. It is trivial to alter a system clock (or to use
software to pass a different time to an app).
If the time/date of signing is legally significant, there had better
be more reliable evidence than the signature time.
Look at the various independent timestamping services available and
make up your own mind whether any of them may be relied upon.
The time from a timestamping service is not the same thing as the time
the document was signed. The timestamping service cannot add its
timestamp until it receives the document. When it receives the
document will depend on when the local user sends it, not on when they
sign it.
As far as I understand, creating a new, additional signature is
precisely what a timestamping service does. It demonstrates the local
user signed before a particular date/time (but not how long before).
In order to give assurance the document was signed after (rather than
before) a particular date/time, the signature from the timestamping
service could be obtained before the local user's signature is

Court proceedings tend to require evidence. The use of a timestamping
service could provide this.
Given that technology is required to produce an OpenPGP signature, it
seems reasonable (to me) to suggest using technology to provide a
verifiable time period for when that signature was made. Technology
can be a tool to assist society in its work.

The "problem" is very simple: the timestamp contained in an OpenPGP
signature cannot be relied upon as accurate without independent
corroboration. An example of such corroboration is to use a
timestamping service that is trusted by the relevant parties.
You asserted that the signer's own signature timestamp was sufficient
when a third party needs to prove when the document was signed. I
replied with the bare bones of a scenario where the third party brings
evidence that suggests the signature timestamp to be incorrect, so
that the signer needs to refute that evidence.
The "problem" is not sufficiently complex to allow this.
The "what is being proven" is when the document was signed.
The "who has an interest" matters only if it affects the proposed
solution. As an example, if an independent timestamping service can be
shown to be sufficiently reliable, it could provide the proof
regardless of which party has an interest in using that proof.

It depends on the proof. If it involved referring the court to
hashed/signed information regularly published by the timestamping
service, such as to newsgroups or in newspapers, the original signer
may not have similar to rely upon.
The parties themselves could nest signatures on a document: A signs, B
signs the signed document, A signs again, B signs again. Each party
has a signature that is constrained to have been applied between two
signatures of the other party. Would that not remove the need for a
timestamping service?
Proving a timestamping service's clock to be fair and honest would not
remove my ability to alter my system clock or to use software to pass
a different time to GnuPG.

A signature that contained only the information for (B) would reveal
less about the signer's behaviour than a signature containing the

is stored in the signature packet as seconds since epoch.

Obviously, one refers to a one-second period of time and the other
refers to a whole day. It would refer to a whole day even without the
"/P1D" but that doesn't affect the point. In the examples "2011-06-16/P2D" or
"2011-06-13/P1W" the time period makes a difference.
If the time period were to be included as an additional field without
altering the contents of the timestamp field, the latter would still
reveal exactly the information it reveals now about the signer's time
management behaviour. The value stored in the timestamp field would
need to be altered, so that the exact time of signing was not stored
but also so that existing apps didn't choke on it.

Really? The references I have read suggest to me that ISO 8601 takes
YYYY-MM-DD to be a 24-hour period, and YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00 to be the
second at the start of the day.
And this was the field you said should be non-critical, right?
Or to the start of the week(or month or year, etc.)
and use /P1W (or P1M or P1Y, etc.).
What about a user who desired no datestamp at all? Would they just use
something like 1970-01-01T00:00:00/P68Y?
What about time zones? Lets say person A, signing the document, has a
local time offset of GMT+2 and person B, receiving the document, has a
local time offset of GMT+1. Person A has their app set to round down
to the beginning of the day, which in person B's local time is
23:00:00 on the previous day. I guess person A seeing
20110618T000000/P1D and person B seeing 20110617T230000/P1D is a
non-issue, since the two refer to the same time interval in UTC.

Also, I think 1901-01-01T00:00:00/2001-01-01T00:00:00

and 1901-01-01/2001-01-01 would be equivalent to 1901-01-01/P100Y.
They are different in the same way as 5 Euros is different to
5.00 Euros.
Aren't the timestamps recorded in the signature packets as unix time
[1], and displayed in the local time detected from the user's system?
I think the ISO 8601 standard assumes local time unless otherwise
specified. So it makes sense for each person viewing the signature to
see the timestamp in their own local time if no time zone information
is included.
20110618T000000+0200/P1D and 20110617T230000+0100/P1D both refer to
the same time period without ambiguity.
If people feel there is ambiguity here, maybe this is best dealt with
by adding some simple text to the GnuPG output to indicate that times
are shown in local time, as per the user's system.

The point I was making was stating a value accurate to a different
number of significant figures subtly alters the meaning. "5 Euros" was
evidently a poor example but it does illustrate there can be a
difference. A retailer stating the price of something in any of the
styles you mention above would mean exactly the same thing. A friend
or colleague discussing the price or value of something who stated "5
Euros" rather than any of the more exact forms, quite possibly does
not mean "5 Euros exactly."
Your example time period of "the 20th century" clearly starts and ends
at midnight, so nothing is effectively changed by your switch from
omitting the time in "1901-01-01 / P100Y" to including it in
"1901-01-01 T 00:00:00 / 2001-01-01 T 00:00:00," even though the
second form is stated to a greater level of accuracy.
More generally, a time period of YYYY-MM-DD/PnD does not necessarily
run from midnight at the beginning of the first day to midnight at the
end of the last day; in the absence of any further information this
cannot be known, and is not a safe assumption. Context may show
something different, such as business hours only.
But I digress.

I see. I'm not sure how the interval notation will interact with the
timestamp. If "behind the scenes" the interval were actually recorded
as seconds (and the timestamp is recorded as seconds since epoch),
then it is automatically anchored to UTC. But, as at present, does not
have to be displayed in UTC.
Local time to each person is the time in their respective timezone.
I think we do not need it.
What is wrong with your system displaying that a signature was made
20110618T000000/P1D (your local time) and my system showing that the
same signature was made 20110617T230000/P1D (my local time)? That's
what happens now (with exact times rather than intervals) and I have
seen no discussions of ambiguity or the need to state timezones.
What I was trying to impart was that when I see a time, I interpret it
to be a time stated in my local time unless I am aware of a reason to
think otherwise. So when I see 20110617T230000/P1D, in the absence of
any information to the contrary, I understand it as local time which
(in the Summer) is 20110617T230000+0100/P1D.
It seems likely to me that somebody in a +0200 time zone would
similarly assume a time to be in their local time zone, so would
interpret 20110618T000000/P1D to mean 20110618T000000+0200/P1D.
GnuPG stores the timestamp in seconds since epoch and displays it in
the local time detected from the machine it is running on. AFAIK, we
were not suggesting this changed.
If the signature was created on a machine with local time zone set to
+0200, then it means 20110618T000000+0200/P1D. If somebody views that
signature on a machine with local time zone set to +0100, then they
will see 20110617T230000/P1D, which means 20110617T230000+0100/P1D and
refers to the same interval as 20110618T000000+0200/P1D.

Fair enough.
We know the timestamp, rounded back to the start of the interval; that
is recorded in the timestamp field. We know the length of the interval
(/P1D, /P1M, or whatever), that will be recorded in the interval
field. Those two pieces of information uniquely define the interval
without the need for guesswork and without the need to know the
signer's local timezone.
As already mentioned, I do not see the need for a timezone. I'm not
against including one if there a need can be demonstrated.
Unless the timestamp is rounded back to the start of the interval, it
still reveals (potentially sensitive) information about the signer's
time management.
You mean because we are only discussing how the interval is to be
recorded? Fair enough.
I think that is implicit. However, what intervals may be allowable? If
the interval is one hour/day/month/year then we round to the start of
the current one. If the interval is one week, which day does the week
start? Do we allow a period of two hours/months etc. and if so, where do
we round back to? What about ten years?
Somewhere along the line I interpreted the suggestion as adding a
timestamp-interval field to the signature packet, and rounding the
timestamp field down to the start of that interval.
You mean actually computing /P
(or alternatively /) and placing
it in a signature notation for each signature or batch of signatures?
Automation would be needed for many people to take this up. Or at the
very least, using long intervals so that the notation needs editing
infrequently. (-;
Is the effect of this that the interval is simply ignored by an app
that doesn't understand it? Would it look like the signature was
created at the start of the interval or the actual clock time it was
Rather than an assumed "Z" we should have a marker that indicates we
do not know the time zone. This is one of those cases where the
technology can't guess for the user. I think the ISO 8601 solution to
ambiguous or unknown timezone is to use "-0000." I didn't understand
how that was different from "+0000" or "Z" when I read it.
I would suggest three options: UTC, the local timezone of the user
viewing the signature, and the timezone stated in the interval field.
Fair enough. But if it is simply a signature notation, how/why does it
get parsed at all rather than simply displayed? Are you suggesting the
value recorded in the OpenPGP timestamp field in the signature packet
is rounded back to the start of the interval before recording, or left

Yes. We already said round the timestamp back to the start of the
current interval. That would be the beginning of the current hour, or
day, month, year, etc.
Or (as previously mentioned) YYYY-MM-DDT23:00/P1D. Somebody with their
system set to a different time zone would see those.
Cool. That is what I thought you said before, but the "not changed"
confused me.
No, I mean that if the interval is (for example) one day, then it is
implicit that it means exactly one day plus zero years, zero months,
zero hours, etc.
I don't know. There may be a technical reason we've not thought of. Or
it may be desirable for clarity and simplicity. I just thought it
appropriate to raise the question.
Without rounding it says "I signed this at 11:37 but it could have
been any time that day" and with rounding, it simply says "I signed it
some time that day."
Do you not think "11:37 but it could have been any time that day" will
just be perceived as "11:37 that day?"
What is the difference? Are they not different motivations to the same
end? (Both seek to broaden the interval for a signature time to
something longer than the current single second.)
Yes, of course. A week can start any day an individual or organisation
wants it to. To always pick the associated date as the start of the
one-week interval seems wrong to me. It may be appropriate to allow
the user to set what day their week starts (or even to allow a random
week that starts on the associated date or any of the six previous
Does the OpenPGP standard allow tying together a signature notation
with altering the content of the signature packet (in this case by
possibly rounding off the timestamp)? I don't know.
I agree that the start of the interval needs to be precisely defined,
and so does either the length or the end of that interval.
"Z" is valid for UTC. Otherwise it's the offset +hhmm or -hhmm.
Does that option exist with notations, or is it something you would
like added?
Some descriptions on the internet say so but I could not devine a
useful meaning. I have not purchased the original document.
The implementation has the timestamp field in the signature packet to
refer to, even if rounded, if it doesn't know what to do with the

Apart from email clients, what infrastructure expects email addresses
in UIDs?
Any keyserver could handle searching for both the plain text and the
hash: the client could query for one string, then for the other, then
combine the results.
Hashes would need to be generated when selecting keys on the local
keyring too, not just when talking to keyservers.
A plaintext "collision" where two people have the same name in their
UID is nothing to write home about. Why would it be an issue if the
colliding string happened to be a hash?

Since the keyserver-no-modify flag is set by default in GnuPG and this
warning would be triggered for a large percentage of keys, why bother
checking for the flag? "Do you really want to publish this key to a
keyserver?" could be asked every time the user told the client to
upload any key, perhaps also displaying some info about the key and
the server.

My analogy, admittedly not a direct comparison, would be having a
phone number that is ex-directory. It is no defence against random
dialling, nor against your number being recorded from outgoing calls
if you don't take steps such as withholding the CLI, nor against
somebody who has your number passing it on without your permission.
Despite these failings there is still benefit in being ex-directory.
Those of us who use different email addresses with different contacts
(and/or periodically change email addresses) might generate a hashed
user ID for each email address, maybe with a non-hashed user-id for
our name. Similarly with role-based user IDs, a user might have their
name in a non-hashed UID but use hashed UIDs for their roles.

The benefits of your phone number being ex-directory are the benefits
that derive from it being harder for people to obtain your phone
number without your permission, harder to link the number to your
name/address, and impossible to find your address or phone number by
looking in the phone book.
A key that had only hashed UIDs would have analogous benefits relating
to email address instead of phone number and to keyserver instead of
phone book.
A key with some hashed and some human-readable UIDs would perhaps be
like having two phone numbers, one listed and the other ex-directory.
Depends who evaluates the worth, how they evaluate it, and if you
accept that is really the trade-off.
I use different email addresses with different contacts and change
some email addresses regularly. Hashed UIDs would allow hiding my
email addresses from the people they are not used with, as well as
preventing a human-readable set of defunct email addresses. If I
included my email addresses in hashed UIDs, they are not
human-readable but could still be used to find/identify my key and
maybe even facilitate opportunistic encryption. At the moment I cannot
usefully include them hashed, so I don't include them at all. For my
own key, to me the trade-off is if hashed but still useful I will
include, if human-readable I will not. For somebody else encountering
my key, the trade-off is the email address they want to match is
either in a hashed user ID or it's in no user ID at all.
What is the disadvantage of a large number of non-human-readable User
IDs on a key? The User ID that I am using at the time (eg to select a
key) is useful, all others are irrelevant noise and may as well not be

Once, maybe. But for quite a few years (in the UK at least) there have
been many competing directory enquiries services, and more recently
the online versions as well. Choosing to be ex-directory is a
binding instruction to your telephone company not to release your
number to any such services.
It is also much easier to create new email addresses than it is to
change phone numbers. And more practical to have multiple or
short-life email addresses than is the case with phone numbers.
For somebody who uses the same email address to communicate with many
contacts and keeps the same email address for a long time, that is
true. For somebody like me who uses various different email addresses
and replaces some of them on a regular basis it is plenty practical
Not exactly analogous (hence my "admittedly not a direct comparison"
when I introduced it) but I have drawn enough parallels for it to be a
relevant comparison. Of course there are differences.

You are going off at a tangent. The mechanism for preventing the phone
number being obtainable from a query of the phone book or directory
enquiry services is not relevant; just the fact that it can easily be
Consider these scenarios:-
1.      I have a phone number that you don't know.
        This phone number is listed in the phone book and at directory
        enquiries.
        It is trivial for you to obtain the number.
2.      I have a phone number that you don't know.
        This phone number is not listed in the phone book or at
        directory enquiries.
        It is harder for you to obtain the number.
A parallel exists with:-
3.      I have email addresses that you don't know.
        These email addresses are readable from my key's user IDs.
        It is trivial for you to obtain these email addresses.
4.      I have email addresses that you don't know.
        These email addresses are not readable from my key's user IDs.
        It is harder for you to obtain these email addresses.
"This phone number is not listed in the phone book or at directory
enquiries" is easily achieved by being ex-directory; this does not
affect the usefulness of my telephone service. It is only easy because
the appropriate mechanism has been put in place to achieve it.
"These email addresses are not readable from my key's user IDs" is
easily achieved by simply not including them in the user IDs. This is
easy because the user ID field is free-text and doesn't have to be
Name (Comment) . This adversely affects the usefulness
of my key, since MUAs commonly rely on the email address in the user
ID for key selection.
Hashed user IDs are a possible alternative mechanism to achieve "these
email addresses are not readable from my key's user IDs" that could
have less of an adverse affect on key usefulness.
I said "in this respect the two are similar."
You appear to be saying "they are not similar because in these
other respects they are different."
A good point well made.
I was comparing the effort involved in actually creating a new email
address (a few seconds to a couple of minutes at the keyboard) to the
effort involved in actually getting the phone company to change a
phone number (ringing the phone company, navigating their stupid menu
system, eventually getting through to a customer service agent in
foreign parts who barely speaks English, trying to make them
understand, discussing the reasons why they should provide the number
change - such as nuisance phone calls you have been receiving, wait
for the change to happen, chase up the billing errors, etc.).

Not especially so. The ones I use for mailing lists etc. change
periodically. This makes no difference to people contacting me, since
they should be doing it via the list. Ones I use with specific
individuals or groups of people, some are quite fleeting while others
persist for years.
Something that would not be necessary if the underlying openPGP
implementations could handle hashed user IDs.
Isn't that best handled *after* a proof-of-concept?
Could these be handled by a local proxy? The openPGP implementation
(which is configured to use the local proxy as keyserver, and not to
check the local keyring) queries the proxy using the plaintext search
string. The proxy checks the local keyring for both the plaintext
search string and the hash, and returns the combined results to the
openPGP implementation. The proxy (simultaneously?) queries a
keyserver for both the plaintext search string and the hash. If there
were matches in the local keyring, the keyserver results are discarded
(or cached?). If there were no matches in the local keyring, the
combined results from the keyserver are returned to the openPGP
implementation and keys may be imported as normal.
That is not necessarily harder than convincing them to sign user IDs
wit no email address.

What would need to be enforced? If a user chose to use hashes when
creating their user-IDs, then all by themself without the need for any
enforcement mechanism they have obscured the data; somebody already in
possession of the data can compare hashes but somebody inspecting the
user-IDs cannot extract the information that is obscured.
Precisely the point of using hashes in user-IDs: all that would be
available to copy and share is a hash of the data.

not needing to search. I deliberately used the comparative. Now I'm

The WoT can be mapped with or without names. In your example, how is
your trust enhanced by knowing Gianna's name? "I signed Frank's key
and I see that Frank's signed a key that has user ID

How does the WoT idea require me to know the names or email addresses
associated with the keys in the trust path? The text strings in User
IDs do not feature in the trust calculation.
That one sentence quoted in isolation from Hauke could be construed in
that way. But take into account the context and it becomes clear that

What would not be visible (at least to people who didn't already know

Whatever you do with user IDs is optional, since they are just a
free-text field. And of course a user wanting to make their key match
more searches could include extra UIDs with additional hashes. For
example John Smith  could include hashes of
example.com and of john.smith. In any event, including the information
in hashed form should make the key more likely to be found than if the
info were not there at all.

Presumably GnuPG factors this into the trust calculations by virtue of
the trust level you have assigned to Ben's key, not by parsing his
User IDs.
In real life, true. But what about the GnuPG default of trusting a key
that carries certifications from 1 fully trusted or 3 marginally
trusted keys. Unless you manually inspect each trust path, how would
you spot unknown keys from past real-life associates you distrusted?
Indeed, if you know that a certificate belongs to somebody you
actually know, trust *calculations* are irrelevant. Of course you
might trust somebody's security procedures and keysigning policy but
wish to keep your valuables or your wife well away from him.

could be. Longer email addresses at less-obvious domain names makes it

Since anybody can add a certification to the key saying whatever they
choose, somebody else could make public one or more of the hashed

That assumes that there is no need to obscure a piece of information
unless it is known that somebody is actively looking for the
information. In my world you obscure certain information simply
because it is nobody else's business. Just like you move stuff to the
drawer or filing cupboard because there is an offchance that somebody
walking through the office might read it if left on the desk, not
because you think they are specifically looking for it.
That suggests that all information should be published unless it can
be demonstrated there is a compelling reason to not publish. Whilst
this is true for some categories of information, it is not universally
true for all information. Much information relating to corporations or
individuals would not be published unless there were a compelling
reason to publish.
My email addresses are personal contact information relating to me as
an individual. I know of no reason to publish any of my email
addresses to anybody other than those with whom I use that email
address to communicate; they are quite simply nobody else's business.
In the absence of a reason to publish, there is no requirement for a
reason to not publish.
Just like a moderately skilled attacker could look in the desk drawer
or filing cabinet, or could open the envelope that obscures a bank
statement or telephone bill. Those schemes are good enough for the
minimal level of protection they seek to provide.
It offers no such thing. In order to be an illusion it would need to
be fooling somebody. The scheme was never claimed to offer security
against any form of attack more severe than casual snooping, and never
could because anybody could add signatures to the key that stated the
unhashed version of any of the hashed strings.
The scenario of a spammer brute-forcing and then spamming was
interesting, if a little esoteric. Usually, spamming subsides after a
few weeks and (aside from a certain amount of irritation and wasted
time) is of little consequence. If the spammer published a list
enumerating the email accounts that went with the particular key ID
then it might be a significant attack against this scheme. Even then,
it would have little relevance unless the list (or maybe a link to it)
were in a signature appended to the key.
Insurance companies, amongst others, earn billions by doing just that.
But this scheme is no illusion; I am aware of no pretence that it
offers anything it does not.
It depends on the reason for wishing to use blinded UIDs. You have
demonstrated limitations to this idea; I still believe it to be
adequate for my purposes. More thought is needed, followed by further
discussion at some point.

I'm assuming a short descriptive paragraph in the gpg.man file plus
some good info becoming available over time in various "start up
guides" etc. by searching the web or mailing list archives or asking
on mailing lists, as with other GnuPG features. It doesn't matter if
people learn after the key is created because additional UIDs
containing extra hashes can be added later.
Fair enough but I believe a person's desire to withhold their own
personal information outranks another person's desire to make use of
that personal information.
I would like hashing to be offered for the name and then again for the
email address, along with a one-liner that obscuring the information
in the UIDS offered minimal protection as described in gpg.man and
made it harder for other users to locate and use the key; if there's a
default answer it should be "No". Maybe others would feel it should be
only in expert mode, or perhaps enabled by a "hash-uid" option to the
"gen-key" command.
The main disadvantage I see in hashing the information is slightly
increased complexity in locating keys. That assumes the individual
would otherwise have a key containing his information unhashed. For
individuals whose UIDs would otherwise contain spurious or no
information, locating their key should become easier.
The search/research capability that you outlined would be reduced if
significant numbers of keys with only hashed UIDs came about, if
the organisations you are searching allow their people to use such
The impact on the WoT is unclear. One scenario is no change from the

My understanding is that the new keybox format for storing keys will
allow storing of metadata such as when the key was last
refreshed/updated/matched a search, usage statistics, and local notes
which might include the known names and/or email addresses.
Don't forget the additional feature of being able to publish a key
that, by direct examination, will not reveal your name(s) and/or email
address(es) but can still be located by a user who already has that
information about you.
There is a balance to be achieved. A user taking advantage of the new
feature have to accept the key would be less efficiently searched and
located than one which announced all their details in flashing lights;
a user encountering that key can at least locate it from the name or
email address, unlike if the key owner had used spurious or no
information in the UIDs.
Yes, different people you communicate with using different names/email
addresses could share information. If this were uploaded to a database
that became widely used instead of keyservers it would circumvent the
whole idea...

Whether on a keyserver or on your local keyring, I see little
difference. Keys that exist on local keyrings sooner or later tend to
end up on keyservers.
The first two or three times I looked at PGP and GnuPG, I found the
apparent requirement to include personal information in user IDs
repulsive and therefore moved on without any further study. A feature
such as this might have attracted me to study further and maybe adopt
sooner. Burying it in expert mode, and thereby branding it as
nonsensical or silly and for experts only, would have effectively
rendered it invisible to me.
No I would not wish to prevent them. Anyway, I'm not convinced that a
mechanism to enforce the keyserver-no-modify flag is possible. In the
absence of such a mechanism, wishing is about all you could do to
prevent such signatures.
I would not seek to stop them, and if I did they might not listen.
A scheme such as this would allow the user, without publishing their
personal information, to publish a key that others could locate and
use. That is not the same thing as preventing their personal
information being revealed.
Maybe inferred rather than determined. You could have gone to a
keysigning party and met a group of people who knew each other in real
life but you'd never seen any of them before. And working out who you
are in real life wouldn't necessarily reveal your email addresses or
any other identities you had in hashed user IDs. (You might have your
name unhashed and only be hashing your email addresses.)

All fair enough but the reason I see little difference between
personal information being on other people's local keyrings or on
keyservers is covered in the next sentence, which you agreed with.
No offence taken. When I eventually looked into it I realised the
requirement for including the email address, although strongly
suggested by most descriptions and how-to articles I found, was not
real. One of the first keys I created was the one use to I sign these
messages; the  is because whatever PGP version I was using
wouldn't create a key without an "email address" of
string at string.string and I was unaware of example.net at the time.

I already see what you mean; I just happen to disagree. (-;
The timestamp of the signature proves nothing. It is merely the time
on the system clock when the signature was made. The system clock may
be correct or incorrect; in your scenario above, it looks like you set
it deliberately a day behind in an attempt to generate plausible
deniability for your signature.

Fair enough. "Reasonable" is subjective.
In which case your attempt to generate plausible deniability would
have fooled anybody "who's right in their mind" (because they all
believe the signature timestamp has some meaning besides being the
time/date your system clock happened to be set on when you created the
signature). I'm not sure I buy that.
In the edge-case scenario you described previously (where the key only
expired the previous day) I doubt it would make much difference. Even
the weak evidence of the email headers and server logs suggesting your
system clock had been incorrectly set a day behind could be enough to
make your deniability implausible.
That was exactly my point.
A non-digital example of a document signed with a date in the future
is the post-dated cheque, which is supposed to be worthless until the
date written on it. Several people sent me cheques as wedding gifts,
which they dated with our wedding day but we received them during the
couple of weeks before. Most of those were banked the day after we
received them, rather than waiting until we returned from our
honeymoon. A bank clerk tried to refuse the last one I paid in on the
Friday afternoon before our wedding but I persisted and he accepted
The date in the future should have made a difference to those cheques
but did not. (In the case of the last cheque that was queried, it made
no difference because it would be the Monday two days *after* the date
on the cheque that it was presented to the payee's branch for
I suspect that fact of the signature timestamp and the key expiry date
being before the date stated on the document, is something it would be
unwise to rely upon in court. Especially if the other side produced an
"expert" witness who testified about the triviality of altering a
system clock.
Several months out (because it expired last year) is different to your
previous case of several hours out (because it expired yesterday). I
could put the clock back exactly a year and some recipients may not
spot one digit being different, but they are more likely to notice
that than to notice the day being off (unless it occurs early in the
new year before they have got used to spotting the year without
thinking about it).
It helps to raise a question in the mind of the person viewing the
signature (if they spot it).
You can't assume.

Since (like any other legal document) the date on a cheque is deemed
to be the date of the signature, it is a non-digital analogy to the
discussion about signature dates.
You are entirely correct in your assumption.
That failure to correctly scrutinise is fairly common, and often
allows people to cash cheques that have expired.
A cheque is an instruction to your bank to pay an amount of money to
somebody if they present it for payment within six months of the date
it was signed. In order to instruct the bank to pay within six months
from a future date, you are simply preparing in advance an instruction
effective from that future date. The date on the cheque is the date
from which the signature is effective. It is non-standard but was very
common when cheques were in widespread use. There is no lying, fraud
or deception involved.
It is not illegal here, or even unlawful. I have heard of it being
banned elsewhere but never heard a credible rationale as to why the
practice should not be allowed.
Giving clear instructions to a bank is usually a waste of time. They
generally fail to carry them out correctly, in my experience.

It's generally better to read the whole email and then reply to
whichever points I have anything to say about. That way, it is fairly
easy to follow the discussion.
The (future) date on the cheque is simply the date from which the
signed instruction to pay takes effect.
Whether or not people check the signature timestamp, it still means
nothing more than "when I signed this, my signature clock was at this
I made no such assumption, merely stated an opinion.
It was months vs hours. My point was that a few hours one way or the
other, which was open to challenge in the light of the evidence about
an incorrectly set system clock at the time the document was emailed
back, was far less significant than a discrepancy of several months.
Of course, the absence of any evidence that the system clock was
correctly set when the signature was created makes the discussion a
purely academic exercise.

Lying *is* deception. And your words "unless there is intended fraud"
appeared to me to be a reference to fraud.
As for the meaning of the date, whether it is supposed to mean the
date the signature was written or the date the instruction to pay
becomes effective or simply the date the cheque is issued to the payee
is unclear to me - and probably varies around the world. UK banks have
told me all three versions at various times. The one I heard
originally (and most often over the years) is the effective date of
the instruction to pay. YMMV.

I have no idea what is the probability. I have seen no figures
relating to what fraction of people using subkeys with expiry dates
claim to keep their master keys offline.
This depends on whether/how the validity of the assumption affects
your threat model.
Mainly the key's owner, but could also protect others from relying on
signatures from a compromised key for which they have not received a
revocation certificate.
I don't know. Expiry dates serve a purpose but cannot be relied upon,
because system clock times/dates cannot be relied upon and a signature
with a timestamp during the key's validity period is a valid openPGP
signature. This may be addressed by using a trusted timestamp service.
That's an interesting thought experiment.
Could a modified version of "HOW TO MIGRATE A (SUB)KEY INTO A NEW KEY"
 be used to substitute one
of your subkeys with another of the same type and size? Or what would
be the implications of an attacker migrating your subkeys to another
master key?
That is very thorough.
That does seem extreme but it depends on the threat model.
Would that mean a certification of a particular UID on a key was not
valid in conjunction with subkeys that were not present on the copy of
the key you signed? If so, wouldn't that discourage people from using
short-life subkeys because they would need to obtain signatures on new
ones? Or have I misunderstood?

reasonably sure somebody posted that they had to remove the angle
brackets to get the group line to work on their set-up.
