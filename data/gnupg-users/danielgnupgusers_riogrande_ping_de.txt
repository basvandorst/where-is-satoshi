@_subject: OpenPGP card and signing 
as my last mail did not get through, here is a new one (maybe the
list-moderators could drop the old one).
The "OpenPGP Card 1.1" specification mentions that ripemd as digest
(page 35).
I could do even without pcscd.
What Michael has not mentioned was, that he (as well as i) do use
Using the agent enables openssh to use the key for public-key auth.
When using the --use-agent switch (with gpg), the agent will communicate
to the openpgp card using scdaemon.
To sign a message gpg will send an PKSIGN command along with the Data to
sign (e.g. the fingerprint of an message). What is missing is the
information about which digest (e.g. sha1 or ripemd160) has been used to
create the fingerprint that should be signed by scdaemon. In
scd/command.c PKSIGN gets mapped to the function cmd_pksig which sets
sha1 as digest when calling app_sign. As this information gets part of
the pgp block which contains the signed data a sha1 signature with the
ripemd160 hash is created. This obviously ends in a bad signature.
Altering the call to app_sign by replacing GCRY_MD_SHA1 with
GCRY_MD_RMD160 enables gpg to create valid ripemd160 signatures, but
also make it impossible to create sha1 signatures.
Maybe gpg and gpg-agent could get altered to pass the digest along with
the call to PKSIGN?
This would be a real improvement :)
Hope that one of the gnupg developers can say something about this.

I've problems building it on debian unstable with GNU Pth.
The build is aborted with the following error message:

estream.c: In function ?es_print?:
estream.c:1689: error: ?cookie_io_functions_t? has no member named ?pth_write?
I've traced it down to pth.h which has PTH_SYSCALL_SOFT to 1 per
default, because it's configured with --enable-pthread, which implies
--enable-syscall-soft, by debian. With PTH_SYSCALL_SOFT set to 1 the
pth.h header enables some  which replace write with pth_write.
This way io.write is replaced with io.pth_write and the non existing
member pth_write is used, which does not succeed.
I've now placed an "# define PTH_SYSCALL_SOFT 0" top of
"# include ", which disables the define in pth.h.

Why not use the one which comes with the kernel?
packages.ubuntu.com lists cm4000_cs as being contained in the
This could be because of changes within the linux kernel. As cm4000_cs
is in the vanilla kernel since a while and distributions shipping it I
would use the one already in the kernel.
Use cm4000_cs from the kernel. Last time I've used my cardman 4000 (now
replaced by a cardman 4040) I had to use openct together with pcscd to
make gnupg make use of it.
