@_subject: Newbie Q: decryption 
Hi there,
Having GnuPG use swap partitions/files is a risky business. There's another way around this mess without having to make the GnuPG binary setuid. If you don't use Windows simply encrypt swap space. OpenBSD does this by default, Mac OS X can be set up to do it and swap partition encryption in GNU/Linux is trivial to setup too. Maybe there should be an option in GnuPG to disable this warning when compiling it on a platform that does swap encryption Take a look here too:
Hope this helps,

I am just following up on this to get a reaction.
Any ideas, tutorials or pointers for GnuPG SmartCard use with a pin pad card
reader like the SCM SPR532?
I didn't make any progress by myself. I really need help here.

Hi there GnuPG users,
Recently I bought a SmartCard along with a SCM SPR532 from kernelconcepts.
The SPR532 has a pinpad I want to use instead of entering the pin with the
keyboard. I read in one of the GNU howtos that only GnuPG 2 supports this.
I followed all the tutorials and howto documents I could and I managed to
figure out that I had to tweak the USB driver bundle installation of the SCM
driver to copy the bundle into the right directory for Ubuntu 8.04. After
restarting pcscd I could use GnuPG 1.4.6 with the card.
So, after trying different things I managed to initialize my card and
generate a new key using GnuPG 1.4.6 (current Ubuntu stable package).
However, GnuPG 2.0.7 (Ubuntu 8.04 package) will not read the card like GnuPG
1.4.6. When I do a
gpg2 --card-status
I get:
gpg: OpenPGP card not available: Unknown IPC command
This is the output of gpg (1.4.6) for the same command:
gpg: detected reader `SPR532 USB Smart Card Reader (21250709203507) 00 00'
Application ID ...: D276000124010101000100000FEA0000
Version ..........: 1.1

The card reader has the latest vendor firmware.
I would also like to know how the whole setup is integrated with graphical
clients in Ubuntu 8.04, for example Evolution, Seahorse and such.
Any help is welcome! Thanks!
Tobias W.
