@_subject: Problems with file opening 
I installed gpg on my windows system with no problem, and have exported
a key.
I also installed gpg on my unix system without any problem.  However I
am unable to get it to do anything.  The problem seems to be that for
some reason it is unable to open any files.  I am running while a super
user, so there should not be any problems with insufficient security.
For instance, if I try to import a key I get the following errors:
gpg --import key
gpg: keyblock resource `/root/.gnupg': file open error
gpg: keyblock resource `/root/.gnupg': file open error
gpg: no default public keyring
gpg: error reading `key': general error
gpg: import from `key' failed: general error
gpg: Total number processed: 0
"key" is a file in the directory I am running this from, but it is
apparently unable to read it for some reason, and is also unable to open
I have searched the faq, howto manual, but am unable to find this
behavior addressed.  I did find one thing in the FAQ which reads:
I have checked and there is no /root/.gnupg file, but have no idea how
to create it since I don't know what goes in there. The FAQ doesn't give
any workaround for this problem.  How do I make it create this file, do

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

@_subject: tty error 
I have gpg installed and working from the command line.  I am attempting
to invoke it from a perl script using Gunther Birznieks's pgp-lib.pl
I had to make a couple of modifications to make gpg happy with the
script, and have fixed all reported errors, except for this one:
gpg: cannot open /dev/tty: Device not configured
I am not quite sure what to make of this message, having never
encountered one like it before.  I have checked with the FAQ and other
resources on the gpg site, but can find no references to this error.
This is what the system says about the /dev/tty
# ls -l /dev/tty
crw-rw-rw-  1 root  wheel    1,   0 Apr  2 12:29 /dev/tty
I believe the problem may be associated with the redirection that this
library routine does, but I can find nothing wrong with the script.
$output file is set to /tmp/[userpid].pgp prior to this code, and the
above error is getting written into this file, which is even more
curious, since if it could not output, how is it writing the file. So it
may be complaining about the input instead.
Here is the applicable code:
Anyone have any ideas?

@_subject: A couple of questions 
I have GNUPG working but have a couple of questions.
I am using the program to encrypt credit card numbers before sending
them to the store from a webcart.  The admin of the store enters their
public key, and the setup scripts I have written put it on the public
keyring.  If they want to revoke the key, once again they can send the
revoking certificate and the scripts will revoke the key.  This part
seems to work properly.
But I have some questions.  The pubring.gpg grows larger, instead of
shrinking, when a key is revoked.  Then if I try to import the same key
again, it refuses to import it.
Just what is it doing when you revoke a key?  Is it just marking it as
revoked?  Why can't I import the key again (I am trying to test the
Since it doesn't appear to delete the key from the actual keyring, I am
now trying to delete the keys from the keyring.  If I select --edit-key
and then enter deluid it responds with "You must select at least one
user ID."  I have tried using "select" to select an id, but there is no
such option.  If I enter a user id after the deluid, I still get the
same response.  Anyone know how to "select the user"?
Can anyone enlighten me on this?
