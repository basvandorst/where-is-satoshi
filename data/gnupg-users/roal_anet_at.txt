@_subject: GPG private key still does not work with PGP 
unfortunately, the final version 1.0.7 still has the same problem as
1.0.6c had, as I have posted at
but nobody mentioned anything about it.
In short: If you generate a DSA and ElGamal keypair and export the
public and private key in ASCII, the private key cannot be exported by
PGP 6.5.8 (the public can, though). The PGP error message is "The
keyring file is corrupt".
Here is the log of the key creation:
[roal roal]$ ./gpg --gen-key
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
gpg: please see  for more information
gpg: keyring `/home/roal/.gnupg/secring.gpg' created
gpg: keyring `/home/roal/.gnupg/pubring.gpg' created
Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) DSA and ElGamal (default)
   (2) DSA (sign only)
   (4) ElGamal (sign and encrypt)
   (5) RSA (sign only)
Your selection? 1
DSA keypair will have 1024 bits.
About to generate a new ELG-E keypair.
              minimum keysize is  768 bits
              default keysize is 1024 bits
    highest suggested keysize is 2048 bits
What keysize do you want? (1024) 2048
Requested keysize is 2048 bits       Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
        = key expires in n days
      w = key expires in n weeks
      m = key expires in n months
      y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0) Key does not expire at all
Is this correct (y/n)? y
You need a User-ID to identify your key; the software constructs the user id
from Real Name, Comment and Email Address in this form:
    "Heinrich Heine (Der Dichter) "
Real name: ANET - New Media Solutions
Email address: info          Comment:                   You selected this USER-ID:
    "ANET - New Media Solutions "
Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? o
You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.    We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

Hope that someone now takes care of this bug.

Hi David,
thank you, that was it! For users, that want to generate a new keypair
that is PGP 6.5.8 comatible the following procedure may be preferred:
In the ~/.gnupg/options file, be sure to include
The first option is required to be able to import the GPG exported
private key into PGP. But, the passphrase will still not be recognized
unless the second option is also given. Therefote, wouldn't it be
better to not only imply
--disable-mdc --no-comment --escape-from-lines --force-v3-sigs --no-ask-sig-expire --compress-algo 1
to --pgp6, but also --simple-sk-checksum? Just a suggestion. Another
thing I found that the manpage describing '--pgp6' says something
about '--escape-from'. This should be '--escape-from-lines' I guess.
Just a note...
