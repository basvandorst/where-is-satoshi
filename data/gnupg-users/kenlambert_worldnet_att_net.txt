I did this recently, so I'll add my limited insight.  I believe all the full versions of Outlook (including 2K) have an option to export mail, including going to standard Unix mail.  Outlook Express lacks this functionality, so different approaches are Of the other e-mail packages avaialable Eudora seems to do the best job of converting from pst.  I believe it's the only one that even has the option.  Actually, from the earlier message I guess Netscape will attempt it as well.
Another option is to do a "select all" and drag and drop all your messages to a folder outside of Outlook (all versions, including OE).  This will give a folder full of plain text .eml files that should be easy enough to import into darn near anything.  Someone who's handy with perl (or any other scripting language) shouldn't have too much trouble converting all those text files into standard mailbox format.  I'm not sure what this method will do to attachments.  I'd try to take care of those indivdually if you can, no matter what method you Back to my regularly scheduled lurking...
