@_subject: CCID token Serial numbers: same subkeys on multiple cards 
Hash: SHA512
Here is my setup:
1 offline master key pair 4096 Certify only
4 Yuby keys, 2 gnuk tokens : same 2048 E, S, A subkeys on all  tokens
My problem is some programs depend on card number and not on the keys on
the card. Example "OpenPGP Encryption applet".
Instead of me switching between gnupg home directories for the key I have
in hand, I would like to know if there is a way to add more than one card
number to the same sub key?
