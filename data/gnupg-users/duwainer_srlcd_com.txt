@_subject: Can I Encrypt Using an entire keyring instead of listing each key? 
Hi All,
I would like to know if it is possible to encrypt files using my entire
public key ring as the recipient instead of listing off each public key
on the ring using the -r or recipient command. I guess my real concern
is whether or not public my public keyring can be used as one entity
during encryption.
Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank You

I am using Windows XP/2000 and Server 2003. I decided that my list is
small enough for it to be ok to for to just list the public during
encryption. I would still love to explore encrypting using a group of
keys so when I get some time I will explore using your --group command
if that is at all possible.
Thank you

Hi All,
I want to automate decryption with GnuPG and I am not sure how is the
best way to go about handling the passphrase. Anybody have any ideas,
suggestions or any failed attempts to speak of?
Thank you

That exactly is my problem because I don't want my passphrase to be

It's fairly easy to automate things with Perl.  Biggest concern will be
keeping the file unreadable by other users, though, since your
passphrase will be in the file.

It will be a server doing the work. I want it completely automated, so
there will be no human interaction.
I am using GnuPG 1.4 on Windows.
Thank you

In general, yes, there are many ways to do it.   The details depend on  what the goal is.  Is this a server doing the work (i.e. no human
present), or do you just want to cache the passphrase so you don't have
to retype it frequently?  Or... ?
Also, to give you the best information, can you tell me if you are using
GnuPG 1.4 or GnuPG 2.0, as well as what platform (Linux, OSX, Windows,
etc) you are running on.

@_subject: Bypass Invalid Public key 
Hi All,
Is there a way to get GnuPG to complete encryption, if there is at least
one valid public key specified? I am trying automate my encryption
process, and I am hoping to be able to get away with not having to
specify error handling if one or more of my public keys does not exist
on the key ring.
Any help is greatly appreciated.
Thank you

Thank you. I actually decided last week to verify whether the each key
is valid before I perform the encryption. I used the --list-keys command
along with a loop to accomplish this with ease.

Oookay, okay, I know, I know, I know - you *can* try running GnuPG on
the *encrypted* file later and find out which keys it is actually
encrypted to, but in my book, that goes under "nonsensical effort".
[almost snip my "--list-keys --with-colons output processing"
That part still stands :)

@_subject: Decrypt multiple Encrypted files within a folder 
Hi All,
I would like to be able to create a batch file or a script that allows
me to decrypt multiple encrypted files within a given folder. Has anyone
done this before? Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you

Seems easy enough. Happens that I am trying to get this done on windows

On Linux that's easy.
To encrypt:
$ find  -type f -execdir gpg -r  -e {} \;
To decrypt:
$ find  -type f -iname '*.gpg' -execdir gpg {} \; (Please
note, that you'll be prompted for the passphrase for every file, unless
you use gpg-agent with passphrase caching or provide passphrase on the
command line.)

I think I might want to test your suggestion about storing the
passphrase on disk or not using one at all to see how it works for what
I need to accomplish. Can you give me some details about how to go about
doing that?
Thank you.
