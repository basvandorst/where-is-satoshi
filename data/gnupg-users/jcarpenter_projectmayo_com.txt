@_subject: GPG and Java 
What facilities exist for programatically accessing GPG via Java?
Even if native code is required, it would be nice to find a Java package
has already done this work and provides a simple API.  I know similar
have been done for Perl and are available on CPAN.
Please copy me in the reply at nawkboy since I am not
