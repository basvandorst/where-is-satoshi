Thank for you answer.
My problem is not to prevent a file from being modified during gpg work but
to prevent gpg to work on an open file.
I understand there is no feature in gpg for this.
So I do :
sudo fuser -v ${fic} || gpg ...
Ps : I find snapshhot and chattr good ideas in your case.

I have a question, I'm not sure it be related to gpg or general to linux :
Can I prevent gpg to encrypt open file ?
I explain my situation : I have file dropped to filesystem by Windows
program with samba share. I take (with a script launch by cron) the file and
encrypt it. It may append that gpg take the file during the Windows programm
copy it.
For the now, I looking to use fuser to check this before encrypt the file
but it may be a better way to prevent this.
