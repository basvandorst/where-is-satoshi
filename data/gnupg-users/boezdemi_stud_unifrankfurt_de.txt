@_subject: Executing GPG Please help! 
Hi list!
I4m trying to encrypt a document with GPG using a Php-Script.
Now I4ve created some keys and exported them.
The Script executes this command: "gpg -e -r test Test.doc".
This works fine when executing in the console.
But on Apache it outputs an error message logged in httpd_error_log:
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
gpg: //.gnupg: can't create directory: Permission denied
gpg: keyblock resource `//.gnupg': file open error
gpg: //.gnupg: can't create directory: Permission denied
gpg: keyblock resource `//.gnupg': file open error
gpg: test skipped: public key not found
gpg: Rechnung.xml: encryption failed: public key not found
The key is definitely there, the permissions are set to all users.
Can anybody help me with this? What directories it tries to
create, and why it doesn4t find the public key?
Thank you in advance and sorry my english ...  : )

Hello list!
Is it somehow possible to decrypt a document without entering the
unlock-passphrase for secret keys?
I`m working on a php-script which automatically encrypts and then decrypts

I already used "-batch" for batchmodus and trusted the key "fully", but gpg
still wants me to enter the phrase.
Anybody know how to skip/automate this? Is there a option where the
passphrase can be entered together
with the "--decrypt" command?
Ok, thank you for helping me!
