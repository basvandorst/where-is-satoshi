Hi Team,
We have setup the entire GnuPG software along with the keys in our Linux server. We are able to encrypt our message and send it to our vendor. even our vendor is able to decrypt it at their end. But we are not able to decrypt the message sent by the vendor to us.
We tried decrypting the error from OS level . this is the error we got -
root at ldxsap23: ~/.gnupg
# gpg -v -v --decrypt /basis/home/sh34191/PYRESULT_KS_20160728192815.csv.pgp
gpg: armor: BEGIN PGP MESSAGE

gpg: public key is 31743B64

After checking the error logs, I found that the public key in the above mentioned log does not match our vendor's key number . So, I'm not sure if this value changes in the process or encryption/decryption or the error is something different. I really need your help in resolving this.
These are my vendor's key
pub   1024D/85093D7F 2011-12-22
uid                  gvqua01 (xxxxxxxx) >
sub   2048g/CF00F368 2011-12-22
these are the libraries and their corresponding versions we have installed in our server. Please help us out here.

Hi Ben,
Thanks for the response. We have provided them our public key. The key 31743B64 is not our public key. I'm confused as our vendor is able to decrypt our message but we are not able to do it. Any advise is appreciated.

It means they have not encrypted the message to your public key.  Have you sent it to them?  Is 0x31743B64 your key?  That one isn't on the keyservers, whereas both the ADP ones are.
P.S.  You know this is a public mailing list, right?
