@_subject: I never quite got my answer, 
I will try phrasing it differently though, is it possible to make the
ecc keys with sha512 and aes256?
and is sha512 the most secure algorithm to go with aes256?

@_subject: where do you find gpg.conf on debian 8 or 9? 
I ask this because, I cannot find gpg.conf at all in the normal location...
anyone know how to fix said problem/where it would be hidden on debian?
Cannot change gpg keys to maximum security unless I know where that is...

thank you for your help it worked.
Although I did have to use gpg2 --edit-key then my id,
but yeah.

@_subject: Trouble installing Version 2.1 on Debian Jessie 
You should use debian stretch if you want 2.1
but I also say that you should install lxde first if you use the rc2
installer which is what I used.
because mate install causes wifi to be nonexistant if you install that
If you install stretch that is...
and yes, stretch is extremely stable for me.
but I Would reinstall from scratch after saving your important files to

Does anyone know how to change the default ciphers in gnupg modern to
their maximum security level?
I am curious because I may soon be in a position to use it. Ubuntu 16.04
has this option as does other ubuntu 16.04 based derivatives...

@_subject: I figured out how to change the algorithms, 
gpg --edit-key (user id)
then showpref and then setpref with AES256 SHA512 ZLIB MDC
the only thing, is that after the installing of gnupg modern
I could not use enigmail properly in icedove...
not sure why. I am using a ubuntu 14 derivative
Is there a way to fix this without getting rid of gnupg modern?

Okay, I was doing this to ecnrypt my files, not emails for the most part...
I did however wonder, what you actually said, because I had pgp
encryption on and for some reason I couldn't read it through enigmail.
My apologies.
