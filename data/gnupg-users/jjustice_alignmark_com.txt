@_subject: Req: Compiling GPG under Windows NT 
I'm trying to compile and install GnuPG (0.9.8) under Windows NT 4.       I've seen in the NEWS file that this software *ought* to be able to be      compiled and used under WinNT (or at least that there's a strong hope      of it), but I'm a little stumped as to how to start.
     My confusion is (at the moment) mainly with trying to figure out how      to use "configure" to generate a Makefile suitable for Windows NT.  I      know if I were under Unix that I could just run it, but I don't have a      bash shell equivalent under NT.  Do I need to go through the steps      configure would go through by hand, to compile for Windows NT?       Currently, my intended software to use for compilation is Microsoft      Visual C++ 6.0 and Microsoft NMake, from a WinNT "DOS Box".
     Is this something where I really need to be using the CygWin tools?  I      don't currently have them installed, and would prefer not to have to      install them before I start on GPG if I don't have to.  (OTOH, if this      is by far the best way or even the only way to get a WinNT suitable      GPG, then so be it.)
     I've seen the precompiled binary for WinNT of a (slightly older)      version of GPG.  However, because this is going to be used by the      company I work at for something mission-critical, I'd rather build      this myself than take my chances on a precompiled binary I know      nothing about.
     Thanks for any help or advice you can provide.  I can be reached via      e-mail at , and via phone at 703-706-0254      (east coast USA).  Oh, and I've subscribed myself to the gnupg-users      list, so you don't need to send me a private CC of any response you      might make to the list iffn you don't want to.
     Thanks again.  It's appreciated.
