Hash: SHA1
Yes, you have to store the auto-generated keys in different files and then
import them to the main keyrings. A few weeks ago I have posted a bash
script for this purpose. Just search the list archive.

Hi Lucas,
As Adrian mentioned, you can use the parsable output from --with-colons

@_subject: QUESTION: Can the gpg output be captured to a file? 
Hash: SHA1
In addition to what Darren wrote, I can recommend to study the file DETAILS
from the document tree. There you can find a lot of information on how to
get more output from gpg if you want to process data automatically. Most of
the time gpg uses the standard error channel (2) to report whats going on.

@_subject: Problems using decrypt in unattended environment 
gpg 1.2.2, compiled statically using gcc 3.2, linux.
I would like to decrypt and verify PGP/INLINE messages automatically.
I have all private and public keys in my keyrings.
For the last 2 month
gpg --batch --no-tty --status-fd 2 --output "dest-file" \
did a great job. Until yesterday!
I received a mail with a simple encrypted message (BEGIN PGP MESSAGE) but
something was different with the signature. The working gnupg process was
killed by my wathdog process after half an our working (on a 2900 bytes
mail!!!!). Trying to find out what went wrong (calling without --no-tty
--batch ) I was surprised that gnupg detected a detached signature and
asked for a file name:
This was no multipart mail! I then processed the mail again without trying
to decrypt and used enigmail. Enigmail processed the mail correctly but
with an error message "bad signature".
OK, what is different between my call and enigmail? Enigmail seem to pipe
the mail data to stdin because when I use '-d < source-file' no question
for the data file was emited and I got the same error message.
What can I do if I want to omit the question for the data file and don't
want to use piping? Is there any option for this?
Who can explain this detached thing more precisely?
The sender uses Outlook and a plugin called "CryptoEx" to create this message.
On the other hand it's a little bit strange that gnupg is waiting for
manual input if someone uses '--batch --no-tty' ...

@_subject: =?ISO-8859-1?Q?Decrypt_an_encrypted_mail_with_detached_signature=3F!?= 
I have received a mail which is encrypted by a CryptEx OpenPGP client.
Using 'gpg --decrypt mail.asc' I see this output:
This mail is encrypted to me and the senders key (11111). The text of the
mail is just "Testmessage signed and encrypted with PGP"
It is a simple PGP/INLINE mail, no attachment, no additional data file:
+----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----
Version: CryptoEx OpenPGP Engine Version 2.1
Comment: CryptoEx Client Suite - +----END PGP MESSAGE-----
I have tried to see more with --verbose --verbose --verbose but I could not
find a hint that this mail has a deteched signature. Which signature type
from RFC2440 does mark a detached signature? Type 0x00???
PGPDUMP does not help because it as an encrypted mail :)
I have then imported my key into PGP 8.0 for Windows and
it does decrypt and verify the message without any error message.
Whats going on?

Well, it depends :-))
If you have a cleartext ascii armored mail, the encrypted or signed part
should start and end with lines like "----BEGIN PGP...", "----END PGP...."
This message is also printed if you use a keyserver during verification of
signatures and the desired keyid is not found on the keyserver.
Maybe use the command line options "--verbose" and "--status-fd 2" to get
more informations about whats going on.

Hash: SHA1
Well after some tests 'disable-mdc' or 'pgp6' should do the trick.
But there is another problem:
- - the sender has a 'legacy' RSA key (e.g. somebody from Siemens),
  recipient ElGamal (created by GnuPG )
- - sender does 'encrypt to self' with CryptoEx
- - recipients key has no IDEA in his preferences (just CAST5, 3DES, AES) !
- -> CryptoEx creates a mail with IDEA as symmetric algo
=> GnuPG without patches is not able to decrypt such message!
Seems to me that "OpenPGP compatible" is nothing more than a slogan :-(

@_subject: NO_SECKEY message if multiple private keys in keyring 
Hash: SHA1
Hi everybody,
Using GnuPG 1.2.1, SuSE 7.3.
I have multiple private keys in my keyring, e.g. 3 keys with 3 different
email addresses. I received an encrypted message with all 3 adresses as
recipients and got 3 ENC_TO entries (using --status-fd 2 --decrypt mail-file ).
For the first key there is a GOOD_PASSPHRASE message but for the other keys
I have NO_SECKEY entries.
Is it a feature to say NO_SECKEY after the first valid private key is found?
Best Regards,
Holger Sesterhenn
