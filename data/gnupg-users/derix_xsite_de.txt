@_subject: problems with sec-key 
right now I try to figure out, how to combine phpgroupware-email and gnupg.
This should be done by exporting the mailbody into a textfile, encrypt it
to a new file and insert the encrypted mailbody again.
While doing this I got the problem that if I try to do the encryption
by using the php system() -command I'm stopped at the point, that gnupg
to get the keyring from the root-user. But there is no root keyring.
My question is: How can I tell gnupg or is there an option where I can
define a default
Thanks in advance
