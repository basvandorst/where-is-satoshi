@_subject: GnuPG 2.1 Windows 7, pinentry does not allow paste, no way to bypass? 
Had a little adventure this morning with GnuPG 2.x on Windows 7 and decided
to revert to 1.4.
During command line decryption, pinentry opens a popup window for the
passphrase. In the pinentry window, paste (Ctl+V) is not supported. Deal
breaker.  I read through the forums and could not find a way around this.
Here are some suggestions:
a) Put the 1.4 Windows binary installer on the download page again.
b) Allow pinentry to accept a paste command.
    or, allow gpg 2.x to bypass pinentry and work in 1.4 mode (and make it
obvious how to do so).
Love the simplicity and speed of gpg 1.4.  If 2.1 can work in the same way,
that would be much appreciated.  It is not fun being stuck on the old
version and left out of all the fun of 2.1!
By the way, the download gpg4win-vanilla-2.1.1-34299-beta.exe failed to
launch, with this message: "Installer integrity check has failed". The
download of gpg4win-light-2.1.1-34299-beta.exe did work.

I understand the risk, and your point is valid.   However, if a machine is
infected with malware, then keystrokes can also be captured, screen shots,
packets, pretty much everything going on.  Considering the low risk nature
of the data this particular key addresses, I'm am comfortable with C&P.
There are other cases where I don't use C&P on purpose.
I would recommend that users be allowed to decide (via config or command
line option), and provide a sensible default such as the current behavior.
