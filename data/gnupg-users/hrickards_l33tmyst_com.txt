Would it be possible to do the same job that GPG does (using all the  same algorithms) simply using a pen and paper? You can do simple  public key crypto with RSA, by choosing two primes and doing a  multitude of stuff with them. I understand that it will take a while  to actually encrypt/decrypt something, and you'll need a calculator as  well, but it would be fun to try all the same.

Thanks for the link, I'll have a read through it (although it might take
a while - 28k words). When you say understand the algorithm, do you mean
understand that you take two prime numbers, and multiply them together
to get n, and then multiply them together using the totient function
etc, or understand *why* you take multiply them together using the
totient function etc?

Maths project on breaking codes. Thought I might as well encrypt some
stuff in hard-to-break ciphers like the ones GPG use as well. Plus it'll
be fun.

This is just for fun, as well as a bit of maths homework, so the numbers
won't have to be too big. Just out of interest, does GPG have it's own
method for multiplying/dividing really long numbers (I'm having to do
the maths in python, which gives an integer, and then work out the

As to sending it, I suppose you could take pictures and type them in
(like they did in Little Brother by Cory Doctor - cc licensed), but it
would take forever. I've found a page at
 that allows you to do RSA
encryption/decryption using a pencil/paper without using the Extended
Euclidean algorithm, something I just can't seem to get my head around.
For a calculator I'm actually using the python interpreter, it seems to
deal with big numbers pretty well. I don't know any python, but you can
mostly type in sums and it tells you the answers. To do powers, you have
to do pow(x,y) where x is the number and y is the power. For example
pow(5,2) squares 5. For anything more complicated I use Wolfram Alpha
(wolframalpha.com) which can deal with most big numbers, it can
certainly go a lot higher than Google.

I asked about a similar thing recently on the debian-user mailing list.
Basically, we worked out that it would be hard to do, and would be a lot
easier just to encrypt the disk. That was using Postfix though. Let us
know if you find a solution.
