@_subject: Problem / Question with GnuPG and GData Gnu Pg Plugin with Window 
Hello friends,
I have the following problem with GnuPg and GData GnuPg Plugin for Microsoft
Outlook 2000. I want to install the GData GnuPg PlugIn on a Windows Terminal
Server 2000 with Outlook 2000. The installation from the PlugIn is no
problem, all is very well, but the path entry of the program files and
keyring is for all users , who logged in into the Terminal Server , the
same. Can i configure the path entrys for all users in Outlook separatly ? thanks very much in ahead.
