@_subject: gnupg probs here 
Hi all,
I just switched from pgp5 to gnupg.
Well that is, i'll still wish to support pgp5 cause many friends use it.
However, i just generated a key with gnupg for myself.
But i have trouble adding any key once so ever.
And always i am getting this message:
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
How to get rid of it?
Btw anyone here using gnupg and pgp5 with mutt at the same time?
For example when i wish to add a key i do:
gpg --keyserver hkp:/horowitz.surfnet.nl --recv-keys 0xDD3FCEE7
The answer is:
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
gpg: requesting key DD3FCEE7 from hkp:/horowitz.surfnet.nl ...
gpg: can't get key from keyserver: Undefined error: 0
gpg --keyserver certserver.pgp.com --recv-key 0xDD3FCEE7
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
gpg: requesting key DD3FCEE7 from certserver.pgp.com ...
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: Total number processed: 0
I aint seem to getting further.
And how can i add keys which are posted in text form in an url?
FOr example how to add  ?
Also adding a gnupg key from a friend didnt work:
 gpg --import pubring.asc
 gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
 gpg: key 9077009B: unsupported public key algorithm
 gpg: key 9077009B: no valid user IDs
 gpg: this may be caused by a missing self-signature
 gpg: Total number processed: 1
 gpg:           w/o user IDs: 1
Oh yes, i am using gnupg 1.0.1
