@_subject: cannot access FTP site to download missing library 
Hi team,
I downloaded gnupg-2.0.19 and got several errors reported by ./configure. The error message is very clear said i missed some library and corresponding FTP link was provided. But i was prompt for username/password when try to access. Below is the link example.
*** It is now required to build with support for the*** GNU Portable Threads Library (Pth). Please install this*** library first.  The library is for example available at***   ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/pth/
Could you please let me know how to get the missing package?
thank you very much!
