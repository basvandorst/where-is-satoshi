@_subject: Header signing. 
Can anybody point me to the formats used by headersigning.
Im currently developing a script, see header, that
should operate on GPG, but I'm not sure if it will be
compatible with f.i. PGPVerify.

Well the command was a bit confusing to me to but this is how it should
look like in your batchfile:
 gpg -a --force-v3-sigs --passphrase-fd 0 -u  -sb
This would sign your file.
