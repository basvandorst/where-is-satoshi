@_subject: gpg site's signature 
I don't know if I'm doing something wrong, but if I used the
public key on the gpg site, ie.
gpg --verify gnupg-1.2.4.tar.gz.sig, I get the following:
gpg: Signature made Wed Dec 24 04:23:02 2003 HKT using DSA key ID 57548DCD
gpg: Good signature from "Werner Koch (gnupg sig) "
gpg: Note: This key has expired!
Primary key fingerprint: 6BD9 050F D8FC 941B 4341  2DCC 68B7 AB89 5754 8DCD
Where can I get an updated one and which key servers does Werner Koch use?
