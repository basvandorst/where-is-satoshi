@_subject: missing self-signature ? 
I just upgrade to MDK 9.1 from MDK 9.0. My gpg worked fine before.
When I try to import a key, it says :
gpg: key XXXXXXXX has been created 3614 seconds in future (time warp or clock gpg: key XXXXXXXX: invalid self-signature on user id "xxxxxx xxxxxxx gpg: key XXXXXXXX has been created 3614 seconds in future (time warp or clock gpg: key XXXXXXX: invalid subkey binding
gpg: key XXXXXXX: no valid user IDs
gpg: this may be caused by a missing self-signature
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:           w/o user IDs: 1
Any idea ? The creation date of the key isn't in the future ...
Thanks !
