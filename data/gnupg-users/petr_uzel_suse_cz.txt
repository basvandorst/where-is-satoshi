@_subject: confusing message: 'no pinentry' 
Hi list!
Today I've tried to generate gpg key as root and got the following error:
gpg: problem with the agent: No pinentry
gpg: Key generation canceled.
This seemed strange because I'm sure that I have pinentry (both -curses and -qt) properly installed.
Further investigation revealed that the problem only arises if I 'su' from my normal user account (running gpg-agent and thus with GPG_AGENT_INFO set). 'su' preserves GPG_AGENT_INFO variable and gpg then tries to connect to gpg-agent running under my normal account, and then gpg fails. When switched to root with 'su -', gpg works fine.
So the question is :
- is this a behavior a bug (using 'foreign' gpg-agent) ?
- if it is not a bug, shouldn't the error message be adjusted somehow ? (as it has nothing to do with pinentry IMHO)

Yes, it is in /usr/bin/pinentry (and /usr/bin is in root's path). In openSUSE, which I use, the /usr/bin/pinentry is a bash script that tries to determine, which pinentry (-qt, -curses, -gtk) to execute and then executes it.
I know all of this. My question was whether the gpg behavior under specified circumstances ('incorrect' GPG_AGENT_INFO env. variable) should not be adjusted somehow. In other words, I know how to solve my issue (use 'su -'/unset GPG_AGENT_INFO/killall gpg-agent/whatever), but I'm uncertain that all other gpg users know it too. Especially when the message about missing pinentry is quite confusing.

I'd try to fix this problem, but I'm not sure how to do it in 'correct and clean way'. Any ideas or recommendations ? Or am I the only one who thinks this is worth fixing?

I'm not sure if it is relevant, but you could take a look at

@_subject: gpg-agent does not know --homedir, --batch and --lc-type options 
although documented in its manpage, gpg-agent does not know following
puzel at foxbat:~> gpg-agent --batch
gpg-agent[11116]: invalid option "--batch"
puzel at foxbat:~> gpg-agent --lc-type
gpg-agent[11119]: invalid option "--lc-type"
puzel at foxbat:~> gpg-agent --homedir
gpg-agent[11128]: invalid option "--homedir"
puzel at foxbat:~> gpg-agent --version
gpg-agent (GnuPG) 2.0.10
libgcrypt 1.4.1
Is this a bug in GnuPG, documentation, both, or did I miss
Thanks in advance,

Hi list,
On ppc, s390 and s390x :

On other architectures (x86_64, i586, ppc64, ia64), everything works fine.
Does anybody has the same issue? Any ideas?
Thanks in advance,

I'd like to, but I can't as those are suse internal machines. Sorry.
I'll try to look at it with a debugger...
