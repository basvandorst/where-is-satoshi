@_subject: Clearsign of HTML-pages 
Not true.  I wrote a script years ago that does just that.  It's available
at  but note that it's written for
Windows, relies on pgp 2.6, and doesn't really work that well.  I don't
believe the source is included in that package because...well, it was
ugly.  ;)
The algorithm is very simple:
1. Start with the HTML file you want to sign.
2. Add "-->" at the start of the file.
3. Add "" at the end of the file.
And then the page can be checked by viewing and verifying the source.
The solution in Linux and other Unix-style OS's is trivial using a shell
script.  I did it in about five minutes one time.
For Windows, I'd actually written a Pascal program to do it (because I
didn't have a C compiler), but it's not difficult to do.  You can set it
up as an action on the right-click menu to have it happen automatically.
What I ran into was this:  when I stopped doing it on the PGP Interactions
page, no one said a word.  So, if no one is bothering to verify them, why
should I worry about it?
