@_subject: Default build says "cipher algorithm is depreciated" 
Building 1.0.4 + patch all seem to work fine.
But as soon as I try and encrypt something I get the message:
gpg: this cipher algorithm is depreciated; please use a more standard one!
Where did "I" choose the depreciated algorithm? - is it in my key
or in the build process?
What is the suggested "standard one" to use?
Do I have to have an options file to set it or can i tweak the build?
