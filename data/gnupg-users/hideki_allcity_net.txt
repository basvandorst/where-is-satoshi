Basically, if you forget password, you are out of luck.
Of course, you can always analyse it, but that case, you are talking
millions of years on typical PCs if not forever. Brute force may not be practical because of "passphrase" which can be long. (Complexity increases significantly as digit increases)
Here's more "practical" way; try all password you can come up in your mind. Chances are, you can come up with it in couple of Good luck.

@_subject: GPG 1.0.2 Win32 and wrap 
As far as my knowledge, it is your responsibility to keep line length of each line <64 chars. I think it is true for both PGP and GPG. Usually, PGP aware softwares does this automatically (for example, my mailer does word wrapping automatically)
So you just have to do it manually by a text editor.

Hash: SHA1
There are questions from some readers of my page regarding commercial
use of GnuPG.
While various resources indicating that GnuPG is not using any
patented method, is that also mean that GnuPG can be used commercially
(like in corporation environments) without legal conflicts?
I'd like to make sure what I write on the page is accurate...
Thank you.

@_subject: Win32 - export keys 
This seems more of the operating system limitation causing this Windows handles text and binary data differently while on most of Unix based systems, it is handled equally.
When exporting ascii texts (with -a) it doesn't matter, but looks like Window's doing its own "formatting" on binary files (probably it's assuming stdout is text) and that's probably why you would get extra returns...
If you decrypt binary files redirection, same problem happens (you'll get garbage)

Looks like TZ setting to PST8PDT actually works.
Actually, this question also involved someone on the gnupgnewsjapan group trying to get their time on JST (Japan Standard Time)
This particular person reported problem, and part of problem could be due to the following time setting: JST-09.
I have already suggested JST+09 (which should be logical, because Japanese time is 9 hours ahead of GMT) and I'm looking forward to see if it works.
If you are talking about Win32 API, there is function that returns UTC called GetSystemTime which retrieves system time.
VOID GetSystemTime(
  LPSYSTEMTIME lpSystemTime   // address of system time structure

@_subject: Signing the symmetrical encrypted data 
Hash: SHA1
This topic has been brought up few days ago in GnuPG New Japan group.
In PGP, there is an option that allows signing symmetrically encrypted data, which you can decrypt using symmetrical password then sign is GnuPG can correctly decrypt and verify such files, but making one requires quite messy technique.
For example, one would do:
gpg -su [Signer's ID] -o tempfile foo.txt
gpg -a --symmetric --no-literal -o result.txt tempfile
(Some reason, first command must be set to output binary to this to work, not armor texts)
gpg -o file -su [Signer's ID] foo.txt
causes conflicting command.
Is there any exisiting way of doing this in one command line? I think this would be quite useful feature.

@_subject: Upgrade from 1.0.4 to 1.0.6 
Here's a simple solution to this:
1. Uninstall existing RPM package of GnuPG 1.0.4
2. Compile and install GnuPG 1.0.6 you've downloaded.
The problem is probably because RPM is putting the binary into PATH settings refers /usr/bin first, GnuPG 1.0.4 (RPM package one) is recognized.

Just to follow-up...
Just in case you need newest RPM package as soon as possible...this way, no need to wait until you can find the RPM package (or when you have a dependency problem) As far as I can see, this particular package manager's quick, but you'll experience some delays for some other distributions.
The SPEC file for the RPM is included in GnuPG distribution, under the directory scripts.
You can easily build do-it-yourself RPM using it. (rpm -ba gnupg.spec, provided that you have your build environment configured
