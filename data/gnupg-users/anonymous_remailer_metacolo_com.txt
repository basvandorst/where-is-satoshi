Bob Metelsky:
If you are on a unix box, use 'find' to encrypt your files.
 $ find /some/path -type f -exec /path/to/my_script \{\} \;
where my_script contains:
# if everything goes as planned, the original files get deleted.
gpg -e -r my_encryption_keyid "$1" && rm -f "$1"
For a wholesale encryption of directories use 'cfs'.

Share your knowledge and let the program authors/maintainers know of the
steps you followed to build the program, or the difficulties you
encountered. Better yet, provide them with a working .spec file...
If they adopt it, it will be useful to lots of other users when the
next version appears.

Yannis :
Copy your gpg binary to a temp file say /tmp/gpg.orig and then
(temporarily) replace it with the following script:
exec 2>/tmp/gpg.arguments
set -x Make the script executable, try to decrypt a message and post the
contents of /tmp/gpg.arguments to the list. They might give us a clue.
(Put the original gpg binary back to its place)

@_subject: gpg on M$ 
I have read about a light mail proxy that does on the fly pgp
encryption (and decryption) before (resp. after) sending (receiving) the
message to (from) the real SMTP (POP3) server. I don't remember
whether it runs on windows, but if it does it could solve your problem
nicely. I don't remember the application name either, but it should
be on freshmeat.net.
Your client must configure the proxy (keys, trust, real servers etc) and
then tell her e-mail program to connect to localhost instead of the
real remote servers.

@_subject: Can't decrypt PGP 8 msg 
Eugene Smiley:
Why sign your messages manuallly? You could automate the whole thing
and never have to worry about it again. Tell your mail program to hnad
your message over to a script (instead of sendmail or whatever you use),
which signs/encrypts the message on a per recipient basis. Use S/MIME
for some and OpenPGP for others. If done right, it will save you lots of
'signing' time. The above assumes a secure box, where your signing
secret (sub)key and passphrase are stored on disk or handled by programs
like gpg-agent.

                           file and password (HTTPS)

    --cacert  CA certifciate to verify peer against (SSL)
 -k/--insecure      Allow curl to connect to SSL sites without certs (H)
Stunnel, which also supports client authentication, can be used with browsers that do not support it natively...

This is usually not a problem. The first message is delivered upon
arrival (ie. _not_ kept in the incoming queue) and its Message-ID is
stored in recently-arrived messages database. The next one(s) to come
will be discarded by the recipe since its (their) Message-ID is already
in the db.
Read the `procmailex' man page and search for `msgid.cache'.

Instead of using a MUA (OL2003) specific plugin, you could use
GPGrelay which is a PGP aware SMTP/POP3 proxy. It will work with any
MUA and can make PGP encryption/decryption/signing automatic and
perhaps invisible, which can be an advantage when dealing with less
technically minded computer users.

Sometimes spammers put future dates in their message on purpose. The
message will always be listed first (or last) and thus get extra
attention, if messages are sorted by date (which conveniently happens
to be the default for many MUA's)

Use a wrapper around 'gpg' which adds '-r corporate_key' to the

exec()'s the original 'gpg' with the modified options.
