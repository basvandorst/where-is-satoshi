@_subject: gpg key generation options 
Hash: SHA1
I have installed gpg version 1.4.10 , the last I think.
When I run --gen-key the men? display 4 voices while the guide and
manual saw on gpg web page show only 3 voices.
Maybe the online documentation is out of date ?
My final problem is to get an explanation of fourth voice RSA and RSA
, why I can't encrypt a file with a key pair generated with this option ?
