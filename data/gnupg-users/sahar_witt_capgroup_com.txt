@_subject: GnuPG 1.0.7 not compiling on Solrais 2.7 
I'm trying to compile Gnu 1.0.7 on Sun Solaris 2.7 without success. I do
not have write access to the /usr/local/bin directory so instead I ran the
configure command as follows:
./configure -enable-static-rnd=none -prefix=$NEW_DIRECTORY
where NEW_DIRECTORY is where i need the pgp binaries to be generated.
then I ran make
Then Make install
But I get the following errors at the end of both make & makeinstall
commands :
"./rndlinux.c", line 226: warning: assignment type mismatch:
        pointer to void "=" pointer to function(void) returning int
ld: fatal: option -h and building a dynamic executable are incompatible
ld: fatal: Flags processing errors
make[1]: *** [rndlinux] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/users/webtools/pgp/gnupg-1.0.7/cipher'
make: *** [install-recursive] Error 1
What am I missing  , If I install gcc, do you think this problem will be
resolved ?

What does it take to extend GnuPG 1.0.7 so it will decrypt messages
encrypted in PGP 6.x or 7.x for commercial use in the united states ?
 Is this even possible or do you have to purchase a license still ?

 (or, on Sol 8 machines, patch 112438). I'll check the Forte compiler
 as soon as I get the license file ...

We were going with PGP 6.5.8 , a public/private key ring was generated and
the public key sent to the customer. It was then decided that we use GnuPG
1.0.7 since it's free, I've generated a new public/private gpg key ring but
ofcourse I cannot decrypt files sent to me by that customer who encrypted
them using our old PGP key.
The preference is to avoid requesting re-importing keys of the customer if
possible or is it not ?
In that case , even adding those parameters to my options file won't do my
any good. I can only import public keys using the gpg -import file.asc
command but when I attempt to decrypt those files i get the following error
message :
decryption failed: secret key not available

I receive files encrypted by clients using
(both 6 and 7) and am able to decrypt them with both gpg 1.0.6 and 1.0.7.
Neither version required any extension (other than setting the following in
the options file) nor any dollars.

This problem is not about PGP/GnuPG compatibility but it does address
issues migrating between PGP & GnuPG. As I see, more & more users in
addition to organizations are looking into replacing PGP with GnuPG. This
issue addresses that. I was able to successfully (Thanks to Steve Butler's
helpful input) export a public/private key pair (after removing the
passphrase) from PGP then importing that into GnuPG. Only then was I able
to decrypt files encrypted with my old PGP key.

1. You generated a keypair "A" using PGP 6.5.8, and sent the public key
A(pub) to your customer.
2. You generated a new keypair "B" using GnuPG.
3. Customer is encrypting messages to key A(pub), but you only have
"B(sec)" on your private key ring.
How do you expect to be able to decrypt those messages if you don't have
the secret key? Why did you generate new keys?
You need to either import your first key pair in GnuPG, including the
private key, or you need to send your customer the new public key
(This problem isn't about PGP/GnuPG compatibility at all).

You'd have a better change compiling this successfully using gcc instead of
cc. I'd start with that, then work through code issues if any afterwards.
