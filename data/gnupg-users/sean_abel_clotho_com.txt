@_subject: GnuPG.pm - Symmetric file encryption 
When using GnuPG from the command line I can encrypt a file with no
recipient. When I try to do this through Perl I get an error to that
Any ideas?
command line:
 gpg --output file.gpg --symmetric file.txt
perl code:
$gpg->encrypt( plaintext => 'test/file.txt',
                          output => "test/file.gpg",
                          sign => 1,
                          passphrase => "$passphrase"
                         );
Thanks in advance!

@_subject: gpg/cgi 
So I'm not the only one having trouble getting a cgi to work with GPG?
Since I am running the web server as Nobody, I am setting the userid and home dir.
The error I am geeting is "invalid home directory"
I am using Linux 6.2, Perl 5.004, GnuPG.pm, and my code looks like this:
(I've left out some chunks)
use strict;
use GnuPG;
use CGI::Carp qw(fatalsToBrowser);
use CGI;
my $in = new CGI;
my $userid = "xxxx";
 Read in variables from form-
$color = $in->param('color');
$name = $in->param('name');
$ship_address = $in->param('Shipping Address');
$ship_city = $in->param('Shipping City');
$ship_state = $in->param('Shipping State');
$ship_zip = $in->param('Shipping Zip');
$bill_name = $in->param('Billing Name');
$bill_address = $in->param('Billing Address');
$bill_city = $in->param('Billing City');
$bill_state = $in->param('Billing State');
$bill_zip = $in->param('Billing Zip');
my $gpg = new GnuPG( homedir => "/home/xxxx/", trace => 1 );
my $gpg->encrypt( recipient => "xxxx",
                plaintext =>                 output => "$filename" . ".gpg"
              );
Any help would be appreciated!!!
