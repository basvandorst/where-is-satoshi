@_subject: GNUpg 2.0.7 installation 
To all concerned,
I am a new linux user and I just downloaded and installed the latest
version on GNUPG.  Everything seemed to go accordingly. ./configure make
and make install. After  all that was done I tried to go into the
program by typing in GNUPG-2.0.7 and I received a "command not found"
message. Can you help me determine what I did wrong.
