@_subject: Harddisk Encryption 
I've  been using DriveCrypt Plus for the last year and it does a sterling
job. It was developed from e4m and scramdisk and works under XP. However,
it is a commercial product. Link is I  do  not know if there is a freeware HDD encryption program around that
works  under  XP. I thought I saw something recently, but can't locate it
again. I'll let you know if I find it.
