Hash: SHA512
One of the issues with that is not supervising the alias you delegate power
keys.gnupg.net (aka hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net) only has servers in Europe.
keys.gnupg.net has EDNS0 issues  I do understand why someone decided to delegate keys.gnupg.net to someone
else, but is that healthy for GnuPG?
