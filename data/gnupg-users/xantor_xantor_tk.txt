Hello all,
When I want to send my public key to a keyserver, I get the following output:
michael > gpg --keyserver pgp.dtype.org --send-key xantor
gpg: Let op: er wordt onveilig geheugen gebruikt!
gpg: [fd 5]: read error: Verbinding reset door `peer'
gpg: fout bij versturen naar `pgp.dtype.org': eof
Can anyone tell me what's wrong with this output or command?

Your key block contained 1 format errors,

The last error was on key 0xeb773936:

When I import your public key and try to verify your signature, gpg also says that the signature was bad. I think that cryptoEx isn't fully compliant with OpenPGP. Why? haven't got a clue :(

If you use envelopes, why not use encryption??
