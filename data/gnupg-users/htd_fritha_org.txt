I think the overall stats for people using cryptography is that low

even can't install programs on their computers properly. This is not meant

I second that. Besides, holding a GPG encrypted keyfile on unencrypted space to open a
LUKS/dmcrypt encrypted device, opening/decrypting the keyfile in the boot
process by entering the correct passphrase, to finally open the
LUKS/dmcrypt secured device seems broken to me. Why not just use the same
secure passphrase for the LUKS keyslot directly, instead of using a keyfile?
Seems a little bit like "security by obscurity" to me..

@_subject: OpenPGP smartcard, how vulnerable is it? 
if someone gets physical access to an openpgp smartcard, where is
the weakest spot in the whole scenario then? Can the contents of the card
be copied, e.g. to circumvent the limited possibilities entering
the correct PIN / admin-PIN? Can the secret key be extracted to
brute-force the PIN / passphrase? Reverse engineering?! What else??
Me thinking: using this smartcard and a 10-digits PIN should be more
than sufficient, because the attacker has only three chances to get
the PIN right, and in case of a 10 digits PIN will he/she be quite
unlikely to succeed. (The passphrase itself may be a 50 chars random
concatenating of numbers, letters and special chars).

Hi David,
Thanks for answering. There's no thread model so far - and I'm quite
shure that I'm not a target for any security agency :-)
The background for my question is simply "what's in it for me if I use
such a card". Will the benefits outweight the drawbacks, and what are
in fact such drawbacks, if there are some?
Frankly, I find it very convenient to be able to use a simple PIN for
nearly all operations, and not the long and compilcated passphrase.

What's the model of threat in your case, actually? Usually, the crypto
algorithm isn't the weakest part in the whole scenario, and stacking
different algorithms will therefore not make any sense at all.

@_subject: KeePass or any other password wallet to store and transport keys 
As far as I know, none of those three is broken. So if neither your
security concept nor the algorithms speed matters: using Occam's
razor, I would suggest "use the one which is preinstalled/predefined
in your distribution". If it's none of those three, "use the one which
is easiest to set up / to use for you".

@_subject: KeePass or any other password wallet to store and transport keys 
It does matter. Because the software which has generated the key can
be flawed, and thus can have generated a flawed key. Nobody has to
know about such flaws, it's quite likely that an attacker chooses not
to publicate information about that, with the effect that he/she can
use the security hole longer (maybe forever). If it's reported, it
will be fixed immediately.
This is why smartcards exist.

You can mount /tmp and the various other tmpfiles to memory. That's
what I do (not for security reasons, but to have the tmp stuff deleted
on reboot).
If this makes sense for you, you could easily edit your file, save it
somewhere where it is secured, delete it on the harddisk and fill the
unused space with random noise via dd or similar. It's a lot of work,
but by far easier than what you did.
Why don't you just boot from USB-stick or DVD, edit your file, save it
away and reboot?

And therefore, these numbers are without meaning.
While there is evidence that reminders can have a slight impact on
quality improvement, it would be a lot more effective to explain to
the downloader what could happen if he/she does NOT check the
signature before using the downloaded software (*). This should come with
an easy instruction how to do that.
I'm quite shure that would boost the number of downloaders who
actually check the signature.

@_subject: Successful experiment boosting the number of users using OpenPGP 
Enforcing something to people mainly results in the opposite of what you want them to do.
You can't know. There can be people who download the sig but doesn't
manage to get it checked afterwards. Quality improvement should both
target these and all the others who don't bother. Show them why it is
important, how they could be affected of the negative consequences of
not checking the signature. And show them how they can do that.
There is no such thing as "statistically meaningless". A difference
can be statistically significant (it's unlikely the result occured
by chance) or non-significant (it's likely that the results you
observe is due to natural variation/chance).
What you mean is that the increased download rate isn't relevant
(because it's flawed by the fact that downloading the sig doesn't
indicate that is has been checked) ;-)
You can only find out if an increased download rate is related to an
increased signature check if you ask the downloaders themselves.

When you take all printable ASCII-chars as "headroom", with
 B = entropy in bits
 L = length of the passphrase
 P = amount of possible chars ("headroom")
then  B = (L*log P / log2) will calculate your passwords entropy in bits. Your 19-chars password
accounts for 124 bits of entropy, which is nearly half of AES-256's
strength (there are P^L different passwords). One assumes that in most
cases, trying 50% of all possible passwords will lead to success).

This very much depends on how important the encrypted information is
considered to be. However, I agree that most probably no one is
especially interested in *my* passphrase :-)
For some ciphers (incl. AES), a smaller key size means
"faster". While this doesn't matter for a reasonably fast desktop
system, it can play a role for a lot of small computers and laptops
running an Atom or AMD E processor.

The thing is, if there's a command to export the private keyring,
you're hosed. Somebody who has access to your machine could simply
install his own software.
Besides: what would you do if you had discovered that somebody had
gained root-access to your machine? I bet you would use your
revocation certificate anyway.
Then, your PIN and passphrase is known to the adversary, and you're
f*cked up.
The whole point with a smartcard is that it's a lot easier to memorize
the PIN than a long and complicated passphrase, and that the private
key can't be exported. If it can, there's no need for a smartcard.
