Can anyone help me out with the meaning of this error message?

Ok... Using Windows XP Pro, Thunderbird 1.5.0.7 Enigmail 0.94.1.0, GnuPG
I'm trying to verify the signature on the automated email from the PGP
Global directory keyserver.  This is the only email that has ever shown
this message.  Here's the Enigmail Console output with a -vv added to
it.  Hash appears to be SHA1.

Thanks!  I thought that might be the problem although I didn't know how
to determine what hash the message was actually using.  What's
ridiculous is that the message was produced by the PGP Global Directory
keyserver.  The message is PGP/MIME in HTML format and I don't even see
a HASH string in the message source at all.
Thanks for your help!

Found it.  That's exactly what's happening and obviously the problem
still hasn't been fixed (or else it raised its ugly head again).

Thanks to you both!

I'm sure he meant to reply to the list.  Unfortunately this list doesn't
generate a "Reply-To" back to the list so if one just hits "Reply" it
goes back to the original sender and not to the list.  I've been called
on this before until I realized what was happening.
If anyone on the list knows who to contact to get this fixed it would be
greatly appreciated.  Or if I'm totally missing something... please tell me!

Thanks for the pointer!
Will do.  Didn't realize there were reasons why doing that might not be
desirable in cases.  Seems to be done on ever other list I've seen
except this one so I'm curious enough to read your links as to why.
Ok I'll bite.  Which one does handle it properly?  I did notice that
doing a reply all on your message sent it back to the list.  Reply All
on most messages go back to the sender with a CC: to the list.  Anyway
I'll hush since this is off-topic.  Thanks for the education!

Just a quick question:
Are there any caveats I should be aware of if I generate an RSA signing
key with an Elgamal encryption subkey?

I think he meant the other Robert in the discussion.

I've used PGP ever since I discovered it when I ran a BBS back in the
late 80's early 90's. I rarely post but always listening.  Definitely
time to break backward compatibility if it will help move it forward!
Go for it!
