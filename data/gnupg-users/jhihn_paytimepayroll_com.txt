@_subject: Removing passphrases and setting output file? 
I wish to automate some processes that deal with sending out and receiving
secure files. I am under the impression that I must remove the passphrase to
do this. Am I mistaken?
Also, how can I set the output file? Right now the file shows up between a
bunch of GPG messages on the console. -o and --output are not it.
