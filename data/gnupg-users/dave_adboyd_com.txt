Turn on debugging in enigmail.  It's the last tab under preferences.
This will show you what errors you are getting.
I do it this way all the time.
That's up to you.  I have a variable set in my system, GNUPGHOME, that sets the directory for gpg to use.  If you don't have one of these set, I believe that it defaults to the directory that it is run from, but I could be wrong.
I also have the following line in a batch file that I use to locate keys:
gpg --search-keys --keyserver pgp.mit.edu %1
So you can try it manually and see if the key is locatable.  Note that this means that gpg has to be in the PATH.
