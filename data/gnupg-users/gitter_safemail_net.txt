I am using gpg-agent to manage my github ssh key. I generate my (private) ssh key via openpgp2ssh from my private gpg key. Unfortunately, although my private gpg key is not password protected, gpg-agent asks me for a password (via a nice X dialog) before I ssh to github. Entering nothing works fine, and I can connect to github.
~$ eval "$(gpg-agent --enable-ssh-support --daemon)"
~$ gpg2 --export-secret-keys | openpgp2ssh | ssh-add /dev/stdin
Identity added: /dev/stdin (/dev/stdin)
~$ ssh git at github.com

Hi xxx! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access. Connection to github.com closed.
Is there any way I can disable this needless dialog?  I am running GNU/Linux; Debian 6; x86_64 - gpg-agent 2.0.14

I am using gpg-agent to manage my one and only ssh key. I generate my (private) ssh key via openpgp2ssh from my private gpg key. Unfortunately, although my private gpg key is not password protected, gpg-agent asks me for a passphrase (via a nice X dialog) before I ssh to my server. Entering nothing works fine, and I can connect to the server.

Ah, that is right.
I already use these long caching options for ssh. Actually what I want is not to enter a passphrase for my ssh key. I trust the applications that run on my system, so I do not want any passphrase.
