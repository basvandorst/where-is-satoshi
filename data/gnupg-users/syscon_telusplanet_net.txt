After using the computer for a day or so I sometimes get some strange
I have Mandrake 8.2 and GPG verion 1.0.6 installed from Mandrake
original disk. I've upgraded to GPG ver. 1.0.7 using tar.gz.
When I try to decrypt the file from a command line it gives me an error
massage that command line is invalid.  If type the "gpg --version it
shows me it is 1.0.6.  If I restart computer it show me the correct version 1.0.7 and I have no
problem decrypting the files.
Do I need to delete GPG ver. 1.0.6?

@_subject: GPG 1.0.7 decrypting problem 
I'm using Geheimnis (shell) with GPG 1.0.7 and I have problem reading a
file after decrypting it.
The file.doc I encrypt with two public keys and sign it so the command
looks like this:
encrypting: --secret-keyring /home/joseph/.gnupg/secring.gpg --keyring
Decrypting command looks like this:
decrypting : gpg -v --no-default-keyring --secret-keyring
--decrypt /home/joseph/file3.doc.pgp At his point I can not open the document.
Any suggestions?
If I go through the same procedure but chose not to sign it I can
decrypt and read the decrypted file OK, but when I sign it I can not
read decrypted file anymore.

@_subject: Encrypt and Sign - strange problem to open on Windows 
I've created a simple file encrypt it with the recipient public key ONLY
and he is able to decrypt the message on Windows
However, if I encrypt the same file an addition to his key to my key and
sign it, he is not able to decrypt the message; why?
Here is how my command look to encrypt the file with his public key, my
key and signature:
gpg -v --no-batch --comment "GPG ver. 1.0.7" -e -s -u xxxxxxxxxxxx -a
--no-default-keyring --secret-keyring /home/joseph/.gnupg/secring.gpg
--keyring /home/joseph/.gnupg/pubring.gpg -r xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx -o
I'm able to decrypt this file he is not, why?

Thanks David for your help.
I repeat the procedure yesterday and the fellow still can not decrypt
the file I sent him.  The file is encrypted to his key and my key plus
it is signed.  If I encrypt only to his key he can read open it.
Here is the command I used, there are two "-r".
gpg -v --no-batch --comment " -e -s -u
0245919ACED0E1FB7 -a --no-default-keyring --secret-keyring
0335919ACED0E1FB7 -o /home/joseph/text.doc.pgp /home/joseph/text.doc

@_subject: selecting uid in a key 
I've generated a key pair and added a user ID (another email) to the
same key.
However, when I go to sign a file I'm only presented with the second
user ID when signing a file.
pub   sub   (1)  First Name (ID)(created when generating original key)
(2). Send Name (ID) (was added later)
What do I do so when I sign a file my "First Name (ID)" appear as a
default name.
Does it have something to do with that small "dot" after the second
number "(2)."

@_subject: GPG 1.0.7 
I've upgraded to GPG 1.0.7 but know I get two errors
gpg: WARNING: --honor-http-proxy is a deprecated option.
gpg: please use "--keyserver-options honor-http-proxy" instead
Any idea how how to fix it?
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
This one has to do something with installing the package as suid (root),
to lock memory pages when typing the passphrase; but the installation
instruction doesn't go into detail on how to do it.

@_subject: verify signatures failed 
I've generated my key in GPG 1.0.6 and I just upgraded to ver. 1.0.7
When I extract my public key and try to verify it I get an error:
gpg: armor header: Version: GnuPG v1.0.7 (GNU/Linux)
gpg: verify signatures failed: unexpected data
Does anybody have similar problem?
Though, if I sign a email and try to verify it it works OK

@_subject: Deleting a Public Key from a server 
I don't think you can delete the key from the server.
One way of doing it is to create key an name it "DO NOT USE"
Sign your public key the one that you lost the pass-phrase to with the
key you just created "DO NOT USE" and post it to the key-server.
