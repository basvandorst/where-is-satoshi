@_subject: PGP Zip with a single file? 
I'm using GNUPG to decrypt files that were created as PGP Zip archives using PGP Desktop.  If there are multiple files in the archive then GNUPG extracts a TAR file, and I have no problem processing it from there.  The problem is when there is only one file in the PGP Zip archive it can have a filename completely different than the filename of the archive file, which would be just fine if it were still stored in a TAR file, but when GNUPG decrypts the archive it outputs the original file, not a TAR file.  PGP Desktop still displays the original file name when you open the archive, is there any way to get this file name using GNUPG?
