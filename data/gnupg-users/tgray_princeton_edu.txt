@_subject: question using gpg... 
I just installed gpg on my Mac OS X system. I was using PGP 7.0.3 before (for mac).  Is there anyway to use my keys from before with gpg?  Is there any way of importing these PGP 7.0.3 keys into GPG (1.0.6)?  If so, could someone describe the process to me? Thanks.
