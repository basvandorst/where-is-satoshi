@_subject: Paper backup of all keys 
Hello all,
I want a paper backup of all the keys I have for an email an address.
How is this done?  (I have printed out my private key in the past....don't remember how I did it or if I did it correctly).
Also, let's say the key associated with the email address (not a paper backup) gets corrupted or I delete it or render the key unuseable- can the paper backup of the key be used to type the key back in?
Thank you,
Craig

Thanks Antony.  I got the txt files of the secret keys.....I hope.  I wonder if there's a way to get the public, private and ID and associated email addresses all backed up into a nice neat txt file?
So far....so good.

 Just off the top of my head, I believe it can be done with:
 gpg -a --export-secret-keys [key-id] > secret_key.txt
 This creates a text file with the ASCII armored private key
 file which can then be printed.

 You can type the key into a text file, say secret_key.txt,
 and then do:
 gpg --import secret_key.txt
 You could name it secret_key.asc as well. Not sure if that
 matters (I don't think it does).
 This is just off the top of my head since I'm not at my
 computer at the moment to verify, but that's the gist of
 it.

I gave paperkey a try the other day and quickly learned, because I'm no techy (and no desire to be one), it was too difficult to figure out. Maybe I'll give it another try?

 Sure, but it would likely be a pain to type the whole thing
 in.
 You might be interested in the "paperkey" tool, written by
 David Shaw,
 which does a good job at minimizing the typing you'll need
 to do
 (assuming that all of the public parts of the certificate
 itself can be
 recovered from the keyservers or your correspondents).
 If you use debian or a debian derivative, just use "apt
 install
 paperkey", but otherwise there's:

@_subject: Is passphrase correct? 
I want to be able to verify that I'm using the correct passphrase associated with an email address of mine.
In other words- I'm trying to make sure I haven't forgotten the passphrase and need a way to test it...preferably using command line (Linux).
How can this be done?
Thank you,
