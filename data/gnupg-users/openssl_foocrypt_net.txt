Hi Nick
Have You tried The FooKey Method ? I will be sourcing public addendum's as addendum's to my submission into the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security [  ] regarding the committee?s review of the 'Telecommunication and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Bill 2018' after the Melbourne Cup. It will be similar to the open request for the Defence Trade Control Act review performed by the former Inspector General of Intelligence, Dr Vivian Thom.

But don?t tell the Australian Government, it?s probably on their back door request list?;)
