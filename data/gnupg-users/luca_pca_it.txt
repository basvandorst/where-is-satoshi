Hi there!
Please Cc: me, I am not subscribed to the list.
I found what I think is a bug in gpg-agent (the environment file should
be delete when quitting), please see:
Yesterday, after having patched gpg-agent and extensively tested my
(very simple) patch, I sent it to the gnupg-devel@ mailing list, but I
still fail to see it appearing on the archives:
  Subject: [PATCH] Remove the environment file when quitting.

Should I subscribe to the gnupg-devel@ mailing list to post?  Can this
information be added to the listinfo page, please?

Hi there!
Still valid.
I know what and how greylisting works, which is exactly what happened in
the log above.  The problem is that there is no sign of my email above,
not even the in-moderation notification.  I will try to re-send it...
I found the answer to my first question in the mailing list webpage, so
this is purely my fault, it seems I completely missed the other part of
that page.  Short story: all GnuPG mailing lists are subscribers-only:
I still think that this information should be added to the listinfo
pages as well, but this is another matter.
Sorry for the noise.
Thx, bye,
Gismo / Luca

Hi there!
Please Cc: me, I am not subscribed to the list.
As I wrote in my previous email, greylisting is not the problem.
I agree with the thanks, not with the fact that non-subscribers need to
be moderated (and greylisting is already a moderation), but it is your
project, so you decide ;-)
I do not see the point in not sending notifications:
1) I would be interested to know how many spam emails passes
   greylisting.
2) given the fact that there is no SMTP error message and no
   notification, there is no way for the sender to know what happened
   with her/his email, which is a bit unfair.
3) not having notifications also means that you can not cancel your
   email, which could result in duplicate posts.
Really, I do not have any problem with waiting (if I know that I have
to), but the above seems overcomplicated.
FTR, I subscribed to the gnupg-devel@ mailing list and re-sent my email:
Thx, bye,

Hi there!
Please Cc: me, I am not subscribed to the list.
Thank you for having answered my questions.
Do you mean that when a moderate post is accepted the poster receives a
copy?  This is not the case for gnupg-users I have never received my
And this happens way too late: it is more than a week now since my first
attempt to post to gnupg-devel@ and still I do not have any news of
that.  I do not know if this is because, as you wrote, moderation
(thanks to the hidden work of volunteers I, as you, am thankful to) or
because my first email got lost on the ns1.u64.de server (which is the
question I ask at the very beginning).
While I do not care anymore (I am now subscribed to gnupg-devel at
least until the environment file issue will be solved), I would like to
be sure it is not a problem on my side (my SMTP server or how I sent the
email), to avoid any consequence.
I was surprised as well to discover that such an option exists!  Here is
the moderation email I received in reply to my last post to
