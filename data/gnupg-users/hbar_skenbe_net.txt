-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

That would have to be very zealous users, since I once found PGP GD signatures
on one of my keys when I checked it on the SKS network. At the time, that key
was known only by me, the SKS servers and the PGP GD.
What users would download keys at random?

Is there a way to run refresh-keys WITHOUT honoring preferred keyserver
Every now and then I need to update an entire keyring from one specific
keyserver, and since some of the keys involved has preferred keyserver
records it usually turns into running refresh-keys followed by locating
the un-updated key ID's in the scrollback, and then run recv-keys for
those keys.
Something like "gpg --keyserver company.keyserver --refresh-keys

Yes, I am aware of the possible conflict of interest between what the
sender/author of any kind of data would want the reciever to do with the
data and what the reciever would like to do with the data.
Still, I need to keep one keyring updated from one non-public keyserver.
