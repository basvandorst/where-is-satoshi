@_subject: errors after running 'make' 
I am installing gnupg-1.2.2 on OpenBSD 3.2, after running the 'make' command I
receive the following error messages:
*** Error code 1
Stop in /usr/src/gnu/gnupg-1.2.2/tools (line 327 of Makefile).
*** Error code 1
Stop in /usr/src/gnu/gnupg-1.2.2 (line 290 of Makefile).
*** Error code 1
Stop in /usr/src/gnu/gnupg-1.2.2 (line 227 of Makefile).
I looked at the Makefile in the gnupg-1.2.2 dir and also in the
gnupg-1.2.2/tools dir and found no clues. Has anyone else seen these errors?
