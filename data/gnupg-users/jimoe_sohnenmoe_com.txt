  What are the "other" return codes?

@_subject: Sign+Encrypt a message 
Hash: SHA1
  I am converting a program that made system calls to PGP to handle
security operations, to using gpg instead.
  One of the features of PGP is its ability to sign and encrypt from a
single command. Is it possible to do the same with gpg?
  If not, can you recommend a method that would accomplish the same thing?

  gpg and gpg-agent v2.0.15
  gpg-agent is not working with Thunderbird v3.1.2. Enigmail seems to
think that gpg-agent is not properly configured. That is likely.
The "use-agent" directive is in <~/.gnupg/gpg.conf>
This is what I use at reboot:

Hash: SHA1
  opensuse v11.2, linux 2.6.31.12-0.1-desktop x86_64, gpg v2.0.12.
  The docs at  cover starting gpg-agent pretty
well. What is missing is how to re-start it.
  If gpg-agent is terminated for some reason, or the system is booted,
the file <.gpg-agent.info> is left behind. Because the file exists, when
.bashrc is run it detects the file and does not start gpg-agent.
  Is there some way to:
1. Detect if gpg-agent is running. If not, erase <.gpg-agent.info>, or
2. Erase <.gpg-agent.info> at boot time.

Tbird v3.0.3, gnupg v2.0.12, enigmail v1.0.1
I have started gpg-agent, have exported the variables from

the message "...to change passphrase caching options, please configure

Hmm. Which settings must be configured? Where is the conf located?

  I have an older gnuPG (v1.4.6) that is apparently mis-configured.
When signing a message, it fails with a note about what a bad idea
IDEA is, and quits. gpg is called from an email program to perform
security services. There is no command option to indicate a preferred

@_subject: General brute force attack question 
My understanding of en-/decryption is that there is no indication of
progress toward finding a successful key match of a given encryption.
Only when the key is exactly correct will the encrypted data be revealed.
  I have seen numerous TV and movie stories where someone is
frantically attempting to decrypt something and there is a progress
meter to indicate the current degree of success. Every time I see this
I think "That is total BS! It is all or nothing."
  Related to this is the oft-repeated request to avoid identifiable
information (initials, birth date, etc.) in a cryptographic key. I
presume this gives an attacker a preferred set of characters to
attempt before moving on to truly random combinations.
  Finally, a brute force attack requires potentially billions of
attempts. Obviously this cannot be done by trying the usual log in
screens or prompts; there are delays between attempts, and a limited
number of attempts per some interval. How does an attacker then
perform a brute force attack? Does he cadge a block of encrypted text
and hammer on that until success?
  Is this a correct interpretation?

@_subject: Top-posting 
In that spirit I offer this rant:
Trim your posts!
There is no need for a complete history of every bit of text in 14
previous posts including "On such date somebody wrote" headers, every
respondent's signature, and every listserv trailer.
I realize many of you use smartphones and tablets and Googlegroups, and
direct experience has shown that it is unreasonably difficult to select
and delete text. Nevertheless, please make the effort.
I also realize that your response is very profound and that it is
important to get it posted as quickly as possible. However, you greatly
inconvenience the readers (for instance, me) of said profundity with all
of the extraneous text you leave in your posting making it a challenge
to even find the response.
A: Because it messes up the order in which people normally read text.
Q: Why is top-posting such a bad thing?
A: Top-posting.
Q: What is the most annoying thing on usenet and in e-mail?

gpg2 seems to enter an infinite loop. The system recently updated; gnupg
does appear in the update log. That is all I know.
I executed the command
  $ gpg2 --debug-all --list-keys
to get a debug output. The resulting file is really large: 8.9MB. I have
provided a Dropbox link to the debug file below.

Sigh. Typo.
  gnupg does NOT appear in the update log. Nor does libscrypt.
  The repetitive part of the log starts at line 475.

As it happens, yes.
  The size of pubring.gpg was 20MB; the backup copy was 1.3MB. After
restoring from backup, gpg2 performs normally.
  Thank you.
