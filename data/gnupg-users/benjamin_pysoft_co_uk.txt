============================== START ==============================
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
After much fuss, I recently persuaded gpg-agent v1.9.20 to compile under
Mac OS with Darwin Ports.  If I remember rightly, I used ports to
install most of the libraries.  However, one library was too out of date
and I used ports file from the previous version to modify it.
I then had to modify the gpg-agent source code to refer to the PCSC
driver under Mac OS and it now works perfectly on my system.
Unfortunately, I haven't got time to list the exact steps at the moment
but, hopefully, the above might help you enough to get it going.  If it
doesn't, send me a message in about a week and I will send more detailed
information / look into updating the gpg-agent port.

You'll need a card that conforms to the OpenPGP standard.  The only
distributor I know of is Kernel Concepts [1].  However, you also get a
free OpenPGP card when you join the Fellowship of the Free Software
Foundation [2].
At this stage, you can only store 1kb RSA keys on OpenPGP cards.  I am
currently working on an implementation using BasicCards that will
support 4kb RSA keys, but it's not a priority for me.

To get gpg-agent v1.9.20 (required for smartcards) working under Mac OS
with darwin ports:
Replace the file

Then type the following:
sudo port clean gpg-agent

Some of the gpg modules do not correctly link with the pth library and

Further to my message to you, I know that you are running gnupg2 from

@_author: Benjamin Donnachie 
@_subject: Configuring gpg-agent 
I should really read messages in more detail before replying!  I hadn't
noticed that you had been able to get gpg-agent working!
Firstly, the system maintains separate copies of the environment - when
you open a terminal and add GPG_AGENT_INFO etc to the environment it
does not update the "master" copy, so when you open Thunderbird from the
Applications menu it does not know how to access gpg-agent.
gpg-agent uses pinentry for passphrase handling.  Under Mac OS it is
configured to use the current terminal for input.  However, when
Thunderbird / Enigmail execute gpg2 there is no terminal and therefore
it cannot get a passphrase.
I'm about to look into whether pinentry can be made to play nicely under
Mac OS.

I've since had a quick look at pinentry and it /may/ play nicely with
Mac OS with qt3-mac, the Qt Tool Kit (Native Aqua Version) port.
It's going to take some time to compile and install and I'll let you
know how it goes...

@_date: 2006-05-06 22:01:50
@_author: Benjamin Donnachie 
@_subject: Configuring gpg-agent 
Well...  it's sort of working...
After installing qt3-mac from ports I disabled the ports copy of
pinentry.  I then downloaded the pinentry source and compiled it with
the following options, ./configure --enable-pinentry-qt
--prefix=/opt/local --with-qt-includes=/opt/local/include/qt3/
Open a terminal and type eval $(gpg-agent --daemon) followed by echo
$GPG_AGENT_INFO.  Note the output of the latter.
Then start Applications / Utilities / X.  In the xterm window start
Thunderbird by typing
Then under OpenPGP -> Preferences -> Additional parameters for gnupg
type --gpg-agent-info= followed by the output you noted from echo
$GPG_AGENT_INFO above.
Now try to send a signed message.  Thunderbird will hang.  However, if
you kill it by entering ctrl+c in the xterm window you will then notice
a window asking you to enter your passphrase!
So, partial success, I suppose...

No need to start it under X.  However, pinentry does expect the DISPLAY
variable to be set so you will need to type export DISPLAY=0 first.
However, it still doesn't work properly.
I'm currently trying to ascertain whether there is a value of DISPLAY
that will work with qt3-mac and enable pinentry to grab the keyboard.
It may be necessary to install qt3 instead and use X11.

@_subject: Running pinentry natively under MacOS. 
Charly Avital has kindly helped me check the following instructions and
they should now be correct.  The following steps are required to run
pinentry natively under Mac OS, ie without X11.
These steps also have the advantage that GUI programs which use ssh,
such as Fugu, can now work with smartcard logins.
NB These steps assume that you previously used darwinports to install
gpg2 and associated libraries in /opt/local.
sudo port install qt3-mac.  (If using ports make sure you deactivate
other versions of qt first! eg sudo port deactivate qt3)
the attached patch-pinentry.diff patch.  ie patch -p0 <
LDFLAGS="-L/opt/local/lib -liconv" followed by ./configure
--enable-pinentry-qt --prefix=/opt/local
--with-qt-libraries=/opt/local/lib/ --disable-rpath
subdirectories /opt/local/pinentry-qt.app/Contents/ and
finder pinentry-qt.app will appear as an application, you will need to
right click and select Show Package Contents before creating the
apply attached patch-gpgparsemail.diff, patch-scdaemon.diff and
patch-query.diff patches.
./configure --prefix=/opt/local
Now test it has all worked - open a terminal, type eval
$(/opt/local/bin/gpg-agent --daemon) followed by echo test | gpg -ase -r
"your email address" | gpg
BE PATIENT!  It can take a few moments for pinentry to pop up.
At the moment - to work with Thunderbird/Enigmail you will need to start
it from a terminal.  The steps required are: open terminal, type eval
$(gpg-agent --daemon) and then
I am currently working on a solution which will negate this step.  (Any

Fantastic news! :-))))  Libgcrypt took a while to convince to build as a
Universal Binary and I was concerned that it may not work on Intels.
I've been over the executables with a fine tooth comb (okay, just otool
-L) and there are not dependencies outside the Apple provided libraries,
so the install should work on all Tiger Macs whether Intel or PPC! :-)

Unfortunately, gpg v2.0.2 does not appear to recognise the option
pcsc-driver anymore:
$ gpg2 --pcsc-driver /System/Library/Frameworks/PCSC.framework/PCSC
gpg: Invalid option "--pcsc-driver"
Despite the following in the man page:
--pcsc-driver file
Use  file to access the smartcard reader. The current default is
`libpcsclite.so.1'   for    GLIBC    based    systems,    `/Sys-
tem/Library/Frameworks/PCSC.framework/PCSC'  for MAC OS X, `win-
scard.dll' for Windows and `libpcsclite.so' for other systems.
Neither scdaemon:
 defined(HAVE_W32_SYSTEM) || defined(__CYGWIN__)
 DEFAULT_PCSC_DRIVER "winscard.dll"
 defined(__GLIBC__)
 DEFAULT_PCSC_DRIVER "libpcsclite.so.1"
 DEFAULT_PCSC_DRIVER "libpcsclite.so"
... or pcsc-wrapper correctly default correctly on the Mac:
 DEFAULT_PCSC_DRIVER "libpcsclite.so"
This shouldn't matter if you are using a CCID compliant smartcard reader
as TEST1 was compiled with libusb support (Though this still needs
testing).  However, if you are using a PCSC smartcard reader please
download the newly patched TEST2 at

I'm not an expert with Mac OS and my understanding is that GUI
applications require an information bundle.  The likes of sh have been
modified to ensure that the bundle is correctly processed and the GUI
information passed to the OS.
Without the bundle information, the application starts beneath all other
applications and cannot grab key focus.  (Search the cocoa-dev and
qt-dev archive for my observations on this).
The standard c calls that I tried, and some Mac OS specific ones, did
not read the application bundle information correctly.  Using sh was a
hack; a hack that worked for me that no-one else (apart from less than a
handful of people) were interested in using.
I like the idea of having pinentry handle the necessary "magic" to get
things working...  I shall reinvestigate the NSTask Class - it may be
the answer I'm looking for.  (It's been over six months since I last
looked at it).
I approached the macgpg team too, but at the time gpg2 was alpha-ware
and no-one seemed that interested in getting it all working on the Mac.
I'll see what I can do... but it's a low-priority at the moment.

There's currently a beta package for gpg v2.0.9 on the Mac available at
Signature at
Universal binary tested on MacOSX v10.4 and v10.5.  Unzip and then run
resulting install package.
Until fully integrated into the macgpg project, support available on the
macgpg2 list - To use the OpenPGP smartcard with SSH you will need to add the line
"enable-ssh-support" to ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf  You then need to log
out and then back in again for it to work.
If you installed mac-gpg2 by hand previously, any entry in .profile
relating to source ~/.gpg-agent-info or source ~/.gnupg/.gpg-agent can
be removed.
This install will overwrite the file ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist on
every login.  If you do not know what this means then generally you do
not need to worry.  If you do have one, it's fair to assume that you are
capable of editing /usr/local/sbin/gpg-login.sh to add the required
statements back in.
This install will NOT replace and existing Login and Logout hooks.  If
you have any existing hooks you will need to run the following from the
command line:
sudo defaults write com.apple.loginwindow LoginHook
sudo defaults write com.apple.loginwindow LogoutHook
Further refinements planned before release in order of priority:
LoginHook - only kill dead standard sockets if gpg-agent set to use
standard sockets.
Install script - produce error message if Login/out scripts already
exist and not mac-gpg2.  Alternatively, replace any hooks but ensure
message displayed/warning given.
Overall - improve install experience and package as dmg.
LoginHook - add facility for optional file to contain additional
environment.plist statements to avoid editing of scripts.
LoginHook - remove requirement for environment file and use output from
gpg-agent instead.

@_subject: gnupg as ssh-agent 
2009/7/10 Ingo Krabbe :
man gpg-agent:
    Enable emulation of the OpenSSH Agent protocol.
    In this mode of operation, the agent does not only implement the
gpg-agent protocol, but also the agent protocol used by OpenSSH
(through a separate socket). Consequently, it should be possible to
use the gpg-agent as a drop-in replacement for the well known
    SSH Keys, which are to be used through the agent, need to be added
to the gpg-agent initially through the ssh-add utility. When a key is
added, ssh-add will ask for the password of the provided key file and
send the unprotected key material to the agent; this causes the
gpg-agent to ask for a passphrase, which is to be used for encrypting
the newly received key and storing it in a gpg-agent specific
    Once a key has been added to the gpg-agent this way, the gpg-agent
will be ready to use the key.
    Note: in case the gpg-agent receives a signature request, the user
might need to be prompted for a passphrase, which is necessary for
decrypting the stored key. Since the ssh-agent protocol does not
contain a mechanism for telling the agent on which display/terminal it
is running, gpg-agent's ssh-support will use the TTY or X display
where gpg-agent has been started. To switch this display to the
current one, the following command may be used:
        echo UPDATESTARTUPTTY | gpg-connect-agent

@_subject: Avoid pinentry-gtk-2 when using console! 
2009/5/31 Roger :
I do wish people would stop complaining about open source
software and actually roll their sleeves up and do something to
One solution, create a symbolic link in your home directory to
whatever pinentry you want to use at a particular time, and point your
gpg-agent config to that, eg in ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent - pinentry-program
So when X starts have your link, say ~/.gnupg/use-this-pinentry point
to the X one, when you start a shell, modify the link for
~/.gpg-agent/use-this-pinentry to the curses one - easy enough to
achieve with the bash login/out scripts.
Alternatively, modify the code for gpg-agent to achieve what you want
and submit to Werner for evaluation.

It is how gpg2 (and hence MacGPG2) is designed to work.
To achieve that you want, add the following to the file ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf:
default-cache-ttl 0
Then terminate gpg-agent - either using 'killall gpg-agent" from the
command line and then run start-gpg-agent from Applications.
Alternatively, just restart your machine.

gpg-agent[9482]: this process is useless - shutting down

This issue has been confirmed by other people using my MacGPG2 package
albeit with a patched copy of gpg-agent.  I haven't had chance to
investigate this thoroughly at this stage.
GnuPG is compiled with the following options:
export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.4
export CFLAGS="-mmacosx-version-min=10.4 -isysroot
export CC=/usr/bin/gcc-4.0
(Above necessary to generate Universal Binary that works on Tiger and above)

The only significant change is the move to libassuan v2.0.0, which I
strongly suspect as it provides the IPC library.  libassuan was
compiled with the same options as v1.0.5:

Open a terminal and type "man gpg-agent".  Make a note of any ttl values you
want to set, eg:
       --default-cache-ttl n
              Set  the  time a cache entry is valid to n seconds.  The
              is 600 seconds.
       --default-cache-ttl-ssh n
              Set the time a cache entry used for SSH keys is valid to n
 sec-
              onds.  The default is 1800 seconds.
       --max-cache-ttl n
              Set the maximum time a cache entry is valid to n seconds.
 After
              this time a cache entry will be expired  even  if  it  has
 been
              accessed recently.  The default is 2 hours (7200 seconds).
       --max-cache-ttl-ssh n
              Set the maximum time a cache entry used for SSH keys is valid
              n seconds.  After this time a cache entry will be  expired
 even
              if  it has been accessed recently.  The default is 2 hours
              seconds).
Then type "nano ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf" at the command prompt and enter the
values you want without the preceding dashes, for example:
default-cache-ttl 0
max-cache-ttl 0
Then kill any existing gpg-agent with "kill gpg-agent".  As you are using
gpg-tools, you may wish to direct your query to their email list -

Use this patch to increase the maximum keysize in gpg2 to 8192 when using
the --expert option - intended for v2.0.17 but should be good for later
versions too.

Allow the user to do certain nonsensical or "silly" things like signing an
expired or revoked key, or certain potentially incompatible things like
generating unusual key types. This also disables certain warning messages
about potentially incompatible actions. As the name implies, this option is
for experts only. If you don't fully understand the implications of what it
allows you to do, leave this off. --no-expert disables this option.
It's generally accepted that a big key is a "silly thing" so seems perfect
for inclusion in the expert option.

You need to tell the OS where to find these libraries.  For a quick fix,
add /usr/local/lib/ to /etc/ld.so.conf, run ldconfig -v and try again.
