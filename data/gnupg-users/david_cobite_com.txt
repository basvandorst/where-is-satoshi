@_subject: decrypting multiple files? 
(please cc any replies to me since I'm not on the list)
Can anyone help me by anwering this question: is it possible to decrypt
multiple files (all encrypted with the same public key) with a single
invocation of gpg and, more importantly, without having to re-enter the
pass phrase? I have a system that sends me encryted log and status files three times
an hour(72 files a day) and don't want to spend my mornings typing my
(long :-) passphase in 72 times.
