Hmm, lots of lists I'm not subscribed to on the To: line, bad juju
on someone's part for the initial crosspost. Hopefully, those other
list maintainers will see and approve my comment, even though I'm
not subscribed to all those other lists:
I'm replying because, Sourceforge? They fell out of vogue when they
started bundling binary downloads with other executables, they deserve
to die a quick death for that as users flock to safer environs. 'Robert'
should upload his binaries to Github. Along with his source code. Then,
if the MD5 checksum on his compiled binaries matches the MD5 checksum
on the source code when it is compiled independently, he's golden. That
is how that works, how it is supposed to work. Accept no substitutes.
