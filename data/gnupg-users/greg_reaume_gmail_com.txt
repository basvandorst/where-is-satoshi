@_subject: JavaCard Implementation of OpenPGP Card 1.1 Spec 
Hi Everyone,
I am interested in using a smartcard for OpenPGP and am happy to see
that a spec has been developed (thanks to g10code) for this purpose
implemented on a native card OS.  What I'm looking for though, is an
implementation of this
spec (compatible with GPG) for the JavaCard OS.  I already carry a
smartcard for my X.509 S/MIME certs and would like to combine the two
applications on one JavaCard.
I searched the mailing list archive and came up with an individual
that has attempted this:
Could anyone provide any information on feedback you've heard about
this implementation and/or any other implementations that you're aware
I appreciate your time.  Thanks everyone!
