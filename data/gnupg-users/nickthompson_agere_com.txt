@_subject: no info to calculate a trust probability 
I have search high and low for an answer to this, but to no avail: I am
using Evolution as my mail tool and am trying to encrypt a mail using a
key that somebody sent me, which this header
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: PGP 7.1.1
The key looks like after importing to gpg:
pub  1024D/A55C22FA 1999-11-23 Xxxxxx Xxxx sub  2048g/29622D17 1999-11-23
(The name and address are changed to protect the innocent)
gpg says:
# gpg --verbose --no-secmem-warning --no-greeting --yes --batch --armor
-r xxxx.xxxx --encrypt file
gpg: using secondary key 29622D17 instead of primary key A55C22FA
gpg: 29622D17: no info to calculate a trust probability
gpg: no valid addressees
gpg: file: encryption failed: no such user id
I have signed the key. If I use gpg interactively I can force the
encryption, but Evolution only uses gpg in batch mode. Any idea how I
can get enough info into this key to make it work?

I have already signed the key and I did try setting the trust, which is
now "trust: q/f", though I did setting it to "f/f" and I still get the
same error. --edit "check" command does shows me as a signatory. I
thought that this is all that is required from reading the docs.
Obviously not.
Any more suggestions?

    You can gpg --edit to set this key to be trusted. Or you can sign this
    key. (I usually sign the key locally if I did not verify it but want to
    send messages encrypted. Which I do rarely, btw, as it's quite pointless
    to send encrypted messages to somebody I did not verify the key...)

Yes that allows me to override on the command line, but I have now way
to get Evolution to use that option. Is there no way to change the
setting of this _one_ key to be trusted?

    I think you mix ownertrust and validity! The ownertrust has nothing
    to with the validity of the key. But you can skip all trust checks when
    you set a key to ultimate (which only makes sense for your own key).

    Try --always-trust, then it should work.
