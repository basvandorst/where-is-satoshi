I object.
My public key is:
pub  1024D/0E9FF879 2000-09-05 Darxus Having the extra "Darxus" in there is extraneous.  An older key of mine,
generated probably with an old version of pgp, is this:
pub  1024R/FE3821D9 1998-12-12 darxus
sig!       FE3821D9 1998-12-12  darxus
..which works fine.  So it appears possible for a valid key to exist
without a name field at all.  gpg is just being a pain in not letting me
do what I want.

       --allow-freeform-uid
                 Disable all checks on the form of  the  user  ID
                 while  generating a new one.  This option should
                 only be used in very special environments as  it
                 does  not ensure the de-facto standard format of
                 user IDs.
..found this as I was about to modify the source to let me do it.

@_subject: tracing trust paths 
I traced a path of signatures from Steve Wozniak to myself (5 hops).
It was a slow manual process.  I know gpg does path tracing for its
internal use, but is it possible to ask it to tell me a path from one
key to another ?

@_subject: tracing trust paths 
I decided gpg didn't actually do internally what I wanted to be able to
do, and your program didn't seem to do what I wanted either, so I wrote a
perl script:  $ gpg --fast-list-mode --keyring mykeyring --list-sigs > mysigs
$ cat mysigs | ./sigtrace.pl 449FA3AB 0E9FF879 mykeyring
Loaded data, tracing....

@_subject: gpg 1.0.1 cannot decrypt stuff encrypted by gpg 1.0.3 
I've been encrypting some mail lately, and after I upgraded to gpg 1.0.3,
the person I was emailing started getting blank messages from me.
He's running 1.0.1.  I did some tests.
I had another box with gpg 1.0.2.  On that box, I generated another
keypair for testing, and then on the box with gpg 1.0.3, encrypted a
message with the test key.
With gpg 1.0.2 I was able to decrypt that message with the test key.
When I downgraded to gpg 1.0.1 and attempted to decrypt the message, I got
blank output.  The output of 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 looks like this:

@_subject: gpg 1.0.1 also cannot decrypt stuff encrypted by gpg 1.0.4 
Without verbose mode turned on, attempts to decrypt messages from gpg
1.0.3 or 1.0.4 with gpg 1.0.1 result in a blank message and no errors.  Is
this acceptable behavior ?  I, personally, don't want to encrypt anything
to anyone else using anything over gpg 1.0.2, because I want the recipient
to actually get what I send them.

@_subject: clearsigning perl ? 
It is good practice to provide a gpg signature for programs you've
released, right ?
I have a few small perl programs at  that
are just a single .pl file... no need for a tarball.  ..and perl is
plaintext, so I figured, why not include the signature in the .pl ?
The result: What I did was:
* replace the 1st line ( with "=cut" * put "=head2" on the last line
* gpg --clearsign file.pl
* add the following 2 lines to the top:
    =head1
It works.  The program functions, and the signature verifies successfully.
Is there a better way to do this ?  Should I sign all my single .pl
programs like this ?
I realize this leaves the lines at the beginning of the program, which
could be maliciously modified to do bad things, are not verified.  I think
I would mention what they should look like on the last lines before the
signature, and provide a url to my public key.
I wish there was a way to clearsign a message without the "BEGIN PGP
SIGNED MESSAGE" stuff... (verification failed when I tried removing it)
