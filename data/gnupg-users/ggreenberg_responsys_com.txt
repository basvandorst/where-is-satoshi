@_subject: Why gpg complains? 
I imported into GPG public keys that were generated by another
Keys were accepted with no problem but when I am trying to encrypt with
these keys GPG gives me the following:
C:\Program Files\GNU\GnuPG>gpg -a -r utest3 -o
 -e C:\sites\local\dig\loadSample.csv
gpg: 4985F643: There is no assurance this key belongs to the named user
pub  1024R/4985F643 2008-01-16 utest3  Primary key fingerprint: 1113 FC70 96BC DA77 E113  9805 F426 E5B2 4985
It is NOT certain that the key belongs to the person named
in the user ID.  If you *really* know what you are doing,
you may answer the next question with yes.
Use this key anyway? (y/N) y
I did type 'Y" and file was successfully encrypted and later similarly
successfully decrypted.
Can someone tells me why it complains and how can I make GPG happy?
Thank you,
            Gary
