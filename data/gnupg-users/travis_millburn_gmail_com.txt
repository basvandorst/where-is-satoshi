@_subject: Problems installing 2.0.26 on Mavericks 
I?m running into problems compiling GnuPG on my mac running OS X 10.9.4.  I have Google-ed at length and read the INSTALL and README files to no avail.  I?m hoping to get some help on the install, and thankful in advance for any help. I have downloaded the current version (2.0.26) and verified the checksum.  I used a standard configure:
$ ./configure
which results in:
        GnuPG v2.0.26 has been configured as follows:
        Revision:  5b2dcdd  (23341)
        Platform:  Darwin (x86_64-apple-darwin13.3.0)
        OpenPGP:   yes
        S/MIME:    yes
        Agent:     yes         Smartcard: yes (without internal CCID driver)
        Gpgtar:    no
        Protect tool:      (default)
        Default agent:     (default)
        Default pinentry:  (default)
        Default scdaemon:  (default)
        Default dirmngr:   (default)
However, when I attempt to compile, I run into problems:
$ sudo make
