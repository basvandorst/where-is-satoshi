@_subject: New (key) signature import problem 
I have a bit of an embarassing problem.
I recently had a bit of a hassle with updating my key in order to
collect signatures to a version with only my new, "valid-forever" email
address. I lost a couple of signatures on the way. Now, after acquiring
this clean version, I got it exported and signed. The only problem is
that gpg --import  gives the error:
gpg: key : no valid user IDs
gpg: this may be caused by a missing self-signature
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:           w/o user IDs: 1
Now, I fear that the version I've sent for signing didn't have a
self-signature, but I'm also somewhat confused as to how it would have
worked to sign it either. The key id given in the error message is
right. Is there a way I can get around this problem? This particular
signature I'll pretty much just lose without a technical solution,
otherwise I could just ask the signer over again until we get something
working out.
The -vvv output of the import command is attached. I'm afraid I don't
really understand what it's telling me. I figure I'll ask instead of
just archiving the file away again and giving up on it.
