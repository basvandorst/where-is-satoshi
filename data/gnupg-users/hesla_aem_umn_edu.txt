I am a newbie to GnuPG, and am using gpg-agent so that I only need to enter
my passphrase once.  If I decrypt a file (which I encrypted to myself), I am
of course asked to enter my passphrase.  If I decrypt it a second time,
gpg-agent supplies my passphrase from its cache.  However, gpg2 still displays
the passphrase prompt-message in the terminal:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
$$ ll test*
-rw-rw-r-- 1 todd todd   6 2007-11-20 15:14 test
$$ cat test
$$ gpg2 -e test
$$ ll test*
-rw-rw-r-- 1 todd todd   6 2007-11-20 15:14 test
-rw-rw-r-- 1 todd todd 599 2007-11-20 16:26 test.gpg
$$ gpg2 -d test.gpg
You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: "Todd Hesla (General) "
2048-bit ELG key, ID 1C0B50A0, created 2007-11-20 (main key ID 65A3115F)
$$ - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
How can I get rid of this prompt-message?  Apparently, it is not sufficient
to just re-direct standard output and standard error to "/dev/null":
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
$$ gpg2 -d test.gpg &>/dev/null

$$ - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Any tips on how to eliminate this prompt-message (when I decrypt the file
the second time) will be very much appreciated.
Thank you.

I am running GnuPG 2.0.3 on Fedora 7.  I am using gpg-agent, and find that
even after gpg-agent has cached my passphrase, gpg2 (needlessly) issues a
passphrase prompt to the terminal when it needs to access my secret key.
(The "pinentry" dialog window, however, does not appear.)
Is there any way to eliminate this needless passphrase prompt?  I have tried
redirecting both standard output and standard error to /dev/null, but to no
In the following example, I first encrypt (to myself) and then decrypt
a test file--after gpg-agent has already cached my passphrase.
