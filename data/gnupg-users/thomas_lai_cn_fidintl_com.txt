Hello anyboby,
I am not sure if anybody can receive this email, though... just have a
I have problem when decryting files with gpg.
I have to write a bash script to decrypt files using my private key
But I cannot avoid entering passphrase manually.
Is there any way to decrypt files without entering my private key's
Thank you and Best regards,
Thomas Lai /  FIL - Dalian

Hello Vlad "SATtva" Miller,
Your answer is very helpful. The first option is ok, however about the second, I could not find the option --passphrase-file in command gpg.
The gpg version I used is gpg (GnuPG) 1.2.1.
I find another option --passphrase-fd; I found it had the similar
function as --passphrase-file.
Anyway, really appreciated for your such good and quick reply.
Thank you and Best regards,

Yes. You could remove passphrase from your private key (do --edit-key
[your_key], then passwd, and finally save). Or you could write your
passphrase in some text file and supply it to gpg with --passphrase-file
parameter. Both options could be just fine or quite dangerous depending
on your security considerations and actual environment, I'll leave that
part alone.
