An OpenPGP card with something like a Gemalto SIM usb adapter would seem to fit the bill.

Hash: SHA256
I agree that just printing the fingerprint and a link on a business
card should be enough. Another online printer is moo.com

Correct me if I'm wrong but I understand that 2.1 is planned for the
end of summer, and that currently there is a wait for all the haggling
and standardisation work around ECC (see  mailing
list), which is close to done, but there's still debate about point
compression format. The time frame also coincides with the last
(possibly relevant / possibly FUD) ECC patents expiring.

While what you say is true, what you can do is create a key that has an
equal keyID to your previous one. See this page for some more details:
or just Google for something like "keyid collision gpg".

Of course in the best of worlds it shouldn't be used anymore. But if
everyone started signing their emails with SHA1 I couldn't be more
pleased, because then you at least have the infrastructure in place, and
can upgrade people later. The major problem we're facing is that we
can't even get most people to use MD5 or DES. Heck, they don't even know
who or what they are, and to be frank they shouldn't have to.

Sound like a good plan. My preference would be the 1st of February
around lunch.

My personal pet-problem is the usability of tools like GPG.
