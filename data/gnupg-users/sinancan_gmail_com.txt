@_subject: differenece between gpg -s and gpg -se 
-s sign
-se = -s -e = sign & encrypt
-s is not encrypting. You either make a detached signature or produce a file which contains both the original data and the signature, which is the compressed file you mentioned.
The alternatives are either a detached signature or the compressed file. I cannot think of another alternative. Why don't you want a detached signature?
