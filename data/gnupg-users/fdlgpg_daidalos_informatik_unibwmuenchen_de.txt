I assume you have a download-Problem (i.e. ascii vs. binary)
I get the following:
 md5sum gnupg-1.0.4.tar.gz

Trying to verify gives:

Could not find a valid trust path to the key.  Let's see whether we
can assign some missing owner trust values.
No path leading to one of our keys found.

@_subject: problem with mutt and gnupg 
I got a pgpewrap script with mutt 1.2.5i The script is as follows:
--- cut ---
 --
die() {
        echo "Command line usage: $0 [flags] -- prefix [recipients]"
        exit 1
while test $# -gt 0 && shift && test -n "$1" ; do
        if test "$1" = "--" ; then
                shift || die
                pfx="$1"
                shift || die
        fi
        cmd="$cmd $pfx $1"
exec $cmd
--- cut ---

@_subject: How to use "--print-md *" 
I assume that you have to escape the * from the expansions performed
by your shell, e.g. put it like
gpg --print-md "*" Filename
For me that works fine and I get
Filename:    MD5 = B7 EB 1C 8B 30 81 8C BD  0F D9 98 28 13 B6 A9 A2
Filename:   SHA1 = E15F 068F 105D 9E0B 6700  C71E 5F21 4E47 B6D7 C164
Filename: RMD160 = 5B5D DBF5 7420 6D06 D429  BAEC EF77 4969 9BC7 97FC

But hopefully _you_ can you tell us, which OS etc. you are
using. Without some more details nobody will be able to help you.
