@_subject: gnupg 2.1.16: change of option --with-fingerprint 
Hello all,
did the function of the option --with-fingerprint change in gnupg 2.1.16 and later?
When I tried to import a CentOS gpg key according to the manual from [1], I made the following observation:
"gpg --quiet --with-fingerprint " does not return the fingerprint when using gnupg 2.1.17 (on ArchLinux and openSuse Tumbleweed).
Also a self-compiled gnupg 2.1.16 does not return the fingerprint in this scenario, whereas a self compiled gnupg 2.1.15 does so.
gnupg 2.1.13 on Fedora also returns the fingerprint.
For the tests I used the key from [2] which I downloaded according to [1] with wget.
Many thanks in advance.
[1]  [2] Arch Linux gnupg 2.1.17
