The CD solution is hard to improve.  You could store a modified GnuPG
binary on it, obfuscate the file names, apply some heuristics to check
for system integrity, check if the binary is running under a debugger,
and so on.  Of course, this is just an attempt to achieve security by
obscurity which doesn't work in general.

processing is possible, but you won't get this with your approach
X.509 does not support arbitrary graphs, only forests consisting of a
limited number of trees, so a conversion loses information.
On the other hand, I have quite a lot of doubts regarding some X.509
implementations (for instance, at least one grants *all*
rights/applications to a certificate if it doesn't limit its rights
itself; this can hardly be considered security practice).  I wouldn't
want to work on my private key material with most of them.

This is not sufficient, even if you only consider syntax (have a look

The time spent in symmetric encryption grows with the length of the
encrypted data, while the time required for public key cryptography is
constant.  Depending on the scope of optimization (i.e. if it's not
for key setup only), it might still be a considerable win for some

PGP 2.6.3
   Vendor: Phil's Pretty Good Software
PGP 2.6.3 is the last of the old PGP 2 versions released
by Phil Zimmerman in cooperation with MIT.
It is mostly incompatible with OpenPGP.
PGP 2.6.3in
   Vendor: Phil's Pretty Good Software, Schumacher, Donnerhacke et al.
This version is derived from PGP 2.6.3.  It was modified by
Staale Schumacher to create the international version (hence the "i"),
and further modifications were made by Lutz Donnerhacke.
This version is mostly incompatible with OpenPGP.
PGP 5.x
   Vendor: Network Associates, Inc.
The first PGP version released by Network Associates, Inc.,
includes beginning support for the OpenPGP format.
PGP 6.x
   Vendor: Network Associates, Inc.
Includes more comprehensive support for the OpenPGP format.
This is the last version of NAI PGP for which source code is available.
PGP 7.x
   Vendor: Network Associates, Inc.
Comprehensive support for the OpenPGP standard.  NAI no longer
releases the source code of the complete PGP application, only
the implementation of the algorithms related to cryptography
is revealed.
V4 key expiration
Multiple signatures on the same document are not correctly verified
and can lead to false positives.
Detached signature
Klima and Rosa describe an attack on the storage format
for secret DSA keys.  This attack is dangerous only if the
secret key is stored on a medium which is not trustworthy.
Klima/Rosa RSA
The Additional Decryption Key (which is used for corporate or governmental
message recovery) attribute of a public key is recognized even if it is not
covered by a self signature.
Entropy gathering
The MPI syntax specification in OpenPGP excludes leading zero octets,
but these can occur nevertheless in V3 secret keys.  Some implementations
cannot import such keys.  (This is not a security problem, but a
reliability problem.)
File name format string
Signatures on V3 keys marked non-exportable are not properly
generated so that they are exportable nevertheless.
Primary User ID
This is the same defect as above, but wrong user ID is transmitted
over a channel intended for automatic processing by other programs.

I don't understand DSA at all, but IIRC somebody suggested a modified
attack which is not caught by the signature computation check.
[Expiration problems]
Yes, there is some disagreement. ;-)
Oops, I wanted to write: "ultimately trusted keys".  Thanks.
Yes and no, the list covers both security defects and defects related
to misleading wording in the OpenPGP specification.  (This was not
clear from the context, and I should have chosen another headline for
the this section, sorry.)
V3 signatures on V3 keys can never be non-exportable, and GnuPG used
to use them even if the user requested a local signature.
No need to hack GnuPG, you can do this with GNU Emacs. ;-)
With the current development version, you can even strip the local
flag without invalidating the signature.

The patent is some kind of business method patent, so it cannot be

I'm unable to find it right now.  There are quite a few US and
Japanese patents on a split registration/certification process, but I
didn't find the patent I was looking for.  (There might exist prior
art for the more complicated protocols, however.  Unfortunately,
Sebastian Korff's diploma thesis at the University of Stuttgart was a
bit too late, at least I think so. :-/)
However, someone should look at US Patent 6,134,550.  GnuPG's new
trust database might infringe on it.

[LDAP key servers] The complexity of typical LDAP client libraries suggests that you
shouldn't link them with cryptographic applications such as GnuPG.
In addition, there doesn't seem to be any consensus on storing keys in
directories.  I think PGP uses a fixed path for LDAP queries which
excludes any meaningful applications.
A web browser, suitable MIME types, and a small helper program can
achieve much the same, with even greater flexibility.
Don't get me wrong: Storing keys in directories makes sense, but after
the LDAP assault on DAP, directories have lost quite a bit of their

* Ben Branders:
You don't sign such things.  It's a simple matter of policy.  You only
mark keys as trusted if you the key holder follows the same policy.
It doesn't.  OpenPGP only specifies a transport format, and hardly any
semantics.  Implementations enforce some semantics (and sometimes,
they disagree), others a matter of the policy the users choose to
follow.  This is both the strength and weakness of OpenPGP, compared
to X.509.

For most applications, this is just a speed bump because the search

you have to apply some data reduction first (think SOUNDEX): a lot of
