@_subject: ^M characters are embedded at the end of every record. 
Hi All,
I created a text file in Windows environment.  Then it is encrypted and =
FTPed to a Unix server where the file is decrypted.  After decryption, I =
am seeing ^M characters at the end of each record.  I have tried sending =
the file in both ASCII and BINARY modes.  Both modes don't help.  =
However, if I send the plain text file via FTP in ASCII mode, the file =
does not contain and control characters.  Is there a way to decrypt the =
file into an output file without ^M character or is there a way to =
encrypt the file without ^M?
Thanks in advance.

Thank Julian.  I tried using McAfee's PGP software to encrypt the file =
and was decrypted on the Unix server without any control characters.  I =
thought there might be a flag that I was overlooking in GPG.  I was =
hoping to avoid using Unix utilities to strip the control characters.  =
To accomplish this using McAfee's PGP is:
pgp --encrypt --user 0xDA17BB2F --text --armor --output BHS.txt.pgp =
How would I issue the --text and --armor flags in GPG?

This is nothing to do with GPG; Windows (and DOS systems generally) use
CRLF to mark end of line, whereas Unix system uses LF only.  The ^M
characters you see on the Unix machine are the 'spare' CR characters =
Windows introduces.
FTP's ascii mode deals with the translation from one format to the other
automatically, but clearly can't do this for an encrypted file.  The
easiest thing to do is to strip the spurious carriage-returns on the =
machine post-decryption. ( tr -d '\r' < file > cleanfile )

Hi All,
I have found the answer to my own problem.
gpg --encrypt -r DA17BB2F --textmode --armor --output C:\BHS\BHS.txt.pgp =
Thanks everyone for your input.

This is not a GnuPG issue. All files created on notepad or some
microsoft editor are full of ^M. Microsoft it says. The best you could
do it not use windows but if you're addicted to this thing you could
always use an other editor.

@_subject: Flag to pass the passphrase dynamically while decrypting... 
Does anyone know how I can go about decrypting a file dynamically =
without getting prompted for a passphrase?  Under the licensed version =
of PGP, you are able to accomplish this by issuing a command like the =
pgp --decrypt --passphrase "xoxoxoxoxoxo" --output $file.txt =
$file.txt.pgp --overwrite
I was unable to find the flag --passphrase in "gpg --help".

Please wrap your lines at 72-or-so characters!
Look for it in the man page.
You will find --passphrase-fd.
