Hash: SHA1
Greetings All:
Back in June I asked about a pop up dialog box [that said: gpg: NOTE:
old default options file '/Users/michaels/.gnupg/options'] that would
appear when attempting to decrypt a friend's [he uses PGP 8.0] message.
Thanks to all for the replies and explanation on what the dialog box
message meant.
However I'm still baffled why I can't decrypt my friend's message.  When
I try I get the pop up box, click to acknowledge the box and then
nothing; back to square one.
If I sign and encrypt a message to myself, all is well, not even the pop
up box appears.
Would one of you folks be kind enough to send me an encrypted message so
that I can help troubleshoot the problem I'm having?  I need to verify
that all is well on my end.   At this point I'm not sure if I'm having
the problem for not decrypting, or is the root cause with PGP 8?  I
Here is my public key:

I recently installed GnuGP on my PowerBook G4.  The app seems to work
fine.  I can encrypt/decrypt locally with no issues.
However a friend recently started using PGP 8 and sent me an encrypted
message with my public key.  When I went to decrypt it I got this text
in a pop up dialog box:
gpg: NOTE: old default options file '/Users/michaels/.gnupg/options'
Can someone tell me what this means?
