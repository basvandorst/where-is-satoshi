Having trouble compiling Gnupg on my brandnew SuSE7.0 system.
In file included from /usr/include/errno.h:36,
                 from dcgettext.c:41:
In file included from /usr/include/bits/posix1_lim.h:126,
                 from /usr/include/limits.h:30,
                 from                  from                  from                  from dcgettext.c:117:
make[2]: *** [dcgettext.o] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/klaus/downloads/test/gnupg-1.0.4/intl'
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/klaus/downloads/test/gnupg-1.0.4'
make: *** [all-recursive-am] Error 2
Something is missing or missplaced on my system I guess? Actually, I didn't compile anything n this new system yet. Any help will be appreciated!
Please cc me!
