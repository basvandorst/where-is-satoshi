I have uploaded my key to a keyserver at pgp.com: upload a key to their
keyserver requires a verification by e-mail. Every id (e-mailaddress) in
your key receives an e-mail. Respond to one of those e-mails (clicking
link) to verify you issued the key replacement. But when (one of) your
e-mail account(s) has been compromised, it could still happen.
