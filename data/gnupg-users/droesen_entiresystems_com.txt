Please fix your (non-existant) line-wrapping. Max. 70 chars per line.
It's Outlook's dumb interpretation of a correct PGP/MIME standards-
compliant PGP signed/encrypted mail. They STILL don't support that.

@_subject: Changing primary user ID? 
Yep, this is also what I was looking for several weeks ago when I
added a new user ID to my key. I know PGP 6.5.1i for Windows is
capable of marking an user ID as "primary". And that what I was
looking for in GnuPG - with no success.

@_subject: Howto distribute key signatures 
They just upload their signed version of your public key to one of
the public keyservers. The keyserver merges their signatures into
the key already being on the keyserver (if it was there already -
otherwise the pubkey would be created on the keyserver) and you can
fetch your pubkey from the keyserver network to merge their
signatures in your local copy of your pubkey.
There's no need to send the pubkey encrypted. And yes, he must have
done s.th. wrong if the pubkey he sent you didn't contain any sigs
from him.
