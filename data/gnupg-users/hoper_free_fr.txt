@_subject: Help me to import my secret key please 
Hi everybody.
After a install "from scratch" of my computer (ubuntu 10.04), I try to
import my previous secret key.
Don't ask me why, but I did'nt save the .gnupg directory.
Instead, I have a .p12 file with the secret key inside.
After lots of try and read on the net, (thanks google) I manage
to import this file with gpgsm :
$ gpgsm -K
gpgsm[5195]: can't connect to `/home/hoper/.gnupg/S.gpg-agent': Aucun
fichier ou dossier de ce type
pub   1024D/1F03B55A 2009-06-09
uid                  hoper sub   4096g/F7C66E72 2009-06-09
My only problem is with the secret part. (my secring.gpg file is still
empty). Any help will be really appreciated...
(and for people who can speak french, you can answer me here:
 )
Thanks !

Bad news yes. But well, nobody's dead.
It's even quite funny in fact, thinking about how often I repeat to
everybody that they need to make backup of everything.
This key is the only thing I loose, I will juste made another one.
And no, I don't have the revocation certificate :( But I think it's not too bad, because nobody had access to this private
key. I just loose it...
Small and last question, If I make a new key, with the same email
inside, will I be able to send it on servers ? (because they already got
the old one...)
Thanks a lot for your time.
