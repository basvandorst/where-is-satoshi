@_subject: How to handle multipart messages (RFC 2440) and verify them with 
I am currently writing some kind of parser which extracts and attemps
to verify email messages signed / encrypted with GnuPG. Simple messages with just a plain/text body surrounded by a PGP
signature work quite good. I now have got a more complex mail. Please see
here: I played around but I cannot extract the neccessary mime parts for
verifying them with GnuPG. I always get "gpg: BAD signature from ..."
I played around with the message but I did not yet figured it out
which parts of the message are relevant for GnuPG (read: which parts
are covered by the GnuPG signature).
I would really appriciate any help :) I already spent 2 days with this
:-/ (RFC 1847, 2015, 2440 and 3156 do not have such an example..)

Thank your for the example. I tried it but it does not work :-/
(I might remember that I already tried this because of an idea in the
RFCs mentioned above).
Here are the 2 files with which I play around:
Command line for testing:
gpg --verify D:\test.sig D:\test.eml
(I always get: "gpg: BAD signature from ..")
I will look at it.
Thank you anyway :)

@_subject: Saving photo of a key to a given filename 
I am using GnuPG on a Win32 box and I have written a small keyring
manager in Delphi. I thought a good idea would be, to display the photo
associated with a KeyId if it exist. Here is my problem: how can I get the photo-data from GnuPG via
batchmode using plain Windows utilities?
Best regards,

Does work from the command line but not from within my Delphi App. It
seems that "cmd" is not called at all - maybe because GPG is called
from within a temporary batchfile which is executed through
"CreateProcess"... Is there no easy way to get the jpeg w/o using tempfiles etc..? (Like I
can parse the --list-keys output etc...)
Best regards,
