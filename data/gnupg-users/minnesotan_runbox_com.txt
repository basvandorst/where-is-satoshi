Hello Jason,
I wish all pgp keys could automatically be purged from keyservers
on the anniversary of their creation. Then, key owners would know
that obsolete keys will eventually disappear, and know when their
actively searched-for keys (fresh keys as well as freshly-revoked
keys) need to be uploaded again--always just after the
anniversary of their creation. That way, key uploads get spread
throughout the whole year. Wouldn't that be a good thing?

via private email:
Could some keys be flagged, to not to be deleted ever? Keep a
list of such keys for your keyserver (that would propagate with
synchronization)? Why not?
0x614239DC 9/7/2000 [expired: 1/1/2001)] PGP Security Software
Release Key 2000

I think so.
Or, maybe, have two kinds of keyservers--expiring database
keyservers and non-expiring database keyservers?
PGP Global Directory could be that, except that they limit keys
to one key per email address.
Isn't that something to be aware of in any case?
I think it's the responsibility of the person who revoked it to
to keep the revocations out there. Once nobody has searched for a
key in five years, however, why have it in the database, revoked
or not?
Fine. I'm not opposed to having both types of keyserver. Also,
since anybody can upload the keys. If your key is signed by
twenty keys, then you could keep those keys in circulation along
with your own if you notice that too many of the signatures on
your key are listed as "unknown."
Just an idea. But, if PGP ever gains wide use--to the point where
200 million internet users know what it is and how to use
it--then something will need to be done to prune back all the
dead keys, I would think.

I think that's a great idea. I assume there would be a web
interface, as well. What about a search option for the web interface
that excludes any expired keys? by means of a check-box, like the
check-box for "verbose" on some web keyservers. Maybe that's harder
than it sounds, but I'd like that. :-)
