@_subject: Import PGP Secret Keys 
I need to import public and private keys created by PGP 8.0.  GnuPG allows
me to import the PGP keys, but it imports all of them as public keys.  I
tried to run > gpg --import --allow-secret-key-import "  ", but it
still imported the PGP private key as a public key in GnuPG.  Am I missing
something here?  Ultimately, I need to be able to read files encrypted by
PGP without having to generate new keys to do so.  I must use the existing
keys.  At some point, I will need to also encrypt files using these same
keys.  Thanks in advance for the help.

Thanks for the help guys.  I verified with my client and they did not export
the key correctly from PGP.  All is well now.
