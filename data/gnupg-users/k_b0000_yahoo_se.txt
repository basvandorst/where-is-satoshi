@_subject: key question: GNUGP -> PGP -> GNUPG 
in the FAQ there are instructions how to use
gpg --simple-sk-checksum --edit (yourkeyid)
and then changing password if one intend to use a key
created by GPG in PGP.
however after doing this and exporting the key one
would like to reset the key used with GPG to be able
to use the non-simple checksum, how is this made?

@_subject: list signatures on server 
how can i list all signatures that are on the
keyserver for a specifik key?
this would be good to confirm that an updated
signature really got uploaded, or when looking at a
persons key without importing it.
i tried things like:
gpg --keyserver wwwkeys.ch.pgp.net --search-keys some
user --list-sig

@_subject: list signatures on server 
is it possible by any switch in gpg?
something like (or shorter):
gpg --list-sig-for-key-on-server keyID --keyserver

hmm, now when i check i found what i needed in the
man, RTFM to me.
however, the --help does not contain for example
it would also bee convinient if the man pages containd
a list of say 2-5 keyserver per continent.

anytime when you developers begin to implement this
(if at all) then here is how i would like tu have it.
keys that signed a persons key should be displayd when
searching on a keyserver, using option to obtain this
is fair.
when importing from server
--recv-keys should work as today, plus it should do by default or ask to at the same time
import keys that signed this key.
a new option
--recv-sig-keys-for-key keyID
that could be used for keys that one already have.
a neet feature would then be a slight change of the
--list-keys option (or a new option called something
like --list-first-line-keys).
my suggestion is that --list-keys should only display
keys that were imported in the first line, keys
imported only to check signaure (second line) should
not show up unless i choose to import them to the
first line.
for example, in my key ring i have 2 keys, signed by
myself and a freind. now i import a key that has 100
signatures, i import it with all of the 100
signatures. however the 100 signatures are not
especially interesting when using gpg on a daily
insted whats interesting is to display the 3 keys, and
then if i request display all.
