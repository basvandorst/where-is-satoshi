@_subject: How to share my private key with others? 
Hi there,
I am using your software (Gpg4win, GPA) to encrypt and decrypt files. It really helps me a lot. However, I encounter a problem. I wanna share my private key with my team members so that they could decrypt files which are encrypted with my public key. Could you please let me know how to do that? Your prompt reply would be highly appreicated! Thanks a lot.
