My apologies to the group.  I meant to say	
I have a customer who can not accept our pgp public key.  They are
asking for a specific cipher to be used in generating the public key.
After some reading yesterday, it seemed that gpg might be the solution. I don't have any experience with gpg, and limited pgp experience.  Cathy L. Smith

Is there a brief explanation available as to how the cipher is used in
generating the private/public keys?  It seems this is separate from the
cipher that is chosen to encrypt my data.

It's hard to talk about how good it is.  Cryptography is an intensively
mathematical discipline, and most people are not very well-equipped to
discuss those details.
Ultimately, it would be like arguing whether King Kong or Godzilla is
better at urban destruction.  Biologists can argue until the cows come
home which one would be better and why, but from the perspective of your
average inhabitant of Tokyo or New York City the answer is, "Who cares?
 Get out of town _right now_!"
CAST5-128 does the job just fine.  The only instances I'm aware of in
which CAST5-128 doesn't do the job well are ones where bureaucratic
rules require specific algorithms, and CAST5-128 isn't on that
checklist.  That's a bureaucratic failing, though, not a failing of

The customer stated that he can accept a public key generated with
either Blowfish or Triple-DES.  I wasn't sure what he needed because all
I've dealt with in generating a key pair before is selecting the DSA or
RSA option.  Our PGP version doesn't offer the DSA and Elgamal option. I've sent him a GnuPG-generated key, and asked him to find out if they
are using GnuPG.  I haven't heard from him today.  Cathy L. Smith

rjh at chronicles:~$ gpg --enable-dsa2 --gen-key Please select what kind of
key you want:
   (1) DSA and Elgamal (default)
   (2) DSA (sign only)
   (5) RSA (sign only)
If you choose  you will be using, by default, DSA as a signature
algorithm, AES256 as a general-purpose message encryption algorithm,
Elgamal as an asymmetric encryption algorithm, and SHA1 as a hash
None of these algorithms are actually used to generate the
private/public keys, though.  The private and public keys are just
numbers.  GnuPG generates those numbers from a cryptographically secure
pseudorandom number generator, then subjects the numbers to a battery of
mathematical tests to make sure the keys are safe to use.
Is it possible for you to tell us what algorithms your correspondent
expects you to use?  Knowing that might help us out quite a bit.

I agree that with the lack of understanding.  It's been difficult to get
specific information from the customer.  I don't have the option of
saying it's their problem.  The GnuPG was a guess after I read something
about specifying the cipher algorithm.  The customer said they have a proprietary implementation that only
supports Blowfish or 3DES for the key.  I'm still trying to find out
exactly what that means.  I've talked to the folks here at work who
understand these things better than I, and all have shook their head.  I appreciate your assistance.

It probably does, actually; PGP just, for marketing reasons, calls it

That said, your customer does not appear to understand how GnuPG or PGP
work.  _All_ OpenPGP-conformant applications (GnuPG, PGP, and others)
can handle 3DES; and 3DES has absolutely nothing to do with how you
generate your public key.

Okay, that much makes sense now.
I would suggest adding:
cipher-algo 3DES
... to your .gnupg/gpg.conf file.  This is a sledgehammer solution, and
not one I'd generally recommend; however, the downsides are pretty
minimal.  Then encrypt a message using their public key and send it on
to them.  If they can read it, great.  If they can't, then the problem
is their proprietary implementation of OpenPGP is shoddy.
Incidentally, if your customer is a telecommunications firm, I think I
may know the implementation they're using and some of its more egregious
misfeatures.  Other than that one and PGP Corporation's offering,
though, I have no experience with proprietary OpenPGP offerings.

The gpg --import option worked without any problems for importing the OpenPGP public keyring.  When I try to import the secret keyring, I get the following message:
[app1 ~/.gnupg]$ gpg --import secring.skr
gpg: key B4A839CC: secret key imported
gpg: key B4A8899S: "ofc" not changed
gpg: key 96B12847: secret key imported

gpg: WARNING: key 96B12847 contains preferences for unavailable
gpg:          algorithms on these user IDs:
gpg:          "pss": preference for cipher algorithm 1
gpg: it is strongly suggested that you update your preferences and
gpg: re-distribute this key to avoid potential algorithm mismatch problems
Set preference list to:
     Cipher: AES256, AES192, AES, CAST5, 3DES
     Digest: SHA1, SHA256, RIPEMD160
     Compression: ZLIB, BZIP2, ZIP, Uncompressed
     Features: MDC, Keyserver no-modify
Really update the preferences? (y/N)
If I answer "no", the import finishes with the message:
Key not changed so no update needed.
gpg: Total number processed: 7
gpg:           w/o user IDs: 1
gpg:              unchanged: 6
gpg:       secret keys read: 7
gpg:   secret keys imported: 7
When I created my gpg keyring, I selected the default for the key, DSA and Elgamml, and a 2048 bit keysize.  What are the ramifications of just saying "yes" to the prompt - update preferences?  How potentially serious is the algorithm mismatch?  I'd like to better understand exactly what is happening.
Just for background, this is migration has to go into production in a very short time.  Redistributing keys to the various vendors, and to test the batch jobs using these keys to exchange files with vendors, wasn't included when planning.  So I'm under a short deadline.

Hello Smith, !
    I would try
gpg pubring.pgp
    as GPG assumes usually the most relevant action.
    Adding
keyring pubring.pgp
    in gpg.conf adds current file to list of keyrings.
    And
gpg --import pubring.pgp
    should import the whole keyring too.

This may related to my earlier question about signing the imported PGP public keys.  When I run gpg --list-sig, the imported public keys show that they are signed.  However, when I run a test to encrypt a file with a key, I get the following message:
[ir at hrapp1 /tmp]$ gpg -e -r 0xEC3A911C gpg-test

It is NOT certain that the key belongs to the person named

you may answer the next question with yes.
Use this key anyway? (y/N) y
I've tried using the --yes option without success to suppress this interactive prompt doesn't pop up.  This encryption does need to run in a batch job.  What do I need to do in order all interactive prompts are surpressed, and that the assumption is they are answered "yes".
I may not understand signing a key properly.  It did occur to me as I wrote this email and my earlier posting tonight that I may need to generate a new signature key and re-sign the keys in GPG.  I haven't had a chance to try that tonight.
Here is the output of the gpg --list-sig:

Hi Tiago
I just purchased OpenPGP cards and Gemalto USB Shell Token V2 readers (see ).  They work perfectly for me.
I'll explain what I use to access them. Maybe you can adapt it to your own use.
1) Start the pcscd service on your distro. This is a daemon that is distributed in the PCSC-Lite package.  On Fedora, as root you can run:
service pcscd start && chkconfig pcscd on
2) Add the "disable-ccid" option to gpg.conf. This will make GnuPG use PCSC-Lite to access the card, instead of the built-in CCID driver.
This in itself should be enough to get the card working properly. You can do gpg --card-status to see the card, gpg --card-edit to edit the card.
I have all this working on my stock Fedora 13 install with the following versions of packages:
To configure other things such as SSH authentication keys, etc., you will have to configure gpg-agent to start during desktop session startup, make environment variables available to the shell (man gpg-agent), and also perhaps disable some things if you are using GNOME.
Good luck.
