Hi Martin!
You can update a key by reuploading it to the server. The server
will then merge your new upload into its keyring.

I know that gpg 1.4 (and probably also 1.2 as well, tho I don't have any

Also note that for forward anonymous traffic you probably shouldn't use

How would I try to retrieve the key for peter from DNS[1]
using GnuPG's command line, other than simulating an encryption (like in
gpg --auto-key-locate cert --recipient peter --encrypt)
to the user in question?
Also, is there a tool that produces a snippet which is ready for
inclusion into a zone file anywhere?  Something similar to ssh-keygen
for SSHFP RRs:
  weasel ssh-keygen -r galaxy -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key -g
  galaxy IN TYPE44 \# 22 01 01 40cc5559546421d15fe9c1064713636a02373ad2

If you run sarge on the servers my package might be of use.  You'll have
to build it yourself from source.  Checkout the tree using
svn co and then dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc -us it after installing the
build dependencies.  The package is not really of the quality I'ld like
it to be, but it's not all that bad either.

I am not aware of anything in the Free Software world that uses it yet,

As far as I know (and that's all second hand, so don't blame me if it
isn't correct), all versions PGP Universal, Satellite and Desktop 9.x
should do it as long as they're not using MAPI.  Oh, and PGP on the
Blackberry doesn't either.

@_subject: Delete uid from keyserver 
You can revoke uids (gpg --edit, then select the uid with its number,
then revuid).  This won't make them disappear from the keyservers, but
it will mark the UID as no longer being a valid UID for that key in
GnuPG and other OpenPGP implementations.
As you might have noticed, you cannot remove uids, or anything for that
matter, from keyservers.

@_subject: Printing Keys and using OCR (was: Proofreadable base64) 
This must be a zombie by now :)
Nice idea.  When trying to find decent backup methods for my new Tor
identity key I cam accross this thread.
I played all day with ocr and friends.  In the course I wrote a small
script that does what you suggest.  I tried to keep it small enough to
print it along with whatever data you have - I clearly failed there.
But other than that it works nicely.
I used the OCR-A font available from a CTAN[0] mirror near you to print the
output of my script.
Then I used gocr[1][2] (0.41-1 as shipped in debian etch) to turn a scan back
into data.  That didn't work out so well at first - gocr had real
trouble distinguishing zeroes and the letter D like Delta.  Fortunately
gocr has an option to disable its internal recognition engine and
instead use a mode whereby it asks you about characters it doesn't
recognize - initially that's all of them - and writes that to a
database.  In the end it asked me for about 300 chars out of 8000 - most
of them at the beginning of the text - but produced the original text
with only a few mishaps, which were caught easily using the encoding
described above.
[maybe I should also try a more recent version of gocr]
If anybody wants to play with this, I uploaded my two scans to
To use gocr with the database learning and its internal recognition
engine turned off simply
  mkdir db; gocr -m 256 -m 130 -i 1.ppm -o 1.txt
I guess playing with encodings other than base64 might be the next step.
There was a strong point made for simply using base16, maybe with
different characters that play nicely with gocr using OCR-A.
Optar[2] is another nice tool which I tried today.  While it does not
provide the "fallback to typing it all in" option it shows promise.
Using the default values I still had several bitflips after scanning in
the printout tho.  Future tests will probably include changing optar's
paramters to larger dots (I don't need 200kb per page), and maybe
preprocessing the data with par2.
