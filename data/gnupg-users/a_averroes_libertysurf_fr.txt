New in GnuPG,
Is It possible to create a RSA private key with GnuPG?

@_subject: Memory Pbm 
Hi All,
New in GnuPG,
When I started my GnuPG, I have got the following
message, does anyone experienced the same odd thing?
othello:~$ gpg
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
gpg: /home/amr/.gnupg: directory created
gpg: /home/amr/.gnupg/options: new options file created
gpg: you have to start GnuPG again, so it can read the new options file
The Warning: "using insecure memory", seems to me worrying...!!!
Any comments, suggestions, etc. are welcome.
Thank you>

@_subject: Split private Key 
Hi All,
This is a repost, well perhaps not
published by the moderator. I don't know why!
Security Question with the Root-CA (possibly Sub-CA Key) private key:
To prevent someone to sign illegimate CSRs, I would like to cut or split
the Private Key of Root-CA in two, three or more parts.
These parts will be distributed to trusted persons (or machines).
So, for the signing process each parts need to be concatened to
rebuild the entire Private Key (e.g. once a day) assuring that
trusted persons (or machines) agree with.
Any ideas for splitting and rebuilding Private key
(be sure, with no damages) will be appreciated!
With Gnu Tools...
