@_subject: comment and version fields. 
The "comment" and "version" armor fields are both essentially
comments, and are ignored by the OpenPGP protocol. You can change
either of them to whatever you like.
Thanks for your reply, David. I apologise for not responding sooner but I've been awaiting the list digest which came a week later! I understand your point as to the protocol ignoring changes to these fields. I suppose its futile to try to change a standard but it seems that it might be very damaging indeed to have a signed message altered after signing. That seems to defeat the reason for signing as the common person would assume that a signed message is protected entirely against unauthorised changes.

This is a good point I hadn't even considered. I only thought about the opportunity for an attacker to insert whatever text he chose to make it look like it came from the sender.
For example
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
To Her Majesty The Queen,
Thanks very much indeed for the lovely dinner you made for our staff. It was vital that we were able to
receive assistance on (insert matter of diplomatic importance)
Your Obedient Servant,
The Prime Minister

I think it's a bit worse on a clearsigned document such as your post for example.
BTW There wasn't any need for name calling!
p.s. of course I've altered his clearsigned post in this example. But it would still verify properly. This is my point.

No, you're misunderstanding me. I'm not concerned with the technical user who posts a question to a news list and understands the issue. I'm wondering about the non-technical (business) user who gets a plug-in for his email client and then misinterprets a modified signature block that someone tampered with.

@_subject: no, it's not an email client problem, it's what I said at the start 
It's either a GnuPG problem or an RFC problem. It's possible to add or remove or modify text in a clearsigned message. If that's what the RFC allows, then the RFC is broken. If the RFC doesn't allow it then GnuPG is broken.
Why all the excuses and flaring tempers...have I insulted anyone?
This kind of sloppy exposure is out of place in the product/RFC. Making excuses or trying to explain around it or blame it on email clients is silly and not fooling anyone.
Thanks to Werner and everyone else who works on GnuPG.
Cheers to all,

@_subject: Signature version line not protected against alteration 
Greetings all,
I came upon something a bit odd in gnupg 1.4.7. I found I can change the comment field in a signed message to be whatever I like. I should think this is a bad thing as an attacker could insert text in a message presumably protected against all modifications if the signature verifies properly.
I'm hoping the attachments won't be corrupted by my emailer. The first attachment is the clearsigned message. I altered the comment field manually after creating the .asc. The second attachment is the public key so you can verify that the clearsigned message is valid.
Thanks loads to everyone whos worked on gnupg. It's a brilliant app and an important one at that.
