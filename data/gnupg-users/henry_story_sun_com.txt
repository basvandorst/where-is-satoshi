@_subject: RDFAuth: a sketch of a simple authentication protol 
Dear GNU-PG users and experts,
build on GPG web of trust concepts by combining these with the linked  data network [1] effect of the semantic web, and simple REST  architecture concepts. Here is the introduction
Here is a proposal for an authentication scheme that is even simpler  than OpenId, more secure, more RESTful, with fewer points of failure  and fewer points of control, that is needed in order to make Open  Distributed Social Networks with privacy controls possible.
I am not a cryptography expert, but I make essential use of PGP in  this sketch, so I was looking for feedback from this community, as  well as REST and HTTP experts. I know there is something really  powerful lying here to be discovered.
Please give us feedback and ideas for improvements. Or just let us  know that we are wrong. Any feedback is welcome :-)
