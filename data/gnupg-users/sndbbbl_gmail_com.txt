@_subject: Open Password Protected ZIP File 
Does anybody know how to open a ZIP file, password protected? I forgot the password.
Google brings me to various password attack tools - any recommendation?

@_subject: MacGPG does not ask for Password 
When I encrypt or decrypt a file on my MacOS 10.7 with MacGPG, my system does not ask me for my keys password - in either case.
Can someone tell me where I can change the settings and have the system ask for a password EACH TIME? I already checked in Keychain Access, but could not find the relevant input..
