@_subject: Protecting signing key 
I plan to make myself a signing key and keep it
offline and as securely as possible. How do you guys
keep your signing key secure?
- Do you put it on a USB stick and encrypt the file
- Do you use Knoppix MIB
- Any other form of bootable USB based Linux system
that can support encrypted file systems, encrypted
swap etc.?

How would this work out for people who do not have
control over the DNS record of domains? Best examples
are free email services like hotmail and gmail?
