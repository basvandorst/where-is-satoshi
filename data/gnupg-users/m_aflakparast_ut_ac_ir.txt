@_subject: How to install gnupg-2.0.18 and decrypt gpg files 
Dear Madame/Sir,
I have downloaded gnupg-2.0.18 to decrypt some files formatted .gz.gpg
(e.g. 70195_B11_WTCCCT444825.CEL.gz.gpg).
I'm using a Windows 7 on  my PC.
I open CMD from start menu,
Then cd to the gnupg-2.0.18 address, then I type INSTALL but no
installation begins!
I read the readme file but again at the first step I have problem with the
command "./configure"
It is mentioned in readme file to cd to the gnupg-2.0.18 address in CMD
, but it doesn't work.
I can't figure out how to insert commands in order to install the program
and decrypt my files.
Any help will  be highly appreciated.
Best regards,
Mehran Aflakparast

============================== START ==============================
I need to decrypt .gz.gpg files (e.g. 70195_C1_WTCCCT442627.CEL.gz.gpg).
I have the encryption key(passphrase).
I used Gnp4win and ran into this error:
     "bad session key"
Then I downloaded gnupg-1.4.9 for windows from the following link:
I followed the instructions and installed.
Now, when I use the full path to the gpg program (gpg.exe)
in the command line, and enter the following command:
gpg --decrypt "myfile.gpg"
I am asked a passphrase, but the problem is that it is not possible to
write any thing in fron of the statement" Enter Passphrase:", e.i.
whatever you type, nothing appears on the screen!
I will appreciate it if you CC me your solution.
Best regards,

@_subject: Decryption error 
I already installed gpg4win-2.1.0.exe, and constructed my certification
and I got the passphrase.
Now, for decrypting "70195_B11_WTCCCT444825.CEL.gz.gpg", I opended
Kleopatra window and clicked on File option then clicked on
"Decrypte/Verify files" and then I entered my file's path then
Decrypt/Verify window is opened and I checked on the second choice "Input
file is an archive..",  after clicking on Decrypt/Verify bottom I enter
passphrase then after a couple of seconds I face an error " Decryption
I wonder how to resolve this problem.
