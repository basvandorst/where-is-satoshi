@_subject: Key Signing, Subkeys 
I'm new to GnuPG and have 2 questions regarding key signing I didn't find answers for in the documentation:
1) Somebody signs my public key, and this "new version" containing that additional signature is uploaded to a keyserver. (Am I right so far?)
How do others that already had my public key before that signature get the new version? How do they know there is a new one?
2) When I have a master key, and a subkey for everyday usage, I don't lose all the signatures on the master key if the subkey is revoked or expires, since the new subkey will be signed by the master key. This implies using only the master key for signing. Now, if someone signs my master key, how will this be reflected on the subkey? Do I have to generate a new subkey every time someone signs my master key in order that the new signature affects the Thanks a lot, georg
