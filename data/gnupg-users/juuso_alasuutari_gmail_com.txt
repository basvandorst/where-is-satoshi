@_subject: GPGME: checking message recipient 
When decrypting a PGP message using the GPGME library, is it possible to see in advance who the recipient is? I've studied the documentation, but the best I've come up with is to parse the key ID from the hint and info strings in the passphrase callback function. Is there another way to accomplish this?
Best regards,
