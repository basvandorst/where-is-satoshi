@_subject: Inability to export and then import my secret key 
I am using Gpg4Win and Enigmail in Thunderbird. I have been a user of
Enigmail for years without difficulty. Today I tried to load a new
computer and tried to export my secret key from my old machine to the
new one. The system tells me
Importing the keys failed
gpg: key 1C0B95E5: "J. Bryant Evans " not
changed gpg: key 1C0B95E5: "J. Bryant Evans
" not changed gpg: key 1C0B95E5/1C0B95E5:
error sending to agent: End of file gpg: Total number processed: 3 gpg:              unchanged: 2 gpg:       secret keys read: 2
The result is that I can neither sign nor decrypt using my secret key. I can verify signatures from other people. The system at home, on which I am now writing this message, works fine.
I appear to be running 2.0.19 and GPG4WIN 2.1.1
Your thoughts and suggestions would be appreciated.

Thank you all for your rapid assistance. I think I have the problem
solved but will know for sure in an hour or so when I test it out
thoroughly at the office.
