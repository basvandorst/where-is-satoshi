-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
Ok, granted there are situations when pinentry pops up without your action. Now that you mention it, this happened quite often to me (uppon receiving an encrypted message though, not on reconnect of the client) before I used OTR for instant messaging :D

If the secring.gpg containing your secret key lies in /home/superagt/.gnupg then you should use --homedir /home/superagt/.gnupg, but I suspect this is not the correct path to your secret key, right?
Where lies the secret key you are trying to use? Is the script executed by the same user who has access to the secret key?

Well, setting digest-algo works, but this will always use SHA256 even if the recipient doesn't have this algo in his digest list, and thus could create a non-openpgp compliant message.
So setting personal-digest-preferences would be the better choice. But Simon is right, this seems to be ignored, even if I set the --recipient to someone who has SHA256 in his digest list.
Maybe I have the options still wrong? I tried
gpg --recipient  --personal-digest-preferences=SHA256 --sign --encrypt
I'm using gpg 2.0.11.

SHA256 is included in the default pref list even for a regular DSA key. Is that because my own key is not involved when verifying a signature, and gnupg could verify a SHA256 hash created by someone with a RSA or DSA2 key?
Is it therefore reasonable to have SHA256 in first place of the key preferences, even for a regular DSA key?

Why do you recommend the DSA2 signing key to be larger than the RSA signing

You type "save" to save your changes and upload the public key to a keyserver:

As far as I understand this paper, MD5 has been broken to that extent. For SHA1 you're still right of course.

Sorry, this is the reference I meant... even more impressive :)

I have not recieved signatures with your mail, but Charly's reply implicates that there is a signature, though it does not validate. I have switched to a new mail system, I hope it does not strip away signatures :-/
I believe (an I think others do too) it is good praxis to not sign new keys even if you have signed the old one and the new key is signed by the old one, without personally checking with the keyholder first. After all, the new key could have been compromised.
If someone does _not_ know the old key, checking the fingerprint against an untrusted source like an eMail is certainly not enough. It is crucial for the web of trust that key/UID combinations are only signed after the fingerpint has been confirmed by the keyholder in person, and the UID has been checked against an official identification.
I think the best way to have your new key integrated in the web of trust is to visit a keysigning party, or to look up key signers in your area at   Raimar

After all the _old_ key could have been compromised, that is what I meant :)
