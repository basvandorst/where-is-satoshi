@_subject: gpg for OS/2 
On gnupg.org I read, that gnupg compiles for OS/2. Where can I get the
binaries?

Hi Werner!
What excatly do you need to generate random numbers.
Sure, OS/2 is still at PGP 2.63 and a relatively useless PGP 5 port.
All OS/2 users would be happy to join the gpg community.

Hi David!
"How random" have the numbers to be, to be secure enough? I mean if
Win* can do it, why shouldn't OS/2 can do it?

@_subject: --password parameter? 
I'd like to decrypt files automalically. Therefor I need to give the
password as parameter, but I didn't find this option. Did I miss it or
doesn't exist it?

Hi George!
I try to set the default uid, setting the default key works as
tam should be the default uid, not timo.maier

@_subject: pgp 2.6 compatibility 
Lot's of the list subscribers demand, or a least would like to have pgp
2.6.3 compatibility. IMHO gpg can only be successful if it's fully
campatible to pgp 2.6.3
I've read a lot about the problems concerning this feature, but how
about a --pgp263 command line option, which would enable it?
All of the above: IMHO.
