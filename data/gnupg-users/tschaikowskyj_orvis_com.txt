Dear Sir/Madam:
I am using GNUPGP 1.0.6 on a windows 2000 platform to encryt text files. Does anyone know if GNUPGP includes "Canonical Text Support" (removes any
text formatting when file is encrypted using recipients public key). I see a
switch available for ASCII Armoring but I do not see one for Canonical Text.
Thanks Much
