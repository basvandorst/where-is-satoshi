@_subject: Weird error after moving .gnupg to new machine 
I've attempted to migrate my gpg keyring from an old machine to a new machi=
by simply copying the .gnupg directory from the old to new machine.  Howeve=
this does not appear to work:
gpchris gpg --list-keys
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=3D00)
gpg: read_keyblock: read error: invalid packet
gpg: enum_keyblocks(read) failed: invalid keyring
What does this mean? Is there a better way to migrate the stuff over to the=
new machine?
Sadly I do not have access to the old machine at the moment, it's currently=
200 miles away :(

Ah of course, so obvious when you know the answer :) (I'm running Debian wo=
and had pulled a newer version of gpg out of sid on the old machine, but ha=
not yet done this on the new machine)
