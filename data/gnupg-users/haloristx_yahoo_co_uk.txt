@_subject: Can't verify signature made by PGP 
============================== START ==============================
Someone must have run into this before:
I can't verify a signature made by PGP using GnuPG 1.4.10 (on mac os 10.6.1).
The idea is to send a detached signature to the PGP Timestamping service at pgp _AT_ stamper.itconsult.co.uk, which signs it.
gpg --verify emits a warning saying that only the first signature in the reply will be verified (the other one is the one I made), then the verification fails (bad signature).
Is giving up using the service for that scenario the only thing to do ?
