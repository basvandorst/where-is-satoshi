@_subject: Replacing PGP (Freeware 7.0.3) by gnuPG + gpgSHELL 
I would like to replace PGP freeware 7.0.3 by gnuPG
and GPGshell. I am using Windows Me with 256MB  RAM.
When I try to import my keys, I get an error message
(number 53) telling me that gpgSHELL does not find
the file I supplied and which has been exported from
PGP Keys. Does anybody knows what is happening?
Thank you in advance

Thank you for your suggestion. They were exported as
ASCII armored files. I succeded when I imported my
keys through a dos box. Maybe, some options for import
are missing in the GPGKeys module of GPGshell. It is
also possible that placing the key file in the gnuPG
directory was important.

Thank you for your suggestion. I finally succeeded
using my keys whith GPGshell, by importing them
directly into GnuPG through a DOS box. But I'll
look at WinPT anyway.
