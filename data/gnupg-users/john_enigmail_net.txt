@_subject: GnuGP Error 
Do you mean GPG4Win 1.1.3?
GnuPG 1.1.3 (if it existed) would date back to circa 2000.
You _DE_crypt with a secret key. You encrypt to a public key.
Without the specific error message, we're reduced to mind-reading and guessing.
However, I'll take a guess and say you need to import the secret key as well as
the public.
As there is only one key involved, the quick and dirty (BUT non-canonical and
guaranteed to change in a future version) way is to copy the files from a
working profile to the new user.
The keyring files, pubring.gpg, secring.gpg, trustdb.gpg, are stored by
default in %APPDATA%\GnuPG. This usually translates as
 - Window XP and earlier (XP/2000/NT) -
    C:\Documents and Settings\\Application Data\GnuPG
 - Windows Vista and Windows 7:
    C:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\gnupg
Any custom settings for GnuPG are stored in gpg.conf. It and any other
GnuPG config files are /normally/ located in the same directory as the
keyring files.

Umm, no. Even though cron is running as root and has access to your keyring
files, that's not the default location gpg running as root is going to look for
keys. gpg running as root will look for keyring files in /root/.gnupg, or
whatever is root's $HOME. Your command-line encryption looks in your .gnupg
directory for the keyring files, ("~/.gnupg" if --homedir or $GNUPGHOME is not

   or
2) run the cron job as yourself;
   or
3) add --home-dir   to the gpg command;
   or
4) set GNUPGHOME to the keys'location before running gpg.

(*This will change in future versions,  i.e., GnuPG 2.1 *)
Import the keyring files in their entirety:
    gpg --import /path/to/secring.pgp
    gpg --import-options import-local-sigs --import /path/to/pubring.pgp
You may omit '--import-options import-local-sigs' if local signatures haven't
been used when signing keys.
Because PGP and GnuPG store trust differently, you will need to use
'gpg --edit-key  trust' to set your key pairs (you have both pub & sec
parts) to what GnuPG calls Ultimate trust (PGP calls this Implicit trust).
Run 'gpg --check-trustdb' after setting the trust values.

have my MacBook, which is usually my main machine, but I also have my netbook
which I prefer carrying around and sometimes I update my key with User IDs on
either machine but the only way I have thought of is to export and import every
single time. Is there an easier way?
The simplification is in /how/ you import the keys:
    gpg --import /path/to/other/secring.gpg
    gpg --import-options import-local-sigs --import /path/to/other/pubring.gpg
Do this first on one machine bringing over the changes from the other and then
repeat on the second machine. By importing the full keyring, there is no need
for the export step.
Note: this works for now. It is likely to change and break in some form
in the future.
An alternate strategy is to use portable storage such as an USB memory stick or
some other form of flash memory, and merge the keyring files onto that device
and then point GnuPG to look there for keys by editing gpg.conf.

Safe bet.
Doesn't a separate config file automate things? I fear you may be attempting to
over-engineer a solution.
To use your example, I know of two ways email plugins communicate with GnuPG:
gpgme (Evolution, etc) or via some form of IPC (mozilla-mailnews/Enigmail,
mutt). Neither seem to have much difficulty communicating additional
(non-gpg.conf) options to gpg.
I think the separate config file idea is superior.
Not a mental health professional, but I'd venture that whether or not you are
crazy is orthogonal to whether this is a good idea, IMO, it isn't. I think it's
an unnecessary complication and more attack/error prone.

It sounds like a slight variation of the auto-key-retrieve keyserver-option. An

ONLY? How much effort did you expend looking?
The MinGW compiler folks provide a little environment called MSYS, for Minimal
System. It's not meant to be a full-on environment like Cygwin, even though it's
a fork of an earlier Cygwin, but provides bash and enough tools to run most
configure scripts and do a reasonable amount of work.  BTW, it's faster than
Cygwin because it's emulating less.
IIRC, Mozilla based their Windows build environment on MSYS.
In addition, there is Microsoft's Services for Unix which is the old Interix
product. I think one may still download 3.5 for XP. cc looks for CL.EXE on the
$PATH. gcc 3.3 is included. Lots of stuff available from the user site.
Certain server levels of Vista and Windows 7 have SFU built-in. It cannot be
installed separately on these OSes.
Another alternative is UWIN, from AT&T's David Korn and Glenn Fowler.
(Umm, yeah /THAT/ Dave Korn.) One used to be able to point cc to either the
MinGW gcc or to MS' CL. I haven't used it in a while.
That's just from memory.

It can be done, but it's nontrivial. I think it's more like Sisyphean IMHO :-(.
To *securely* run gpg, or any other program, from portable media, use ldd or
MS's Dependency Walker to see all the DLLs that need to be supplied locally from
a trusted system. They need to go in the same directory as the gpg executable as
Windows searches there first. At a minimum one needs these DLLs: libbz2,
readline5, libz, libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll, probably be good to include msvcrt.dll as
MinGW targets it.
Then you have all the Windows DLLs to deal with. Are your copies 'safe'? Do you
have all the dependencies of the initial dependencies?
Here's a first pass at a list (these are examples from my builds, yours will nut
likely be the same):

        ssleay32-0.9.8.dll => /c/MinGW/bin/ssleay32-0.9.8.dll (0x69240000)
And so on...
Now, you've got all your gpg-related exe files along with a closure of DLLs to
be called. What are you going to do about the core Windows OS, device drivers or
the actual hardware? Quick answer: probably nothing unless the machine is yours
and under your full control.
You cannot secure "everything" necessary to securely run gpg (or any other
program) from a USB stick.
Please don't delude yourself into thinking you can. You can't. Even with an
encrypted file system, you still reach the point where you don't control things
the rest of the way, and only iff you do, can it be made "secure," and in that
case, why go to all this trouble in the first place? Put GnuPG on the machine
and your keys and other data on the USB stick if you need them to be portable.
The only way to securely run any program from a USB stick is on a computer you
installed the OS (from a secure source - Is your Windows CD Genuine?), audited
and have total control, and in that case you don't need the USB stick for the
programs, only data you wish between machines of which you also have total control.
Now, on the other hand, if your goal isn't security, just to be able to run the
programs from an USB stick, you need the gpg and gpgkeys_* binaries along with
the non Windows DLLS all in the same folder - It's several MB zipped up,
cryptoeay is BIG. But I have to ask, why use gpg without security in mind?

Odd that only you seemed to find Rob's remarks offensive, and exceedingly at
that. But then again, only you stooped to argumentum ad hominem. Peter Segment
was not under attack, only the ideas he presented were being challenged. It's
great for one to hypothesize a new idea, but with no data for support and by
disagreeing with a couple decades of peer-reviewed research, then yes it's not
going to be taken very seriously especially by those with academic and/or
professional experience in the field.
Trying to discount a research paper because of its age (when later papers
reach substantially the same conclusions) is akin to want to toss legal
precedent because the case was decided 100 years ago.
Your use of a pseudonym does not devalue your words. Your use of personal
attack does. Anonymity used in that fashion reminds me of SlashDot's
"Anonymous Coward" moniker. You were rude to Rob. I do not know how many
others on the list also found your behavior rude.
Your glee says even more about you than just the words you used to attack Rob.
BTW, saying in your attack that Robert J. Hansen and Robert P. Hanssen were
the same name also adds to your level of credibility. I guess you were also
unaware that Rob has pointed this similar name thing out several times both
here and on other crypto lists. Rude as it was, it was also entertaining. I
found the example of "sending 30 Israeli academics to Iran" to be quite
entertaining in its na?vet?. I imagine details like lawfully securing visas or
passing Customs were forgotten in haste to insult.
This forum has always provided mutual respect to posters, but ideas are ideas,
they are not people. The "Old Guard," as you describe us, tend to be rather
patient with new members often patiently re-answering frequently asked
questions and pointing to other sources of information. I've seen much worse
behavior on some other lists.
I doubt Rob gives you or your words much thought or regard.  He and I are both
experienced of much more vociferously phrased attacks from academic realms
than his corrections on why people do not avail themselves of crypto. But
typically in those cases we've experienced, the attacker is buying the second
pitcher of beer later in the day (depends on whether he has tenure). We are
taught to attack and challenge _ideas_ especially new or unproven ones. It's

I guess you don't know the degree that SKS from its outset stripped much of the
"crappy" from PKSD. The few flecks of fecal implementation were needed at the
time for interoperability -- a nasty practicality of which software writers on
the Internet have to be mindful.
As for being still totally crappy, the problem only came up in discussion about
a week ago. Do you expect us to pull a fix out of our behinds and have it
magically applied to all existing keyservers in a week? BTW, it's being
discussed on the GnuPG-* lists. NO ONE has opened an issue on SKS
I'm sorry, did you mean to attach a patch fixing this to this message?

Dan, Enigmail's Per-recipient rules are a perfect way of matching email address
to a key without that email address in an UID or when when multiple keys contain
UIDs with the same email address.
Huh? Why on Earth would hashes need to be stored for plaintext UIDs? Present day
keyservers don't even store the UID as a single element.
That's ridiculous. Perhaps an understanding of the workings of keyserver lookup
should be gained before trying to modify how OpenPGP UIDs are handled.
Other than the human element, I don't see a reason the keyserver code would need
to be changed. Most of my objections to this idea lie in matters of HCI.

@_subject: Why hashed User IDs is not the solution to User ID enumeration 
You've just outlined the problem. The present behavior of all keyservers is to
merge packets. If the no-modify behavior is introduced, that server is going to
drop or refuse packets. How do you reconcile keys when you have two legal
behaviors in place within the network? Differing copies of a key is _NOT_ an option.
The thing that makes SKS so fast is its reconciliation scheme which relies on
logically identical or near identical copies of the keystore. If two variant
copies of the same key are allowed to exist, they will endlessly be exchanged
between servers, thus crippling the reconciliation process as more no-modify
keys are sent to the keyservers.
It has nothing to do with what is or isn't published. You ask for key
0xdecafbad, you get all of the key. What it has to do with is _what_ gets stored
and how those decisions are made. Differing algorithms equate to differing keys.
I tagged SKS 1.1.2 at the end of September. Currently there are four versions of
SKS running in the network: 1.0.10, 1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.2. I think the 1.0.9
servers finally upgraded.  Getting all servers on the same release would in
itself be a large undertaking and would be required for a no-modify scheme to work.
I don't see a way that a rolling-upgrade to a no-modify supporting version could
be accomplished without breaking things in the process. The only way I can
envision doing this to to form a completely new network and let servers migrate
into it as they upgrade to the no-modify supporting version.  In a way, that's
also undesirable as it divides the widely distributed network in two.
There's really no simple way to retrofit no-modify behavior into an existing
keyserver network.

This is simpler than you're trying to make it.
Try this experiment
   gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --search-keys gswot
Note that the search results returns the key and all the UIDs if just one of the
UIDs contains your search term. The keyservers break a UID down into words and
index each word. If I search for MFPA, I'll get all keys that have an UID
containing MFPA along with all the UIDs on those keys.
To achieve the two goals, you only need to put each in its own UID. Just
remember once they locate the matching key, they will have all the information
in all the UIDs. You may need --allow-freeform-uid as Werner pointed out earlier
when creating these User IDs.
Sorry, but there is no way to only return a single UID matching the search term.
Things were never designed that way. (So there's really no reason not to put all
three in a single ID.)

Something sounds odd about the search criteria or keyserver selection.
Searching for the subkey 0xA1BC4FA4:
returns the key:
Search results for '0xa1bc4fa4'
Type bits/keyID     Date       User ID
pub  4096R/99242560 2002-01-28 David M. Shaw This should be true of any of the SKS keyservers out there.

No, but it may be scripted. Example pulled from list archive:

It may take several runs to get a complete closure of all available signing keys.
Backup pubring.gpg first. You may not wish to keep all those extra keys

As a friend of mine commented: "First people have to care enough to want to
use crypto before they start worrying about how easy to use it is or how well
integrated it may be. It's like my friends who like hedgehogs: They're spikey
and are weird but if you like them, they're cute."
Along with the hedgehogs, there are the echidna[0] and porcupine[1] as
options. Maybe even a honey badger :-)
My suggestion was inanimate: Reynolds, the tin-foil hat (or cap).

@_subject: phrase "UNTRUSTED good signature" is dangerously misleading 
The instructor would have made the same wrong recommendation regardless of the
interface. That he seemingly did not understand the workings of gpg is
unfortunate. The problem I see here is not the tool, but its instruction.
Local signatures are also a valid solution to a formal keysigning
verification. It depends on the relationship between the two parties.
The message is a one line condensation of gpg's output:
gpg: Good signature from $First_UID_on_Key
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX
"Not certified with a trusted signature" --> untrusted
I believe I can say the Enigmail folks do not find a problem with this
language. At least that's what we all agreed on some time ago. No amount of
hair-splitting over replacing an accurate word with something else deemed to
be "more accurate" is going to substitute for proper user education in the
first place.
if one needs to be made. This started from a good signature made by an
"untrusted" key. Dragging ownertrust in is IMO a sad conflation.
At any rate, if one wishes to do more than keystroke emptily into the ether,

@_subject: certificat for a key pair 
Speaking as one of those people who took part in the discussion creating that
advice, it wasn't about the mechanics of the install: manual, apt-get,
yum,...; but that the copy of Thunderbird/Seamonkey and Enigmail come from the
same distro foundry, i.e., compiled by the same compiler.
This was required because Enigmail contained a binary IPC component creating a
dependency on both the OS and on the C++ compiler used to build the code.
This is why we created the statement that both TB/SM & Enigmail must come from
the same source -- Enigmail's 'source for TB & SM being Mozilla.org;
Enigmail's own build architecture tracked that of Mozilla.org. Thus, a SuSE
Thunderbird needed a SuSE Enigmail, a Debian (whatever they call it) needed a
Debian Enigmail, and so on...
Patrick Brunschwig did a large amount of code cleanup this past winter and
removed the binary IPC components from Enigmail.  The "same place" rule is
pretty much gone for Enigmail 1.5+, but is still a strong recommendation due
to the numerous changes in the mail-news code in each Thunderbird release.

@_subject: OpenPGP Smartcard + signing email = two signatures? 
Nothing nefarious going on, nor is it a bug. Take a look at the source of your
PGP/MIME signed email.
In order for Enigmail to generate the outside email header
(multipart/signed...), it has to know the digest that will be used later to
construct the signature part, in this case SHA-512, but all the message
processing happens in a single pass with the signature part at the end.
To do this, a small test message is signed and then examined for the digest
that was used. This is the first time you are asked for your PIN. The second
is when the message signature part is being generated.
We used to see this on the Enigmail list a lot as folks started using
gpg-agent instead of Enigmail's more limited internal passphrase caching.
With no PIN/passphrase caching in effect, I'd expect you to be asked twice on
PGP/MIME messages, but only once on inline OpenPGP.

@_subject: Can I revitalise an old key-pair? 
On *nix and similar systems (MacOSX, Cygwin) GnuPG stores keyring files in
~/.gnupg (~ = your login directory: /home/ or /Users/)
On Windows XP and older, keyring files were stored in
:\Documents and Settings\\Application Data\Gnupg
Windows Vista and newer versions use
You'll want the contents for all of the directories you can find. A tool such
as the linux-based SystemRescueCD [ ] makes this
task somewhat easier.
You should be able to use the newest set of keyring files directly. The keys
in the older keyring files may be imported later.

@_subject: Recommended key size for life long key 
And Rob's friend, John Clizbe, hasn't even made a projection for RSA, because
if he wants anything past 3072 bit RSA, he's going to switch to ECC.
But honestly, I think that even switching to ECC is no guarantee we'll have
more than 25 years or so of security. Frankly, predicting tech progression is
the worst kind of voodoo. Over the summer of 2010, readers of the
[Cryptography] mailing list were reminded that in 1993, the "experts" thought
that 1024-bit RSA 'should be ok (safe from key-factoring attacks) for "a few
decades".' 1.75 decades later it's essentially history. [few>=3]
There /IS/ a reason NIST and the TLAs aren't pushing 4k and higher RSA, it's
inefficient. For multiple senses of "inefficient". RSA-3072 has a 128-bit
keyspace, RSA-4096 has only about a 140-bit keyspace. That's a lot of
additional time/energy for crypto operations for only another, what, 12 bits?
Past RSA-3072, RSA becomes a phenomenally inefficient way of adding keyspace.
It just gets exponentially more ridiculous as key sizes increase.
Several minutes to verify a signature makes such large key sizes non-starters.
Folks using a baseline of a 1GHz cellphone seem to have no idea of the
lifetimes involved in MIL-SPEC equipment. I'm sure there are some 1 MIPS VAX
11/780s still in military service somewhere. /MAYBE/ the 233Mhz hardened
Pentium chips have been decommissioned by now.
I should do a rebuild of libgcrypt on a 500MHz 64-bit uSPARCii. The timings
from the make test phase ARE NOT pretty. it would be better than
pulling numbers out of /dev/ass.

Certainly. If one signs all of the UserIDs of a key, they will have the same time.
Caveat: the time recorded is the local system time (as UTC) when the signature
is made. If the machine's clock is off, the time will also be off.  Also, the
clock time may be manipulated before the signature is made.

@_subject: trying to find a folder 
On Mac OS X (you're using Applemail) and other *nix platforms, it is ~/.gnupg,
which is a shortcut for $HOME/.gnupg. A directory named .gnupg in your main
user folder. Since the name begins with '.' it is normally hid from Finder and
other file managers.
On Windows, GnuPG's files are stored by default in %APPDATA%\GnuPG. This
usually translates as
 - Window XP and earlier (XP/2000/NT) -
    C:\Documents and Settings\\Application Data\GnuPG
 - Windows Vista and Windows 7:
    C:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\gnupg
In either of the above, the default location may be overridden by setting the
environment variable GNUPGHOME.

As there are many Enigmail users who read this list, but not [Enigmail], I'm
forwarding the announcement of the newest release of Enigmail, v1.7.
There are quite a few changes in this release.
As Patrick writes in the announcement:
Until then, Enigmail 1.7 may be obtained two ways:
1) From Until the AMO staff finish their review, new versions will be available only
from Version History list ('View other versions' link below-right from the
Download button).
2) Visit the Enigmail project's download page and download from there.
Debian/Ubuntu users will need to wait until Enigmail 1.7 has been packaged for
your use.
There will no doubt be support questions. The BEST, and recommended, place to
address them is the Enigmail mailing list:

@_subject: adele 
I still have the copy from when the Enigmail team translated to message file
from German to English six+ years ago. One file is all that needs translated
to any new language. It should be fairly easy to implement a polyglot Adele
site.  adele_de.pas is ISO-8859. adele_en.pas is ASCII. IMO, I think they and
future work should probably be UTF-8/16.
Copyright is to G-N-U.de. License (on what I have) is GPL 2.
The source language is Pascal, specifically Gnu Pascal. The requirements from
the INSTALL file are:
  - GPC 2.1
  - librx
  - GnuPG 1.0.6
  - GPGME 0.3.4
  - MySQL 3.23.25
  - any standard MTA (syntax below given for exim)
  - cron
I have not tried building it with fpc.
When we did the translation work, I tested it against gpgme 0.3.15 and gnupg
1.4.8. The gpgme Pascal bindings need to be updated to work with the current
version. This will probably also require some updating in the main program unit.

In the present team's twelfth year, we're now "broken by default." Broken for
whom precisely? The default trust of all keys has recently been discussed
(again). Search both the enigmail-user and gnupg-user list archives.
Setting defaults comes down to a decision of how high to set the bar for
enabling a new user to encrypt email. "Crypto training-wheels" seems an apt
analogy. One needs them at first but later they can be removed.
Setting defaults to values that make using the extension simple enough for the
beginner is often at odds to what "experts" desire. Given the often XOR nature
of the two groups, we as a team tend to choose defaults in favor of the
beginners. As they learn, they can make the changes to more secure settings.
More knowledgeable users can make the changes when installing Enigmail.
Thank you for your opinion. We hope to see you on enigmail-users.

@_subject: riseup.net OpenPGP Best Practices article 
Ah, yes... the fetish of equinonecroflagellation. It has an strikingly common
rate of incidence with maxicryptosizism[*], along with Internet posts labeling
the author[s]'s opinions vis-a-vis cryptography usage as "Best Practices".
I have found the best way to handle best practice cryptography posts is to
look for the writer[s]'s academic and/or professional qualifications and act
accordingly. Recommendations of RSA-4096 for general use allow me to bypass
that step. Security is a system, a chain. Fixating on a single, unlikely to be
attacked, link in that chain often ignores the other more easily attacked
links. Think of it as installing a bank vault door on a Bedouin tent.

That is as I remember it, Rob. I don't recall if there was a difference
between 8.0 and 8.1 with respect to SHA-256. JM3 probably would.
Any? Maybe for the Windows/Linux/Mac case.
In the US? Sarbanes-Oxley or any other retention/retrieval laws and
regulations. [see below] Those requirements have a way of spreading
internationally within a corporation or business sector.
HR, and Compliance/Legal are some other departments that would veto the move.
PGP 8.x has a couple non-RFC extensions that make it quite popular in the
corporate world: ADKs, and X.509 certifications on PGP keys.
The accompanying LDAP-based PGP Keyserver is also often found in this
environment, if they haven't added the keyserver functionality to their
corporate directories.
PGP also had plugins for GroupWise and Notes, in addition to Outlook.
