Test mail to mailing list testing GNUPG signing, appearance and hopefully conforming to mailing list standards.

Great.  However I had no idea my mailing list post finally made it to the mailing list, as the mailing list did not send a copy of my post; even though this option is activated within the mailing list settings.  (I see similar activity on other mailing lists, with some merrily returning a notice the poster's email made it to the mailing list.)
Veiwing this email online, the GNUPG signature looks in similar format to others' emails with the signature with email addresses removed or stripped.  ...looks good to me.

Yup.  Sure enough, changing from the currently viewed default INBOX folder to the GMail/"All Mail" folder reveals my posted emails to the list.  Only took me 2-4+ years to figure this one out.
