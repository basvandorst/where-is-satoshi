@_subject: Problem running gpg in unix script 
I run the gpg in unix shell script and keep getting prompt below.
Can anyone tell me what I have done wrong and how I can get around without
the prompt?

gpg -e -r "" encryptfile.txt
[xxx:zhubfm]/home/zhubfm/encrypttest> encrypt.sh
gpg: NOTE: secret key 4EB63A62 is NOT protected.
Could not find a valid trust path to the key.  Let's see whether we
can assign some missing owner trust values.
No path leading to one of our keys found.

It is NOT certain that the key belongs to its owner.
If you *really* know what you are doing, you may answer
the next question with yes
Use this key anyway? y
