@_subject: Error message when trying to run GPA in Debian 
Hello group,
I have searched this problem on the web, but have not found a solution. It
may be an easy fix or a known bug.
I am running Debian 7.7 I have installed GNUPG version 2.1 (modern)
I have also installed GPA successfully. (so it says)
When I type "gpa" at the command line, I am greeted with:
relocation error: gpa: symbol gpgme_op_spawn, version GPGME_1.1 not defined
in file libgpgme.so.11 with link time reference
Have I forgotten to set something in my path? Or is this a known bug?

Hello group,
I'm sorry to keep turning to this group for help with things that may seem
painfully obvious to all of you.
I am attempting to install GnuPG modern 2.1.0 on a clean install of Debian
7.7.0 amd64
I installed the development tools using the Debian "add/remove software"
I have downloaded all of the packages.
GnuPG modern
download  download  download download  download  Libksba  download  download  Libassuan  download  download  download  download  GPGME  download  download  GPA  download  download  download  download  I have verified each package signature with the GPG (1.4.12) that came with
Debian using Werner's public key
I have successfully "configured, made and installed" all of the required
libraries in order.
    npth         (ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/npth/)
    libgpg-error (ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgpg-error/)
    libgcrypt    (ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgcrypt/)
    libksba      (ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libksba/)
libassuan    (ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libassuan/)
However, when I try to ./configure pinentry-0.9.0, It never completes
I get quite a few no's and yes's
I did install gawk and then tried again.
But at the bottom I get:
Checking pkg-config is at least version 0.9.0 . ./configure: line 8042: no:

I suspect I am missing some dependencies.
Is there a way to install this package that also grabs and installs
dependencies similar to Homebrew on a Mac?
Thanks for taking the time to help.

@_subject: Trying to install version 2.1.4 
Hello all,
I have just done a clean install of Debian 8.0 on an i7-4790K with 16 GB RAM.
I am trying to install GNUPG 2.1.4
(I have this thing about wanting the latest version? call me crazy)
I have done this before in Debian Wheezy. I install all of the latest libraries (in order), and the install GnuPg 2.1
The problem is that Debian 8.0 (Jessie) comes with GnuPG version 2.0.26
It appears that when I go through the motions of installing 2.1.4, it leaves things untouched.
after I?m done:
 ?version
returns: 2.0.26
And then I read that 2.0.26 and 2.1.4 cannot co-exist.
OK, so now I am trying to remove 2.0.26
However, when I try to remove it using package manager it wants to also remove a whole host of other software.
So I tried using apt-get remove gnupg
I get an ominous warning that the following packages will be REMOVED
apt apt-listchanges apt-utils gnome gnupg python-reporting... etc. etc.
This should NOT be done unless you know exactly what you are doing (which I don?t)
apt gnupg (due to apt)
 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed , 14 to remove, and 0 not upgraded
You are about to do something potentially harmful
Type: Yes, do as I say!
Will all this stuff reinstall itself when I re-install GnuPG 2.1.4?
Is there any way to do a targeted removal of 2.0.26 to make room for 2.1.4 without removing all the other things?
Is there a way to UPGRADE from 2.0.26 to the latest version (2.1.4)?
Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Thank you for all of the thoughtful replies. I think i will try the experimental version within Debian. This sounds like the most stable and strait-forward way to use the latest (close enough) version in Debian 8.0.
As a follow up. Since, version 1.4 is also installed, my assumption is that using "gpg" on the command line invokes 1.4, and using "gpg2" on the command line invokes 2.x. Is my assumption correct?
If so, is there any way to make the command "gpg" invoke version 2.x? It is a bit tedious to add the 2 on every command to ensure I am invoking version 2.x

Successfully installed Gpg2 experimental. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I was at 2.1.4 when I ran a version check from the command line.
Also installed GPA. Imported my private key successfully. Can  still see all the public keys I Imported using 2.0.26.
Seems to be running fine so far. I will continue to experiment.
Thank you for all of your hard work.
