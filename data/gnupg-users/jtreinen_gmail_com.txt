@_subject: Documentation on symmetric key options for GPGME 
I am new to GPG, specifically GPGME.  I am trying to familiarize myself
with programming against the GPGME C library.  I was wondering if it is
possible to explicitly specify the use of AES 256 and choose a block mode
when using the OpenPGP protocol ? I am sorry if I have overlooked something
obvious.  I have looked at the 'GPG Made Easy' Reference Manual, and do not
see any mention of these types of options.
Many thanks in advance,
Jim Treinen.

Thank you for the information, that certainly makes sense.  Regarding AES,
I understand your point about being compatible with all clients, but for my
own education, is it possible to force the use of AES (or any other cipher)
using the GPGME library ? I don't see any parameters on the *
gpgme_set_protocol* or *gpgme_op_encrypt* functions that would seem to
allow for this.
Thanks again,

@_subject: Is it possible to use keys that aren't on the keyring? 
I have a question about retrieving keys for use with GPGME.
I understand that GPG is primarily built to function using keys on the
user's keychain, however, I was wondering if it is possible to perform
crypto operations using keys that are not on the keyring.  For example,
rather than encrypting a file for a recipient on the user's keyring, and
retrieving it by fingerprint, is it possible to use a public key out of
memory, for example from a web service call that retrieved the recipient's
key from a publicly hosted key store?  gpgme_get_key appears to only work
with the crypto backend ( gpg and the corresponding keyring) .  I was
wondering if there are any alternatives to reading in keys than from the
native key ring ?
Thanks in advance,

@_subject: Philosophical Question Regarding OpenPGP 
Hello everyone,
I have a general philosophical question regarding OpenPGP implementations,
and I'm hoping that this is an appropriate place to ask it.
When it comes to the most actively maintained implementations, it seems
that GPG, and GPGME as an API are the de-facto standards.  Correspondingly,
libgrcrypt seems to be one of the best choices for using a lower level
library to provide quality crypto primitives.  Observing the standard "thou
shalt not roll thine own crypto" philosophy, I have an ongoing dialog with
one of my colleagues regarding the risks around implementing a library that
would take the output from something like libgcrypt and format it in
compliance with the OpenPGP RFC.
I have looked around and seen some efforts at doing this (e.g.
 ).  The question I pose is
this:  Given the inherent risks in rolling your own crypto primitives, is
there equal risk in terms of say, attempting to secure private keys that
are generated using libgcrypt and storing them in an OpenPGP message
format.  It seems to me that there is tremendous risk here in terms of
implementation details, but I'm unable to put my finger on exactly what it
If anybody has thoughts on this topic, I'd love to hear them.  I apologize
if this is not an appropriate forum for these types of questions.
