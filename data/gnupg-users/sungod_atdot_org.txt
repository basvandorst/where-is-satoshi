@_subject: key storage 
This is a really good idea, and I didn't realize until you'd said it that it's (finally) not just possible but downright easy. Anybody know where I can get CD-R blanks that are credit-card sized, like the rescue discs LinuxCare makes? This would be perfect for storing keyrings.

Several friends and I were debating the other day about the gains and losses that would be imposed if the entire Sendmail-based email system as we know it were scrapped for an XML-based system. This is purely hypothetical, as a complete replacement of the entire Internet email infrastructure as we know it is practically impossible, but I would categorize this solution to your problem as one of the benefits of switching to an XML-based email format.
Dear mom,
Things are going well here. How are you?
Love, Your Son
This example shows how header information (including the subject line) could be used within the content and extracted with any of the popular Free xml parsers available.
Another example shows how header information could be abstracted from the content:

Now, add encryption: say instead of using arbitrary ---- BOBS ENCRYPTION EMPORIUM ENCRYPTED MESSAGE FOLLOWS ----- tags, like PGP and GPG do, an encryption program would only have to read text between user-selectable tags and add tags of its own:
Dear Mom,
Note that by choosing to put the "encrypt" tags around the part of the message with the subject specified, the subject would be encrypted with the rest of the message when the time comes to convert to cyphertext. However, since it is still specified in machine-parsable XML tags, when the secret key is used to decrypt the content of the  tags, it can still be rendered as part of the MUA header info if the user desires.
Obviously, this level of flexibility means it'd be easy for people to write email that utterly breaks the transport system; for example, what if the user chose to encrypt everything within the  elements? The recipient and sender addresses would be encrypted also and the MTA's would never be able to deliver it. This seems to be more of a problem for MUA developers, though, rather than with the concept as a whole. Those of us who understand XML and would probably prefer to write it by hand would simply have to be careful to exclude transmission attributes from the  elements.
XML's greatest feature, I would say, is its ability to be parsed meaningfully by machines as well as humans. This would make it well-suited to digital signing, too:
Message text blah blah blah including markup like this is the subject blah blah blah
...and if the mail user agent understands the specified DTD (which could be different for PGP 2, PGP 5, GPG, and Proprietary Encryption Software  thus making incompatibilities irrelevant) it could do neat tricks like hide the ugly signature cyphertext but display the contents of the  tags in black if the signature is valid and red with a warning dialog box if it isn't.
Once again, this is all purely hypothetical and even a bit oversimplified, but selecting which parts of email documents get treated which ways by which mail agents seems to be a task that the flexible, hierarchical Extensible Markup Language would excel at.
This message has contained YASXMLT (yet another stupid XML trick).

Document formatting, for one, via technologies already standardized by the W3C (CSS1 and CSS2) and in development with partial implementations in the majority web-browser already (XSL). Also, intelligent indexing and searching and extensibility and many other features which you can read about at  and .
Well, if my hypothetical "replacement" took place, it would be in place of existing SMTP/POP/IMAP/FutureProtocol header parsers, so not much of a sacrifice. Besides, OS design is getting incrementally better to take advantage of shared libraries:
I'd say at least 90% of computer users have one... Windows 95 with IE5, Windows 98, Windows NT 4 with IE5, and Windows 2000 all have one built in... so does Red Hat linux and (I presume) most other Linux distributions. Commercial Unix OS's certainly have no shortage of parser libraries available; anyone who's installed GNOME has an LGPL'ed parser available already. The only "gray area" I can think of are Mac OS and Mac OS X users, although I would be shocked if the latter were missing an XML parser.
Yup. Thankfully XML isn't limited only to replacing the ---- ENCRYPTED MESSAGE FOLLOWS ---- lines in email, otherwise it WOULD be a waste. The good news is that most modern OS's DO come with an XML parser, and most of them DO support shared libraries to conserve computing resources.
The problem is not that MIME is broken, or that it's a problem at all; it's just that some of us like to look ahead at what can be done with some newer innovations and think about what "would be possible." The sheer flexibility of XML is enough to grab my attention; if you don't think it's a worthwhile transition, rest easy: without implementers, the idea remains, as I originally contended, "practically impossible."
This thread is now way off topic for the GPG list. Please, all followups to my personal address ONLY. Thanks.

GPG is best used installed to run with superuser access. This gives it the
ability to request a portion of memory which will not be paged to disk by the
operating system. If you DON'T set it to run as superuser, it will give an
error telling you that it is using unsecure memory.
I don't think there's a wipe function either, but this is A Good Thing(TM).
True to the Unix design philosophy, GPG is intended to encrypt and decrypt
files, and things like triple-rewrite-with-random-data-and-wipe-clean-with-
small-tactical-nuclear-weapons are better left to outboard utilities that
can dedicate themselves to doing a better job without being considered "bloat."
