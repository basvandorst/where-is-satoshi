I've not (yet ?) subscribed to this list and I don't know if the problem
has already been pointed.
I made a build/ directory in the gnupg-1.0.4/ directory and ran
../configure --prefix=bar --exec-prefix=foo , make, make install. I'd
got an error with mkinstalldirs (not found): solution was simple ( a
symbolic link in gnupg-1.0.4/ to scripts/mkinstalldirs). So I suppose
you just need a small change in the makefile to adjust paths.
Hope this helps,
