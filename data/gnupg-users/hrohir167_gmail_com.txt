I have a question about libgcrypt license
We can find following license notice
 Libgcrypt is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
License (LGPLv2.1+). The helper programs as well as the documentation are
distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPLv2+). The
file LICENSES has notices about contributions that require that these
additional notices are distributed.
And I also found following commit
This mean that only dumpsexp is GPLv3?
