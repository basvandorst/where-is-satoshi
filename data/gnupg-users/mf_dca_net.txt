@_subject: Moving from PGP to GPG 
I have been using PGP on Windows for some time, and am now trying to  move to Fedora.  That implies a move to GPG, which is fine, but I want  to have access to my PGP files without converting every single one.  I  imported my secret keys, could not get a confirmation for importing  public keys.
So do I just use PGP for Fedora, if it exists?  Am I missing the easy  way to access PGP files using GPG?
