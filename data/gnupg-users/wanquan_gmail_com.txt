@_subject: Storing of PGP keys in OpenLDAP 
I have the following observation while using "gpg --send-keys" to
insert PGP keys to OpenLDAP.
I have noticed that "gpg --send-keys" insert the key's detail in
alphabetical order to "ou=PGP Keys,dc=example,dc=com" (ie.
Distinguished Name: pgpCertID=5B41FBAB4BC73374,ou=PGP
I was wondering if it is possible to insert as Distinguished Name:
pgpUserID=william,ou=PGP Keys,dc=example,dc=com instead as it would
faciliate easy maintanence of keys later on as it grows.
I have been google-ling for the past couple of days but to no avail.
Any tips for me is appreciated.
