@_subject: tracing the Web of Trust? 
Quoting "Michael W. Lucas" :
If your using an old version of gnupg, you can use Darxus's sigtrace[1] and
mutt-sigtrace[2] to display pgp signature path traces inline with the pgp
signature verification of your MUA. (I use mutt)
I maintain some newer[3] versions of these same scripts, which works with
gnupg's --with-colons mode.  The end result isn't quite as pretty, but it
does work.
You can also use wotsap[4] data to determine a signature path.  I
discovered it after I'd customized sigtrace for my own use.
There are a variety of web-enabled tools to achieve the same results if
your only interested in casual tracing.  The most well known of these I
think is probably Jason Harris's keyserver which can be used by playing
with the following url:
Once I started tracing all the pgp keys that I came across, I noticed my
attitudes toward key trust changed.  For example, I used to think CA Robots
were a great idea.  Now i tend to not trust any key verified through a CA
robot.  You really start to appreciate the WoT for what it is when you see
it in action all day long.

@_subject: set-policy-url 
I was browsing through the gnupg manual the other day and was wondering
about what (if any) conventions are in use for the --sig-policy-url and
--cert-policy-url options.
From what I guess, --cert-policy-url should point to a textfile on a website
describing any details you noted when signing someone's key, for example at
a keysigning and type types of id presented, etc.
--sig-policy-url would is where I'm a little unsure.  Is this meant to point
to a url with the detached signature of the note listed in --cert-policy-url?  I'm thinking that if I chose to use this, my signing commandline would
change to look something like:
gpg --cert-policy-url  \
 --sig-policy-url htpt://website/PGPLONGID.sig --sign-key KEYID
Or does --sig-policy-url point to a document (probably html) which describes
your procedure for keysignings, how you assign trust, etc?
Just trying to make sure I understand these options... Thanks...
