@_subject: How to verify the file was successfully encrypted... 
First off, I hope you've considered that gpg is doing what it's suppose
to do and you're really trying to break it. If your encrypted files
are "corrupt" at a later date, maybe you have another problem and don't
*want* to make it just go away. IOW, be cautious that a solution
doesn't weaken your security. ;)
Don't know if this will help or not, but I just did a quick test with
GnuPG 1.4.4 and the --dry-run command line switch seem to work fine.
Outputs to stdout rather than writing a file to disk.  I changed a
single bit in an encrypted (armored) file and tried it, and got a "CRC
error" without entering any pass phrase at all. That's with -vv set in my options file, FWIW. And bleeding edge
hash/cypher algorithms.
Additionally, you can enter a pass phrase on the command line with the
--passphrase switch. I tested it with both known good and known bad
encrypted files, and if you enter a bogus/incorrect pass phrase for a
known good file you get a "bad passphrase" error. With a known bad
encrypted file you get the same "CRC error". Neither one requires any
user input, which is what you want.
IOW, if you...
 gpg -d --dry-run --passphrase boguspassphrase bad-file.asc You get the "CRC error", but if you...
 gpg -d --dry-run --passphrase boguspassphrase good-file.asc
You get the "bad passphrase".
The down side is, both are exit code '2', so you'd have to grep for the
"verbal" response to tell the difference. But that's not a major hurdle
and it should be trivial to "if $?" grep return codes into something
The other down side is this doesn't explicitly tell you if you have a
*good* encrypted file, it only picks out a couple errors. To do that
you'd have to either be sitting there entering pass phrases, or include
them in your script. Probably not where you'd want to go with this. :(

@_subject: Good and bad signature... 
Your signature verified fine here.
I had this exact same trouble with the Pan news reader. Never really
explored the causes in any detail, but I did notice the same article
displayed in Pan and another news client were word wrapped differently.
I assumed that GnuPG/PGP operations were performed on a temporary copy
of the original, either generated from the display or using some
"clipboard" facility, and discarded Pan as a client that messes around
with message text the same way it messes around with the display of
message headers. :-(

@_subject: Keyring Directory 
Sorry for the out of sequence reply, just joined the list. :)
I think what you want is actually a series of entries in your options
file. This works under Linux with a thumb drive, maybe you can get it to
work under Windows(?) by just changing the paths to the keyrings.
# Begin - Set keyrings to flash drive
keyring /mnt/cruiser/.gnupg/pubring.gpg
secret-keyring /mnt/cruiser/.gnupg/secring.gpg
# End.

@_subject: how to create a symmetric cipher 
If you're just trying to eliminate pass phrases and set up a key file
only scenario, why not simply create a key pair with a null or "zero
length" pass phrase? Keep those keys on your removable device, and use a
script/batch that calls GnuPG with the appropriate keyring switches
or .conf file options so it sees only those keys, only when they're
needed. This would in effect eliminate asymmetric encryption, which I believe
GnuPG really only uses to encrypt a symmetric session key. In reality
you'd still be using both key files and asymmetric encryption I'd
think, but it would appear as though you were merely using a simple key
file encryption because you wouldn't have to enter a pass phrase, and
the only actual security would come from the session key encryption.

@_subject: Logo suggestions 
Here's something I did for my own use that's so woefully inadequate it
can't be called an official submission, but it certainly meets the
criteria of being simple. Maybe it will spark an idea. I was thinking the "fade to binary" theme was symbolic of what GnuPG
does. I know, that's real corny. Maybe the GnuPG part without the other
text, superimposed over something like a simple graphical key or what
the like???
A GIMP 2.2 generated .xcf is here if anyone cares to build, play,
mutilate, etc...
