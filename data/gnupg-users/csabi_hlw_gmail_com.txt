@_subject: Set key to be default to sign/encrypt 
Hi all!
I created a new keypair now and i would like to set this new keypair
to my default keypair.
How can i do it?
GNUPG using my older key to sign/encrypt messages.
The default-key option in gpg.conf is not operate me, if i using it
then the following error message appear: Failed to sign, secret key is
not available.
How can i set this new keipair to be default?
Best regards, Csabi

Thx your reply.
I tried the following:
gpg -u 4096R/626D791C --detach-sign t.txt
The error is the same: 		
gpg: skipped "4096R/626D791C": secret key not available
gpg: signing failed: secret key not available
I tried it with the public key's key ID too but the result was the same.
What am i doing wrong?
Best regards, Csabi

-----BEGIN PGP ARMORED FILE-----
-----END PGP ARMORED FILE-----
To the following lines:
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----
-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----
It was enough?

@_subject: GNUPG and Cast6 
Hi all,
Why does not support GNUPG the CAST6 (256 bit key) variant of the CAST It supports the CAST5 (128 bit key) variant and it is the default cipher.

@_subject: old files decryption problem 
Hi All!
I have some old files encrypted with (probably) the old PGP 2.6.x version.
I tried to decrypt it with GNUPG 1.4.14, but i unable to do it.
I use "gpg -v encryptedfile.pgp option to decrypt the file...
gpg: assuming IDEA encrypted data
Enter passphrase:
gpg: ring trust w/o key
gpg: [don't know] invalid packet (ctb=42)
gpg: WARNING: message was not integrit protected
gpg: packet(2) with unknown version 77
I remembered correctly the password which i used to encrypt the files. If i write any different password then GNUPG shows me the following message:
gpg: assuming IDEA encrypted data
Enter passphrase:
gpg: packet(6) with unknown version 22
gpg: WARNING: message was not integrit protected
gpg: uncompressing failed: unknown compress algorithm
Are there any differences between this GNUPG version (with built-in IDEA support) and the older GNUPG 1.4.x versions that use the "idea.dll" module?
Best regards, Csabi
