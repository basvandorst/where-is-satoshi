@_subject: gnupg and pgp key compatibility 
Hi all...
I currently use PGP5 for my email encryption / validation. I'd like to
move to gnupg to support the gnu more and so that I can use the encryption
functionality for work purposes (Which I can't with pgp5's license). I
only have one question... Several people have, and actively use my public
key to send me mail.
Is there any way that I can use my current key pair with gnupg or do I
have to create a new one? If I have to create a new one, what is the best
way of doing thisi and notifying people?
Thanks in advance...
