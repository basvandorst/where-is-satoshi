@_subject: dirmngr cygwin resolv.conf 
On Debian Stretch I tried to do the same thing:
$ dirmngr --version
dirmngr (GnuPG) 2.1.18
Tor browser for linux (7.5.6) downloaded from the torproject.org site.
On linux it works out of the box! :)
Which bring me to two possible causes:
1)  Cygwin dirmngr can't be  used in that way.
If I start "tor.exe" from the Tor Browser for windows bundle it works like a charm because Tor  then listen on port 9050.
So I don't thing this is the issue.
2)  Regression in dirmngr between version 2.1.18 and 2.2.8.
It looks like the code that is responsible for falling back to port 9150 when port 5090 is not available is somehow failing.
I'm stuck here and would appriciate any help on finding a solution to this issue.
If any one can test dirmngr 2.2.8 and Tor Browser for linux 7.5.6 and can let me know how it goes?
beyond '-v' and '--debug-all' what can I do to furder troubleshoot?

Some hints:
1)  Do you have 'BZIP2' in .gnupg/gpg.conf in the preference string?
$ grep -n 'BZIP2' .gnupg/gpg.conf
If the above grep command prints something to the screen try removing 'BZIP2' from the file.
2)  If you do:
$ gpg2 --version
look at the gpg.conf found in the directory specified by the line 'Home: 3)  If you pass the option '--homedir' to gpg2 you should look in the gpg.conf found in that directory.

When I said above that subkey is easier to manage I was talking only

That is based on the assumption that you can have only one encryption

Thanks to the help on this mailing list I've been able to isolate the issue that was bugging me:
I was trying to use the cygwinized version of dirmngr while having gpg4win installed.
As soon as I removed 'gpg4win, Cygwin dirmngr is able to connect to TBB for Windows.
So Cygwin returns the proper error code and gnupg can connect to TBB for Windows without issue.
On Cygwin I use git and need to verify tags and commits using gpg but I also use enigmail with gpg4win to verify e-mail signature.
When I need to use Cygwin dirmngr or gpg4win dirmngr, I do, 'gpgconf --kill dirmngr' as a work around.
Is this approatche reasonable or how can I insure that gpg4win dirmngr won't interfer with Cygwin dirmngr?
As an aside, gpg4win dirmngr is running as an processe.
I'd like dirmngr to use TBB for Windows instead  of Windows's DNS, is 'gpgconf --reload dirmngr' the correct way to reload dirmngr for it to use TBB?

You, the recipient, will use your private key to decrypt this e-mail.
That having been said, as far as I know, you need to configure your

Is there any downside to have my master key with the certify capability
In other words, is it required for the master key to have the sign and
certify capabilities.

@_subject: Different key pare for e-mail and signing code 
Hello all,
Following my thread at (1), unless I'm missing something, it became
apparent that Enigmail/Tunderbird does not fit the bill anymore.
My plan is to use something like the following:
sec   rsa4096 2020-01-03 [C] [expires: 2020-01-04]
      3C5CFD620005347A62052A6B596CB80D30E8829D
uid           [ultimate] Firstname Lastname ssb   rsa4096 2020-01-03 [S] [expires: 2020-01-04]
ssb   rsa4096 2020-01-03 [S] [expires: 2020-01-04]
ssb   rsa4096 2020-01-03 [E] [expires: 2020-01-04]
With mabey more signing subkeys.
My goal is to sign code and sign/encrypt e-mail but I'm not sure what's
the best way forward:
- One key pare for e-mail (sign/encrypt) and an other key pare for
signing code
- Finding a way to do what I want with only one key pare (multiple
signing subkeys and one encryption subkey)
- Am I missing something/better approach
For now I'm considering notmuch/sup to get what I want, it looks like
Mutt uses 'ncurses' which is not an option for me.
Any input is welcome
By key pare, I mean private/public key.

No argument there, Patrick is doing an outstanding job with Enigmail.
I should have said that enigmail does not fit the bill for my needs
anymore, sorry about that.
From the answer in this thread, it looks like having two key pares (one
for signing and one for e-mailing) is somewhat more flexible but this
approach is more complicated for the web of trust.
I guess , I'll go with separate key pares.
Thanks Robert for your answer in all my threads! :)
I'd like to also thank (1) for his answer, and (2) for his answer in an
other thread (3).

Do you have enough entropy on the VM?
In a Stretch VM, I had to install 'haveged' to have enough entropy
otherwise it would hang for ages.

I might be missing the point here but why don't you simply use a Buster
VM for monkeysign?
Also, monkeysign is convenient but you can do it yourself as well! :)

Thank you Werner, I wrapped the above as an one liner:
$ mkdir -p /etc/gcrypt && printf "# Options for the random
We don't trust the Jitter based thing -  do not use
it.\n > /etc/gcrypt/random.conf

Actually, I just reinstalled the Stretch VM in question to test the
above option and I'm back to square one.
$ gpg --version
gpg (GnuPG) 2.1.18
libgcrypt 1.7.6-beta
Is it not working because of a too old release?

I'll go back to using havege then as I need to generate a gpg key for
testing purposes on this VM.
I thought that 'only-urandom' could be used as an replacement of haveged
on this Stretch VM, looks like I misunderstood when to use this option.

You should use veracrypt instead.
Does it work if you do:
$ gpg --verify <*.sig>

@_subject: Verifying and checksumming new release is somewhat cumbersom 
Hello all,
I see that at (1) and (2) the public keys block and the sha1sums
respectively are listed on their corresponding page.
Is there a URL to download those sha1sums and those public keyss as  files?
That is for checksumming I could simply do:
$ wget $ sha1sum -c  --ignore-missing
and for the public key I could do something like:
$ wget $ gpg --import $ gpg --verify *.sig
I understand that for this last step I could also do:
$ gpg --keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve veirfy *.sig
Any feedback is appreciated.
If I can I'll be more than happy to help tweaking the release process in
that regard.

Thanks for this.
To be sure that I understand you correctly, I took the liberty of
rewording your answers.
If I look at Debian (1) for example, the checksum file is gpg signed.
Assuming that I understand correctly, the Debian approach is not a safe
way to make the checksums available?propagate?
Even if the file would be gpg signed?
You mean by checking if the  fingerprint of the downloaded keys match
the one listed on the web site?
Okay, if the fingerprints matches I should sign the keys with mine.
Okay, won't do that anymore.
If I want to verify a new release,:
- Manually: take advantage of gpgv
- Unattended: use a wrapper around gpgme
Your input is much appriciated.
