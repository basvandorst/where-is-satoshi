Hi Bo¹tjan,
GnuPG doesn't use the RSA and IDEA algorithms. So you can't use a key
which is generated from PGP 2.x (PGP 2.x only knows RSA- and IDEA
keys). PGP 2.x can't use a key from GnuPG, because PGP 2.x doesn't
knows the algorithms (in this case DSA/EG).
You can use a DSS/DH key with GnuPG (that is default for PGP 5.x and
above) and you can use a DSA/EG key with PGP 5.x and above *without*
problems; you can verify the signatures and decrypt encryptet mails.

You can use the PGP keyservers. Of course, them work very well with
OpenPGP keys. Anywhere on [1] it should be a list of PGP keyservers.
You can submit a key by email (with the subject "add") or with the
GnuPG options '--keyserver' and '--send-key'.
You can get a key by sending a mail to the keyserver with the subject
"get EMAIL" (you must replace EMAIL by the emailaddress or a piece of
the user-id).

Hi all!
I've got the following problem: I have a directory tree which should be
shared to others via anonymous-ftp. How can I make a detached signature
on all files in this directory tree without suplying my passphrase for
each file to gpg?
There might be a possibility to use "find" for my problem, but I
couldn'f figure out how to use it. I tried gpg in conjunction with
the option "--passphrase-fd 0" and I used "--exec gpg -ba {} < /tmp/pp"
as an option for find, but gpg complained about a wrong passphrase
(surely, I put the right passphrase in /tmp/pp).
Eventually I tried "gpg -ba *" directly in the shell, but gpg signed
only one file in the directory and ignored the other files in the
directory (I'm using zsh as shell).
Any help would be appreciated.

@_subject: notion conventions: OpenPGP, PGP/MIME, ASCII Armor, inline, embedded 
Hash: SHA1
I've always understood the old way (the method I use) to be called "inline
PGP", and the newer way is PGP/MIME. ASCII armour is an ambiguous term to
use, as ASCII armouring can be used for inline PGP, PGP/MIME, ARCFOUR,
micellaneous binary transfer, etc.

@_subject: updating a key's self-signature 
Is this possible with the selfsigs on subkeys, too?

@_subject: updating a key's self-signature 
Isn't it possible to revoke the older selfsig?
Of course, it's still possible for an attacer to compromise the
keyserver and/or distribute the key himself, but that risk exists always
(e.g. when revoking the whole key - which is the same as revoking all
the 0x13 selfsigs....)
