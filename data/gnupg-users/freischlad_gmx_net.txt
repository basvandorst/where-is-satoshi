@_subject: Problem with x.509 certificate and OpenPGP Card 
Dear all,
I've got a OpenPGP Card 2.0 and would like to use it with Thunderbird for signing and encrypting mails via s/mime. I'm running latest version of gpg2 (2.0.19) on a Windows 7 machine.
What I did so far:
1) Set up of OpenPGP Card with gpg2 (changed name, generated keys). No Problems so far, Card works fine.
2) Generated Certification Request with gpgsm. Also worked fine.
3) signed request with a new generated own rootCA in xca
4) Transfer of certificate to the card with gpg2 --card-edit (writecert 3 < cert.crt). Still everything worked good.
I now thought it'll be everything to do. So I terminated gpg-agent.exe in task manager and started Thunderbird (already with PKCS configured). Right after opening the certificates dialog my Smart Card PIN is requested by the PKCS driver. But there is no x.509 certificate shown.
I tried to import the certificates (root and signed certificate) with gpgsm --import but with no effect. Also reboots, card reader disconnection, restart of thunderbird in every possible combination did not work.
What am I doing wrong?
Thanks and regards,

Werner, thank you for your quick response.
Because of the Specifications on  ("Data onject to store a X.509 certificate") I thought it would be possible.
As far as I understand the card is capable of storing a complete certificate (sec key and pub key). But this certificate is not supposed to be used with the on card generated key(s). Am I right?
So it should be possible to transfer a off card generated key that might be used without scute? But then the key is extractable from the card if one knows the PIN!?
I'll try out and report asap.
Thanks and regards,
