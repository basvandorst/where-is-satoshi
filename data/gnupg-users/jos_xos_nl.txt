@_subject: gpg --verify exit status 
In my experience, both gpg --verify as --verify-files exit 0 for
files that are not signed.  The only difference is that they
then do not print the success message.  Is this correct?
In general: how do I enforce a signature check on a given file
(without having to parse the output messages -- if possble)?
