Hi Jonathan,
 , but later you wrote that you installed
(and uninstalled) it already. In fact, gpg4win 2.1.0-rc2 comes with GnuPG
2.0.17. The 2.x series MUST use gpg-agent and gpg-agent DOES use a graphical
pinentry. Depending on how you install gpg4win, GTK or Qt pinentry is used.
They have slightly different behavior concerning focus. If you did a default
install, then Qt is installed. If you install JUST GnuPG and disable all
other packages (documentation doesn't hurt), then GTK is used.
It does not need to be set up but you may tweak it by creating gpg-agent.conf
in the GnuPG home directory and maybe add a line with "default-cache-ttl 86400".
But it uses pinentry GUI and that dialog is even problematic for non-blind
since it is sometimes hidden behind other windows. Mind that if you use GnuPG
2.x (requiring gpg-agent), then you must also set Enigmail to use it (in
EXPERT OpenPGP preferences -> Advanced -> "Use gpg-agent for passphrases".
Then GnuPG 2.x may not be for you. Are there features the 1.4 series doesn't
provide that you really need (such as different passphrases for multiple keys)
because Eningmail doesn't provide for that? If not: 1.4 is still up-tp-date
and will be for long ...

Dear W.,
There should be no problem to do so. Install Thunderbird from
  GnuPG from
  and download Enigmail using a browser from
  but save the AddOn to your local disk and install it within Thunderbird AddOns
from where you saved it.
Welcome! But ... please describe the issues you encounter :-)

@_subject: How to migrate my key from card to file? 
Hi list,
I did search but did not find a useful answer to my question. In 2017 someone else asked:
The discussion that followed explained how to create another CARD based key from the backup. That is NOT my concern, I know how to do this. Thus, I'd like to put this more specifically:
I want to no longer use a card (e.g. in order to be able to read old messages on a mobile device, or in Thunderbird 78.2.1 WITHOUT the use of GnuPG) but want to use the OLD CARD KEY.
I did create the key "on card"* (with --card-edit/admin/generate, NOT as plain file and then with --keytocard). I do have a private_stub.gpg, pubkey.gpg and sk_xxx.gpg.
*As I read in the above thread, the code actually generates the key as a file, writes out a backup file and transfers it to the card. So maybe I'd rather have used file based creation+backup-my-key+keytocard in the first place, but I did not.
My question: Now that I have the above three files (and a working card with the secret key on it), how can I use these to create a plain file based private+public keypair from it?
