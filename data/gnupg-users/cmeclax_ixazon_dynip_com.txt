Please copy me as I am not on the list.
I am writing a pinger which uses GPG to compose Cypherpunk pings, and am now
trying to ping nymservers. To do this, I have to generate RSA keys. Nymservers
do not recognize DSS keys. Unfortunately, GPG does not generate RSA keys, even
with the RSA module loaded. The fix for this (which I haven't tried yet) is to
remove an " 0" at the line number indicated in the error, and recompile. But
I'm not sure if it's reasonable to expect someone who uses my pinger to
recompile GPG. Can you enable this feature in the next version?

What's a v4 RSA key? If GnuPG can use a key generated by 2.6.3, why can't it
generate one?
I commented out the " 0"s and recompiled and tried to make keys. It
generated the keys, then segfaulted. Why?
