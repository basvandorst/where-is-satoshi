  Hi Tamer,
  You might want to try and use 'checkinstall' instead of 'make install'. T=

for those things.
  I've an i386 and an i586 rpm for SuSE 8.2 of the very latest gnupg-1.2.3r=
(My system is also SuSE 8.2). If you want to try one of those let me know a=
I can put it up on my little website so you can download it. The i386 is=20
probably from checkinstall, and the i586 is probably from when I did 'rpm -=
gnupg-1.2.3rc2.tar.gz'. Unfortunately I don't know enough how to find out=20
which of the two my system is actually using
  I had to do a lot of searching, because the tarball of 1.2.3rc2 wouldn't=
compile, and finally found a spec file that was supposed to work better, bu=
I had to change a bunch of the characters in it so my english version could=
read it correctly to compile it, so now the specfile is pure 8859-1 I guess=
