I need some help.
I downloaded GPGTools on my Mac laptop (I have not done it on my Mac desktop yet as I want to be sure I know what I am doing!!!) and did the Install. I Imported my existing keys. And I have several question/problems:
1) When I open a new email message window, I see a green box in the upper right hand corner which is labeled ?OpenPGP?. Is that right?
2) Should I be able to toggle GPG on and off;
3) I composed a short Test message to send to myself. In order to Encrypt it, I selected the text, went to Services and selected Encrypt. That gave me the encrypted code in a new window. It seemed to me that I then had to select that text, copy and then paste it into the new message.  There has to be a simpler way to perform these functions? What are they?
4) My existing keys were created (in 2009 in PGP) at 2048 length.  Should I change them to 4096?  If so, how?
5) Even if I do not Encrypt the outgoing message, I get a window asking for my Passphrase. In the older PGP version, I had the option to cache the Passphrase so I did not have to enter it every time. How do I simplify this function?
In advance, Thank You everyone for your help.

@_subject: 2 Q's 
I have finally and successfully gotten GPG up and running on my Mac desktop and my Mac laptop (and also on my iPhone with iPGMail). Your application is so superior to the earlier version of PGP that I used some years ago.  My hat is off to everyone who working on this!
I have 2 questions:
1)  How can I set the time for retention of the Passphrase?
2) What is the best way to automatically send my Public Key to message recipients?
 Thanks.

@_subject: Retrieval of passphrase 
============================== START ==============================
Hi everyone,
I hope someone can give me some advice.
I have been a Mac user for years (and years!) and used PGP most of that time.  I was running v. 9.7.1 when I upgraded my old G5 to a new iMac.  And, of course, that old version of PGP does not run on OS X 10.11. I downloaded the GPG Installer Suite and read some of the online Tutorials.  And I now have a question:
How do I retrieve my existing key pair so I can continue to use them.

It appears that I made a mess of my new install.
I am on a Mac, running OS 10.11.4.
I had been using PGP ( v9.7.1?)  on a previous older Mac but, of course, that will not work on OS X.
I downloaded the suite and did the install on my laptop (I did not want to try it on the desktop machine until I was sure I could do everything right).
The Keychain was moved from my old machine to the new one. After the new install, I opened the GPG Keychain andI saw that I had a sec/pub key set dated 3 months ago. I assume I mistakenly created that set when I was trying earlier to install GPG.
After getting some help from some of you, it appeared that the install was good.  I could send an encrypted and signed message to myself and receive it.
Feeling smug and on top of the world, I then sent my public key, dated in 2003,  to a colleague with a request that he respond. He did and ?  I cannot decrypt his message.  I get a prompt telling me that my secret key is missing.
I still have the previous/original secret and public keys. When I tried to Import them, I get a prompt telling me:
"It seems that you're trying to import some non PGP related data that can't be processed."
I do not know what to do now. Should I Uninstall everything, cancel/revoke all the keys and start over from scratch?
Thank you everyone in advance, for your help.

I sent the following message several days ago and am not sure it actually went.
I am, therefore, sending it again.

Thanks you, in advance, for your help.
I have to say here that I am more than a bit embarrassed because I seem to know so little about what I am doing.
OK, here we go.
First, I have 2 Macs, a laptop and an iMac.
I am writing to you from the desktop and the laptop is right here on my desk for reference.
As I said earlier, I want to get the laptop going first so that, perhaps, I will learn a thing to two that I can use to properly setup the desktop.
Incidentally, I had tried to set  up the desktop but, with all the difficulties I was having, I just Uninstalled GPG.  GPGTools, v2015.09
I moved:
PGP Private Keyring.skr
PGP Public Keyring.pkr
I don?t know how/where to look. And I am not sure I would know what I was looking at.
I believe it was the 03 version.
He said he used the key I sent to him.
I put them on a USB flash drive from my old (G5) machine, plugged that flash drive  into the laptop and hit Import in the GPG Keychain window.
I am obviously missing something  here because I am getting ? nothing!
Don?y know.
I do not see the encrypted message. I see the message I just sent to myself.  In the Header it says:
Security: Encrypted, Signed (daniel at hillsdalecorp.com)
Again, nothing!
I hope, Robert, that my responses here are useful in developing the next step.

As I may have said earlier, it appears that I am not very bright. I looked again in the GPG Keyring and I see that my Public Key was created in 2000, using an old email address.  Can I update the key with the new and current email address?  If yes, how?
