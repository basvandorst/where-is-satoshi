@_subject: Elementary Question 
I've googled and checked the docs for an answer to this, but have come
up empty-handed.
Is it possible to verify public keys without actually adding them to my
keyring?  For example, I don't want to add keys from mailing lists under
most circumstances, but I would like to retreive the correspondent's key
and verify it.  On the other hand, I'd like to add the key from
correspondence with private parties to my keyring.  I can configure mutt
to retrieve selected keys only, but the process always adds the key to
my keyring.  I'd like to do a "provisional" check of the key if it's
attached to a mailing list message, without adding it to the keyring.
I hope my question makes sense.  Thank you for any suggestions.
