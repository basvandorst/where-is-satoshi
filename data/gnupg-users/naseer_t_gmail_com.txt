@_subject: Separate stdout and stderr -- Any Command or shell script?? 
Hi All, I am newbie to GPG. I have got an application where it uses the following command to decrypt GPG
encrypted messages. This often (at least rarely) returns an error. One such example is: Decrypted message body =-=-=-=-=-= ----cut----       } !     sprintf(prime_arg, "%s to %s", prime_arg1, prime_arg2);    gpg: Signature made Fri May 25 13:11:36 2007 PDT using DSA key ID *******
gpg: Good signature from "****************" gpg: WARNING: message was not integrity protected    ret.code = KADM5_OK;       if (! CHANGEPW_SERVICE(rqstp)) { --- 573,586 ---- ----cut---- =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Key ID and email is deleted for security reasons.
And I see, error and the decrypted message (stdOut??) are spewed out in the
body. I would like to separate these error messages to bottom of the message and
standard decrypted output to the top of the body. Could someone please help me to use some command or a shell script to
achieve this? Any help would be highly appreciated... ~

Or Is there any way to track warnings?
What I would want is to separate such warnings from the main decrypted
Please help me out.!!
