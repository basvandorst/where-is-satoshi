It will work in that way that the uid is still on the server, but that your
revoked sig is also on it. This means that openPGP complient clients like
GnuPG will not import this uid but whine about non self-signed uids.
This also has the advantage that people who already have your key are
notified that this very uid is no longer valid. HTH
