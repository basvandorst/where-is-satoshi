Why wont you use SSL (OpenSSL) or ssh ? Much simplier.

There's also Gnus, and that's all I think.
Anyway, latest version of elm ME+ supports GPG (but only the old way).

@_subject: Extending the key expiration date 
Florian Weimer wrote/napisa³[a]/schrieb:
This is done using CRLs and revocations themselves. And it depends on
definition of 'reliable expiration'. The point of expiration is to eliminate
'forgotten' keys and keys with short lifespan on purpose.
If a personal key is not compromised after expiry period, it should be
perfectly legal to reset the expiry date for a next period. This saves a lot
of hassle with key distribution, establishing trust etc.

Florian Weimer wrote/napisa³[a]/schrieb:
Can you elaborate?
I repeat myself - this is what CRLs and revocations are for. If a key has to
have imposed hard limit, you generate a key with revocation and release the
revocation after the time limit is up.
If key has no limit, it will be valid forever until the revocation is
released. If a key expired and had expiration date reset to new time limit,
it means that its owner believes it to be not compromised and prolongs its
use for next validity period. If a key has expiration time and was not
renewed it means that nobody cared to renew it or revoke it and should not
to be used.
Your method of generating new and new keys has two deficiencies - is prone
to man in the middle attack, and pollutes the keyrings.

try another keyserver, try sending via http proxy (it helps in communication
with OpenKeyserver software).
