@_subject: Cygwin32 and compiling 
Hello all,
it implies an operating system of which will go unmentioned, the reality
is that there are times in which it must be dealt with. Currently I am
attempting to compile and install GNUPG using the Cygwin tools, however,
when I get to make I receive a number of errors. If possible, I would like
to post those errors or mail them to someone who could help me. Please let
me know what the proper channels are since I have just recently subscribed
to your list and am unfamiliar with your protocols (since each list has
its own feel, etc.).
Thanks in advance
