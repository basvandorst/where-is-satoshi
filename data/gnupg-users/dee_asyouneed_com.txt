Hi All,
attachments via pine to MS outlook with PGP.
Error "encrypted session key is bad"
I have now taken to using the same key on both machines built the key
using GPG following the how-to on GPG website and exporting to PGP.
Still the same problems no matter what flags so I was wondering if
anyone has experience with this that can help?

@_subject: GPG Linux to GPG on XP 
Hi all,
Having no joy with my previous post I installed GPG on XP encoded file
with GPG and successfully decoded with PGP. I then sent it over to linux
box via ftp and decoded it their. When I encode with GPG on the Linux
system I can decode on the linux system but send it over to the XP
system and I can't decode in GPG or PGP.
This is using the same key on each system.
GPG Error gpg: mpi too large
Any idea's?

Hi All,
without creating an unencrypted file first. E.g. building a string or
array with all the form data encrypting it to another string and then
mailing it?

without I am just trying to encode a string with a shell script first but I
can't seem to find the right options to allow it, as it always seems to
be expecting a file any ideas?
Thanks I may require this later.
