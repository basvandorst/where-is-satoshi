@_subject: PGP Failed to Initialize 
I'm a rookie at this, so my problem is I installed GnuPG encryption on my
online store website through agora.cgi.  When and order comes through, I get
the following error message: PGP Never Executed. Something went wrong.
Does this mean I have a path wrong somewhere, or am I forgetting something.
Any help would be appreciated.
