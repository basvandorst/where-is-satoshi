@_subject: Decryption fail in PgP ver. 8.0 
I am running Gpg4win on Vista PC, with Outlook 2007 plugin, Kleopetra.
GPA 0.9.0
GnuPG 2.0.14
When I encrypt the file, it will be named: document.txt.gpg
I do the encryption manually: Rightclick > More GpgEX options > Encrypt >
choose option "Encrypt"
When I try to decrypt in PgP ver. 8.0: Pgp does not understand the file
extension: .txt.gpg.
I do not get the option for Right click > Decrypt.
Decryption will work OK on Vista/7 PC with GpG4win.
Anybody can help?
