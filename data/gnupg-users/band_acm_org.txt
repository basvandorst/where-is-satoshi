@_subject: keyservers 
This seems like a pretty naive question, but where do I find an
appropriate keyserver on which to put public keys?
For some reason no FAQs on gnupg or openpgp say anything about
keyservers. I'll be happy to provide an appropriate entry, if it's

Cesar: there is useful information in the Gnu Privacy Handbook at:
  The handbook is available in several langauges.
To get your key into a file suitable for posting on a keyserver you
can do the following:
$ gpg --output yourkey.gpg --export --armor your_uid
where your_uid is commonly the email address associated with the
key. The file yourkey.gpg will contain an ascii rendering of your
public key. The contents of this file can be sent to others or posted
to various keyservers, such as the one at Bill Anderson

@_subject: key fingerprints - a practice question 
What is (are) the established practice(s) for distributing key
I used to see mail that had fingerprints as part of message
signatures, but this doesn't seem to be very common now. Are there
security issues here?
Or is it a better practice to simply sign messages?
