It's possible to engineer a MUA to do that, but there's no use without a
recipient who has the same magic box :-(
DomainKeys and similar schemes can authenticate you as a sender from a
particular network, but not specifically from your email address, nor
can they provide message authentication.
You're stuck with the standards if you want to communicate with others
using PKCS. If you want to make sure your message can be authenticated,
you'd best choose non-opaque ("clear") signing whether OpenPGP or
S/MIME. This way, you don't force the recipient to possess your public
key in order to read your message, or suffer other consequences should
their MUA lack support for your message type. If they want or have a
need to authenticate your message, they'll request your public key.

GnuPG is a cryptographic application. It verifies digital signatures,
not email addresses.
There is no magic bullet :-( A signature is only "special" to the one
who recognizes it. Some people trust my sig, while others have no cause
to. The same goes for bots and CA's. That's why the web of trust is
important. The more signatures you get on your key, the greater the odds
someone who receives your key sees a signature of someone they trust.
The PGP Global Directory will only publish UID's bearing email addresses
that you confirm.
The Robot CA at toehold.com will also similarly validate your email address.
There are other organized webs of trust around like Thawte Consulting
( CAcert ( and the Gossamer Spider Web of
Trust ( Thawte is a commercial CA (only good for X.509
unless you use a compatable RSA OpenPGP key). CAcert is a not-for-profit
CA (X.509 and OpenPGP; trying for browser inclusion). GSWoT is a
grassroots organization that endorses CAcert Assurers, Thawte Notaries,
and other internally produced assurers to enhance the OpenPGP web of
trust. These entities perform identity assurance. You won't get a
signature for proving access to an email address.

I couldn't agree more, Greg.
I primarily use inlined PGP because I'm tired of having my S/MIME signed
mail bounced back to me as undeliverable because "pkcs7 signature is
listed as a dangerous attachment on this server". What's so dangerous
about a S/MIME signature?! Apparently, it's the same danger that's
present in a PGP/MIME message - mail server admin stupidity.
It's unfortunate, but it's prevalent - and that's why inlined PGP is a
good thing. We can still retain message authentication despite the
goof-ball between us and the recipient.
Of course PGP/MIME is "superior" to inlined messages. I don't think any
of us would deny that. It's just a sad fact that it remains not well
supported by many popular MUA's, and that is further complicated by mail
server admin fear of just about any kind of attachment.
Those who don't exchange mail with commercial enterprises probably don't
suffer this fate. I don't think I've ever had a problem sending any MIME
message to any residential recipient. It's businesses I have trouble
sending to.

Stand in the feature request line ;-)
I'd sure love my headache to end with GnuPG being able to "remove
this/these sigs" or "remove all but this/these sigs".
Don't you just love hitting your Enter key 237 times to reach that sig
you're trying to remove, only to accidentally hit Enter that 238th time
and having to quit and start over? :-S

I don't think your reply was to be directed to me. I don't use Outlook
(I use Thunderbird).
Why not just encrypt the mail? Of course that's the obvious solution,
and the preferred way to send mail (encrypted!!!). The problem is that
you don't possess the company's (or the particular staff members')
public key. And well, if your S/MIME signed message is being rejected,
it's a strong indication they don't use any form of secure MIME
messaging at the company, so encryption is not an option.
If you send a PGP clear-signed message, you can at least provide
yourself with message authentication (ie, if they can't quote a
verifiable message, they can't prove that's what you said).

You're not issuing a signature when deleting a uid.
What does it hurt to delete a uid, or even a key? You seem to be asking
for keyring permissions. That's beyond GnuPG's purpose. You should store
your keyrings in an appropriately secured volume if you're worried about
accidental or intentional removal of public keys or uid's.
