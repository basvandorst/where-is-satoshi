@_subject: Why doesn't gpg ask me for my password when decrypting (symmetric 
When encrypting with --symmetric, I would expect to get asked for the
password when decrypting but I am never prompted... why?
me$ gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 -v foo.txt
gpg: using cipher AES256
gpg: writing to `foo.txt.gpg'
me$ gpg foo.txt.gpg
gpg: AES256 encrypted data
gpg: encrypted with 1 passphrase
File `foo.txt' exists. Overwrite? (y/N) y
me$   I'm on OS X 10.7 with gpg (GnuPG/MacGPG2) 2.0.17
