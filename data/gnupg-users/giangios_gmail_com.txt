@_subject: Removing all installed versions of GNUPG 
Hi to evrybody,
I am not very familiar with linux and I have found out that GNUPG was
installed more than once on the server. There was already a preinstalled one
and trying to install and configure the last version I have realized that I
have now 3 installations of GNUPG.
How can I remove all the installations?
Shall I go to the build directory and type 'make uninstall'?
This would work in the 2 I have installed (maybe), but what concerning the
preinstalled version.
Could somebody explain me how to remove all the installations?

I have found out in the documentation this:
6.22) I just compiled GnuPG from source on my GNU/Linux RPM-based system and
it's not working. Why? Many GNU/Linux distributions that are RPM-based will install a version of
GnuPG as part of its standard installation, placing the binaries in the
than from a source RPM won't normally overwrite these files, as the default
location for placement of GnuPG binaries is in /usr/local/bin unless the
'--prefix' switch is used during compile to specify an alternate location.
Since the /usr/bin directory more than likely appears in your path before
called since they were not replaced. To resolve this, uninstall the RPM-based version with 'rpm -e gnupg' before
installing the binaries compiled from source. If dependency errors are
displayed when attempting to uninstall the RPM (such as when Red Hat's
up2date is also installed, which uses GnuPG), uninstall the RPM with 'rpm -e
gnupg --nodeps' to force the uninstall. Any dependent files should be
automatically replaced during the install of the compiled version. If the
default /usr/local/bin directory is used, some packages such as SuSE's Yast
Online Update may need to be configured to look for GnuPG binaries in the
to the binaries located in /usr/local/bin. I have unistalled the 'preinstalled' gnupg and reinstalled the last version. When I run the command: rpm -q gnupg, now doesn't show any gnupg
installation, but I can use it.
Now I need to point the distribution packages (CENTOS 4.2) to use the last
(and unique) installed GNUPG.
If the default /usr/local/bin directory is used, some packages such as
SuSE's Yast Online Update may need to be configured to look for GnuPG
binaries in the /usr/local/bin directory, or symlinks can be created in
What shall I do? I am not very familiar to configure servers. :-/

Thanks to everybody for help and suggestions.
At the end I have installed checkinstall, removed all the previous
installations of GNUPG and used checkinstall for making the last version
available in the system.
The server where I had this problem is used just by me, so I had no critical
points to handle with other users.
