@_subject: --edit-key Information 
Try as I might I can't seem to find any solid information regarding some information under --edit-key. Consider this slightly redacted pub 1024D/92323698 : 2009-12-11 expires: 2011-12-11 usage: SCA
                      trust: ultimate validity: ultimate
sub 4096g/746E2A67 : 2009-12-11 expires: 2011-12-11 usage: E
Where do I find information about the "D" in "1024D" and the "g" in "4096g"? What are the other potential values?
And although the answer may be obvious or intuitive, is there a source of information that describes the values of the "usage:" flags?
Thanks for any help you can give me.
