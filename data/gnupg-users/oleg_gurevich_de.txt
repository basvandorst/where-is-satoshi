Hash: SHA256
Hi with GnuPG modern (2.1) i can't delete anymore a secret key based on smartcard. Is there an known workaround ?
by calling of: gpg --delete-secret-key ABCDEF123
Delete this key from the keyring? (y/N) y
This is a secret key! - really delete? (y/N) y
gpg: deleting secret key failed: Not possible with a card based key
gpg: deleting secret subkey failed: Not possible with a card based key
gpg: deleting secret subkey failed: Not possible with a card based key
gpg: ABCDEF123: delete key failed: Not possible with a card based key
