@_subject: FAQ update for MUAs supporting GnuPG 
A couple things:
Gnus should be spelled "Gnus" not "GNUS", which is the spelling for
pre-v5.x versions of Gnus. (I think!  I wasn't using it then :)
Someone correct me if I'm wrong...
Gnus has support for GnuPG a couple ways, either with Mailcrypt as an
add on package, or with gpg.el which is more of a native support
package. (it is in the contrib directory though...but only because of
copyright assignment issues...)
Perhaps this should be reflected as
Emacs/GNUS        Y       Y       T (Mailcrypt, contrib/gpg.el)
