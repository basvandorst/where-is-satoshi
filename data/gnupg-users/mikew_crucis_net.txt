@_subject: Editing Public Key 
I'm a newbie here and also to using GPG.
I have a public key and published it to one of the keyservers.  Now, since I'm a
Comcast user at home, my e-mail address will change.  Is there a way to edit the
public key to change the comments and e-mail address? Or, should I just revoke it
and issue another?  The new Comcast e-mail systems is ready yet in my area but i
want to be ready when they are.

@_subject: can't send pub key to keyservers 
I've been trying to send a new key to the public keyservers for a couple of days
using the following command (RH Linux 7.2):
gpg --keyserver  --send-keys ABC123F45
I'm getting an error message:
gpg: error sending to `
This occurs on multiple public keyservers.
Anyone know what I'm doing wrong?
