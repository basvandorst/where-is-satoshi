I like it.
Keybase did a lot of great things, but with their future in the hands of Zoom, it's good that we have alternative, decentralized, open source things being developed.

A hardware smartcard is meant to be a closed system, and you can enumerate all (or fuzz most) of the possible inputs.
If you have a Nest thermostat, why bother with an alcohol thermometer? Perhaps there is a bug with your Nest and it reports in Farenheit instead of Celcius. Google can issue an update, and send out an email apologizing profusely. If your alcohol thermometer is inaccurate, your homeostasis is surely doomed.

@_subject: The infinite struggle of Yubikey, GPG and SSH 
This is quite a painful process; I went through a similar journey on macOS. For me, it seemed that GPG was expecting my master key to be in the signing key slot on my Yubikey. What helped me debug this was turning on logging with gpg-agent, and guru-level logging on scdaemon... have you tried that?
As the current issue is with gpg-agent, has it been confirmed that it will work fine repeatedly with keys on your hard drive?
Also there isn't any reason to redact your key/subkey fingerprints.
If it helps you stay sane, I can say with confidence that this setup is possible with your hardware. I blogged about it here , although ssh over gpg-agent just worked out of the box so I didn't go into any detail.

I hope I'm not the only one on this list that may have left innocuous commits forged under the name of someone who didn't work there anymore to prove that a less ethical person may have already gotten away with actually committing malicious code.
I was in an org once that had a neat system of generating SSH keys on hardware tokens, and then distributing them to the servers that each person should have access to. It was hella cool.  I did something similar with my home LAN by swapping ssh-agent for gpg-agent on my terminals, and using a keyserver to distribute my public key to devices.

@_subject: Traveling without a secret key (was: As a fan of GnuPG ... ) 
Regenerating your secret key like this is perhaps dangerous and easy to do wrong, for example you will probably leak it in your shell's history. If an attacker finds out this is your scheme, they can then start to brute force your secret key without need any access to your data, which happened with Brainflayer[1].
Since your secret key is stored symmetrically-encrypted with a passphrase, it's not game over if it gets leaked (e.g. border control). It is a concern that you could have leaked without knowing, and your passphrase could _eventually_ being cracked; better would be to put it on a smart-card like an Yubikey, which will only give Mallory a couple chances to guess before the tape self-destructs.

@_subject: What is supposed to happen after I refresh keys? 
It pulls all of your keys from the keyserver, which will update their expirations and get new signatures and revocations.
I do not believe it should _delete_ keys from your keyring. Just tell you if the owner has revoked them.

1: When revoking a UID from my key, it asks for a reason. What happened to reasons 1, 2, and 3?
Please select the reason for the revocation:
  0 = No reason specified
  4 = User ID is no longer valid
  Q = Cancel
2: What benefits benefits are there to having separate master keys for personal and professional use? Outside of not wanting the identities linked, because I am not yet famous enough for that.

Is this alleviated by subkeys? i.e. it is not necessary to keep the master key on another's device.
That's what I've done; revoke it. I have not had any employers ever care about my weird PGP thing, but they disable my access to the email when I got fired, of course.
The things I found are limits/benefits:
- I can only have one 'default' key in my gpg.conf
- My global gitconfig can only have one user.signingKey

@_subject: Detached signature file. 
You probably don't wanna muck around with a binary .sig file but if you create a .asc file with `gpg --armor --detach-sign bort`, then the myfile.asc file will have lines with `-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----` and `-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----`. Don't mess with the data between them. Anything before or after is fair game for ascii art.

It appears that 3C5B212A55B966881E2D2718A45398B520BEE91E does not have the [E] usage for encryption, nor does it have any subkeys with that usage. This subkey would have been created by default when the master key was created. See if you can recover it?

Create another subkey with the "Encryption" usage.

@_subject: Ban HTML mails? Really?(was: Re: Thunderbird / Enigmail / 
As a personal policy, I do not respond to emails if they are only in HTML. It provides an excellent signal on when an email is actually worth the distraction. Even password-reset/verify-your-email emails will have text-only components. Mailchimp marketing emails, on the other hand, often skip over the plaintext version (text-only emails don't convert in their metrics, i imagine the images don't load and they don't know you read it).
This battle has only been lost when you give up.

@_subject: Announcing paperbackup.py to backup keys as QR codes on paper 
A: Take a look at Paperkey,  I think it serves this need well. Not to diminish your work, good job! It's probably a good thing to have diversity in implementations, so we don't get stuck with the only thing being written in OCaml.
B: I'm not well versed in Python, but have you tried `pip install qrencode`?
C: If you're using an rsa4096 key, extracting just the secret key with paperkey will just barely fit in a QR code, and if you have subkeys then just forget it with "export-minimal". This, to me, is a good reason to migrate to an ed25519 key which is a deci-order of magnitude smaller (e.g. On 2020-09-14T08:16:19-0400 bexnews--- via Gnupg-users  wrote 7.3K bytes:
