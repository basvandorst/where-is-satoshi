@_subject: AES for GnuPG, on Mon Oct 2? 
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) will
announce the winner of the Advanced Encryption Standard competition on
Oct. 2 at 11:00 am EST.
When will GPG incorporate the AES? I see in the OpenPGP that there are
slots reserved for the AES. What would be cool is if someone has
written "AES modules" for all 4 of the finalists, so that there can be
a GnuPG 1.0.4 release on Monday at 11:01 am EST.

@_subject: Decrypting conventionally encrypted pgp2 files? 
I've installed GnuPG 1.0.3, and have installed the IDEA extension.
I've got a bunch of files that were "conventionally encrypted" using
PGP 2.6.2, which I assume means that the cipher is IDEA and the
passphrase was hashed with MD5.
I'm trying to get gpg to decrypt the files. No joy. My old pgp2 can
still do it, so I know I havnt forgotten the passphrase. I had
assumed that either just
gpg filename.pgp
or gpg --s2k-digest-algo MD5 --cipher-algo idea filename.pgp
would do it, but they both fail with "gpg: decryption failed: bad key"
Any pointers?

@_subject: rijndael implementation 
I would assume that the TABLE_SIZE define in cipher/cipher.c
is probably the right place. It's currently fixed at 10.

I started hacking last night at making it dynamic.
