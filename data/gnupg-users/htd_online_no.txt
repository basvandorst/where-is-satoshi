I'm unable to compile this version on my system. The configure script
bails out with the following message:
checking for nl_langinfo and THOUSANDS_SEP... yes
configure: checking system features for estream
*** It is now required to build with support for the
*** GNU Portable Threads Library (Pth). Please install this
*** library first.  The library is for example available at
***   ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/pth/
*** On a Debian GNU/Linux system you can install it using
***   apt-get install libpth-dev
*** To build GnuPG for Windows you need to use the W32PTH
*** package; available at:
***   ftp://ftp.g10code.com/g10code/w32pth/
configure: error:
*** Required libraries not found. Please consult the above messages
*** and install them before running configure again.
Both 32 and 64 bit pth is installed, and pointing configure to the libs using "--with-pth-prefix=PFX" doesn't help either.

Does anybody know what's wrong here?

The developement package was installed, but I found out that opensuse
compiles their packet with
 --disable-static  --with-pic
 --enable-optimize=yes
 --enable-pthread=no
 --with-gnu-ld
One or more of these options collide with the gnupg build. After a
manual compilation of pth with the defaults, all went ok. Didn't try to figure out which ones were the cause for the build failure.
So if anbody feels like having gnupg-2.0.13 installed on the latest
opensuse, here are the facts :-)
Thanks Werner for your help!
