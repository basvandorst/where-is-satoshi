@_subject: PGP 8.0 released today 
Well, this seems to become the industry standard as microsoft
suggested. Even ISS seems to stick to the 30 days, as presented
in their new policy for publishing information about security
holes. I think, 30 days is quite a long time, but there HAS
to be some time for the developers to fix the bug before
anyone tries to develop exploits. Just think of the last
security hole in apache, when ISS published their report
just after the apache developers were informed (so they
had 2 hours to fix the hole). This is bad style... And
not only a pgp-issue.
Cheers, Olaf

Well, it seems that PGP opened their Sources for 8.0
recently, they have a somewhat restrictive license, but
each person may have a look at the source...

Hmmm... The keys you send may find their way to the
sender on another way (eg postmaster) so it may not
be enough to verify the email address...
And of course (as mentioned in some other mail) you should
only sign the uids containing this special email-address.
This is a funny idea, though I am not sure if I would
trust the signature of your CA (but it may help in my

@_subject: GPG support in Mahogany 
just a short (and late) remark:
Well, if your machine is compromised, you may not notice
this immediately. So the attacker install a little daemon
that is locking your keystrokes, gets your passphrase and
that way compromised your key. Even with public key
cryptography the overall security level ist that of
the weakest link. And there is NO way to prevent this.
Even with smartcards, you cannot prevent an intruder
from changing your signing software (just a little
trojan) so when you want to sign a document, the
software gives a hidden other document to the signing
The only solution to this is a completely secured device.
This could be some kind of PDA running with a certified secure
signing software, implemented in hardware (so it cannot
be changed). This device may get the document you want
to sign via a simple interface (maybe as a tif- or
bmp-image, but not as postscript or word-document, because
there you could implement some features that hide parts
of text under certain conditions). It displays the document,
asks you if you want to sign it, you enter the pin and
the document is given to the smartcard to be signed...
This is a quite secure and very expensive solution. ;-)

@_subject: Automatically Signing Keys? 
Hi all,
we are trying to switch to GPG for our PGP-certification
authority. So I am adapting the software (some shell scripts).
I did not find any way to tell gpg to sign a key without
asking questions (which is necessary to use gpg for this
from the scripts).
--batch: gpg: can't do that in batch-mode
--yes: gpg still asks questions.
--no-tty: gpg: Sorry, no terminal at all requested - can't get input
Any other way to do it?

Oh well, before I forget:
--pashprase-fd: GPG does not ask for the passphrase anymore, but it
  still asks "How carefully have you verified the key..." and
  "Are you really sure that you want to sign this key". Maybe one
  should introduce the option "--really" (= yes, I really mean,
  what I specified on the command line)?  ;-)
My actual test-command was:
printf "%s" "password" | gpg --sign-key -u [CA-KeyID] --yes --status-fd 1 --passphrase-fd 0 --yes [KeyID-to-be-signed]
Cheers, Olaf

Hi David,
I was already aware of --status-fd and --passphrase-fd
but not of --command-fd. I think this will solve my problem
(looks good). Thanks, David! Cheers... Olaf
