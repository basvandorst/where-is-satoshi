Hm... Under GNU/Linux there's ecryptfs, but I'm not sure if it's capable of using a GPG key for decrypting the symmetric key? It doesn't use containers and actually encrypts each file individually. It does have its own structure for file layout, though (technically, you can identify which file is which by timestamp, for example).

Well, OmniKey is famous for not working with stock libccid and extended apdus. I had such problems with the OpenSC pkcs and pcscd. Can you try smaller key sizes (never worked with OpenPGP, but it "solved" the issue for me - using 1k keys instead of 2k)

One thing I forgot to add (I was typing on a telephone) was that in
case of pcscd you can use the extended APDU, but only if you're using
the proprietary driver from OmniKey (pcsc-omnikey in Debian/Ubuntu
non-free, for example). If gnupg goes through the psccd, this could
allow you use of larger keys. A useful page for you should also be (the
"CCID/ICCD readers" section):
This driver collides with libccid, btw, so only one of those can be
active at the same time. The proprietary driver also provides the
contactless reader capability (almost nobody makes CCID-compliant
contactless readers unfortunately).

@_subject: Reading key capabilities information before importing a key 
Hello all,
I'm trying to find a way to list the key capabilities of a key before
importing it. I can obtain some basic information by using the command
(I've seen this one in the mailing list archives):
gpg2 --with-colons test.key
The only catch being that the above command will not list the key
capabilities for the keys contained in a file. Any way to obtain this
information without importing the key into keyring?
I'm using GnuPG 2.0.19 with libgcrypt 1.5.0 on Debian Wheezy 64-bit.

@_subject: Reading key capabilities information before importing a key 
Hm... Certainly looks better than parsing the --list-packets output.
The background of this question is that I'm working on small
helper/wrapper utility script for encrypting data and storing it in git
repository. This includes having a small local .gnupg in the repository
where the public keys for encryption are stored.
The script includes commands for adding/removing a key from that local
directory keyring, so I was hoping to check the keys being imported to
it for key capabilities.
I'm thinking of trying out the gpgme library, Python bindings to be
more precise, but I'm not sure if I could get all
information/functionality as using GnuPG CLI.
Btw, is there any particular reason why the gpg2 --with-colons key.pub
command does not list key capabilities?
Thanks for all the answers :)

@_subject: Python bindings for GPGME - PyGPGME vs PyMe 
Hello all,
I'm looking for the best way to utilise the GnuPG from within Python
scripts. Instead of wrapping myself around output from gpg2 binary, I
was thinking of starting to use GPGME. I can see there are two bindings
available right now:
The PyMe package seems to be unmaintained, latest release coming from
2008. The PyGPGME seems to be a bit more recent (latest release in
march 2012).
The features I'd be working with are:
1. Adding/removing public keys to a local GnuPG keyring (outside of
user's home).
2. Encrypting/decrypting files. Decryption is done using user's
default keyrings.
3. Listing encryption sub-keys in local GnuPG keyring (so I can
use them for encryption).
4. Listing encryption keys used for encrypting the files (in order to
figure out if all recipients from keyring are included).
So, has anyone played before with Python and GnuPG? Any suggestions on
which library is better?
The script's intention is to more easily manage an encrypted directory
within GIT repository that should contain non-PKI based credentials
(passwords). I am aware that this type of solution has its limits and
flaws, of course. But I'd use it with a small team (for now), until we
develop better tools for something like this - in addition to
switching to PKI-based authentication/authorisation wherever we can, of

Hello all,
I'm looking into setting myself up with some OpenPGP cards, and I'm
looking into some opinions on using separate OpenPGP card for the
master key and sub-keys vs using a single OpenPGP card.
The idea behind this would be that my master OpenPGP card would be kept
in a safe area (hidden cavern, back home under pillow/mattress and
similar :), while I'd carry my sub-keys OpenPGP card with me at all
times and use it for every-day operations.
In particular, I'm curious to find out if there is any technical
limitation that I should be aware of if I go with this kind of schema?
Mainly in terms of how GnuPG handles the OpenPGP cards?
Does anyone utilise this kind of schema? Or do people go with soft
token for master key instead?

feel free to point me to it with a link. "Best-practices" links in

Ok, so the catch here is that the first command in the line is being
run as user wsc_gpg, but not the subsequent ones. You want want to put
a sudo -u wsc_gpg in front of the second gpg command in the pipeline as
well (otherwise it'll still run as root, and gpg will complain
about .gnupg directory not being owned by root).

@_subject: Recommendations for handling (multiple) user IDs - personal and 
Hello again,
With my OpenPGP smart-card set-up almost done (master key on one card,
everyday sub-keys on second), I'm thinking a bit about how I should
handle my user ID, since the master key will be valid for 15 years.
What are the general recommendations on what to use the user ID for
(i.e. which e-mail addresses)?
In addition to adding my home/personal e-mail information, I was
thinking of maybe adding my (current) company's e-mail as well (and
starting to actually sign my outgoing work mails with the same card).
The catch is that I might not stay in the company for full 15 years.
I've read-up a bit on how the user IDs are handled, and seen that
keyservers will merge user IDs instead of replacing them.
So, is it common that people reuse the keys in this way (for both
personal and work communications)? Any bad experiences or
recommendations someone could share on this topic?
Best regards

@_subject: Recommendations for handling (multiple) user IDs - personal and 
Up until now I've usually went with short-lived (1-2 years) keys. After
each period I'd simply replace them with completely new ones. Since
this can be a bit cumbersome, I wanted to set-up master key with a bit
longer validity period.
The 15 years felt good enough for me to have a nice longer-living trust
anchor without overdoing it (lots of X.509-based CAs out there have
validity of 20-25 years, but to me it feels a bit too long).
Of course, in case of some serious cryptographic attacks on RSA keys, I
may need to revoke the key long before those 15 years expire.
Truth be told, figuring out the validity of keys/certificates in PKI is
probably one of those things where you have to guess more than anything
else. In general, the way I see it it's a trade-off between convenience
and security (where security is actually very hard to figure out).

Hello all,
I'm using Debian Wheezy, GnuPG version 2.0.19.
I've discovered a slight difference in the output I get from the
--list-only --decrypt command depending on whether the secret keyring
contains one of the private keys used for encrypting the file or not.
For example, if I've encrypted a file for two recipients, where I
have private key of one of the recipients in the secret keyring, and
then I try to list the encryption keys used with:
gpg2 --list-only --decrypt test.gpg
I will get only one of the keys listed (the one for which I don't have
the encryption key).
I'll get a full listing of keys if I were to run, for example:
gpg2 --homedir /tmp/bogushomedir --list-only --decrypt test.gpg
On the other hand, I'll get full list of keys used if I run something
like this:
gpg2 --status-fd 1 --quiet --batch --list-only --decrypt test.gpg
Is this intended behaviour or a bug? I haven't found anything in the
man page.

@_subject: [Announce] [security fix] Libgcrypt and GnuPG 
I should've been more specific with my question (or perhaps I
misunderstood the answer a bit :)
If I understand correctly (please do correct me if not), when
encrypting/decrypting a file with GnuPG using an OpenPGP card, a
symmetric key is created that will encrypt the file, and subsequently
this symmetric key will be encrypted using the OpenPGP card, with the
encrypted symmetric key becoming part of the encrypted file.
This symmetric key is generated outside of the OpenPGP card (if I got
it right), and encryption/decryption of a file itself is performed
outside of the OpenPGP card (i.e. on host computer).
Can the attack be used to obtain this symmetric key for encrypting the
file during encryption/decryption operations performed by GnuPG?
