@_subject: unable to send key to keyserver 
I have been reading a book about openPGP and have installed GnuPG. I have successfully created a keypair and have created a revocation certificate. But when I try and send my key to a keyserver with the command:
gpg --keyserver subkeys.pgp.net --send-keys myemail at mydomain.com.au
i get an error:
gpg: "myemail at mydomain.com.au" not a key ID: skipping
I dont know why this happens as this is the email address I used when creating the keypair and gpg printed that this address was part of my User ID. I tried another command:
gpg --output  pubkey.myemail at mydomain.com.au.gpg.asc --armor --export myemail at mydomain.com.au
this worked and printed my public key to a text file. I have no idea why it is not accepting my email as part of my user id when I try and send keys to the keyserver.

Hi Charly,
Thanks for the help, I found the fingerprint and the keyid and successfully sent the key to the keyserver.
thanks again
