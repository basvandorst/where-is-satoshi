about 7-8 months. But they wont do that unless you're a really big guy named osamma... After all it will take all their resources they have to break in such a short time span.

@_subject: keyserver index 
Hash: SHA1
Hello, I would like to know if there is an index file of the available pgp keyservers somewhere. If there isn't one, would it be of any use use if I would maintain one? Maybe it can be usefull to newbies or if you can't find a certain key on a server.

@_subject: strange email 
Hash: SHA1
this doesn't really has anything to do with gpg, but I just got this email:
Your mail to 'Gnupg-users' with the subject
    Spice girls' vocal concert
Is being held until the list moderator can review it for approval.
The reason it is being held:
    Message body is too big: 206921 bytes but there's a limit of 40 KB
Either the message will get posted to the list, or you will receive
notification of the moderator's decision.
Gnupg-devel mailing list
I came from the gnupg-devel mailinglist and was sent to the gnupg-users list. I did not send any email to this list and certainly not about the Spice Girls......Yuk :(

@_subject: Key created in the future 
Hash: RIPEMD160
I recently had some problems with my linux clock so I corrected it and now everytime i want to encrypt something, gpg refuses to do it because one of my keys was created in the future.
I didn't find any option to change the key's creation date, so I deleted it and made a new subkey.
My question now is: did this alter something to my public key, so I need to send it to a keyserver again? I don't think so, but I just want to be sure.

Hash: SHA1
If the scrips says that PGP never executed, you could have tried to use the pgp binary and not the gpg binary. pgp is Pretty Good Privacy, gpg is Gnu Privacy Guard.
Maybe you have mistaken the two.

@_subject: cannot receive certain keys 
Hash: SHA1
Hi, I'm having troubles dowloading certain keys from the keyservers
I use certserver.gpg.com en sometimes I just get: Cannot find OpenPGP data
or something like that. Is it because the users just have not uploaded their key or something
