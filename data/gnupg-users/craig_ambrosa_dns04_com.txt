@_subject: Security Implications 
I agree that its BS but that message is something that i have seen on several
mailing list's.  Personaly i dis-reguard it because i know that e-mail
programs can be set up to do this and i think that is the case here.
Many security managers from companies set this message up so that if some
message gets out to the wrong people (mistyped addresses happen all the time)
they can inform the originator of the message to let them know.  In cases like
this the intended recipient(s) are us, the users of the list, and therefore
we should just disregurad this notice.  If you can't understand that most
people on the internet are legitimate users and/or coporations make mistakes
(even "security specialists" do as well) then my personal sugestion is that
you get off of mailing lists where this can happen.
that is just my 0.02 on this.
