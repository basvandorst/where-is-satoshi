@_subject: Revocation questions 
I was signing my emails (in KDE Kmail) with a gpg signature I created based on
an email account that is no longer valid, and I am unsure if I should:
1.  Publish my revocation certificate and then generate a new keypair.  My key
has not been compromised, so I do not know if that is the strict use of
2.  Expire my current keypair and then generate a new keypair.
3.  Keep current keypair and add a new userid to my current keypair.  If I do
this, can I reset the new userid to be the primary one?
