The "disclaimer" below is not "complete bullshit".  The message that was
attached to this disclaimer _WAS_ for the intended recipient(s), i.e.
the list.
Now, if he had sent the confidential sales records to us rather than to
the corporate big wigs, we should all feel honor bound to contact the
sender (multiple times if necessary!) and destroy the e-mail (and either
buy or sell stock based on the records :-) )

@_subject: encrypting files via web CGI 
Hello all,
I have written a perl program to accept a file name from a list.  I want
to encrypt this file and then send it on to another party (also from a
list).  I'm using the following command...
   system qx(/usr/local/bin/gpg -e -v -r "Ronald" ./reports/$report);
This works great when I run the procedure interactively but fails when I
run it as a .CGI script.  I get no information returned from my .CGI
script regarding any type of errors.  Is there anyone who can provide
some guidance on this?  I am currently logged in with the same account
as my web server is using so it shouldn't be a permissions issue.  Or,
is there a perl module I could load which would assist in my efforts to
encrypt files?
Please CC: to me as my subscription to this list is pending.
Thanks & regards,

@_subject: removing the secmem warning 
Regardless of whether gpg could tell me all about my system security
holes or not, if any application is going to provide me with a warning
that something isn't right, a link to more information would be greatly
appreciated.  It drives me crazy the number of applications out now that
provide error codes indicating some sort of failure with no reference to
where the codes can be found to describe what the problem is.  A
reference to where more information about the error or warning would be
a definite plus.  That way you could make an informed decision whether
to correct the problem or ignore it.

@_subject: short question 
Sorry, but there's no gender bias here.  "man" is simply short for
manual and is in character for all the other short and (seemingly)
meaningless commands within the unix environment.
Of course these days with everything GUI or web based, who needs command
line commands? :-)

@_subject: Klez worm and digital signinatures 
Maybe if you demonstrated to them how you could send their manager a
resignation that looks like it came from them rathar than you, they
would understand the need to provide digital signatures.
