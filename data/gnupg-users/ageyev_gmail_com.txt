Dear All,
we create a service for OpenPGP key verification: It's open sourced  and it has legal part ( see:  ) aimed at creating an international system of legally recognized and enforceable contracts based on OpenPGP.
I would be very interested to hear feedback, criticism and suggestions on our project. And also to establish contacts with people interested in Best regards,

Yes, that's the point.
If my counterparty had signed some contract or document, he/she should not be able to delete his/her public key certificate and data used for its verification.
So in case of dispute I can prove that he/she really signed the document.
This is exactly the part that is difficult to ensure, especially given the new European legislation (GDPR). We needed to develop a justification for this. We had registered by U.K. Information Commissioner's Office ( , hired certified Data Protection Officer etc.
For now we have connected notaries only in Tel Aviv and Kyiv.
The main verification method is online verification, and we have already users with verified keys from 34 countries.

We use the rule, that userID should contain user's fist and last name exactly as in passport, and only one email - the same as used for login.
So we can verify it's really your email.
Actually, we are going make notary verification optional after online verification. Online verification works for everyone, but building network of notaries takes time.

Because of Google or because of "only one user ID" ?

Signing is easy. The difficult part is 1) to create a system in which you can prove that the key really belongs to the user specified in the userID 2) to make contracts singed by verified key legally recognizable and enforceable.
We are working on 1) and 2)
For 1) I mean the case when users has signed a document or contract, and after that this user claims that the signature was not made by his key.
In such case, I think signing keys on 'key signing party' is not reliable. There must be a known key verification procedure, and a permanent repository of information and documents that were used to verify the key.
And we actually not sign keys. From two reasons:
a. If you automatically trust the signing key, compromising the signing key breaks the entire system.
b. In many countries, generating or signing cryptographic keys requires a license. We create a system that should work the same way and legally in all countries. And we do not sign key certificates. We only attach to them information about the owner of the key, which the user manually checks before adding this certificate to his list of trusted certificates.

Yes, we considered this option. But we can not be sure that user uses secure email system, and this link can not be read by somebody else.
For now, using Google?s login system seems to be the most reliable and secure solution. Our backend works on Google App Engine, and thus we don?t have our own login-password system and, accordingly, it is impossible to crack it unless you hack Google. Yes, of course Google can find out the public certificates associated with Google accounts, but any other user in our system can do this.

You can register a Google account with any email address. Simply, instead of creating an account on our service (another password that needs to be saved), you create an account on Google, or use an existing one.
It doesn't seem to me that every internet site should have its own separate login-password system, in most cases it is better to use the existing secure solution.

But you can easily send email with any address in 'from' field.
It does not mean you really control this email address.

We can not verify all email addresses in your public key certificate as yours, just because we have verified your 'preferred email'.
I would suggest:
1) Remove all other user IDs except the one with preferred email, as described on:  2) change validity term of your public key certificate to 1 or 2 years.
Than you can upload your public key certificate to Cryptonomica and verify it. Fingerprint (and your private key) will be the same.

According to EU regulation ( signatures made by keys verified on Cryptonomica can be considered as 'advanced electronic signature (AdES)' ( but not as 'qualified electronic signature' AdES is still legal way to sing documents and contracts. Following Article 25  of the eIDAS regulation an advanced electronic signature shall "not be denied legal effect and admissibility as evidence in legal proceedings solely on the grounds that it is in an electronic form or that it does not meet the requirements for qualified electronic signatures".
But we have an ultimate solution, that can be used regardless of local laws. You can put in contract an arbitration clause, like this:
"Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this agreement, or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof, shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Cryptonomica Arbitration Rules (  ) in the version in effect at the time of the filing of the claim.
The place of arbitration shall be: London, United Kingdom.
The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be: English.
The number of arbitrators shall be: one.
The arbitral tribunal shall decide ex aequo et bono"
Where 'ex aequo et bono' means that arbitrators will dispense with consideration of the law but consider solely what they consider to be fair and equitable in the case at hand. And yes, arbitration award ('judgment') will be recognizable and enforceable in almost any country according to Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (  Best regards,

We also require phone number check to verify user identity.
If you want to stay anonymous, you can not verify your identity.
Most logins connected to email. Crack email, and you got them all.
What is the difference if you use the same login as for email?

Viktor Ageyev
