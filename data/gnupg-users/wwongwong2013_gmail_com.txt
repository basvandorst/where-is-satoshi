@_subject: Different SHA1 Checksum using Microsoft file checksum integrity 
Greeting all:
I downloaded the Gpg4win 2.3.0 (Released: 2015-11-25)
from I did a checksum using Microsoft file checksum integrity verifier as
C:\Users\edsw\utility>fciv.exe ..\..\Downloads\gpg4win-2.3.0.exe
4a88f90a01b0ba8e3eb0073f7b6a4bfb ..\..\downloads\gpg4win-2.3.0.exe
The checksum is different from the one announced on the site
SHA1 checksum (for gpg4win2.3.0.exe):
I believe that nothing has been tampered with the version  gpg4win-2.3.0.exe
that I have downloaded. Is there any reason why the Microsoft file checksum
integrity verifier (fciv) will produce a different checksum?
May be the checksum announced on the has not been updated for a while???
Please comment.  Thanks in advance for your assistance with my query
Best regards,
