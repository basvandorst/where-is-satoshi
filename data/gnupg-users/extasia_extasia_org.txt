-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
I can't speak to ettiquette, but I can share something that works for
me.  I clearsign the message bodies inline.  (I usually generate
simple emails without attachments.)  I haven't received a single
complaint since I started doing it.
I used to make the signature an attachment.  Some folks would inform
me that they "couldn't open the attachment I sent them".  At least
once, a recipient's mail program wouldn't show them the message
body.  Sometimes ambitious spam programs would return my message
telling me that a virus was attached (I use mutt on linux and there
was no virus in the single attachment that was simply a gpg
signature!).  I got tired of the hassle.  So I switched to inlining.
As I mentioned above, I use mutt.  In mutt, I have ctrl-p bound to a
macro that filters the message body I'm composing through a command,
which just happens to be:
  gpg --clearsign
So I compose my message and invoke the clearsigning macro just
before sending.  What results is a simple ascii message without
attachments.  All mailers can handle that, right? :-)

Hash: SHA1
I recently upgraded from 1.0.6 to 1.2.3 on a machine running:
  $ uname -a
  Linux somehost 2.4.17  Wed Jun 12 10:40:57 EDT 2002 i686 unknown
When I run "--verify" on my own email, which I clearsign, I get
something like:
  gpg: Signature made Fri Jan  9 09:41:50 2004 PST using DSA key ID CFCEA5D0
  gpg: Good signature from "David <[current email addr]>"
  gpg:                 aka "David <[obsolete email address]>"
  gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
  gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
  Primary key fingerprint: 708D 7772 46D0 BA64 766C  4AE1 3E1D 0CF5 CFCE A5D0
I didn't get the "WARNING" before upgrading.
So I try to edit the key:
  $ gpg --edit-key cfcea5d0

[it sure looks like I've signed my own key...  fine.  let's try again]
  Command> sign
  Really sign all user IDs? yes
  "David <[current email addr]>" was already signed by key CFCEA5D0
  "David <[current email addr]>" was already signed by key CFCEA5D0
  "David <[current email addr]>" was already signed by key CFCEA5D0
  "David <[obsolete email address]>" was already signed by key CFCEA5D0
  "David <[obsolete email address]>" was already signed by key CFCEA5D0
  "David <[obsolete email address]>" was already signed by key CFCEA5D0
  "David <[obsolete email address]>" was already signed by key CFCEA5D0
  Nothing to sign with key CFCEA5D0
  Command> quit
So how do I stop getting the "WARNING" when I "--verify"?

I don't know python, but I didn't see anything that looked like a
umask or chmod statement.  You should make sure that group and world
rwx permissions are denied for all temp files, even if they only
exist for a short time.  Does python automatically do this for temp files?
P.S.        xxdiff is truly an *amazing* tool.  If you use diff, you should
      check out xxdiff.
