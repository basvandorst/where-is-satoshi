@_subject: Stopping Useless Keys 
============================== START ==============================
One thing that could be done to minimize the number of useless keys
propagating out onto the keyservers is to track down the authors of
the multitude of "GPG HOWTO" articles out there.  They should be asked
to change their articles that instruct new users to immediately upload
their keys as soon as they are created.
Key management cannot usually be handled properly in a simple 2 part
article from a technology web magazine.
Most users should first be informed on how to make choices on how they
are going to use their keys (personal / work or just for encrypting
backups), what lifetime they expect for any given key, how
distribution is handled, what signatures are, etc.  Subkeys should be
explained properly.
THEN, and only then, should an article go into key generation
procedures.  Users should be encouraged to use manual distribution, by
email or otherwise, at the outset as they get comfortable with gpg and
the like.  It is at this time when keyprefs can be properly setup,
signatures from friends can be obtained, testing can be done with
other types of OpenPGP implementations, and their uid list can
stabilize somewhat.  Authors should encourage key expiry dates of one
or two years (if they are to be uploaded) for the user to become
comfortable with gpg and ensure that any mistakes will eventually
fall by the wayside (and out of precious keyserver storage).  Ironing
out keyprefs, etc. before the key is uploaded will reduce future
storage requirements for the keyservers.  (Only the last sig-packet is
displayed but in most cases all previous remain if my thinking is
correct.  This includes keeping around old uids, expiry dates, etc.)
Users should also receive an intro on the keyserver system and be
encouraged NOT to upload test keys but to play with them manually on
their own machines or with friends only.
When users determine within one or two years they'd like to continue
to use gpg/pgp, they can upload any new signatures or uid list
changes, keypref URLs, etc. and update their key expiry date to a time
farther in the future.  This would encourage people to backup their
keys and generate revocation certificates and file them away rather
than letting them vaporize with the latest disk crash.
This may be difficult to do but I believe a campaign could be started
if anybody would be interested in taking on such a project.  Users of
this mailing list and other places could be asked to search the web
for any articles (and author links) that instruct users to immediately
upload their keys after creation.  These could be collected,
duplicates removed, and verified.  Another distributed or collective
effort could send the authors notice on what "the community" would
like their readers to do along with some prepared text on how the
keyserver operate.
Please excuse my old keys.  Too much experimentation on my part has
clogged up the keyservers as well.  I've learned a great deal since

@_subject: encrypt the sent folder - offline task 
[I'm making assumptions you are uni*-enabled]
I do not have a full solution for you but I can propose to you
another way of accomplishing the task.
Modifying your client or plugin may not be the way you want to go.
I'd suggest placing the feature request, but for the meantime.....
Some scripting or configuring will probably be in order.
What you might look at doing is, if you can stand your sent-mail
being unencrypted on the IMAP server for a little while, copy
it or sync it to your local machine (or to a server machine
somewhere) with an IMAP mail copy tool[1] and encrypt them one
message at a time which you could then sync back onto your IMAP
storage and delete the plain-text version.  You might consider
two outgoing folders in your IMAP storage space: sent-plain and
Another possibility would be to setup Thunderbird to write
sent mail to a local folder on the machine you work on, do an
encrypt-to-self operation (automated preferably, a batch job
moving through your local spool) and then copy the enciphered
version to a sent-mail folder on the IMAP server (via SMTP or an
IMAP copy tool).
You could also Bcc: all mails you send to an address where you
have a mailhandler setup that bounces an encrypted version back to
your 'IMAP email' and use server side filtering (SIEVE) to place
those mails in sent-enciphered.  I'm sure you could get procmail
to do this too.  To prevent the plaintext version from hanging
around, you could set outgoing emails in Thunderbird to write to
the local filesystem (or /dev/null somehow) instead of the default
location on your IMAP space.
There are a few tools that are designed for moving things about
your IMAP storage and/or to a local file system.  A small list and
a bit of discussion about a few of them can be found at
[1] You would have to give up the body-text search for sure but I'm
guessing you're not as worried about that as others seem to think
you might be.
A compromise might be to 'digestify' your mails so they are
stored in day or week long chunks on the server.  These would
only require one decrypt per many messages rather than a resource
intensive operation per message.  Store in the 'real' sent-mail
folder a dummy message with a body that hints to where the pgp
text can be found.  An approach like this might be useful to the
plugin folks - one decrypt per many messages would be a huge
speedup if body-text search were needed.  Store in the body a
machine readable index hint.
If you have any control over your mail server [you may not but
others on the list might] you can encrypt/sign all outgoing mail
or perform other fun tasks with some of the tools you can find
listed at:
And for those configuring your own mail servers, be sure you've
got yours set to opportunistically encrypt traffic with TLS.
That's just good sense, regardless if you use OpenPGP or not.
(Setting it up is trivial on Postfix.)
