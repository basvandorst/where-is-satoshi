my hard disk got damaged and now I can't access my gpg data.
Is there a way to create a revocation certificate without the data?
I'd like to "remove" my key from the keyservers and submit a new one.
Is there any way?
Thanks in advance

I still have my passphrase, that's why I hoped to be able to revoke it.
