@_subject: how to use the gnupg. 
I want to use the gnupg in a client server environment. Client  request to
server to create a session for  him.  Server authenticate the client  based
on the signature provided by the client and issue a license to him .i want
to  transfer  the singature  safely  to the client.
Let me know how can I use the gnupg . Thanx
