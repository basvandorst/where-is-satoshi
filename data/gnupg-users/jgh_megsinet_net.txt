@_subject: heads up with list signing up 
I have been unable to sign up for the list for 2 days now, sending 8+ emails, but now that I am at work and signing up via a web interface, I am excepted right away by Majordomo.
In both instances I requested "subscribe" in the BODY to "gnupg-users-request
I was using mutt as an emailing program before and have had no problems sending or receiving mailings to GNUPG. Just a fluke maybe, but I thought you should know.

Reading through a new book I just received "Practical Unix & Internet Security," I found a statement about taking much time into learning about encryption and public key cryptography, don't go ahead and keep your key rings in your home directory.
If you don't keep them local, where would you keep them, other then an encrypted filesystem?

@_subject: gpg --recv-key option 
I have been speaking back and forth with some users of gpg and am having some problems seeing any posts for my reqests to the group....
Make a long story short...
Why is it that if I do something of this nature:
gpg --keyserver certserver.pgp.com --recv-key email
I will not receive anything. I am told through communications with yourself that you can only get the id of the key. How can someone have any idea how to retrieve a given persons key off a server if they have to know the id?
If this is true, what is the logic behind the structure of this? If I am wrong, what am I doing incorrectly.
I am running Redhat Linux 6.1, Kernel 2.2.13

So this can't be done via the shell, if this is what I am seeing? I know that you can do this with pgp6...

this is my point exactly....!!!!
you have to know the hex. And this is not a friendly search for gpg... you should be able to search by email address, last name and hex....

if it is a security issue, how is it allowed in pgp6, the certificate servers and others....i agree with you though, having to take the extra step is nice, however annoying as hell...
why should I have to open a web browser and search! this should be a command line function.
