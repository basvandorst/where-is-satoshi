@_subject: Hash of Win32 binary doesn't verify 
the downloaded file gnupg-w32cli-1.4.16.exe doesn't verify against the
hash published at the gnupg site:
0bf5e475f3eb6f33d5474d017fe5bf66070e43f4  gnupg-1.4.16.tar.bz2
ead70b47218ba76da51c16b652bee2a712faf2f6  gnupg-w32cli-1.4.16.exe
I've tried different mirrors. I always get the hash:
8207 9C7C 1834 67B4 DD37  95CA 1979 83CD 2494 CEC4

@_subject: Moving away from SHA-1 
GnuPG, as OpenPGP compliant, relies heavily on the near broken hash
algorithm SHA-1. Is there any work in progress to move to a more secure
hash algorithm?
When SHA-1 falls, GnuPG will otherwise be completely broken as internal
key signatures, as well signatures of public keys from others and the
fingerprint rely on SHA-1 hashes.

Hi Peter,
Yes, I've searched the archives. Conclusion: There's not any immediate
danger to GnuPG.
But, all the same: I cannot find any information on what's the plans for
the future. Sooner or later a transition to some other hash has to take
place, hasn't it?

Hi Kristian,
Thanks for the link. I've studied some interesting threads.
Anyhow, I'm surprised that apparently there isn't any decision on how to
move to the next OpenPGP standard, or what it would look like. Or has
something been decided?
I just want to be updated as I haven't followed the discussion for some
years. It might be of interest for others as well.
