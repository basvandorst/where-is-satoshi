@_subject: Question about use of --cipher-algo AES & --openpgp when encrypting 
I am required to encrypt a document using the --cipher-algo AES switch
using gpg on a Solaris 10 system using gpg (GnuPG) 1.2.6.
The company that is receiving this file requires that the file be
encrypted with the --openpgp switch.
I have run --edit-key showpref on the receiving key and it shows that
AES is a usable cipher.
My question: does the --openpgp switch interfere with the --cipher-algo
AES switch?
Also is there any way to check if a gpg encrypted file is encrypted
using AES?
Thanks in advance for any replies.
