OK let's be precise. Whether the "No war" message was meant as a
political or an ethical statement, only the site owner can say. But
the message as it is is an ethical statement. albeit in a
highly-charged political context. But it's just such a context that
pushes someone to make clear their ethical beliefs.
You say these statements should have been made before the war started.
They were, not on the GnuPG home page but in massive anti-war
demonstrations around the world, and there was the hope that the issue
could have been resolved in the UN Security Council.
And let's be precise about the holy mission of the US to liberate
these poor Irakis. It was never an issue put forward until there were
massive anti-war demonstrations around the world, including the US and
UK. The issue was disarming Irak of any remaining arms of mass
destruction.  Now we're at the hour of body counts and the losses
among Iraki civilians are far higher than among the US and UK troops.

@_subject: A GnuPG oddity (decompression) 
Decrypting with GPG 1.2.1-nrl and Enigmail in Mozilla I got three sections of corrupted text. When I open my mail window full width I see these three sections exceed the width of the rest of the text and the corruption begins at the point where these sections exceed other lines, so maybe there's a line-wrap problem.
Hope that helps.

If any list members had problems accessing my keys recently at
 this was because of a massive attack on the
.tk root servers, and the .tk registry server.
This was such a large attack that the FBI in the US is investigating
it, IP address by IP address, since one of the root servers is
on US soil. The Dutch Criminal Investigation Service is doing the same
on the other servers.
Things are running again but may still be slow for a few days yet.
Sorry for any inconvenience.

The problem is that additional identities added to an RSA key by
PGP 6.5.8 are always v3 and not v4. You can't edit the v3
signatures in
GnuPG (assign primary status, preferences, etc).
But GnuPg creates v4 RSA keys. You have to do it in two stages,
a signing key first, theb "addkey" will give you some choices
which include "RSA encryption only".
This will then give you a key pair you can edit.

Reading your post mpre carefully, I see that your KEY, not just
the additional self-signature, is RSA v3, in which the same key
is used for signing and ancryption. In PGP 6.5.8 you can tick
the v4 option for RSA
keys and this will create a signing key with a subkey for
But as I said in the previous post adding a new identity in PGP
6.5.8 will give you a v3 self-signature. If you create your v4
key in PGP you can add an identity in GnuPG and it will have a
v4 signature.

David Shaw  kindly replied to my question:
It depends on which version of GnuPG you are using.  For quite a while
now (since 1.0.4 at least?) it is CAST5.
Thanks David. Taking it a step further, is the strength of the session key
directly related to password strength? I'm thinking: OK I have a 128-bit
random-character password to open my private key, but does this give
me 256-bit security when I use Twofish or AES256 for messaging?

On Thursday, March 27,2003 David Shaw replied:
OK. That's clear. Just two more questions.
1...Do I get any extra protection in using a password (random
characters) longer than 128 bits?
2...If I import keys created in PGP does GPG use the PGP cipher or does
GPG convert to CAST5?

Yes, that's an evident possibility, as is capturing the password from
radiation One mustobviously find ways of dealing with these,  but in
the end there's also the possibility ofphysical seizure of the machine.
What I'm looking for is a security strategy that forcesa would-be
attacker to resort to latter.
Thanks for you precisions.

If I had loved ones involved in this dirty mess I would be praying
that this war is stopped, not finding it distasteful that others feel
the same.
And a second point: "No War" - this one or any other - is not
a political statement; it's an ethical statement.
