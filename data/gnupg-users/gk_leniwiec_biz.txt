@_subject: Automating and integrating GPG 
I am working on a project (in Python and bash) that requires me to use GPG in "headless mode" to generate keys and edit OpenPGP smartcard (to set some properties and transfer some of the generated keys). This includes transfering any passwords and PINs from my program to GPG, instead of requiring user to enter them using pinentry.
I wonder what method of integration of GPG with such project is best, most future-proof and recommended and are there any other advices you may give me?
Thank you in advance.

@_subject: Performance of Yubikey fw >= 5.2.3 and Curve25519 in OpenPGP 
Some time ago Yubico released Yubikeys 5 with new firmware capable of doing Curve25519 in OpenPGP (and not only).
Unfortunately they don't offer any benchmarks so one can't be sure if the performance is decent vs. for example RSA 2048 and 4096. Also it seems that nobody published such benchmarks independently.
Does anybody here have Curve25519 enabled Yubikey and did/could do such benchmarks?
Thank you in advance!

Disclaimer: I am not a cryptographer either, let's just say I am an advisor. So, anybody, please correct me, if needed.
1. In terms of key size Curve 25519 and P-256 should have same strength: ~128 bits (== comparing with good symmetric cipher, like AES). Generally decent ECC strength = ~0.5 * key_length_in_bits.
2. Curve 25519 is very easy to implement in such a way that the implementation is fast. Implementations of other curves are usually slower.
3. Curve 25519 is generally easier to implement and easier to implement in such a way that avoids many common security pitfalls, like vulnerability to timing attacks.
4. The design of Curve 25519 is public, (is believed to be) software patent free and all constants in it are derived in an easily explainable ways. There are no "magic numbers" out of nowhere that may be just random or maybe were chosen by designers to make some kind of backdoor - but you can never prove that they are innocent since obviously you can't prove that random number was indeed chosen truly randomly.
5. Curve 25519 was designed by DJB, an (mostly) independent security expert while others were designed/standardized by big organizations that (given indirect evidence and rumors) may not be that trustworthy.
6. This is why many new (and not only, see SSH) protocols tend to choose Curve 25519. But in PGP you should be careful because many implementations (and/or older versions) don't support it. So if you want portability/interoperability you may want some other curve or RSA, especially for the main and signing key.
7. If you want something stronger than Curve 25519 that (is believed to) share similar benefits try Curve 448 (~224 bits of security). But I am not sure if PGP implements it (yet?).

Since you seem to be following OpenPGP-in-TB78 development:
1. Will key management and crypto happen in the same process as IMAP/POP/SMTP, GUI, JavaScript and everything else? If so - do you believe it's acceptable?
2. Is there any real plan to have working smartcard support in the near future?

I wasn't asking if GUI is acceptable. I was asking if crypto and GUI happen in the same process (the main TB process). Since they seem to be using a library for PGP it's quite probable. And if so - is that acceptable in your opinion?
Double nice.
Time to check Claws I think.
