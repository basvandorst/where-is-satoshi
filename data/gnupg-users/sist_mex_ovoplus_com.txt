@_subject: GPGRelay and outlook 2000 
Hi! I'm trying to use gpgrelay0.955 with outlook 2000 and gpg 1.2.5 to encrypt and decrypt mails.
1. When I send an encrypt mail from mozilla with any attachment in PGP/MIME, GPGRelay doesn't decrypt the mail, and outlook cannot see the 2. When I send a encrypt mail from outlook to mozilla, mozilla crash and cannot see the message (mozilla1.7.3, enigmail0.84.0)
Do you can help me?

Hi! I have the next problem, I have a user using Outlook2000, g-data(0.91 now outlgpg-0.94) plugin, gnupg1.2.5, and gpgshell3.30rc. Other users are using Mozilla mail 1.7.3, enigmail0.8.5, gnupg1.2.5, and When I send a message encrypt with attachments (from mozilla mail to outlook), mozilla mail give 3 opcions to encrypt, when I select the 3rd option (PGP/MIME) the message is send in one file (encrypted.asc), then when I was to unencrypt in outlook, it can't unencrypt the message.  How can I resolv this problem?
When I select the 1st or the 2nd option I don't have problems to encrypt/unencrypt with this mua's (outlook, mozilla mail)
Do you known how to resolv it problem??
