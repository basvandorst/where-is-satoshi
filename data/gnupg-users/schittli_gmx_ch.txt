@_subject: gpg Feature request: merge gpg.exe and gpgsm.exe into one tool 
Dear?GnuPG community
I'm not sure if I'm right here for feature requests... I try it:
Many open source tools like Git uses GnuPG.
Unfortunately, they usually only support gpg.exe - and therefore don't know how to handle X.509 certificates. It's a pitty, because GnuPG supports X.509 certificates since 3 years...
Therefore my Idea:
please merge the functions of gpg.exe and pgpsm.exe into one application.
And - I'm not sure if this is possible - try to automatically detect which kind of certificate is meant, e.g. if a function can not find the OpenSSL key, then it tries to use X.509.
Thanks a lot for this great tool!
Kind regards,
