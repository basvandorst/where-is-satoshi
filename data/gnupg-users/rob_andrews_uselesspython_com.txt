I've got a bit of a PEBCAK issue here, since I'm pretty new to actually using secure communications in a real way. I'm using GnuPG 1.2.3 with KMail, and as I sift through incoming messages, some begin with the following:
Other messages will begin with the first two lines (except that they will actually list the unknown key in question), and not cite a plug-in problem.
I don't know how much of my situation is KMail ignorance, how much is encryption ignorance, and how much is general ignorance, so I'm asking here. At first glance, I assume this is one of those situations in which the answer to my question is probably well-documented somewhere, but I just don't know where to look off-hand.
