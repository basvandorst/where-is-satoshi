@_subject: gpg-agent of gpg 2.2.13 seems to pass wrong passphrase 
I'm using gnupg 2.2.13 and 1.4.23 on Fedora 29 on gnome desktop on two
computers.? Usually, I use 2.2.13.
On one desktop, gpg-2.2.13 works perfectly.??? However on the other one,
gpg-agent seems to work wrong.?? It doesn't seem to pass the passphrase
entered to gpg2 properly.?? So I cannot decode files encrypted with an
error "Bad passphrase".?? But on the console, without gpg-agent, gpg2
can receive the passphrase correctly and decode encrypted files.
So I want to know how this can be avoided, or how I can see if the
passphrase is passed from gpg-agent to gpg2.
Best regards,

I found the solution after launching gpg-agent with --debug-level
advance option.?? In a nutshell, gpg-agent doesn't seems to support
Xwayland.?? It works with Xorg, but not with Xwayland.?? So I changed
Xwayland and the problem has gone.
Thank you!!
