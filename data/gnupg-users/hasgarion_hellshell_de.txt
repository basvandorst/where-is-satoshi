Hash: SHA1
Hello everyone,
since I could not reveal anything useful on google, here my question.
I want to have a safe backup of my smartcard which contains my primary
key and two subkeys.
I guessed the private keys can not be exported as it would make no
sense then to have a smartcard.
But if I run 'gpg --export-secret-keys' for my keys, it actually seems
to export the private keys according to pgpdump.
How can this be? (I see no smartcard activity on the terminal and no
PIN is asked)
Since I'm new to gpg and smartcards I don't know what to think of this.
And still I don't know how to make a backup copy of my smartcard.
Any ideas or further readings highly welcome.
Best regards,
