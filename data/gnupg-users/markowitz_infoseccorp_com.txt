Now that *that* has been corrected, it might be worth pointing out to Phil
that RFC2440 is NOT an IETF "Standard" so that he can correct that error
(which appears on numerous pages throughout the site).
For example,  says:
"By becoming an IETF standard (RFC 2440), OpenPGP ..."
while  says:
"The OpenPGP standard is defined by the OpenPGP Working Group of the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF) standard RFC 2440."
Perhaps Phil needs to read  so that the difference in meaning between "RFC" and a "IETF Standard" is more clear. Or is he
using "standard," as opposed to "Standard," as a synonym for "Proposed It's hard to tell. )
"Standards" are the RFCs listed in the the *first* table on
 not just anything that appears on
that page.
Good luck!
