@_subject: using insecure memory 
I presume this would make it suid root, because when I run gpg as root I never see this insecure
memory message. Is the message just because root can look at other user's memory spaces? Or is there
another reason as well?

Yes you can. Download the program from
ftp://ftp.gnupg.de/pub/gcrypt/binary/gnupg-w32-1.0.2.zip and install it
according to the instructions in the README.w32 file. I also recommend
the manual that is on the web site (
 is the English PDF version, there
are others in  if you want them).
