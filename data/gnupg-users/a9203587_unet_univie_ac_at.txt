@_subject: beginners question 
sorry people, i've no idea what about you're really talking here. i'm just
thinking about other things:
- read about an outlook plugin for gnupg and downloaded it together with
gnupg but could not generate a key after proper installation on a win2000
machine -- maybe because there's just an 95/98/nt version available.
downloaded pgp and generated a key -- and fine so on. but on linux i gotta
started gnupg now too.
QUEST: can i use the same key i created with pgp for gnupg as well? and if
yes, how do i?
thanks in advance

@_subject: Win2000 Installation Problems 
After proper installation of GnuPG on a Win2000 Machine (AMD K6-III 400, 512
MB RAM)I tried to create a private key. even 12 hours of waiting has not
been enough to finnish this process.
when i opend the task manager i could see, that after all, just 2 seconds of
cup-time has been used.
has anyone encountered the same problems, or is something more to do after
installation before creating a key?
thanks for help
