@_subject: pinentry dialog 
hi ,
I am using GnuPG 2.1.15 version installation on  windows 2008 R2.
[image: Inline image 1]
While decryption , the pinentry pop up shows up although i have tried the
1.  Added the passphrase to the perl script in the following manner
system ("type $PASSFILE | gpg --no-tty --batch --passphrase-fd 0 --output
$CONTACTDECRYPT --yes --decrypt $CONTACTTARGET");
$PASSFILE = 'abc123$$';
$CONTACTTARGET = "XXX.pgp";
$CONTACTDECRYPT = "text.dat";
2. preset passphrase as shown below :
C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuPG\bin>gpg-connect-agent --homedir C:\Users\XXX\Ap
pData\Roaming\gnupg "preset_passphrase
-1 53656324537465663123313233" /bye
Please suggest what i need to do so that i am able to pass on the
passphrase without the pop up.

Thanks Peter for your reply. When i tried adding "--pinentry-mode loopback"
in the argument, i dont get the pinentry dialog but it says:
*gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit RSA key, ID 035A38377BE10CD8, created
*      "XXX Inc. "*
*gpg: public key decryption failed: Bad passphrase*
*gpg: decryption failed: No secret key*
If i remove the pinentry parameter, the same password works fine. Any
suggestions on that ?
