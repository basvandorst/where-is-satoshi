@_subject: GPG Logfile 
is it possbile after decrypting a file, to generate a logfile describing what
has been decrypted or if the process fails, list what happened?  I tried
this but it produced an empty logfile...
gpg --always-trust --batch --decrypt -o pp26.pgp.txt PKTMP002.xls
Anyone have any ideas?
