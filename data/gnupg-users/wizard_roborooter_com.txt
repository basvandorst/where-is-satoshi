How do we know it's really yours or that you are really you? I'll accept
that this message was signed with it, but by signing you key it means I
have no doubt that it really does indeed belong to Dan Mundy. And I've
nver met him.
I personally don't have any signatures except from my other identities
(who have seperate keys instead of subkeys), I will have more, I'm
waiting for my local LUG's keysigning party after their next meeting. To
miss-quote someone else here. (It's got the same jist)
"People travel long and far to get their key's signed."
I'd give you some links off hand (if I had any on hand) for how to find
any keysigning parties or people in your area who will meet with you to
sign your key. You should look yourself, and I'm sure there are plenty
of other people here who have those links handy.
Good luck.

@_subject: How to set word wrap in GPG ? 
Hash: SHA1
Is there a good way to send signed HTML email messages? If I understand
the problems come up when gpg thinks an html tag is a gpg tag. So
pgp/mime solves this problem?

@_subject: Max compression 
Hash: SHA1
And I'll add that most rsync servers I've used usually keep things set
at 7 for a balance between processor cost and compression rates. If
processor cost is an issue for you, it pays to test a few of the
compression levels out to see what's acceptable.

Hash: SHA1
Keep your keys under your user account and specify that root should look
there in your gpg.conf. This way your user account will still be able to
read and use them even after root's had a go at them.

Hash: SHA1
It's trying to run it's interface on your terminal, how are you running
the program? Is it just a command prompt, or is it through xterm or some
other terminal program?

@_subject: Keyserver 
Hash: SHA1
I've got
keyserver ldap://keyserver.pgp.com
in my gpg.conf, but my enigmail has a few listed.
It uses random.sks.keyservcer.penguine.de by default.
A random keyserver selection seems like the best idea for me (unless you
need to hit one specificly) I can't read german but I'd think this one
directs you to a random keyserver.
Does anyone know?
And why would someone use subkeys.pgp.net instead of any of the others I
Thank you.

@_subject: How to cancel public key 
Hash: SHA1
How would I revoke a key I no longer have a private key for? I
understand I can't do the same thing, but can I do something like the
opposite of signing? Signing against a key?

@_subject: Key Signing 
Hash: SHA1
With all this talk about key signing and trust models, I noticed that I
don't trust any of your public keys. I supose I'd have to trust one or
two of you first, but how do the key signatures get transfered around?
Email? or can you upload the signature to the keyservers?
