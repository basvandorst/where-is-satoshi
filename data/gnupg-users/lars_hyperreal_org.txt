@_subject: Import of revocation certificate fails 
I'm desperately trying to revoke one of my keys.
I still got the original revocation certificate, but
importing the cert via "gpg -vv --import revocationcert.asc"
fails. GPG bails out with the following errors:
 gpg: armor: BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK
 gpg: armor header: Version: GnuPG v1.0.6 (MingW32)
 gpg: armor header: Comment: A revocation certificate should follow

I'm using gpg 1.2.0 under Linux, but also generating a new
revocation certificate with this version produces a similar error
when I try to import the certificate into my keyring.
The original key pair has been created with GnuPG 1.0.6 on a
Win2k system.
Anyone any idea what is going on here?
