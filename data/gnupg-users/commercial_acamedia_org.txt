@_subject: 8-bit message encrypted by gnupg appears as 7-bit after decryption? 
this might be a silly question but my curiosity has not been satisfied after three days of continuous web searching so i hope somebody will humour me.
kmail encodes some of my utf-8 emails as base64. this happens when i dont allow 8bit and when i type arabic.
my question is this: after an outgoing message is encrypted with gnupg the body of the message appears as 7bit. meaning that when it arrives as the recipient he/she will have no way of knowing the original encoding after does this never cause problems? how can the mua know whether the original email was 7bit, 8bit or base64?
i should also say that i have not had any problems but then again you rarely do when emailing yourself. i would just really like to know how the recipient knows what type of body he is dealing with.
