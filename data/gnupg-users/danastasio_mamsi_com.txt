@_subject: file decryption executes, but produces no output file 
Hello all,
I have been using GPG without encountering any problems for the past 8-10
months, but have been unable to decrypt this test file. The command seems to
run OK, but there is no output file generated (see command output below).
$ gpg --output test --decrypt test.pgp
You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: "mamsi_production "
2048-bit ELG-E key, ID 27DC2236, created 2002-01-16 (main key ID AA6ECF82)
$ ls test         test: No such file or directory
Here is information about my version and the other guy's version of GPG:

I would not expect it, but is it possible that the version differences are
causing this problem? Please note: I am able to decrypt the file and view the data when I transfer
it to a PC running PGP. However, I would prefer to decrypt it using GPG
since that allows me to handle the process inside a script.
Thanks in advance for any insight into this problem you may be able to give
