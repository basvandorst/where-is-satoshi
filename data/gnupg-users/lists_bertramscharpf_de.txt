we all know that kidnappers do publish a picture of their
hostage holding up a todays newpaper. The purpose of this is
to proof that the victim was alive _after_ a certain point
of time. I want to do the opposite. I want to make evidence
that I created a document _before_ a certain point of time.
I could use self-darkening ink but that won't be reflected
in a JPEG scan and my pen won't make the job that TeX does.
I could sign a newspapers home page but that cannot be
reproduced at a later point of time to verify the signature.
Is there a standard way in GnuPG and in the keyholder
infrastructure to accomplish this task?
Thanks in advance.

Thank you all for your detailed answers.
I might resume it to two possibilities to accomplish the task:
  - Post a digest to a site where you cannot withdraw it
    ever and where it can be retrieved by everybody. This
    could be a Github issue, on Reddit or Twitter or maybe
    even on the GnuPG mailing list.
    The disadvantage is that you are dependent on the
    provider of the site to continue the service and that
    your information can be found there. This could most
    notably become a problem because the post is, in the
    end, an abuse of the forum.
  - Let one or more people sign your document and provide
    the signatures yourself.
    The weak point is how to find these people and to make
    them do what you want. The service
     makes
    signatures in a format that is no longer supported.
Maybe a combination of both methods is a good way to handle
the disadvantages.
