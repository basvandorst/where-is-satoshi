Actually, the package I was referring to can be found at:
Last time, I gave the URL for the GnuPP home page, but this link will
display the download page, with the bundled GnuPG 1.0.6/GPA 0.5/WinPT
0.5.7 package.
Happy 'crypting,

Same here.
Of course. That is a great tactic to realize and deploy.
Well said, Veronica. I responded to a flame war on sci.crypt the other day,
with a long, drawn-out similar approach, as to how flaming really serves no
purpose, rather than boasting pride. In doing so, you miss out on key things
that could help narrow down the problem and potentially help solving it.
Let's keep the mailing list clean and to the point.
Let's discuss and learn, not flame. So, go with Graham's and Veronica's
advice and start now. There's no better time to do so.
A few more cents...

Well, assuming you are talking symmetrics, it is apparent that the larger
the key, the stronger, initially, however, if you are comparing the
relations of a 8192-bit symmetric key vs. a 1024-bit asymmetric, the
symmetric is evidently stronger, by far.
To make a comparison of symmetric/asymmetric key sizes, you could compare a
1024-bit asymmetric key (public key) to an 80-bit symmetric key.  Since the
levels of performance and attack properties are different between the two,
it is not accurate to compare any other key sizes between the two in this
If I had to recommend key sizes based on security, performance, and speed,
I'd say:
Symmetric: 128 bits (You'll find this as fast as a 64-bit key)
Asymmetric: 2048 bits
Hope this helps.

GPA is probably the best GUI for it, of which I use, along with WinPT
( due to its tasktray availability and clipboard
Working with GnuPG via command line is fairly simple, provided you
read over the man file and some documentation, however the GUI
automation is great, but, with GnuPP, of which is explained a bit
below, you can use the GUI utilities or still choose to run it at the
command line. Your call.

I would recommend downloading the GnuPP package, which bundles GnuPG,
GPA, and WinPT together for easy installation.
The GnuPP site it in German, but with a little help from Google
translation, you should be able to comprehend everything at:
As for integration with mail clients, on my Windows 98 box, I use
GPGOE (for Outlook Express), which utilizes the S/MIME encrypt/sign
buttons (although not using S/MIME) to do the GnuPG encrypt/sign
routines. I am well pleased with it, especially after migrating from
all the GUI eye-candy of PGP and its mail plugins.
Also, check  for plugins and such
which might be of use to you and whichever mail client you decide on
Hope this helps you get started with using the application. If you
have any questions, feel free to send 'em on.

if this
Right, my apologies. I used WinPT for key generation, however, so
I've had no problems. GPA 0.5.0 is packaged with GnuPP, so it would
be best to either
use WinPT or generate from the command line.
Thanks for pointing that out, Marc.

Actually, there are 3 active servers for this IRC network I speak of,
although, I understand your point.  The offer still stands, either way.
Ahh, SILCnet. This is a superb idea. As I've been familiar with it for quite
some time, the initial idea of using it here had not occurred to me then.
As it does utilize cryptography, it does fill an appropriate niche.
Thanks for your reply, as well as this idea.
As I said, the offer for the IRC channel still stands.  Whichever is the
most convenient and appropriate for the purpose is quite alright by me.
SILCnet may very well be.  However, my only question is, for the purpose of
a discussion medium alone, would a cryptographically-sound structure be
necessary? I ask this because I see that many do not even utilize
cryptography (GnuPG) on this mailing list, (encrypting, signing, et cetera.)
although some do.
Using cryptography is a great practice, as I do everyday, don't get me
wrong, but this happened to cross my mind.
True. I feel this is a promising step towards the future use of the SILC

I appreciate the reply.
True, it's isolation brings forth benefits. The largest channel consists of
10 to 15 regular users, with a maximum of about 25.  There are a few
channels with >5 users, making the total userbase very small compared to
Efnet, by far.
With this small userbase, we don't go through much hassle with lag time or
incompetent users who enjoy flooding the channel, et cetera.
Yes it is and not at all. Here is a list of the server hosts, most all of
which connect at port 6667 by default:
When you arrive, you can join  or  (base channel for the
Gamma security project, which is dormant at the moment), of which contains
most of the server operators and regulars.
I feel that this would be a great addition for discussion, along with the
mailing list, in that a group discussion can take place in real time.  If
anything, it can only provide convenience in some way to some people.  The
offer will stand, either way.
Feel free to drop by and check things out.
