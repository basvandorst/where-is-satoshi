@_subject: Programatic execution of GPG 
I'm looking for a way to programmatically execute GPG commands.  My
company is steering away from DOS Batch execution so my existing
automation will no longer be acceptable.  Does an API  or code wrapper
exist or has anyone tackled this issue?

@_subject: Key Ownership 
When I encrypt a file with the recipient's key I sometimes get the
"There is no indication that the key belongs to the user"
Why is this so and what can I do to eliminate this issue/error?

Please help me understand how I can run GPG to decrypt a file without human
intervention.  Currently I can use the --yes to handle all questions but
cannot feed in the passphrase.  I'm using v1.2.3 for windows and am very new
to the product.

@_subject: Can't find public key during encryption 
I run GPG 1.2.4 on a windows cluster using one of 3 users.  All users
except for 1 work fine on either node.  The failing user works on one
node of the cluster but not the other.  I verified that the registry
settings for are the same for all users.  I get the error below, of course only on
The failure is below.  Why is GPG looking to the C: drive for this
