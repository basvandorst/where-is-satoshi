@_subject: auto refresh-keys 
Hello every one!
I'm new to this list, but this seems a very interesting topic to me.
2010/6/4 Micah Anderson :
Thanks for this wounderful idea. I update my keys every now and then,
but it usually comes down to events like key signing parties. Which
is, in fact, very seldom.
Sounds good to me. Another consideration would be to pass this task to
gui frontends, like kleopatra or seahorse. A warning printed out by
gpg would be a good idea, too. Also, there should be a severe warning
if you sign a key, which hasn't been updated for months (or so).
Looking foreward to you opinions.

@_subject: What is the "list keyring content" command? 
$ gpg2 --no-default-keyring --keyring  --list-keys
It doesn't give me the same output, but this seems the most obviuous
command to me. I couldn't find the exact output either. I was missing
fingerprints, but --with-fingerprint didn't help.
Hope this helps,

@_subject: kwatchgnupg-Options 
Hello everyone,
there is a bug where kwatchgnupg adds gpg2-Options to gpg.conf,
whether it is a gpg2 config file or not. gpg refuses to work with
these invalid options.
Perhaps some of the devs might want to take a look at it, as it is
very annoying.
Thanks in advance.

@_subject: how to store the public keys in a db? 
Just my idea. I tried to understand the dispatcher code and keyring.c
Werner was referring to, but I would not know how to implement it.
Save each chunk as a seperate relational tuple?
By the way: Because of database design, even SQLite would probably be
faster for reading, but not for writing. But yes, a connection to
mysql/postgresql would be interesting for key servers. So, yes, please
keep the interface as generic as possible. I'm very interested in it.

@_subject: gpg command output language??? 
Hi there,
LANG=C is always ANSII. For UTF-8 use en_EN.UTF-8.
