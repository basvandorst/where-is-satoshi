Content-Disposition: inline
Ok.. So now I seem to have everything right messed up. :-(
My old key expired. I wanted to have interoperability between Linux
and Windows, so I generated my next key with PGP for Windows, and then
imported it into GPG.
Unfortunately, GPG seems to still like my old key (even if I disable
it). Although I get warnings when I decrypt that my key has expired,
when I encrypt it seems to still want to use the old key.
I think it'd be doing the same thing with signatures but for the fact
that I specified the default-key option to my new key.
Is there some way to get around this problem that doesn't involve
dumping my old key from my keyring (still handy for reading old

Yup. I have partially fixed the problem by forcing my ID in mailcrypt,
but I'd still like gpg to handle things correctly.

I need to clarify this:
1) By forcing the ID in .gnupg/options, I AM able to properly sign messages.
2) However, if I want to send self-encrypted messages, I have to
specify the key ID. If I specify a user id, GPG wants to use my old,
expired public key. This despite the fact that it's disabled (indeed,
if I disable the old key, GPG exits with a failure if I try to encrypt
to my own user id).

@_subject: RSA key-gen??? 
I downloaded GnuPG 1.0.3 thinking I'd finally be able to have RSA-based keys given that the patent has expired. However, it appears that you still can't generate RSA keys using GPG. I looked through the keygen code and removed a few  0 comments around RSA key generation, but as expected, generating an RSA-key with this code base results in a segmentation fault.
Is this still not possible or is there a devel version that actually has this feature?
