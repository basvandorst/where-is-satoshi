@_subject: GnuPG code in Mozilla: GPL issues? 
I recently posted to netscape.public.mozilla.crypto about OpenPGP support in
the Mozilla mail/news components.  I wanted to reuse code from gnupg (Yes, I
am lazy!), but I was warned of probable GPL violations if I did this.
What are your thoughts on this?  I wouldn't be attempting to distribute gpg
with mozilla, I was thinking more along the lines of a separately available
wrapper for gpg that works with moz.
Changing to another mailtool is not an option open to me.
