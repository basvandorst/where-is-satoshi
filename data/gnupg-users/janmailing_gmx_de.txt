@_subject: gpg called from apache 
I'm just implementing gpg support into imp (webmail client).
As the gpg executing process is the apache server there are some problems using gpg tries to access root's secring and isn't allowed of course because of missing rights. Is there a way to call gpg to at least verify signed messages without attempting to access the user's secring?
If I'll go further on there will be the need to encrypt/decrypt/sign messages for the webmail user. Because these users don't always have an account on the machine running apache/gpg it would be great if you can supply keyrings to gpg not from the filesystem but from stdin or some other way. Any ideas?

@_subject: verifying whithout key 
is there any way to verify signed messages without having the owners key? pgp complains but does the verifying, gpg doesn't at all.
