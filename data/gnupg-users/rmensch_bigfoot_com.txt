I'm the I.S. Manager for my corporation, and have no objection to
using free software -- use Apache for our Intranet, perl for some
production programs, and even GnuPG itself on a web site.
But those are items I can get directly at -- I know how they were
installed, and I can get to each and every file if needed to do
I don't have that type of access to the hordes of individual PCs
scattered around the corporation.
When someone in the corporation wants encryption security (count so
far: 3 including me), I get them commercial PGP for one reason: I know
what package they're getting, and I can walk them through the install
my eyes closed.
