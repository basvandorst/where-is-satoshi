@_subject: Problem generating keys on FSFE card 
I have been having similar problems with gpg 1.4.5 on debian etch. With
-   When trying to generate keys for the card the problem (to me) seemed
    that I was using a 2048 bit key for encryption. I therefore deleted
    that sub-key and tried again. This worked in that my card got
    populated but now I cannot decrypt old emails
-   In restoring my secring, I still cannot decrypt old email, and
    cannot generate new sub-keys for the card. When I do I get similar
    message to the above
I am trying to find a way to remove all my existing key data from the
card so I can start again

@_subject: FSFE Smart Card 
Running Debian-Etch
I deleted my decryption sub-key by mistake and my back up was incomplete...
After taking advice it seems that the only way forward is (in order) to:
-   Issue a new keypair
-   Sign the new-keypair with my current signature
-   Tell all those who signed my old-key of my new key ID
-   Revoke my old keypair
-   Publish my key
-   The FSFE website states that the recommended procedure is to use the
    smart card with sub-keys only. If however I am creating a new
    key-pair and backing up the secret key to a safe place, then what is
    the problem?
    If I lose my smart card would I not be able to continue with the
    backed up secret-key?
-   Is there any way to add a uid to the generated smart card, or is it
    possible to only use one identity?
Any assistance would be much appreciated    Sun Oct 29 18:25:08 GMT 2006

As a newbie who has just started using his card and in the expectation I
will be corrected where I am wrong:
Your public key is public, so why would you need to restore it?

Last night my system was updated
cron-apt: Setting up libccid (1.3.0-1) ...
cron-apt: Installing new version of config file /etc/reader.conf.d/libccidtwin ...
cron-apt: Installing new version of config file /etc/libccid_Info.plist ...
cron-apt: Installing new version of config file /etc/udev/pcscd_ccid.rules ...
cron-apt: Restarting PCSC Lite resource manager: pcscd.
Since then on trying to access my smart card (SCR335) I get the following
$ gpg --card-status
winscard_msg.c:97:SHMClientSetupSession() Error: connect to client socket: No such file or directory
gpg: pcsc_establish_context failed: no service (0x8010001d)
gpg: card reader not available
gpg: OpenPGP card not available: general error
I have removed and added all the files specified in  and in particular
-   libpcsclite-dev
-   libpcsclite1
-   pcscd
Can anyone suggest any solutions?

@_subject: Problem with FSFE gpg card 
Running Debian Lenny and have both gpg (1.4.6) and gpg2 (2.0.9) installed (I am still trying to learn more about gpg2)
This morning apt-get updated / installed the following
       console-common dbus dbus-x11 java-common libdbus-1-3 libevent1 libgcrypt11 libtasn1-3 Much as a few days ago (23 Apr), I could not use my card to decrypt a file as the card existence was not recognised. Furthermore in trying to use my backup key set, I could also not decrypt the file as the decryption command kept trying to find the gpg card...
In rebooting the computer (as per last time) all was fixed and the card works
I have two questions:
- As this has now happened twice, on the assumption that this will happen again, so that I can forward a complete bug report can anyone suggest what I should try to fix the problem WITHOUT rebooting.
- I like using the card, but I would like to be able to use gnupg without using the card (ie if I have to restore my complete key ring). Could anyone advise what the command is to force gpg to use a particular secret keyring
I tried $gpg2 --secret-keyring secring.gpg -d filename but that did not work
Any assistance / pointers gratefully received

@_subject: Problem with FSFE gpg card 
When I opened a new terminal, the problem was the same. Rebooting was the quickest solution.
Removed my card and then tried $gpg --homedir  -d file.gpg
and got the following message
gpg: anonymous recipient; trying secret key  ...
gpg: detected reader `SCM SCR 335 00 00'
gpg: pcsc_connect failed: no smartcard (0x8010000c)
gpg: apdu_send_simple(0) failed: no card
Please insert the card and hit return or enter 'c' to cancel: c
if I just entered
$gpg --homedir Then I get gpg: Go ahead and type your message ...
I have got to be making a silly mistake somewhere. Will take the time the to reread the manuals slowly and the set up commands of the card
Thanks

Yes (just rechecked) and I think I found the problem. For some reason the file is not being encrypted to my master file
Many thanks

Problem solved: in the gpg.conf file when referring to the other keys, I forgot to add the !
