@_subject: GPG encrypting and decrypting files 
I'm trying to encrypt a file and ftp it to another machine only to have
it decrypted on that machine, but I can't seem to get the files
When I go to encrypt the file, I use :
gpg --output [encrypted file] --encrypt --recipient [recipient] [file]
and it works just fine until I transfer the file to the other machine
for decrypting.  I have exported and imported the what I thought were
the proper keys, but it doesn't seem to want to decrypt on the other
machine, while testing (encrypting and decrypting) it on one machine
works just fine.
When I decrypt, I use :
gpg --output [decrypted file] --decrypt [encrypted file]
It seems like it should be correct, but for some reason, it just isn't
working.  The error message I receive is :
gpg: can't open `[filename]'
gpg: decrypt_message failed: file open error
The file is in the directory that I'm running the command is in, so I
know that my file is there.
If anyone has any help, that would be wonderful.

Both machines are running Linux.  The machine encrypting the files is
running Red Hat 8 and the decrypting machine is on SuSE 9.
I am transferring the files using a binary ftp transfer as the files
being encrypted are jpeg images.
so -b ) and attempting Could I get an example of what the detached signature command(s) should
look like?  I looked in the manpages and that didn't seem to help a
whole lot.  To generate the signature file, I tried using :
"gpg --output det.sig -b [filename]"
To encrypt the actual file, I used :
gpg --output [encrypted file] -br [recipient] --encrypt [unencrypted
However, when I try to decrypt the file, it asks for the signature file,
which I give the location and it tells me :
gpg: Signature made Mon 01 Mar 2004 11:17:01 AM PST using DSA key ID
gpg: BAD signature from "[recipient]"
Is there some other command I should be using for the detached
filename output The file being refused was the encrypted file being decrypted.
I seem to have gotten beyond this problem, and have come across a new
one.  When I go to decrypt the file, I get a message saying : gpg: encrypted with ELG-E key, ID 9012F1E4
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
When I "gpg --list-keys", the keys are identical on both the encrypting
and decrypting machines.  Is there something that I'm missing somewhere?
Naturally.  I actually changed the permissions to 777 immediately
following the transfer so I don't come across any permission problems.
