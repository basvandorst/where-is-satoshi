@_subject: GnuPG 2.2.8 -- Trouble Decrypting using PowerShell script 
Hi Team, We are lately running into some issues with the decrypting file using PGP.
In command prompt we are using  "& gpg -d --batch --passphrase comment C:\projects\successfactors\SuccessionTalentPool\incoming_files\Succession_Talent_Pool_Tableau_Report.csv.pgp "

We are passing the passphrase but when we run the script the a window pops up to enter the passphrase manually like this below.

On local if enter the passphase in above prompted window then it is able to decrypt the file. But on servers we can do that manually and that is the reason we are passing it to command prompt.
Kindly help us in resolving this issue. Let me know if you need more information.
