As it is a little bit ambiguous whether you had GnuPG installed in the
first place I just want to add a disclaimer as found on [1]; "Never
use a GnuPG version you just downloaded to check the integrity of the
source - use an existing GnuPG installation."
The question at hand has already been answered.

John's public DNS names are listed below that snippet.
But as also mentioned by John, the pool is running on quite a bit of
redundancy when it comes to DNS servers;
  Name Server: NS2.SKS-KEYSERVERS.NET
   Name Server: NS3.SKS-KEYSERVERS.NET
   Name Server: NS5.SKS-KEYSERVERS.NET
   Name Server: NS6.SKS-KEYSERVERS.NET
   Name Server: NS7.SKS-KEYSERVERS.NET
of which at least one of the DNS servers is a BGP AnyCast address. So
I'm very interested in hearing if anyone is having troubles with it....

Hash: SHA256
Hi Mick
If I understand your question correctly it is actually the other way
around, with the KeyID being based on the fingerprint.
Multiple keys can share the same KeyID, which is why for verification
purposes the fingerprint should always be used.

This is not what cert-digest-algo does, I'd recommend removing this
line at all, but;
       --cert-digest-algo name
              Use name as the message digest algorithm  used  when
              signing  a key.  Running  the  program  with the command
              --version yields a list of supported algorithms. Be aware
              that  if  you  choose  an algorithm  that GnuPG supports
              but other OpenPGP implementations do not, then some users
              will not be able to use the  key  signatures you make,
              or quite possibly your entire key.
Note that as per RFC4880 this will still not remove SHA1[0: 13.3.2.]
or 3DES[0: 13.2.], as these are appended tacitly to be able to ensure
a matching set between implementations.
Clearsign some text and see what hash it yield?
Also note what has been mentioned regarding the use of 1024 bit DSA
keys, which are limited to the use of 160 bit hash algo. If you wish
to use a non-truncated version of SHA256 and have such a key, you'll
have to propagate to a new one.

That will only prevent pinentry from grabbing the focus. You'd
probably want to add "pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry-curses" to
the config file as well (obviously changing the path to the
appropriate directory), iirc pasting is disabled in the GUI varieties
shipped in the main trunk, so these will require some patching to
allow pasting of passwords (e.g. with password managers).
An alternative could be to check out --passphrase-fd in man gpg.

Indeed, the number of recipients and their key parameters will be
significant for the time to encrypt.
Somewhat off-topic, but to provide a measurement for an encryption and
signing using a tin-foil hat key of 15360 bit key, since I for various
reasons keep one around in the first place, and don't really get to
use it too often;
On my email VM, which has 4 cores and 4 GB of RAM, the measurements
are as follows:

Hi John,
I'm using GnuPG (from the 2.x branch) on some servers running Windows
Server 2008 and 2008 R2 without issue. GPA not so frequently, but not
encountered issues in the little use I've had from it.
As previously mentioned though, there isn't a 64 bit version of GpgEx
(shell extension).

Hash: SHA256
Although GnuPG won't allow generation for larger keys than 4096 bits
without some hacking it will actually import and use such keys without
any modifications being needed (could try to import e.g. [1] from
[2]). So in that sense there seems to be some difference to the
reported behavior to ssh-agent.
Now, whether such a large key is really useful, that is indeed another

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

I agree, and don't see much of a reason not to use a long KeyID rather
than a short one.
However, please note that search for subkeys using the long keyID
format is only supported in SKS since version 1.1.3 announced 11 April
2012 (lookup for parent/regular public keys is supported before that),
so before implementing such a change I'd like to consider setting the
minimum requirement for the SKS pool[0] to 1.1.3.
Technically that is a rather easy change, however, it'd currently
reduce the number of available servers to about 15 from 61 in the pool
with min version requrement of 1.1.0 (current). So might have to give
the keyserver administrators some time to upgrade before that.
