Such an option would not only be nonsense, but dangerous. Imagine your "random" key id actually is an existing real key id! The affected user would not be amused... Would you check every fake key id you create that it is not an already existing real key id?
If you really want a fake id, why not create a unique key for just one singular message/purpose?
"Hiding anonymity" with a fake key id makes no sense. Imagine you use some kind of anonymous remailer or proxy or whatever to transmit such a message, then you gain nothing with a fake key id, because the IP adresses of those services are often well known and so every eavesdropper will see that there's anonymous communication.
--throw-keyid has the advantage that you can use a trusted,existing key and if your recipient receives such a message he/she can be confident that there was no man-in-the-middle attack.
