@_subject: Backup .gnupg using git 
I created a master key and three subkeys following instructions at [1].
I've backed up the secret keys using paperbackup with a modification
to add the sequence count to the backed up data so as to identify any qr-codes
that don't get decoded properly [2] and deleted the master secret key.
I then transferred the secret subkeys to a yubikey as per [3].
Finally I backed up .gnupg to github [4].
Then to restore the I clone the repo and change permissions to 700:
$ git clone git at github.com:winksaville/.gnupg ~/.gnupg
$ chmod 700 ~/.gnupg
And then insert the yubikey and get the card-status to retrieve the
stub secret keys have gpg functional.
$ gpg --card-status
Comments on the security of what I'm doing?

Not-Mossad, it seems if its Mossad it doesn't matter. My goal is to have
as good a security as possible while make it relatively easy to use. Using
the smart card seemed to increase the security by not having any secret
keys directly on my computer, hence that choice.

I'm ignorant and didn't realize what I did :)
At the moment I've not signed any keys nor have I had any signed so nothing
lost so far (I think). On the other hand, I haven't run across any
information that
would allow me to control what information other people might leak.
Also, it would seem if you're using "Public Key Encryption" you have to assume
all "Public" information is already leaked, correct?
Definitely me.
I'm using 2.2.6 on Arch Linux systems which I update about once a week,
so hopefully keeping up to date and I'm now "just using the defaults".
TXS, Wink
