If you want to use gpg1 with Enigmail, use /usr/bin/gpg .
If you want to use gpg2 with Enigmail, use /usr/bin/gpg2 .
use /usr/bin/gog2, you might need to install "gnupg2".
If you are unsure, just use /usr/bin/gpg, it should work with all Debian
based systems (including Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint etc.).

Both GPG and GPG2 use the same ~/.gnupg directory.
1. I don't understand this question.
2. You said that you are on Linux Mint, which uses apt, which requires
gpg1, so you might get warnings when trying to remove it. I recommend
just keeping both.
3. As I said above, both use ~/.gnupg. If you want to use gpg2 with
Enigmail, open Enigmail preferences and on basic tab you should see gpg
location. Check the "override with" box and write (or browse) /usr/bin/gpg2.

If you ask on Enigmail mailing list, they will tell you that that
issue is with Mailman (or other mailing list software) which messes up
with headers and makes PGP/MIME unverifiable. They will also say that
this is why they recommend PGP/INLINE, it's more resistant to messing
