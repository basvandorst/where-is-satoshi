@_subject: gpa-0.6.0 compile and run problems 
Hi, I've never used a PGP type prog before, and GPG looked Like a good
place to start.
I compiled gnupg-1.2.1 and installed it succesfully, as well as
gpgme-0.4.0. I also seemingly compiled gpa-0.6.0. When I try to run gpa
though, I get an
"gpa: error while loading shared libraries: libgpgme.so.10: cannot open
shared object file: No such file or directory"
however locate libgpgme.so.10 claims
So it's where it should be, I guess.
I'm running debian, if that's of any use.
Is GPA looking for this lib in there wrong place? how do I find out where
it's looking? how can I tell it where to look?
