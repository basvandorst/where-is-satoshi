Next time they will patent the `sin' function ... :-(

What about this one (from `man gpg')?
       --passphrase-fd n
           Read the passphrase from file descriptor n. If you use
           0 for n, the passphrase will be read from stdin.  This
           can only be used if only one passphrase is supplied.
           Don't use this option if you can avoid it
(You want to work with a nonzero `n', of course.)
Hope this helps,
    Peter

Not really:
    birdie/home/peter/src> diff -Nurp gpa-0.4.3 gpa-0.5.0 | wc
      31654  113267  954484
The source code is under the GNU GPL and publicly available for
free. That's not exactly what I'd call "closed development".
There was a deadline to meet. Keeping the CVS in sync and
discussing everything on this list would have meant to miss it.
So I just went on my way and produced gpa-0.5.0.tar.gz in time.
If you are willing to spend two months or so improving GPA, be
welcome to do it your way.
Currently I do not have the time to sync the new source with the
CVS - sorry for that. (For example, I would have to write a *long*
ChangeLog, and to hack my changes to the Makefiles into the various
autofoo input files - and I am not familiar with those autofoo

It is usable now.
Perfect. Then you will have no problem with GPA 0.5.0:
If you don't like it, don't use it.
You seem to know exactly what has to be done. Please do it then.
If you don't like the way how GPA 0.5.0 was created, be welcome to
do it better. You have the full source code of both GPA 0.5.0 and
0.4.3, and the GNU GPL grants you full permission to use it.
This is not a drink-or-die situation as with proprietary software.
You have the freedom.
BTW, as far as GPA is concerned, *we* gave this freedom to you.
