@_subject: bad signature 
I'm running gnupg 1.0.1 on Linux
Home: ~/.gnupg
Supported algorithms:
Cipher: 3DES, CAST5, BLOWFISH, TWOFISH
Pubkey: ELG-E, DSA, ELG
Hash: MD5, SHA1, RIPEMD160
When I sign and encrypt a message using my public key, correspondents using PGP 6.5.6 on both Mac and Windows machines report a bad signature, yet are able to de-crypt my message. Has anyone else seen this behaviour, is it a bug, or am I simply overlooking something glaringly obvious in either configuration or documentation?
Thanks in advance,
chris couples
