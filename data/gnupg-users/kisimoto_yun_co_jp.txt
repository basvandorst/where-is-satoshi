@_subject: How to set HomeDir with Registry Editor 
I am using windows2000.
And I am trying to set different HomeDir from "C:\gnupg", using Registry Editor.
README.W32 seems to say that under the key
new path should be set.
I set "D:\gnupg" for the value, "REG_SZ" for the data type and "HomeDir" for the name of value, but it does not work. GnuPG tries to create "C:\gnupg".
I may be doing something different from normal procedure, so would you please teach me correct procedure with examples.
Thank you.

@_subject: How to replace public key? 
I am looking for the way to replace only my own public key without changing private key.
I tried "gpg --delete-key my_own_name", but without removing private key, I could not delete my own public key.
Would you please teach me the way if it's possible.
Thank you.
