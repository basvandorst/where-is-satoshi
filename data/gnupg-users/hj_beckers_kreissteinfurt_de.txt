@_subject: GnuPG 1.0.7 & AIX 4.3.3 
I'm trying the above combination. Gpg is compiled as mentioned in the mail-archives with
"--enable-static-rnd=egd '--with-egd-socket=~/.gnupg/entropy' --dysable-dynload". Egd is running.
When I run "gpg --gen-key" and answer all questions, it runs for a while (2-4 minutes) and stops
then with the following error:
"gpg: out of  memory while allocating 0 bytes"
Running "make check" as suggested in the egd-0.8-README gives the same "Making check in intl
