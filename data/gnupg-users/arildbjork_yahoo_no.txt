In news.txt there is a reference to gpg-zip:
    * Added "gpg-zip", a program to create encrypted archives
that can
      interoperate with PGP Zip.
I've searched the manual and the installation path for gnupg for
Windows and I can't find the program or find it mentioned in the
manual. Why isn't it included in the Windows version?
