@_subject: Using symmettric keys in GPG 
I want to use GPG in our office, and want to use symmetric encryption for sending files.. The reason being the files are too big (> 400 MB) and to encrypt them using public-key becomes too slow.. How can I generate symmetric keys using my choice of the algorithm and will the receiver automatically find out what algorithm I am using or does he have to make changes to his GPG too?/
