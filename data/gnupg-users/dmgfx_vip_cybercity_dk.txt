@_subject: default key length of Blowfish in GPG? 
I'm using version 1.0.1 of GPG, but only for symmetric encryption, by
using the -c argument. I know that the Blowfish is the default algorithm
in GPG's symmetric encryption, but what is the key length set to? I read
that Blowfish supports variable key length(32-448bits).
