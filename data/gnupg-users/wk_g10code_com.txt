@_subject: [Announce] GnuPG 1.9.16 (S/MIME) released 
Hash: SHA1
We are pleased to announce the availability of GnuPG 1.9.16; the
development branch of GnuPG featuring the S/MIME protocol.
GnuPG 1.9 is the development version of GnuPG; it is based on some old
GnuPG 1.3 code and the previous NewPG package.  It will eventually
lead to a GnuPG 2.0 release.  Note that GnuPG 1.4 and 1.9 are not yet
in sync and thus features and bug fixes done in 1.4 are not available
in 1.9.  *Please keep on using 1.4.x for OpenPGP*; 1.9.x and 1.4.x may
be installed simultaneously.
You should use GnuPG 1.9 if you want to use the gpg-agent or gpgsm
(the S/MIME variant of gpg).  The gpg-agent is also helpful when using
the stable gpg version 1.4 (as well as the old 1.2 series).
This is mainly a bug fix release but comes with some new features as
 * gpg-agent does now support the ssh-agent protocol and thus allows
   to use the pinentry as well as the OpenPGP smartcard with ssh.
 * New tool gpg-connect-agent as a general client for the gpg-agent.
 * New tool symcryptrun as a wrapper for certain encryption tools.
 * The gpg tool is not anymore build by default because those gpg
   versions available in the gnupg 1.4 series are far more matured.
Please get it from the mirrors as listed at
 or direct from ftp.gnupg.org:
  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/alpha/gnupg/gnupg-1.9.16.tar.bz2    (1667k)
  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/alpha/gnupg/gnupg-1.9.16.tar.bz2.sig
 or as a patch against the previous release:
  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/alpha/gnupg/gnupg-1.9.15-1.9.16.diff.bz2 (108k)
You will also need to get a new libksba (the X.509 and CMS parser):
  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/alpha/libksba/libksba-0.9.11.tar.bz2 (443k)
  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/alpha/libksba/libksba-0.9.11.tar.bz2.sig
 a patch is also available:
  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/alpha/libksba/libksba-0.9.10-0.9.11.diff.bz2   (112k)
GnuPG 1.9 makes use of a separate tool for CRL checking, this is
called the Dirmngr.  We have also released a new version of it and we
suggest to update to that release:
  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/alpha/dirmngr/dirmngr-0.9.2.tar.bz2  (463k)
  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/alpha/dirmngr/dirmngr-0.9.2.tar.bz2.sig
 as usual we also provide a patch:
  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/alpha/dirmngr/dirmngr-0.9.1-0.9.2.diff.bz2 (16k)

GnuPG: remotely controllable function pointer [CVE-2006-6235]
    ===============================================================
                              2006-12-04
Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo security team identified a severe and
exploitable bug in the processing of encrypted packets in GnuPG.
[ Please do not send private mail in response to this message.  The
  mailing list gnupg-devel is the best place to discuss this problem
  (please subscribe first so you don't need moderator approval [1]). ]
Using malformed OpenPGP packets an attacker is able to modify and
dereference a function pointer in GnuPG.  This is a remotely
exploitable bug and affects any use of GnuPG where an attacker can
control the data processed by GnuPG.  It is not necessary limited to
encrypted data, also signed data may be affected.
Affected versions: All versions of GnuPG   < 1.4.6                    All versions of GnuPG-2 < 2.0.2
                   All beta versions of GnuPG-2 (1.9.0 .. 1.9.95)
Affected tools: gpg, gpgv, gpg2 and gpgv2.
Affected platforms: All.
gpg-agent, gpgsm as well as other tools are not affected.
A workaround is not known. If you are using a vendor supplied version of GnuPG:
 * Wait for an update from your vendor.  Vendors have been informed on
   Saturday December 2, less than a day after this bug has been reported.
If you are using GnuPG 1.4:  * Update as soon as possible to GnuPG 1.4.6. It has been uploaded to
   the usual location: ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/gnupg/.  This version
   was due to be released anyway this week.  See
    for details.
 * Or: As another and less intrusive option, apply the attached patch
   to GnuPG 1.4.5.  This is the smallest possible fix.
If you are using GnuPG 2.0:
 * Apply the attached patch against GnuPG 2.0.1.
 * Or: Stop using gpg2 and gpgv2, install GnuPG 1.4.6 and use gpg and gpgv
   instead.
If you are using a binary Windows version of GnuPG:
 * A binary version of GnuPG 1.4.6 for Windows is available as usual.
 * Gpg4win 1.0.8, including GnuPG 1.4.6, is available.  Please go to
    .
GnuPG uses data structures called filters to process OpenPGP messages.
These filters ware used in a similar way as a pipelines in the shell.
For communication between these filters context structures are used.
These are usually allocated on the stack and passed to the filter
functions.  At most places the OpenPGP data stream fed into these
filters is closed before the context structure gets deallocated.
While decrypting encrypted packets, this may not happen in all cases
and the filter may use a void contest structure filled with garbage.
An attacker may control this garbage.  The filter context includes
another context used by the low-level decryption to access the
decryption algorithm.  This is done using a function pointer.  By
carefully crafting an OpenPGP message, an attacker may control this
function pointer and call an arbitrary function of the process.
Obviously an exploit needs to prepared for a specific version,
compiler, libc, etc to be successful - but it is definitely doable.
Fixing this is obvious: We need to allocate the context on the heap
and use a reference count to keep it valid as long as either the
controlling code or the filter code needs it.
We have checked all other usages of such a stack based filter contexts
but fortunately found no other vulnerable places.  This allows to
release a relatively small patch.  However, for reasons of code
cleanness and easier audits we will soon start to change all these
stack based filter contexts to heap based ones.
Support g10 Code GmbH, a Duesseldorf based company owned and headed by GnuPG's
principal author, is currently funding GnuPG development.  As evident
by the two vulnerabilities found within a week, a review of the entire
code base should be undertaken as soon as possible.  As maintainers we
try to do our best and are working slowly through the code.  The long
standing plan is to scrutinize the 2.0 code base, write more test
cases and to backport new fixes and cleanups to 1.4.  However, as a
small company our resources are limited and we need to prioritize
other projects which get us actual revenues.  Support contracts or
other financial backing would greatly help us to improve the quality
of GnuPG.

@_subject: [Announce] Libgcrypt 1.4.6 released 
Hello! The GNU project is pleased to announce the availability of Libgcrypt
version 1.4.6.
Libgcrypt is a general purpose library of cryptographic building
blocks.  It is originally based on code used by GnuPG.  It does not
provide any implementation of OpenPGP or other protocols.  Thorough
understanding of applied cryptography is required to use Libgcrypt. Noteworthy changes in version 1.4.6:
 * New variants of the TIGER algorithm.         * New cipher algorithm mode for AES-WRAP.
Source code is hosted at the GnuPG FTP server and its mirrors as
listed at .  On the
primary server the source file and its digital signature is:
 ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.4.6.tar.bz2 (1125k)
 ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.4.6.tar.bz2.sig
This file is bzip2 compressed.  A gzip compressed version is also

For help on developing with Libgcrypt you should read the included
manual and optional ask on the gcrypt-devel mailing list [1].  Note
that this version is from the stable branch; the current development
version is available at  .
Improving Libgcrypt is costly, but you can help!  We are looking for
organizations that find Libgcrypt useful and wish to contribute back.
You can contribute by reporting bugs, improve the software [2], order
extensions or support or more general by donating money to the Free
Software movement (e.g. ).
Commercial support contracts for Libgcrypt are available [3], and they
help finance continued maintenance.  g10 Code GmbH, a Duesseldorf
based company, is currently funding Libgcrypt development.  We are
always looking for interesting development projects.
Many thanks to all who contributed to Libgcrypt development, be it bug
fixes, code, documentation, testing or helping users.
Happy hacking,
  Werner
