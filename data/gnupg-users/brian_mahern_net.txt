@_subject: new install - old version number 
I downloaded, compiled and installed the latest version of GnuPG (1.2.4).  When I run it from the command line with the --version command it still shows the older version. (1.0.6), but when it used in through Enigmail the signed message indicates the the newer version.  What gives?  Which is it?
