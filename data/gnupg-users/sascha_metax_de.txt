The CVS gnus (version 5.8.8) has also a quite good integration of PGP
and GPG.  It is able to process S/MIME, too, though I haven't testet
this yet.

Ok.  Then your plugin is the first I know of, which enables OE to make
use of PGP/MIME, gratulations.  I'd love to advertise it to my
contacts, but I'm afraid the installation process still is too much
for the regular win* user.  Can you implement some installation
routine which ommits the editing of gnupg-w32.reg and adding new
buttons manually?  That would be very helpful.

I tried GPA agan and it works at light speed compared to seahorse.  So
please ignore my complaints and simply see it as a feature request to
seahorse to use gpgme, too.

I haven't tried it myself, but you can use crypt++.el which is almost
exactly what you are looking for.
        ftp://ftp.cs.umb.edu/pub/misc/crypt++.el=20
should be its URI.

Hi all!
After some keysigning I was notified that my key on wwwkeys.pgp.net
is unuseable.   After taking a closer look there are strange
effects.  This is my key:
pub  1024D/CC611EE6 2000-01-26 Sascha Luedecke (private) uid                            Moxon sub  2048g/85D3C1A7 2000-01-26 [expires: 2003-01-25]
sub  2048g/BC8DCB23 2003-04-04 [expires: 2006-04-03]
sub  1024D/5240B9BF 2003-04-04 [expires: 2006-04-03]
1. Problem: uploading to the keyserver
When I export my key to the hkp://wwwkeys.pgp.net keyserver:
a)  gnupg doesn't give me an error message
    gpg --verbose --send-key cc611ee6
    The key is silently accepted but the new subkeys are _not_ listed
    on the keyserver.  I tried this at least three times (giving it a
    night to update its databse) with no success (but other effects,
    see blow).
    Maybe GnuPG should give some error message (if hkp tells it about
    errors).
b)  parts of the key get rejected.  When submitting through the
    webinterface, the result is:
    Key block in add request contained no new
    keys, userid's, or signatures.
    Your key block contained 5 format errors,
    which were treated as if the erroneous elements
    hadn't been part of your submission.
    The last error was on key 0x037aaac0:
    Key block corrupt: more than one signature on subkey
    Aha.  gpg tells me that (gpg --export --armor cc611ee6 | gpg --verbose -)

    sig        CC611EE6 2003-04-04   [keybind]
    Whats going wrong here?
2. Problem:  replicating selfsigs
I "gpg --recv-key" several times since I have been on a keysigning
party this weekend.  Each time I get some new signatures which is
great (thanks if anyone of them is listening).   But:  each time I

Hi David, hi list!
Hm, bad luck for me this time then.  There are some _new_ servers in
the rise calling themselves SKS, but I am sorry to say that even those
are not yet OK now.  One of them lists a subkey of mine as revoked
which is definitely isn't.  So I'll avoid any of them in the future.
I do :)  But I am left with a massive self-signed key.  Any way to
remove the extra ones?

Hi David, hi all!
Yup, noticed that.  So the fighting began ...
Besides that:  thanks to Werner and all the others who made a great
product.  Keep up the good work!
