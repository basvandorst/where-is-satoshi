I get a "redefinition" error when trying to compile the IDEA algorithm module on Mac OS X 10.1.2 + DevTools Dec-01.
Any advice greatly appreciated.

I have been trying to compile the IDEA module under Mac OS X 10.1.2 with DevTools Dec-01. I think I solved the repeated definition issue by commenting out the line re "ushort". Then I compiled idea.c again and got the following error:
[localhost:~/] user1%cc -Wall -O2 -shared -fPIC -o idea idea.c
the term g10_log_fatal first appears in the code as:
void g10_log_fatal( const char *fmt, ... );
Is this function not defined? What to do next?
Any advice appreciated. Kindly CC me your replies.

I understand -c means compiling without linking. Yes, it compiles and doesn't complain about missing fuctions anymore. Thanks! Now I have put the compiled idea file in ~/.gnupg and added the line "load-extension idea" to my options file, but I stall can't sign my old keys. It still say:
gpg: protection algorithm 1 is not supported
gpg: signing failed: unknown cipher algorithm
Checking my gpg version, the follow ciphers are listed:
Cipher: 3DES, CAST5, BLOWFISH, RIJNDAEL, RIJNDAEL192, RIJNDAEL256, TWOFISH
Pubkey: RSA, RSA-E, RSA-S, ELG-E, DSA, ELG
Hash: MD5, SHA1, RIPEMD160
I have also tried putting the idea module in /usr/local/bin/, same results.
Am I doing something silly or does the source need to be further modified?
Kindly cc me on your replies.

Thanks David for your advice. I have moved the idea file to the default lib directory but i'm still getting "protection algorithm 1 is not supported" error. I chmod the file to -rwxr-xr-x, but not the group and owner, which is me as an standard admin user on mac os x. should the owner be root? if the idea file loads correctly, would gpg --version report the extra cipher supported?
(please cc me)
