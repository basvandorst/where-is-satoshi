@_subject: key backups 
I don't know whether I'm too stupid - I want to create a backup copy of
both the secret and the public part of my key and save it on a floppy.
I'm using gnupg under Windows and do not find any parameter which does this
When I create it using the Privacy assistant, the backup fails saying "GPA
Error: no valid public key specified.".
Thanx for your help
