@_subject: Encrypt to key outside of keyring 
is there a way to encrypt data to a specific key, which is not in the keyring, but instead present as a single keyfile?
So instead of calling something like:
$ gpg --recipient  -e you could write something like:
$ gpg --recipient-file  -e $ gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring /tmp/keyring.once --import $ gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring /tmp/keyring.once --recipient  -e but I would prefer it, if it could be done in one step and without creating a temporary file. It's also bothering, that I still have to tell the second command the KEY-ID, even if there is only a single key in the Keyfile.
If there doesn't exist an option like this yet (which is probably the case since I couldn't find it, but maybe I'm looking for the wrong thing), where could I fill in a feature request?

@_subject: export-minimal and expired subkeys 
just a short question: Does the ?export-minimal? option also remove unusable (expired) subkeys, or not?
The manpage only mentions user IDs and signatures.
If not, is there a simple way to minimize the export further by dropping those subkeys?

@_subject: Encrypt directly to keyfile 
Hi folks,
I already asked the question here about half a year ago, but IIRC didn't get any reaction:
Imagine you have a file containing one or more PGP-Public-Keys, and you want to encrypt something for this key, without adding the key to your public keyring. Is there some commandline option to easily achieve this?
I would expect something like:
$ gpg --recipient-file  -e
instead of:
$ gpg --recipient  -e
I can achieve something similar, by using:
$ gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring /tmp/keyring.once --import $ gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring /tmp/keyring.once --trust-model always --recipient  -e
But this requires an additional temporary file (which needs to be deleted), and I still have to look for the Key-IDs in the file, to give them as parameters.
If there isn't an option for this, I think it would be a neat feature to implement.
One might ask what this is good for:
I'm thinking mostly about automated systems. Imagine a webforum, mailinglist or something similar. The interface could provide the user with an input-area to paste a public key(s) into, and then every automated mail (like forgotten-password, notifications or reminders) could be encrypted directly to those keys.

Does this really work?
I mean especially the part: --recipient "$KEY_ID"
in case the string contains more than one ID, my version of GnuPG only encrypts to the first one mentioned.
I have to specify --recipient KEY1 --recipient KEY2 and so on.
