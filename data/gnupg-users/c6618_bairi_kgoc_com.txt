@_subject: Exporting a private Key 
I have generated the key pair using the command line on Unix machine. I
have a couple of questions here
1>     How can I back up the secret key while generating the key pair
from the command line
2>     If I miss taking the back up of the secret key is there a way to
export the secret key. Kindly please give the command.
