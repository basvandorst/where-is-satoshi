Hash: SHA1
I have been trying, very unsuccessfully for the last few days to
configure Cygwin on a Windows XP machine so that I can build GPA 0.7.0.
I keep getting error messages when I am trying to install glib, gtk+
etc. which seem to be dependency errors. I have tried Googleing for the
errors and seem to be getting bogged down in stuff that I am not
convinced applies to Cygwin, as the suggestions give more errors.
Has anybody here built GPA 0.7.0 for Windows before, and if so, would
you have any instructions or a list of dependencies that I could follow?
If not, does anybody know a good intro to building programs on linux
that would help get me pointed in the right direction?
Any help gratefully appreciated.

I had a similar problem using the G-Data plugin for Outlook with
Outlook 2003 Beta. In my case it went through the motions of
signing but never signed the message. If I open the message in
the outbox and re-sign it there it would work fine.
Gave up with the plugin and just use GPGShell to sign current
window. You can do the same thing with WinPT and at least you
know it is done before you hit send.

You could try Mozilla Thunderbird with Enigmail.

@_subject: gpg.conf and groups 
Hash: SHA1
I am trying to configure a group in GPG with Thunderbird and Enigmail on
Windows XP.
I can get the group to work with no problem providing I have all the
group user addresses on the same line as the group statement.
This can get somewhat out of hand with a large group and was wondering
if anybody had any idea on how to split the group over a number of lines?
I am given to understand that on Unix you can do this with a \ at the
end of a line and it will be able to continue on the next line. On
Windows GPG complains about this.
Thanks in advance for any ideas on how to get round this.

In Thunderbird, go to Enigmail menu > Preferences > Sending Tab, uncheck
"Allowed flowed text (RFC 2646)".
This is normally a symptom of this being switched on.

Hash: SHA1
There are no v1.3.92 binaries for Windows on the GnuPG site so you must
have got it from somewhere else.
John Clizbe wrote on the list yesterday:
iconv.dll is needed. The best (as in "easiest to install") place to
get it from is the gettext project on SourceForge:
Open the ZIP with WinZIP (or other archiver) and extract iconv.dll to
your GnuPG binary directory.
I dropped iconv.dll into my Windows/System32 folder so that it is
available to all applications and it works fine for me there.

See the message below from Timo Schulz regarding an updated release of
the G-Data plugin. I use this version with Outlook 2003, GnuPG
v1.4.1-cvs and GPGshell all with no problem sending binaries as attachments.

Hi Yousef,
What format are you trying to write your emails in in Outlook? If you
are using anything other than plain text that will cause problems too.
