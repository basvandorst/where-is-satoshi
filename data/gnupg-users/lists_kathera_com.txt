@_subject: Multiple Identities 
I'm roughly familiar with GnuPG and have used it in the past when I had a single presence, a single e-mail address, etc.
I'm in a position now where I'm using multiple e-mail addresses, for different purposes, but want to share the same key for the sake of simplicity in my applications (Enigmail for example).  I know it's possible to use one key for multiple e-mail addresses/identities but I'm not sure how to go about doing it.
Any tips would be appreciated.
