@_subject: Explain it again, Sam 
Hash: SHA1
I would appreciate a few recommendations for online PGP primers.  PGP
for dummies, I guess.  I have OpenPGP on Thunderbird, and I would like
to understand purpose, usage, and best practices.  Again, I'm going
for learning and understanding, not just having another application on
my machine that isn't used.

I switched from XP to Ubuntu 6.06, now the SCR338 cardreader built into
the keyboard doesn't work.
~$ gpg --card-status

@_subject: Gnupg error 
Hi, I'm posting this on multiple forums in the hope of getting my
mistake corrected.
I'm running Ubuntu 7.04, Thunderbird 2.0, Enigmail 0.95.  It was working
fine with gpg 1.4.6 or gpg 2.0.2.  I installed gpg 2.0.3 yesterday, it
was working fine.  Today 1.4.6 and 2.0.3 both have errored out.
Enigmail key management says "loading keys" but never does.  Any
encrypted and/or signed message times out without displaying.
Any guidance will be appreciated.  Please don't sign your message(s), I
need to read them!

I don't know the why, just the what.  I deleted pubring.gpg.lock,
secring.gpg.lock, and pubring.gpg.tmp from /.gnupg.  Errors gone, I just
don't know how I created them.

@_subject: Smartcard not recognized 
I've been unable to access my smartcard since switching to Linux.  I'm running Ubuntu 7.04, Thunderbird 2.0, Enigmail 0.95, gpg 2.0.4 and
gpg 1.4.7.
I know Linux will support it, and would really appreciate some ideas on
where the
problem lies.

I have returned to a previous ISP, and they've given me a new email
address for my secondary email.  How do I edit it on my key?  I need
to delete and/or revoke uid and keep  the new one.

Thank you sir, worked fine.  I had read the instructions, but wanted
to ensure I got them right before committing.
