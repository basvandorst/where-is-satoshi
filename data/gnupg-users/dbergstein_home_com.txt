I followed the procedures recommended for exporting and
reimporting my public and secret keyrings.  However, it appears
that expiration dates for public keys are not correctly read
under v1.05.  Here is an example of an expired key:

I neglected to mention this issue is on the win32 binary and have not
checked to see if it happens under gnupg v1.05 for linux.

I was able to duplicate the same problem on my linux system (kernel 2.4.3)
on gnupg v1.05.  However, when spot checked another public key that had
expired last year, the expiration date did not appear to shift like it did
with my old public key below, which I believe was generated under gnupg
Any insight into this problem is appreciated.

similar problems have recently been observed for recent dates on my keyring

a facsimile of my observations for two of my public keys that I expired

I was able to duplicate this behavior in both the win32 (Win2k) and linux
(2.4.3) environments.  The incorrect dates were displayed the same way in
all cases, including using keys imported locally and from keyservers.  When
I reloaded gnupg v1.04, the correct expiration dates were displayed.
