@_subject: Another step towards crowdfunding 
How about an RSS-Feed.
This would be a nifty trade-off. Clients like newsbeuter, gnus, liferea
already provide a somewhat 'summarized' view of the blogpost and would
allow your favourite browser to show the whole article, provided that you want to
read more.
That creates traffic to the blog itself and points interested people to gnupg.org.
Additionally, RSS offers the opportunity of syndication.
Those who don't want to use a rss-client of its own or the rss-feature
of their mail-client could still use a browser-plugin. The RSS-Feed could be archived via gmane/gwene.

General Description:
On GNU/Linux:
 - > gentoo  - > debian Keepass is not "for [your] personal password file", instead it allows
you to build and manage your own password database.
Perhaps it fits your use case.

@_subject: signatures from revoked key, trusted? 
Hi Gabriel,
'Correctness' refers to the result of the process of 'verifying a
signature' - this has nothing to do with 'trusting a key'.
Correctness and trust belong to different realms.
You need to separate both concepts.
gpg(1) labels a signature as 'good' in order to attest that the file it
just verified - (a) has indeed been signed by a specific private key(!) and
- (b) that this file hasn't been modified in any way on it's way to you.
gpg(1) does this by 'relating' your friend's public key(!) to this key's
(More information
       esp. last paragraph.
      'trust' - on the other hand - describes how thorough you have checked
the relation of ownership(!) between the key and the one who claims to own
(More Information
        If Person_X claims to own Some_PubKey and you have checked successfully,
that Person_X really does own it, you may start to give Person_X's key a
trust-value of 'enough'. (Now Some_PubKey appears to be Person_X's key.)
To wrap it up: 'verifying' is 'checking a checksum' - and a particular
checksum may be 'correct' even if you don't trust the key.
Hope that solves at least one of your questions.
