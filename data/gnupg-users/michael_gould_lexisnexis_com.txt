@_subject: how to do 
Currently we use do not use pgp for email, only to decrypt and/or encrypt customer files for processing.  We currently use a single user id for this however this doesn't allow us to audit the use.  What I was wondering is can I create a public key that has everyone's email address in it that should have access to a specific private key?  If not any other suggestions or example or URL of places that have detailed explanations would be appreciated.
Best Regards
Michael Gould
