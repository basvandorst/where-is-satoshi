Ohh.. I thougth that one nice thing with gnupg whas that you should be
able to encrypt to and from pgp, gpg and other users without to mush
problems. It's a fact that pgp is mush more used than gpg, so i think pgp
should be fully compatible with pgp by default (as long as it's not a
violation to openPGP). If gpg are to replace pgp (as I understand you wold
like?), it would be nice to be as compatible as possible.
