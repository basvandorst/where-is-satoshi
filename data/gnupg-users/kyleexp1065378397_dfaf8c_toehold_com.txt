@_subject: Signing headers (was Re: Evolution signatures) 
Hash: SHA1
Just to throw another wrench in this, I've frequently wanted ENCRYPTED
subjects.  When I'm sending a private mail, I find myself using a
"practically blank" subject like "Note" or "Hi" because I don't want the
subject available to third parties any more than I want them to read the
contents of the message.
I consider some headers (especially the subject) to be part of the
communication of a message.  As such, I'd like to protect the privacy and
integrity of those parts the same way as the message itself, as much as
that's possible.
The alternate extreme is that we throw away all the (unsigned) headers and
try to understand the message as best we can from what's in it--who signed
it, what it says, what the date stamp on the signature was, etc.  I dislike
that option.
