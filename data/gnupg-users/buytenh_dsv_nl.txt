@_subject: only accept sig when from .... ?? 
Hi all,
What I would like to see in gnupg is a command-line option specifying
'Only return with a successfull exit code when the signature was made by
this key-id'. I believe there is no such option currently (or is there?)
(Yes, I know I can do this with a filter and --status-fd.)
Please CC me, as I'm not on this list.

What if you redirect stderr to stdout?
How does gpg find your keyring? Did you do a 'export HOME=/home/myname' ?
