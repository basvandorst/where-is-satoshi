@_subject: Cant decrypt in IIS hosted wcf service but works fine in console 
Hello Team,
.Net WCF service development issues with GPG.
I am using GPG for Encryption and Decryption of the message, however, I could not decrypt the message in WCF service hosted in IIS. But I can decrypt using the same code in console application.
Please check the same and do the needful.
Error : {"gpg: encrypted with RSA key, ID 642C729C\r\ngpg: encrypted with RSA key, ID 765F4971\r\ngpg: decryption failed: No secret key\r\n"}
Thanks & Regards,
Janardhan Bonthu
