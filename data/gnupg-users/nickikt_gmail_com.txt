@_subject: How to configure Smartcard without 'toggle' 
Hallo all,
I have the same issue as in this bug [1]. When I '--edit-key' the 'toggle'
command will not show the private keys. I don't understand the comments in
the bugticket and the question asked by 'einalex' seems relevant.
"perhaps I missed something but...with the command removed how are we able
to see the private keys (esp the details on where they are stored
Every single guide I was able to find uses this:
gpg --edit-key 0xXXXXXX
key 1
How can I do this without the 'toggle' command? Am I missing something?
When I just type these commands the Smartcard rejects the keys, so its
not just a visual problem.

Sorry. The information is basically in the linked issue.
I had the problem moths ago and their was no solution. Now I retried and I
still have the same problem. Back then it was probably 'gnupg-2.1.3.3' now
it is the newest version from Arch Linux Repo '2.1.11-1'.
I want to set up a Yubikey 4 Nano:
Reader ...........: 1050:0405:X:0
Application ID ...: D2760001240102010006041562870000
Version ..........: 2.1
Manufacturer .....: Yubico
Since I never got to the point where the SmartCard is relevant, I don't
think it has anything to do with the problem.
My problem is that I can not select the private keys, because I can not use
Thanks for your help!
