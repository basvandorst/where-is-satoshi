@_subject: Calculating the Private Key 
Dear gnupg users,
I have a question regarding a feature from mailbox.org [0]. This
provider offers to encrypt every unencrypted email you receive with your
public key. Thus only encrypted emails will be stored on the server.
Is there any security related problem, when an attacker has both, the
encrypted and decrypted message?
Looking at the RSA algorithm. Is it possible to calculate the private
key when a message is available both encrypted and decrypted? Maybe not
with just one message, but with a thousand?
The RSA formula for decrypting messages with RSA is ? according to
Wikipedia [1] ? $ m = c^(d) (mod N) $ where N is ? as a part of the
public key ? always given, c is the encrypted message, m the decrypted
message and d the private key. Can you solve this formula for d if
everything else is given?
At the moment I believe it is not possible to calculate the private key.
That would be an enormous bug, because everyone could write a message
and encrypt it with the public key to have the encrypted and the
decrypted part. But I don?t know how to prove it using maths :). So I am
very interested in *why* it is not working out, assuming that I am right.
[0]: [1]: Thanks in advance for your answer,

Thanks for your answer. Then I am convinced that the feature offered by
mailbox.org is useful. Maybe we'll have to look at this topic again in
10 years or so.
Have a nice day.

That's definitely good to know. Thank you for providing this link. At
the moment I don't run my own mail server, but I don't know what I'll be
doing in the future ;).

I think the term ?signing? leads to confusion, too. When I receive a
signed statement from a good friend, I have no chance to prove whether
he signed or not. And proving if something was added after he signed it
is even more difficult. But as far as I know this is all possible with
an OpenPGP signature.
So are there analogies that can easily explain what signing does?

You're right. That's hard to impart that the message will be readable to
everyone. Also it doesn't prevent anyone from changing the message
content after you send (and signed) it. I don't see, how you could do
this with your (pad)lock analogy.

@_subject: one key/pair for multiple email accounts 
I'm using one key pair for multiple email addresses. But I think it
depends on the usage of your email addresses. If you use one for
business and don't want your partners to see your private email address
(maybe something like bunny309 at example.com), then I'd prefer two key
pairs ;).
But I'm not using gnupg for long now and I'm curious what other say,
too. Maybe there are best practises about this topic?
