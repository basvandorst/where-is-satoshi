In the mail mentioned above, Mr. Stapel said:
gpg --decrypt filename.gpg --passphrase-fd 0
1>filename.txt < filename.key
where we can use filename.key as a file for getting
the passphrase. Now, my problem is instead of
specifying a file for the passphrase, I want to give
the passphrase on the command line above so that it
doesn't ask for the passphrase. Is it possible? If
yes, how?
