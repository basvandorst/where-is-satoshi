@_subject: Using --gen-key --batch doesn't seem to work anymore 
Hi List,
I have been using a Script which gets the key ID via
and if there is no key ID found, it tries to generate a key via
the gpg_config file is looking like this:
Key-Type: default
Subkey-Type: default
Name-Real: $hostname
Name-Comment: backup-key for $hostname
Name-Email: root
Expire-Date: 0
Passphrase: secret
Somehow, since the last update, the key Generation does not work anymore. If I try to execute that exact step on the command line, I get:
# gpg -vv --gen-key --batch < gpg_config
gpg: agent_genkey failed: Operation cancelled
gpg: key generation failed: Operation cancelled
I put a line in the .gnupg/gpg-agent.conf, because I thought it might have to do something with the Agent:
I must say, my experiences with gnupg are very limited, so I can simply miss something. Is there an obvious reason why this fails?
Some help would be greatly appreciated.

You are right :)
Any idea, when 2.1.2 will be ready?
I have a pinentry installed, yes. When I add ?pin entry-mode=loopback, it gives
gpg: Sorry, we are in batchmode - can't get input
