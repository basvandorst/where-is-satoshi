@_subject: Wherre to place keys under Linux 
Hi everybody,
i have just installed GnuPG under Linux but have a question where to put
my keys.
I want to use my keys for both root and user. I know copy them after
changes but i think that's not the best solution.
Does someone know what's the wright place for those files and how to
manage this?
Kind regards,
