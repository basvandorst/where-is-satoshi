@_subject: GnuPG 2.0.12 on Windows 
When compiling 2.0.12 on Windows with MinGW/MSYS there was a compilation error on scd/ccid-driver.c because ETIMEDOUT doesn't exist on Windows.
This can be fixed by using WSAETIMEDOUT instead.
Maybe a simple  __MINGW32__ can be used to resolve this?
Once I replaced this the rest of the build worked fine.
