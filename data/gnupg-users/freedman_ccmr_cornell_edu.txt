I've installed GnuPG 1.0.4 on RH 6.0 using the RPM linked to from the
 website.  When trying to establish my initial key with 'gpg
--gen-key': I get the following message:
gpg: keyblock resource `/home/freedman/.gnupg': file open error
gpg: keyblock resource `/home/freedman/.gnupg': file open error
It will continue the script to generate the random seed (??), but then
fail to be able to write that in my home directory (in .gnupg).  I've
never seen this type of message before, so I'm not sure if I've
misconfigured bash (I do have umask 077 set, but I didn't think this would
effect this process) or if this is a gnupg-related question.  If it's
bash-config, sorry for bothering you guys.
Thanks for any suggestions (kindly cc them to me as I'm not on list).
Take care,

Thanks for the advice.  I was going to just create the .gnupg directory
myself, but I thought i'd see first what others thought.  Anyway, it works
fine now.  Should someone maybe look into fixing this (namely gpg 1.0.4
rpm's inability to create .gnupg) or at least noting it somewhere, so that
other people don't run into the same issue?  I'm not sure whether it's an
issue with gpg proper or just the rpm installation procedure for it.
Thanks,
