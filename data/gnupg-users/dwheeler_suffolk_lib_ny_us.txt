@_subject: unable to import-self sign error? 
Hash: SHA1
with their public key at the bottom and I saved the email as a file then at the prompt typed:
gpg --import /path/filename
I got the following error:
gpg: key xxxxxxxx: no valid user IDs
gpg: this may be caused by a missing self-signature
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:           w/o user IDs: 1
I then went to certserver.pgp.com and did a search using the persons email address as a user id. It opened up a new window with the public key and I saved it as a file and ran the same command with the correct path and file name. This person has been using pgp encryption for awhile so I don't think the problem is being caused by him forgetting to do a self-sign. He is using:
Version: PGPfreeware 6.5.8 for non-commercial use Any help would be appreciated
