Blown capacitor is the correct term, and has widespread use.
Actually, most of the capacitors do not "blow", but the electrolyte inside the aluminium/metal can dries out after the pressure relief ventil on top of them has opened due to a failure (to
avoid "blowing").

The use of PGP/GPG depends entirely on the respective needs and
and context. For me, it has been working perfectly in many years, and
thus, what's described in this article is a good example for theory
which doesn't affect practice. At least in my case.

Looking around where I live and work, nearly nobody is even able to
install Windows itself, and software installation is mainly done by
"IT specialists". I agree that this phenomenon is caused at least
halfways by ignorance. How would these people ever be able to use GPG?
The anwer is: they would if they would care - but they don't. "I've
got nothing to hide, so why bother?" (*). These people won't use GPG,
even if they were capable to do so. Even in the light of the recent
spying on the privacy of the general public. "I've got nothing to
hide, so I can be sure that they didn't that to me". You won't change
those peoples attitudes and perception - ever.
I'm afraid this won't change.
This is a global phenomenon wrt the information society. Knowledge as
a capacity for action has never worked. The "know-do gap", failing in
getting evidence into action, is well documented (**).
"Giving the people what they want" is a common marketing
strategy. This is not about security, it's all about binding the
Not for me. Never. I appreciate to be able to have at least a little
bit of privacy when communication via the Internet. Even if the use of
GPG encrypted email is limited to 4-5 persons. It's worth every word
written, in every email.
I also care about the personnel working for my uplink who is tempted
to snook in other peoples email.
They fear their own population, because they lie and
misbehave. Unfortunately, this is nothing new either.
It won't. At least not for me. We (= the people using it) have never
been more. I'm quite sure this won't change.
Provider encryption is useless if you don't trust your provider. It's
like letting your private key get handled by somebody else who does
the decryption for you.
And that's where the big providers like Go*gle and Yah*o step
in. Wonder why they exactly came on with that after Snowden (and
others) blowed the whistle? Now, at least some are frightened they
could be a target for spying and surveillance, and the big providers
give them what they need...
Just my 5?.

when decrypting a file with gpg2 in combination with a GnuPG v2.0
smartcard, my PIN, once entered, is cached a long time. Removing the
smartcard or the reader deletes the cache, of course. Although I've
read a bunch of documents and searched the net, I haven't managed yet
to find out how I can disable PIN caching *completely* in this case.
I'm aware of the "Signature PIN" option, and it's set to "forced", but
this does of course not affect decryption.
Is it possbile to disable PIN caching entirely when using a smartcard,
and if so, how can I do this?

Don't do it, it's not safe.
In case you're allowed to boot from an external medium, this still won't be
secure. Because you have no control over the hardware built into the computer,
a keylogger could read your input (read: passphrase), and somebody else with
remote access could copy your secret key.
After all, it boils down to what your thread model is, and how much unsecurity
you can live with. If your data is crucial: don't do it.

The text as-is assumes that the reader knows what you mean by "64-bit

The left one is a modular padlock, and the one in the middle is an
integrated padlock. According to one of my friends who is a native
en_GB speaker. Not shure if this helps, though. I guess most languages
simply use "padlock" for both types. Haengeschloss in German,
hengel?s in NO, h?ngl?s (SE), h?ngel?s (DK)..
