@_subject: GnuPG asks for other card 
Hash: SHA1
Yesterday I configured my Fellowship card and it works fine (after some
trouble with the wrong cardreader).
Today I got a "normal" OpenPGP card and I created a new key (based on
the same keyring as the one I used for the FSFE card).
Everything seems to work, but when I want to sign or decrypt something
GPG first asks for the 1st card (the FSFE one) and then after pressing
"c" for about 3 times I can use the OpenPGP card.
When sending email it's even worse, I use IceDove with Enigmail and
there I just get a "general error" when I use the OpenPGP card.
My idea was to have 2 OpenPGP cards so I have 1 as backup.
I edited the gpg.conf file to default encrypt to both keys so I don't
think that's the problem.
Any help would be apreciated.
