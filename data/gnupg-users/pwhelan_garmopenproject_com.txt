@_subject: GnuPG --gen-key batch process? 
Is there any way to generate keys in a batch-like mode, with predefined
values, preferably with a shell script?
I need a large number of unique keys with predictable ID's.  Ideally,
I'd use a shell script to generate a key for a series of consecutive
numerical addresses,
for ((k=3D1; k<=3D100000; k++))
 gpg --gen-key RealName$k $k CommentKey$1 NoPassPhrase
