@_subject: I compiled via myShell on my webserver - now what??! 
What a day it's been! Learnt a lot, namely that I can compile and install on
my web hosts machine (in my dir) without telnet access, using phpMyshell(?).
So, it all compiled OK, and it's sitting there looking lovely. Except when I
come to generate a key, it wants to get all interactive - or rather, nothing
happens, because the telnet emulator is a simple "call and response" php web
So - is there some way to pipe everything it wants, all in one go, into the
command? Once I got my key made, then I'm off an running, but it's this initial
interactive bit that's getting me!
Unless someone can recommend an easier way of getting a simple gpg app running
on a non-telnet webhost? (It's for the secure mail module of a shopping cart,
in case you were wondering).
Also, I've googled myself silly looking for the answer to this, so sorry if
I've missed a FAQ (apart from "the" faq) or something.

No telnet access at all - using MyShell php shell emulator. Compiled it without
any trouble at all, but it all seems to be too interactive  which MyShell can't
I got the windoze version of gpg, made a key on my local machine, tried to import:
--import filename
but again silence in the response.
I can't see that there's any other way to do it!
No, you seem to have it spot on...I know there must be a way round this...someone
must have written a php front end for this!
