After I generate my GnuPG certificates on my system which is bound to
my email address. What is the next step? Where do I export my public
key at so that all I exchange keys with can verify myself?

Thanks for the fast and helpful reply however I don't understand what
you mean by ?
I checked in my ~/.gnupg folder and found the following:

How do I make out which is my key ID? It is not clear and I can't find
any info? Also is my private data now compromised for posting this
info publicly?

Thanks all! I was able to run the following command with no problems:
carlos at laptop:~$ gpg --keyserver x-hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net
--send-key 0x8BF7AA16
gpg: sending key 8BF7AA16 to hkp server pool.sks-keyservers.net
I now wanted to know how do I check or verify others according to
their signature block or when they do sign their messages? I went to
 and don't see a "search" option or a way to
look myself up to make sure my data imported to their site

@_subject: Trying to Understand Keys 
Looking to create keys however I really would like to understand
before I select a key which is best to use. Normally I would just
select "default" when I don't know however I think in this case it
would be wise to understand the difference between the options listed
Anyone explain to me the pros / cons between the 1, 2. & 5?
Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) DSA and Elgamal (default)
   (2) DSA (sign only)
   (5) RSA (sign only)
Your selection?

I am not using Windows so I can't say for sure about *.exe. I am using
Linux and Mozilla Thunderbird.
I uninstalled and reinstalled Enigmail on my Mozilla Thunderbird just
to be make sure the "plugin" worked properly.
I then looked at my keys generated on my system:
cwilliams at tunafish:~/.gnupg$ gpg --list-keys
pub   1024D/C4B187CB 2008-05-29
uid                  Carlos Williams sub   8446g/6B90B444 2008-05-29
***I don't know if I should be publicly posting the info above...Is
that bad to show in public?***
Anyways - Enigmail does not find my key. I installed the most recent
version on my Linux / Thunderbird system...
I am fairly lost on why this is not working for me...any suggestions?

I think it may be working now. I tried everything over from scratch on
my gmail account and it looks like it found me key. Is there a way to
test this with you guys on the list?

@_subject: First Time Setup Confusion 
I am the email administrator for my small company and have never dealt with
any kind of cryptographic software. I have several internal users on my
email server (Postfix) who have the need to send encrypted email to trusted
vendors so there will be some kind of public key exchange however I don't
understand where GPG fits in the puzzle and maybe someone can explain this
to me. I was told on a tech forum that PGP and / or GPG both are client side
applications and don't need to run on my email (Postfix) server. I contacted
PGP and they explained they have a client application that runs on the users
desktop that handles the key encryption and exchange however I would like to
use GPG and don't understand what the steps are that need to be done.
I read their mini_howto guide:
However this basically runs over the entire process and everything I need to
install this. I am just not clear on if I need to install GPG on my email
server or a stand alone server (or does it matter) and how this all works
with my current system.
Please pardon my ignorance and thanks for any help and or info!

Thanks all. It appears I have a better understanding of how this works in
general based on the online documentation I read which is vendor neutral.
Now my only question is that GPG seems to function nativly on most common
Linux systems but my question is what if I have a Linux email server that
has 50 Outlook / Windows XP clients who connect to it via IMAP4. In this
case I see that there are some options but I don't know how supported or
buggy they are. What does this list recommend for Windows / Outlook clients
sending encrypted email using GNUPG?

I am trying to generate a key and start using it with Mozilla Thunderbird /
Enigmail & I am obviously missing something. I generated a key on my system
using the following command:
cwilliams at tunafish:~$ gpg --gen-key
You can see below exactly what I did and I am now unclear once I created
this key how to start using it with my email client. Am I missing something?
Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) DSA and Elgamal (default)
   (2) DSA (sign only)
   (5) RSA (sign only)
Your selection? 1
DSA keypair will have 1024 bits.
ELG-E keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (2048)
Requested keysize is 2048 bits
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
        = key expires in n days
      w = key expires in n weeks
      m = key expires in n months
      y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0)
Key does not expire at all
Is this correct? (y/N) y

You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.
We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number

I am using Thunderbird 2.0.0.14 & Enigmail 0.95.6.
When I select the "Select Key" option, I get the "Select OpenPGP key" window
however there is no keys listed in the box for me to choose from. Why do I
not see the key I generated?

I am looking to see if I can export my GnuPG public key I created on
my Linux machine here at work and exchange this with 15 users in the
office who are using a licensed copy of PGP Desktop 9.9. All their 15
public keys were generated by the PGP software and I wanted to export
my public key from GPG and exchange it with the 15 users using PGP. Is
this possible for digital encryption and signatures between the two
products? Will there be any issues or incompatibility?
Thanks for any info and or help!

Myself and office mate just installed GnuPG on our Linux machines and
generated a key:
carloswill at tunafish:~$ gpg --list-keys
pub   1024D/7351884D 2008-11-14
uid                  Carlos Williams sub   2048g/49148CB4 2008-11-14
My question is what is the proper way to export this to a file for
both of us so we can import this to our keyrings? When I check the
How-To page : I see they're importing a *.gpg file. I was told from another site
that I can export my public key as .asc so I am really confused what
the correct way is to export my public key so my co-worker can import
Can anyone please pull me out of the dark?

So we both now appear to have each others public keys in our local
PC's keyring. Now is there a way we both can send encrypted email from
Thunderbird using our GnuPG keys? We are both using the same email
client and have each others public keys listed in our local PC's
keyring. I just don't know how we can test this from the point we're
at now.

@_subject: Supported Formats 
I had someone at a co-location (different network / domain) install a
Verisign Class 1 Digital certification. I was able to share the
Verisign cert with another user who has the same kind of class 1
certificate and we can now send encrypted and signed email back to
each other fine. My question is now I would like to take my
certificate and send it to any of the users with class 1 Verisign
cert. The problem is when I export my GnuPG public key and send it to
him, it does not recognize it at all. It does not like the .asc file
extension. How can exchange keys with anyone using a class 1
certificate in Outlook 2003 and or Mozilla Thunderbird. I am guessing
neither of the machines configured are unable to read the .asc format
I am exporting my public key as.
Any advice.

It is just a matter of opening a terminal window or command prompt
based on your OS. You did not specify if you're using Windows, OSX, or
