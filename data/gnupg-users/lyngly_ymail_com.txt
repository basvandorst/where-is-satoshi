Hello, I saw the following thread unanswered and am having the same problem when I try generate revoke keys, adduid and many other commands. I'm never prompted for my secret key, and these commands don't take them as arguments.

Thanks for the reply. I'm using OpenSuSE-11.0 and performing this from the command line.
$ gpg --edit-key myID
at the new command prompt, I try to perform actions such as:
$ Command> adduid
Need the secret key to do this.
$ Command> toggle
Need the secret key to do this.
$ Command> expire
Need the secret key to do this.
$ Command> But I am never prompted for my passphrase.

  Could you please give more details about what was you doing (and
how)?, and maybe the operating system you are using... I make my
revocation certificates using a GUI, so maybe it would help you...
Best Regards

Yes, I do get all the info about my key listed when I enter gpg --edit-key. There doesn't seem to be any issue locating it.
Many other linux users have an idea.
Thanks for your help though!
