Hi Werner,
I just came back on my original key-loading problem after almost two
months; you said you would implement the option "--ignore-crc-error", but
I just checked out gnupg from CVS and didn't find it. Am I just dumb or
did you change your mind?

Speaking of which, are there any plans to release 1.0.5 (incorporating the
security fix and other patches) anytime soon (or not soon:)? No pressure
meant, just curiosity.

@_subject: GnuPG fails to import some PGP keys 
Hello Everybody,
As some of you probably already know, here at RIPE NCC we plan to use
GnuPG for signature authentication in the new implementation of the
software which runs the RIPE Database.
Since we are currently using PGP software to import the keys and check the
signatures, we will need to "port" all the keys to GnuPG. In the RIPE
Database, we have a bunch of objects which represent "key certificates",
which we use to import the keys in the database public keyring.
We would like to regenerate a GnuPG keyring from these key certificates,
but that's where the problem lies. Some keys can be successfully imported
by PGP, but not by GnuPG. They normally have a CRC error.
This issue has already been addressed in the message "Problems importing a
public DSA key" (
but the answer from Werner Koch was "Something is wrong with the ascii
armor [...] Try to get the key from another source". Now, unfortunately we cannot get the keys "from another source", since
some users have already put those keys in the database, and the keys do
work with PGP. We cannot ask them to resend their keys.
Did anyone here had to solve a similar problem? I accept the fact that
there may be a problem with the ASCII armor (if I import then export the
key with PGP, the key block is slightly different, and the new one *can*
be imported with GnuPG), but then why does it work with PGP in the first
place? Is there any possibility to make the key work with GnuPG without
having to get a "better" copy of the key?
Thanks a lot in advance.

Hi Werner and all,
Thanks a lot for the answer!
The trick actually works, except for one key, 0x1228A499 (see below for
the full public key). I have to import this key in PGP, then export it and
import it in GPG (with "allow-non-selfsigned-uid") to make it work.
If you could implement the b), that would be great. It would be especially
nice when supplying a file containing many keys, because both "gpg
--import" and "gpg --dearmor" exit as soon as they get a CRC error.
Plus, unfortunately I have another problem. There is a key which won't get
loaded, and this time it's not because of a CRC error. It seems to be a
typical "missing self-signature" problem, but even the
"--allow-non-selfsigned-uid" doesn't help. The key is 0x41B35C52, it is
correctly imported by PGP 5.0, and not even the
"import-then-export-with-pgp-then-try-gpg" trick works. Did I maybe hit an
incompatibility? You can find the key at the bottom of the message, if
someone wants to give it a try.
Again, thanks.

Hi Werner and all,
I guess that means we won't be able to import these two keys as-they-are
to a GnuPG keyring...:( Well, I guess we'll find some workaround.
I tried to find some documentation which would explain why some keys can
be imported by PGP but not by GnuPG (maybe that depends on how the key was
generated? The algorithm? The PGP version? Etc.), but I failed. Maybe
someone can provide me with some pointers to such documentation?
Again, thanks for the help.
