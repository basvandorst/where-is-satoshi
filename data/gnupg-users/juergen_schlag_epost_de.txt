@_subject: harddisk encryption with gpg? 
I am wondering if it is possible to encrypt a harddisk partition
or a disk image file with gnupg. Or does anybody know a tool for
mounting an (encrypted) image file as a virtual drive letter
(with Windows) or as a new mountpoint (with Linux/Unix); something
like pgpdisk, but platform independed?
