I need to sign files remotely. They're moderately large, so transmitting
them back to my firewalled-off laptop (I'm usually behind a slow line),
where the secret key lives, isn't a good idea.

What happens if you have a smartcard, anyway -- doesn't the gpg agent
tunnel these requests?
Using standard gpg as the back end shouldn't be too much of a
stretch then..?

@_subject: OpenLDAP schema to store OpenPGP keys? 
The pam_ldap module has optional "binddn" and "bindpw" configuration
options. Having the same kind of support in gpg would make sense, IMHO.
