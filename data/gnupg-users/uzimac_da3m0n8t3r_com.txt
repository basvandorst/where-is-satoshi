Hmm I dunno, ...opinion... this presumes an automated script can get 'bob's' attention, and either 'Bob' is dumb as a board or he's so compelled about the juicy details on 'Alice's' computer that he can't help but be naughty. It's presuming that Alice is 'talking' about Bob behind his back or talking to people whom Bob does not appreciate, ie secret cyber lover whatever. I'm brainstorming scenarios here:
the email you receive:
hey, did you know (alice) was saying 'that stupid jerk' about you, Bob. (but bob does not actually know alice)
hey, did you know (alice) was saying 'that stupid dork' about you, Bob. (and in this case maybe bob actually will take the bait)
hey, did you know that (bill gates) was just chatting about you, Bob. (ummm. yeah right. or even possibly in 2012 wtf is b.g. lol)
I suppose the 'Temptation' bit of this scenario is very weak, as it would take much effort and skill to carry out 'randomly' and the percentage of 'hits' would probably be low, not worth the trouble. {I'm presuming that reading a PDF with gv on FreeBSD is not susceptible to a virus one might possibly contract using Acrobat on a MS system. (I believe there has been at least one instance if memory serves me. If that is not correct then I suppose I fell for the bait.}
But maybe it would be a more likely scenario when computer chips are in brains and we are all truly connected, and we can get elaborate computer-brain viruses that pop right through our brain-firewalls. Unfortunately I doubt I'll be around when that stuff is happening. (Hmmm I guess, but you know what, now that I think about it - the guy who showed up this morning to clean the carpets definitely had something going on. Perhaps just a hangover.)
Then I suppose the scenarios I listed above might be more effective. (?)

@_subject: trouble compiling gnupg 
I'm having trouble compiling gnupg v2.0.18. I'm compiling with
cd /usr/opt/contrib/gnupg
make -j4
gcc 4.6.2 freebsd 10.0-CURRENT amd64
(umm, kinda, i've been replacing all the ancient gplv2 with latest gplv3 software, it's in a transitional state)
make is failing with 'libgpg-error.a function gpg_strerror "undefined reference to 'libintl_dgettext'"'
I've rebuilt gettext 0.18.1.1
libgpg-error 1.10
and dependencies.
I was concerned it was maybe linking to leftover stuff in /usr/local/ so I deleted /usr/local (and /usr/lib32) completely and still receive same error. :(
Any help, suggestions or pointers much appreciated!
Thank you,
