@_subject: can't decrypt symmetrically encrypted files from PGP 
OK, so I just nipped across the border to Belgium to get the extension. But it still doesn't work:
$ gpg -vv test.txt.pgp
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
:encrypted data packet:
        length: 45
gpg: loaded digest 3
gpg: /home/mark/.gnupg/idea: IDEA ($Revision: 1.11 $)
gpg: BLOWFISH encrypted data
gpg: decryption failed: bad key
(the test file is attached to my previous message to the list)
If I follow your instructions completely the result is still bad:
$ gpg --load-extension .gnupg/idea  --cipher-algo idea -vv \
 	test.txt.pgp
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
gpg: .gnupg/idea: IDEA ($Revision: 1.11 $)
gpg: loaded cipher 1 (IDEA)
gpg: /home/mark/.gnupg/idea: IDEA ($Revision: 1.11 $)
gpg: skipping cipher 1: already loaded
:encrypted data packet:
        length: 45
gpg: loaded digest 3
gpg: IDEA encrypted data
gpg: decryption failed: bad key

You can use --passphrase-fd 0 so that the password will be read from
standard input, like
echo  | gpg --passphrase-fd 0 etc.
