Hi Team,
I`m service engineer from Huawei, and working on upgrade GnuPG version from 2.0.9 to 2.0.30, but faced the version not changed after executed ?make install?.
n  What I did:
?  Install required lib package found in the README
libgpg-error     (ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgpg-error/)  libgpg-error-1.24.tar.gz
libgcrypt        (ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgcrypt/)  libgcrypt-1.7.2.tar.gz
libksba          (ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libksba/) libksba-1.3.4.tar.bz2
libassuan >= 2.0 (ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libassuan/) libassuan-2.4.3.tar.bz2
zlib          (                  zlib-1.2.8.tar.gz
?  But I found the version or patch didn`t upgrade on these packages.
?  Executed ./configure under /home/luke/gnupg-2.0.30 seeing logs as attached gnupg_configure.log
?  Executed make and logs as attached gnupg_make.log
?  Executed make install and logs as attached make_install.log
n  Current version
There is still 2.0.9 of GnuPG software
cpsDSV1:/home/luke/gnupg-2.0.30 # gpg --version
gpg (GnuPG) 2.0.9

Please help checking on this, how can I do next on version upgrade as I didn`t find any upgrade guide from website.
Thank you!
