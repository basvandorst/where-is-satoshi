You should realize that this scheme is vunerable to a man in the middle
attack - it is entirely possible for an active attacker to substitute the
PGP key before it hits the server then intercept the encrypted reply. This
is why gpg has a trust mechanism. If you don't have a specially prepared
and trusted keyring then you have to establish trust for each key
However, if you still what to do that then I'm guessing it is fairly
simple to do just by manipulating the keyring options, perhaps:
cat KeyMaterial | gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring /tmp/trash --import --with-colons
Extract the key fingerprint of the imported key then do an encrypt
operation using similar options
