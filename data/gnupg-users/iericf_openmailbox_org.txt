Yes, sed in OS X is a little bit different. ?Sed'ing? an output is fine,
but when to change/write something in a file it's different.Example:
gnu sed:    sed -i 's/foo/bar/g' foobar.txt
osx sed:    sed -i '' 's/foo/bar/g' foobar.txt
I've updated sed to gnu's sed(-4.2 ) and
it works fine. (+ an updated libiconv).
    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-libiconv-prefix=/usr/local
(Haven't compiled gnupg though).

Perhaps not directly gnupg related, more OS X related. But, with both
GPGtools an GnuPG for OS X I'll post it here... (and there was this OS X
sec. discussion the other week) :)
It's seem like ?Gatekeeper? is only using http if I read it correctly.
Ex-NSA Researcher Finds Sneaky Way Past Apple Mac's Gatekeeper
?He found around 150 on his own machine, including hugely popular
software like Microsoft Word and Excel, Apple?s own iCloud Photos and
Dropbox. The list also included Apple?s developer tool *XCODE and email
encryption key management software GPG Keychain, both of which he abused
in his proof of concept attacks*.?
I have no idea how this works, but one question that came in mind was if
a hijacked ?GPG Keychain? on a Mac computer could form a threat to gpg
on other platforms?
Anyway, interesting reading. Just wanted to share.
