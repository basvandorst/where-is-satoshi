@_subject: retrieving data with a new username 
I used gpg to back-up my data. I had disk problems. I reformatted the disk;
and am now using a different username. When I try 'sudo gpg -d
hebrews.....tqz | tar -xzvpP' I get the error 'Cant open file. No such file
or directory'; enenthough  it is showing what I would see if I had done
'sudo gpg -d hebrews....tqz | tar -tz'
