Now that i have a burner can I setup either one or both programs to run

I am assuming not having a CDRW on the road for updates.

Your looking for homonyms.
I might suggest looking for a phrase or poem and picking a stanza; then
looking for both homonyms and synonyms for alternating key words.  If you
really want to get fancy find an online translater and run your phrase
through that just pick a language you dont speak.
You could even use phonetic spellings on top of that and have several on
hand to see which you can remember best.

On Windows, you will probably have to zip the directory first. On Linux,
recommend tar instead, because it keeps the permissions and ownership.

Youre too late. GPG is available for the Windows commandline, and using the IDEA module it is PGP 2.6x compatible.
There are a couple of Windows front ends available (IMHO better than anything in Linux, particularly GPGShell) and a number of MUAs (Becky, The Bat, Pegasus, Outlook Express, Eudora, etc) have a plugin to use GPG in Windows.
What more do you want?

In Windows there are some few other programs but still data survives in

Does a program like Eraser 5.6 adequately address this problem or should
something like Norton wipefile / wipespace also need to be used?
Freeware suggestions are of course welcome.
For those with multi boot abilitys we can mount the windows partitions
backup the data and zero that partiton before restoring the files.  what
I dont know is how effective such a protocol would be.

@_subject: Eraser Latest Version 
For those using windows.  I plan to make a special utilitys and security
disk for travel.
Any further recommendations beyond Eraser, GNUPG and a Frontend of choice
will be apreciated.
For those using Linux.  Recommendations as to bootdisk configuration and
drive scan utilitys for testing a windows box prior to booting windows
would also be apreciated.

@_subject: Non-Zero return code on successful decryption? 
Solaris is a form of *nix.  Return codes are issued so that scripts
running programs can make decisions based on how a particular program

Does Solaris use negative logic generally in tests?

I was not sure if solaris used positive or negative logic relating to
return codes.
If negative then a nonzero return indicates success.
if positive then a nonzero rethrn indicates failure.

@_subject: secrets lying around on the HD 
The only thing to do with them would be to erase the swap and force
windows to recreate it.  As I remember there are several programs called
clean and cleanup so I forget which has the ability to do that
automagically for you in windows.  Myself I would boot knoppix and use erase as root then reboot into
windows.  but thats the easy way.
