@_subject: how to change the default symmetric cipher  
i started working recently with gnupg, i did every thing instaling, generating keys, sending to keyservers, receiving keys from keyservers, sending and receiving encrypted & signed emails...
now my question is how to choose the symmetric encryption algorithm among the available ciphers in GNUPG. & is there any way of selecting / adding a new symmetric cipher to GNUPG on which both sender and recipient are agreed.
thanks a lot i learned quite a good mount from this group,alex?
