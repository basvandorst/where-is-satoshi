@_subject: Importing and using non-self-signed PGP keys 
my organization issued to me a public/private PGP keypair
that is not self signed.
I managed to import these keys into GPG 1.4.19 with the
--allow-non-selfsigned-uid flag, as described in
How can I self-sign the new uid in GPG, or,
for that matter, do anything else with it?
I keep on getting the errors `User ID ... is
not self-signed.  Unable to sign.'

No, I don't know.  Various messages generated by GPG indicate PGP 2.x keys.  The message digest is MD5, which GPG warns about.
What I have found out is that the key is signed by my organization -- although I don't know how to display that in GPG.
Your google-fu certainly outclasses mine! Amazingly (considering the time I had invested beforehand), this works.
Thank you!
