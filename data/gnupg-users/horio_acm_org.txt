@_subject: what is interactive mode ? 
I got following log entry when I tried to generate a key pair from
a shell script.
gpg: Key generation can only be used in interactive mode
The command line the script tried to execute is
except for redirections for 3, 4, 5.
The content of options file is (other than comment lines):
However, following simple script doesn't get that complaint.
=47=byte:/opt0/horio/HOT/test/test-gpg> cat g
        --logger-fd 5 5>>log \
        --status-fd 4 4>>stat \
        --passphrase-fd 3 3 cd q*
=49=byte:/opt0/horio/HOT/test/test-gpg/quack> alias g.. 'sh ../g'
=50=byte:/opt0/horio/HOT/test/test-gpg/quack> g.. --gen-key

gpg: Interrupt caught ... exiting
The only differences between the two scripts are the former
o  is a bit complex, and
o  uses options file which contains --batch option.
So far, I tried following things:
o  Adding --no-batch on commnad line or removing batch from option file
   doesn't work.
o  Removing --no-tty doesn't change much... other than passphrase fd
   is recognized.
o  Using --interactive is complained; -i either. Presumably because
   out of context ?
o  Trying to execute above command line copied to a file results in
   the same complaint.
o  Removing --options phrase from the file let it go ! Amazing !
   It seems yet more options are deemed as non-interactive.
So my question is, what is 'interactive' mode exactly ?

I don't see what you are asking. As for fds 0, 1, 2, I haven't changed
as you point out. As for terminal emulator, I'm using xterm.
But neither seem to relate to --options contents, except for batch,
and interactive.
To reiterate my question, what options affect interactiveness, assuming
--options presence itself doesn't affect it.

I think I found the answer. It's yes. --no command line option reverts
Isn't that too incovenient ?
