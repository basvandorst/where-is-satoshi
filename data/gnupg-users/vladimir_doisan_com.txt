Hash: SHA1
You will have to just trust GPG as I do not think that such checking
is possible to do in a secure manner.
At my org, I am using GPG to encrypt all backups. To ensure that the
code does not contain bugs, I wait for ~ a month before upgrading the
GPG release. After an upgrade, I perform several
backup+encrypt+decrypt+restore+check to make sure nothing is borked. I
lock in the version and use that for a while. I do not worry about
daily backups, but each quarterly backup, I encrypt it, decrypt it and
verify it manually.
The user base of GnuPG is huge, and any serious bugs in the code will
be weeded out very quickly by the beta testers and early adopters.
Invalid encryptions is a VERY serious bug.

It will be fine, all you have to do is to import your keys into gpg
[code]gpg --import key_file.asc[/code]

Yes, I did exactly the same for my encrypted backups, only I chose
Twofish due to speed advantage (TW256 - 16.2 mbps vs. AES256 - 12.6
mbps). With compression enabled - encryption speed was within 0.5 mbps
across all ciphers at around 12 mbps.
I did switch over to public key encryption last month.
Some benches
(this is on single Xeon 2.8 EM64T, 1 Gig RAM with RAID5 running Gentoo
in two separate 64 and 32 bit installs)
GnuPG 1.4.2 Benchmarks (symmetric encryption, no compress)
512 MB backup file
                          GnuPG-64         |         GnuPG-32
