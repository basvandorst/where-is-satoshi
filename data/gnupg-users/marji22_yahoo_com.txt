@_subject: Gnupg make error 
I have downloaded gnupg 1.4.2.1 source code from
gnupg.org. I get the following errors when I run the
make utility:
make[1]: Entering directory
../g10/gpg --homedir . --quiet --yes
--no-permission-warning --import ./pubdemo.
gpg: mpi larger than indicated length (124 bytes)
gpg: read_block: read error: invalid packet
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: import from `./pubdemo.asc' failed: invalid
make[1]: *** [prepared.stamp] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory
make: *** [check-recursive] Error 1
Can someone help me regarding this matter. Thank you

@_subject: Porting source code 
I have been working on GnuPG 1.4.2.1 under cygwin. I
have downloaded, configured, compiled, and installed
it under cygwin. I have made some modifications to the
source code and successfully compiled and installed
the modified source code in cygwin. My problem is porting the source code to linux. I have
configured the modified source code in linux. The
cofiguration completes successfully with no error
messages. However, when I run 'make', I get a number
of undefined reference errors. Listed below are some
of the errors:
undefined reference to `mpihelp_addmul_1'
undefined reference to `mpihelp_sub_n'
undefined reference to `mpihelp_sub_n'
Can someone explain these errors? How can fix it?
Any help is appreciated.
