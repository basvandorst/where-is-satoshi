I count about 30 different entries, this is not much more than the
alphabet. thus the complexity is only for the naked eye. using the
proper glasses you might talk better write with these signs like with
the latin alphabet. However, with lowercase and uppercase letters of the
latter, the variation will be larger and you might even be able to
repeat a passphrase from memory.
With respect to randomness, do you have an idea how passphrases which
use first letters of e.g. songs or poems (with lower and uppercase
letters in german) are rated?
Would be nice to know how often I have to change my favorite song.

test2 is a saved mail sent by myself. When I try to verify this mail in

welcome, thanks a lot!

Ok, the problem I have that evolution und GnuPG together do not verify
any mail, even my own signature. For this reason I saved a mail and
tested whether verifying could work at all. Now I know better, thank

Is this correct?

@_subject: Import of old keys 
For a long time I have used debian sid and gnupg with three keys for
different purposes.
After moving to Ubuntu (OT: for multimedia reasons) I fail to use these
keys with the newly created account. I have access to all the old files
and directories and would like to get some help for the incorporation of
the old keys into the new system.
Thanks a lot!

@_subject: keys not available for signed messages in this maillist 
i wonder whether the keys from several members of this maillist should
be available from the keyserver. e.g. Grant Olson signs all his messages
here. evolution and gpg on ubuntu, however, fail to retrieve the public
key from the server:
the message always reads: signature exists, however, the public key is
required. I have already tried to use the key ID to look for the public
key, but, not too surprisingly, could not retrieve it. I have then seen,
that the key used for signing is one of grants subkey.
My question now is, why are those subkeys not retrieved?
I do not at all want to blame Grant, John Clizbe's key and that of
others can equally not be retrieved.

see also the other mail: this actually worked here, too. on the

have to prefix 0xA18AA54D6. Thus all the problems are solved. your other suggestion were already
active here: sks-keyserver pool and the auto-retrieve-key option.

@_subject: signed messages take an eternity to be formatted by evolution 
Hi everybody,
I am using ubuntu 10.10, gpg and evolution. And I am reading this
mailing list for quite some time. Lately to read this list is a pain
since many keys are no longer found on the key server(s) I have entered
into the keyserver list and for any mail thus signed with an unknown key
I have to wait till the keyservers time limit is reached. When a message's key is not found I get the following: message signed,
but the public key is required. a click on the symbol reveals:
gpg: ASCII-H?lle: Version: GnuPG v2.0.18-gitcb2f55e (GNU/Linux)
gpg: ASCII-H?lle: Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla -
gpg: Signatur am Di 01 M?r 2011 03:20:12 CET mit RSA Schl?ssel, ID
A18A54D6, erfolgt
gpg: Schl?ssel A18A54D6 von hkp Server wwwkeys.eu.pgp.net anfordern
gpg: Schl?sselserver hat das Zeitlimit ?berschritten
gpg: Unterschrift kann nicht gepr?ft werden: ?ffentlicher Schl?ssel

i.e. last three lines:
get the key from the key server
time limit of the key server reached
signature can not be tested, no public key found
I would be very gratefull if someone could point me to a remedy of this

Some strange things have happened: first: on the interactive sks-keyservers.net page I looked up the key
A18A54D6 and it did not show any result. Afterwards I typed olson grant
and got several keys listed but not the one we have been looking for
here A18....
second: I have seahorse as the gui tool to enter keyservers and keys.
However, I removed any other keyserver but pool.sks-keyservers.net.
After that I type your suggestion:
gpg --search-keys A18A54D
and to my surprise it still looked up wwwkeys.eu.pgp.net with no result.
This leaves us with two questions:
1. why do I not get a response for A18A54D6 on sks-keyservers.net?
2. where do we have to tune gpg and evolution on ubuntu 10.10 to look
for the correct keyserver?

I found a change of behaviour of pinentry.
Win7, Thunderbird with newest enigmal, password safe.
When I send a signed message, Pinentry opens and asks for the password.
With Alt-tab I switch to the Password manager?, copy the password with
ctrl-C and switch back to pinentry. However, the pinentry focus is lost.
I have already asked Patrick Brunschwig in the enigmail maillist and he
