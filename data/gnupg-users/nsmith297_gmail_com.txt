@_subject: signing source code with gpg 
Does anyone know if there's a solution to signing source code (using gpg), in
a way which will still allow the source code to function.  For example for a
Java file if the GPG signature code be placed within the comments embedded
within the Java source (ie /* */ ), of within XML comments (ie  )
for an XML file.  We are trying to impliment a source signing policy at our
company, where a developers source code is signed before it is checked into
our source control system. But of course, the source must still be able to
compile, and signing must not effect the functionality of the source. Thanks.. Nate
