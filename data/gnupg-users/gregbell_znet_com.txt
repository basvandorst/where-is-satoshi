@_subject: gpg 1.2.1 corrupted a file 
Hi Listies,
I've been using gpg to do symmetric encryption/decryption on a text file
for months with no problems.  Just last night, it got corrupted apparently
on an encryption operation.  Now I can't decrypt it:
$ gpg -vvvvv --decrypt /info/access.gpg
gpg: packet(2) with unknown version 13
I searched Google and the list archives to no avail.  What happened?  What can I do to make sure this doesn't happen in the future?
For the record, 1.2.2 can't decrypt it either.

@_subject: Gvim and gpg 
Hi GPG users,
I've successfully used gpg from vim for years, using the autocmds easily
found with google.
However, when using gpg from gvim, I get this:
   :!gpg --symmetric
   gpg: cannot open `/dev/tty': No such device or address
   shell returned 2
If I try the --no-tty option:
   :!gpg --symmetric --no-tty
   gpg: Sorry, no terminal at all requested - can't get input
   shell returned 2
Root privs, setuid, etc. don't work.  And my /dev/tty device is there and
   $ ls -l /dev/tty
   crwxrwxrwx  1 root root 5, 0 Apr 20 19:48 /dev/tty
Anybody have any idea why it doesn't work?  Again, it works with the
normal vim client.
Thanks much,
