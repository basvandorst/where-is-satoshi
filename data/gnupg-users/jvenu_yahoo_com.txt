I do not think the first version ever made it so I am
resending. Apologies if you receive it twice.

I am pleased to announce a new version of GPG-Dialog is a way to use GnuPG with a character-based menu system. It frees you from having to remember all the command line options of GnuPG. Also you have a somewhat easier way to select files rather
than typing in long file names.  I find it much more convenient to use than having to type in long command lines all the time. GPG-Dialog requires Perl 5 and works on
*nix and Windows. New versions of GPG-Dialog are always available at
I will be happy to fix any bugs that are
brought to my attention. GPG-Dialog
is available to you under the GPL.
