@_subject: gpg-agent, authentication key, and ssh 
Hash: SHA512
(Sorry if this has been asked/explained but my searches return mostly
directions on using ssh-add with gpg-agent.)
As I understand it, I can create an authentication subkey and use some utility
to convert that to an ssh key. If this conversion is possible, then why can't
the gpg-agent consider private auth (sub)keys along with ssh keys loaded via
the SSH_AUTH_SOCK protocol?
Also, out of curiosity... Would it be possible to multiplex the GPG_AGENT_INFO
protocol with SSH_AUTH_SOCK? Damien Miller of OpenSSH has talked about unix
socket forwarding [0], but nothing has come of it. I think it'd be a big win
for usability and security if we could easily sign/encrypt on a remote host.
(/Easily/, so no socat).
