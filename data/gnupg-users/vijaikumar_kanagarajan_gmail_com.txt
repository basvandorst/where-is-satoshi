@_subject: Commands supported by extra socket 
Hi All,
Where can I find information on what commands are supported by
S.gpg-agent and S.gpg-agent.extra socket? I am looking for some
information which clearly differentiates these two sockets.

@_subject: Change socketdir from ~/.gnupg to /run/user/ 
I am using gpg inside a docker container. By default, there is no
directory. Is there a provision to change the socket directory later?
Now, I would like to create /run/user/$(id -u)/gnupg and use this as
the default socket directory. Is there a way to kill the existing agent
and relaunch it with the new socket directory?
