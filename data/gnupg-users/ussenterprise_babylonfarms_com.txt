@_subject: newbie would like more info on waring in g-w32cli-1.3.92 
Hash: SHA1
I've looked through the archives and found no answers ( I realize I
could of missed it so please be kind )
Is version 1.3.92 a version that should be used or should a newbie be
using a previous version until 1.4 is released?
NOTE: THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT VERSION!
It is only intended for test purposes and should NOT be
used in a production environment or with production keys!
what are the reprocusions of using 1.3.92
learning as I go.......

Hash: SHA256
I achieved a desired output by changing the the file g10/mainproc.c
and compiled it using MSYS,
only because I could not find po/gnupg.pot file to do translations.
Can you tell me what problems I may run into and where exactly to
find the gnupg.pot file
