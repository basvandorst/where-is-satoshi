Can you encrypt/decrypt a file by providing the file path to the
public or private keyring which is not in the list? 'gpg' will be
invoked as 'nobody'...
Please CC to my email.

I sent the mail too quickly. I figured that out soon after posting
the message, this seems to do the job:
gpg --armor --yes --homedir /etc/gnupg/ --recipient blahblah \
--output secret.txt --encrypt test.txt
echo 'PASS_PHRASE'|gpg --armor --yes --homedir /etc/gnupg \
--recipient blahblah --passphrase-fd 0 --output secret2.txt \
--decrypt secret.txt
Is there anyway to directly output the (en|de)crypted text
to stdout (fd=3D1)?
Enjoy your day!
