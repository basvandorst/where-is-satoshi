@_subject: Ask for passphrase once, but require confirmation each time a key 
The motivation is that I'd like to know when something wants to decrypt
a file. I could configure gpg-agent to not cache the key and ask for the
passphrase each time, but that is very annoying with a long passphrase,
so I was wondering if there was any other way to accomplish that.
What I'm thinking is a popup window that (while gpg-agent has the key)
replaces pinentry, requiring a simple click of a button to allow the
decryption. Is there any way to do this?
I'm pretty new to this, so feel free to point out that my idea is
pointless / makes no sense if that is the case!

I do use a password manager ( but it
stores passwords in pgp-encrypted files - I'd have to insert the
passphrase to get the passphrase :)

Thanks, that could be an option - but not a cheap one it seems.
I'm also considering writing a pinentry program that does what I want,
however the last attempt ended in nothing but frustration...
