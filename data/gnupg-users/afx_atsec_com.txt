@_subject: PGP 7 and encrypted session key is bad 
I am using gpg 1.0.3 and 1.0.4 (Linux).
I am trying to interoperate with PGP 7.0 (NT).
When encrypting messages to the PGP system, no matter if it is a gpg or pgp
generated key, I always get the error "encrypted session key is bad". If I send
signed messages (with a GPG key) then I get a "found detached sig, no
callback" error from PGP. Browsing the archive I found references to using CAST, and I ended up setting
to following options:
cipher-algo CAST5
compress-algo 1
Still, no go. Am I missing something? Didn't see anything in the FAQ pointing
to PGP 7 and I hope I have included everything I need that I could see from
references to the older versions.
Colleagues who use gpg 1.0.1 as shipped with redhat tell me that they don't
have this problem. For obvious reasons, I'd like to us a more current release :-)
thanks for any hints

@_subject: waiting for lock... 
what would that mean:
$ gpg --no-verbose --batch --with-colons --list-keys  2CAE19B6
gpg: waiting for lock (hold by 1407 - probably dead) ...
gpg: waiting for lock (hold by 1407 - probably dead) ...
gpg: waiting for lock (hold by 1407 - probably dead) ...
gpg 1.0.4 on a SuSE 6.4 system.
It prevents mutt (1.2) from finding keys.

Thanks! It was not the . file but trustdb.gpg.lock that caused it!
The 1407 was putting me on the wrong trck, I was thinking PID here...

Massive distribution of Sphinx.... I doubt it. This is a German government
thingy ( None of my
commercial customers has ever heard of it. The beauty of Sphinx is the storage
of keys in smart cards. But there is near zero chance to use this on a
worldwide heterogeneous customer base. Way too much German signature law
centered. If you your key contacts for e-mail are in the German government,
there is probably no way around it, but for the rest, I really don't think
this is the solution, it is way too Germany centric.
