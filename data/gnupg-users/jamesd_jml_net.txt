@_subject: A question about verifying keys 
A colleague of mine asked me to send him a signed e-mail of fingerprints
of some keys that I'd personally verified earlier in the day. I'd also
signed the keys, and published the signatures to a public key server.
I argued that my signature on the publicly available keys was as good as
the signed e-mail of the fingerprints. He seemed to think that the
public key server introduced the possibility of meddling with the keys
(although I pointed out that if this was the case, my signatures
wouldn't verify).
Is a signed e-mail containing a fingerprint equivalent to signing a key?

@_subject: Problems with gpg-agent and ssh 
After a hard disk died, I recently moved from Debian Etch to Ubuntu
Hardy and I'm in the process of rebuilding my gnupg/gnupg-smartcard
environment. The card is working fine for encryption and decryption but
I'm having some problems getting gpg-agent to use the authentication key
for my SSH logins.
When I run ssh-add...
$ ssh-add -l
The agent has no identities
and gpg-agent's logs say
2008-10-14 11:45:42 gpg-agent[11743] ssh handler 0x8097fe0 for fd 9 started
2008-10-14 11:45:42 gpg-agent[11743] ssh request 1 is not supported

2008-10-14 11:45:42 gpg-agent[11743] ssh handler 0x8097fe0 for fd 9
Any ideas as to what's causing this problem?
