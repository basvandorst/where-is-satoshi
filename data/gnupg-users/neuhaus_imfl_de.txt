@_subject: Rescue secring 
my reiserfs partition crashed and I do not have any backup (or
revokation) of one of my keys.
I tried to find the secring with hexedit and I found some data.
But gpg --import always says
"gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: Total number processed: 0"
Does gpg have a fault-tolerant mode or do you know about any keyringtool
that may repair my dumps?
