You're cracking the wrong nut. We've concluded : You can't enforce everyone to ensure their email is decryptable.
So the solution is to make sure they don't get encrypted email.
Use GPG at a gateway level and deny any internal mail that can't be decrypted. This is the way PGPU can work. All internal users'
keys are stored on the PGPU server, users don't need to know their passwords or anything about their keys. The server decrypts or
encrypts as required. All traffic on your local network is in the clear.
We used to have a TFS server doing something similar using GPG. (you need to buy TFS, I don't know if there is a free solution out
Of course if your encryption policy is designed to prevent colleagues reading each others email, then this doesn't work. But if
people can access each others mailboxes, you've got a different problem (with file permissions)!
If it's too many people with root/administrator account that can read everyone's mail causing fear, then move the mail server to a
new, more secure box and only one person has the password (probably you should have sudo or similar setup so you can do admin

You can try to run ldd on the binary (use the full path to gpg, ldd won't search $PATH for you). That will show all libraries the
binary wants and if they aren't found. This might save you some repeated copying libs one by one onto the box!
It will also show that if you know libgcc is somewhere on the box but fails to be found, then you need to set your library search
path again (this env var varies depending what OS you're on. Solaris uses LD_LIBRARY_PATH).
I'm being a bit vague about the answer because the exact command you need will depend on the OS and the shell. You said you'd
already set some environment variables so I assume you know how to do it. In case you don't, here is a clue : if you're running sh then the assignment command needs to be followed by an 'export' for future
shell scripts to find it. If you're running bash/csh/ksh you can do it all in one.
Check it's properly set by doing an echo in a new shell (example in sh) :
$ VAR=val
$ echo $VAR
$ sh
$ echo $VAR
$ exit
$ export VAR
$ sh
$ echo $VAR
Every time you logout, you'll need to reset it. To make it permanent, it'll need to go in one of your dot files (.profile, .login,
.cshrc etc)

ld.so.1: gpg: fatal: libgcc_s.so.1: open failed: No such file or directory
I have set environment variables both when I compiled gpg and when I run the restore utility but I can't seem to get past this
I have worked with the Amanda folks but still haven't figured this one out.
