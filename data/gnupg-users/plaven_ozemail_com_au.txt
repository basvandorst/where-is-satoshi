This sounds like what I have been after.  I've read the manual and
have read a web of trust doc somewhere that espouses the virtue of
having the public key info (my key is already on a keyserver) available publicly like in your signature, but
what do I put in there? Finger print?  Key ID?  How is that benefical?

@_subject: Trusted Signatures on your Public key? 
Hi everyone,
I'm still wading through the reading available on Public Key Crypto,
one thing I'm not sure about, actully there's a lot I'm not sure
about, is what I came across reading about the web of trust, was
getting someone you trust to sign your key.
How does this work?  Does someone I know and trust sign my public key?
If so, how is that done and do I import it?  I appreciate the work gone into gpg... having read a page outlining
PGP horror stories, the one thing that came about was that public
keys weren't signed.. with that I checked my public key to find that
it had already been signed.. I gather during the process of creating
the key pair...?
