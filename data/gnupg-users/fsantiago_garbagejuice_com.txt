when i run it with --gen-key, it goes through the motions but on the final step of collecting entropy, it simply hangs and does nothing and my new key is not created. what can i check on this issue?

Technically yes. It's a hosted vps. Fabian Santiago

Haveged solved my issue. Worked instantly after installation.
Understood about my vps' comprised state.
This is for testing. My server published keys were indeed created under my own full control. Fabian Santiago

@_subject: How to use a the same generated keypair on 
people out there correct me if I'm wrong,
iOS natively won't make use of gpg keys, only s/mime. so you'd be relying on a 3rd party app to handle encrypted email using the former. unless you also have an s/mime key pair to use, then iOS' mail app will use it. said 3rd party app may allow you to transfer the key(s) to your device by way of itunes. i forget the exact place (something to do with app syncing i think) but there would be a place you can copy the files you wish to have sync'd to your mobile device. then the app would pick it up from there. i've used one such app before in the distant past but forget its name and don't currently have an ios device on me to look around but you can probably find something in the app store.

@_subject: using --keyserver but still getting gpg: no keyserver known  
Hash: SHA256
remove the hkp prefix from your server address:
someserver.com instead of hkp://...:...
and no equal sign either after keyserver.

@_subject: Question / sync keyrings between devices 
Is there anything out there, think bittorrent-sync, that allows for syncing your full keyring between devices? Would it be enough to simply use bittorrent-sync to sync your .gnupg folder? I get the ?export / ?import but what about automating it a lil? bit? Something peer to peer preferably. Sent from my iPhone
