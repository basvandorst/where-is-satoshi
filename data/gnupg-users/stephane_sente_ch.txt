@_subject: Bug when signing text? 
I'm using GPG on MacOS X Server; I downloaded from   a patch to make it compile on MOXS.
I encounter a strange behaviour with gpg, when signing some ASCII text:
Here the file to sign (the dashes are part of the file content):
I issue the command:
gpg --armor --clearsign < /tmp/unsigned > /tmp/signed
and the returned file has modified the lines beginning with double  dash (--). Now they begin with "- --". Is it normal?
hnw> gpg --armor --clearsign < /tmp/unsigned > /tmp/signed
gpg: can't mmap pool of 16384 bytes: Invalid argument - using malloc
gpg: Please note that you don't have secure memory on this system
You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for

@_subject: Decryption of file encrypted using multiple userIDs fails 
I'm writing an extension for a mailer, which allows it to  encrypt/decrypt pgp messages, and I make calls to gpg for this.
When I decrypt a message which has been encrypted for many people,  gpg returns an error, even if it can decrypt the message, because I  don't feed it with all receiver secret key passphrases!
For example, if I encrypt a message like this:
gpg --recipient recipient1 --recipient recipient2 --recipient  recipient3 --armor --encrypt myMessage
When recipient3 receives the message, it tries to decrypt it with:
gpg --no-tty --passphrase-fd 0 --decrypt theMessage
by passing its passphrase to stdin. gpg returns an error code of 2,  stderr states that there is no secret key for decryption available  (receiver1) or that passphrase is bad (receiver2), AND returns the  decrypted message to stdout, as it could be decoded using receiver3  Is there a way to avoid gpg to return an error code in this case?  There is no error, as the message could finally be decrypted; it  doesn't matter if not all identities are known.

@_subject: gpg 1.0.4 can't find entropy 
There has been a change bewteen gpg 1.0.1 and 1.0.4. Before, gpg  could find automatically ~/.gnupg/entropy file (I'm using egd), but  with gpg 1.0.4 it can't find it any longer: gpg needs to be launched  from path ~/.gnupg. Is it normal, is there an option to tell gpg  where is entropy?

@_subject: Localization settings? 
This is a question more related to GNU text localization system.  What are the environment variables used to set the current language?  I need to parse the output (as I can't rely on the status code... It  would be nice if there was one error code per error message), but I  want to force gpg to speak English.
