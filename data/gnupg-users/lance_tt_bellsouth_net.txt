@_subject: any way to add a public key to my secret keyring? 
I'm stumped.  I accidentally deleted two previous keys and created a new one, now a bunch of email I encypted to myself I can't open because the keys are gone.  However I have access to the public keys which were uploaded to a keyserver.  Is there a way to import these public keys to my secret keyring so that I may use them for previously encrypted data?
Please reply directly to my email, as I'm not a member of the list just yet.
