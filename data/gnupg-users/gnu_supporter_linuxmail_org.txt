@_subject: exporting and importing keys 
Hi all,
I just created my very first gpg key.  I read the Howto and was able to create the key but I'm a little confused on exporting the key and where it's placed when I export it.  Also, when importing someone elses key, is it stored in the same place?  I'm using Mutt (just in case you need that information).
Thank you very much for the help.
