Hey, I recall back in the days there were lots of online tutorials about
how to strengthen your GnuPG configuration. I'm setting up my gnupg.conf
environment and I was wondering which of these options still apply for
todays standards (GnuPG v2.2).
export-options export-minimal
keyid-format 0xlong
list-options show-uid-validity
verify-options show-uid-validity
personal-cipher-preferences AES256
personal-digest-preferences SHA512
default-preference-list SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 SHA224 AES256 AES192 AES
TWOFISH ZLIB BZIP2 ZIP Uncompressed
cipher-algo AES256
digest-algo SHA512
cert-digest-algo SHA512
compress-algo ZLIB
disable-cipher-algo 3DES IDEA CAST5 Blowfish
weak-digest SHA1
s2k-cipher-algo AES256
s2k-digest-algo SHA512
s2k-mode 3
s2k-count 65011712

Thank you kindly for your very informative answers.
It seems I was right to have asked here after all. It's amazing how many
outdated tutorials exist i.e. googling for "perfect pgp keypair" gives
at least three "wrong" articles among the top few results.
Having read the GnuPG docs a bit it appears a lot of options I listed
are already enabled by default by a recent gpg, so I removed them.
Should these also be included in the default-preference-list? I think
the latter is only used when generating new keys (setpref), yes? Alas:
personal-cipher-preferences AES256 CAMELLIA256 TWOFISH AES192
CAMELLIA192 AES CAMELLIA128
personal-digest-preferences SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 SHA224 RIPEMD160
default-preference-list SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 SHA224 RIPEMD160 AES256
CAMELLIA256 TWOFISH AES192 CAMELLIA192 AES CAMELLIA128 ZLIB BZIP2 ZIP
This I'm uncertain about. Should probably be removed too?
The documentation says:
--cert-digest-algo name
Use name as the message digest algorithm used when signing a key.
Running the program with the command --version yields a list of
supported algorithms. *Be aware that if you choose an algorithm that
GnuPG supports but other OpenPGP implementations do not, then some users
will not be able to use the key signatures you make, or quite possibly
your entire key.*
The RFC 4880 standard (section 9) does say that 3DES and SHA-1 must be
implemented, but the reason I included these is because I read on some
websites that you do NOT want to use these at all due to their
weaknesses and there should be some way of warning the user that weak
algorithms are being used.
disable-cipher-algo 3DES
weak-digest SHA1
If some client can't support newer algorithms like SHA-2 and AES then
it's better if that person upgraded their software rather than continue
to use SHA-1 and 3DES.
Best regards,

Hey, thanks for all the help. That was really an educational read.
I ended up with this config file contents:
keyid-format 0xlong
personal-cipher-preferences AES256 CAMELLIA256 TWOFISH AES192
CAMELLIA192 AES CAMELLIA128
personal-digest-preferences SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 SHA224 RIPEMD160
default-preference-list SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 SHA224 AES256 AES192 AES
ZLIB BZIP2 ZIP Uncompressed
cert-digest-algo SHA512
Do you also have any suggestions for generating new keypairs with GnuPG
v2.2? I'm planning to use a Raspberry Pi (Raspbian) to create a RSA-4096
master key with CS capabilities (the UID comment should obviously be
left empty) and three RSA-4096 subkeys for E, S and A. The subkeys will
be put on a smartcard (Nitrokey Pro) while the master key will remain on
the raspi, airgapped.
main: RSA-4096 SC, 5y
sub: RSA-4096 E, 2y
sub: RSA-4096 S, 2y
sub: RSA-4096 A, 2y
Also I was told to armor export the secret keys to a file and then print
that file as a last resort paper backup.
Best regards!

I would like to second this.
Storing private keys on a smartcard is a noteworthy security
enhancement, and I would like to see smartcard support being available
in Thunderbird. Either via GnuPG or some other mechanism.
