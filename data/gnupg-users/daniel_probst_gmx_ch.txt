Cygwin can create native code (i.e. exes not using the cygwin dll).
 I'd prefer (by far) using this option to downloading yet another version of
it compiles more or less out of the box. A point Werner mentioned was that
cygwin uses MS Crypto API for /dev/random. Quick and dirty tests I did,
did  not show any glaring statistical probs. I'd like to see a detailed
comparing MS API to Linux /dev/random.
I don't think any Win user would switch to a sane OS via being enlightend
by Cygwin. Give them Corels distr instead; they need to fiddle with a GUI
before they can autoconf.
Anybody with the knowledge to productively use GNU tools  only uses
Cygwin because he is forced to work on an MS Platform.
