@_subject: --send-keys fails 
When I do the following with GPG 1.0.7 (on Linux)
     gpg -keyserver certserver.pgp.com --send-key bob
I get
     gpg: conflicting commands
I also tried various other combinations including "--send-keys" and each
with and without a key specified and to several popular keyservers.  I also
verified that I can access the server's TCP port 11371 through my firewall.
This used to work on 1.0.1.
I have a deadline in a few days.
Thanks in advance,

Failure is not an option!
It comes bundled with all Microsoft products (in my opinion).

Please accept my apology for wasting your time and the list's time for
such a boneheaded mistake.  I checked it a whole bunch of times but did
not see it.  Really.  I have been working very hard and I am very tired.
