@_subject: how to bypass the prompt 
a vendor. In the process of producing my first encryption files using the public key, i'm getting the prompt asking me about the fingerprint, I had to type 'yes" to create the file. How do I bypass this and don't ask me about this again? I tried gpg with --yes option. it seemed like that it didn't work.  What should be the correct syntax?  ( tried with "gpg -ear --yes vendor_key_name " )
echo "my friend, " |gpg    -ear vendor --yes >testbea.pgp
gpg: A499C5CD: There is no indication that this key really belongs to the owner

It is NOT certain that the key belongs to its owner.
If you *really* know what you are doing, you may answer
the next question with yes
Use this key anyway?
