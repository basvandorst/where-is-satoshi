@_subject: Solid Crypting for GNUPG 
-For developers of GNUPG-
Can u get policy for adding a new open-non-patent algorythms for crypting in new versions of GNUPG without modules to it?I still aint get any new module and dunno how to add it at Linux.
Collect any open algorytms and release it in new GNUPG versions.Also give algorythms developers any contact for adding it code to GNUPG.
Thanks,Victor.A,GNUPG user from Russia.
