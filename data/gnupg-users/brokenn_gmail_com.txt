@_subject: Backup of private key 
Hi All,
This is a complete n00b question, but I still need to get an opinion on
I've created myself a public/private key and got a bit concerned that if my
harddrive fails, I lost the key and all data I've ever encrypted using it.
 Advice I find around the net suggest saving it to a floppy (what's that?),
storing it on cd-rom/usb in a safe location or printing it out.
All of these make sense to me, but aren't compatible with my ability to lose
physical things.  So, what would the risks be of me using symmetrical
encryption with a long passphrase to encrypt my private key, and storing
that in an online email account (gmail/yahoo/etc)?  If we consider the
symmetric encryption to be (practically) unbreakable, is this safe?
Looking forward to any comments.

Thanks for the useful tips - I think I'll go the encrypt-upload-to-email
route plus an additional paperkey option stored at relatives house in case
of email service going down.

So this implies that I could safely upload my  ascii-armored private key to
an email server without fear (assuming of course that my passphrase is
secure and large). What symmetric encryption is typically used on the key
itself? I'm assuming that this level of encryption is secure enough to not
worry about it being broken?
Thanks for the tip and welcome :)
