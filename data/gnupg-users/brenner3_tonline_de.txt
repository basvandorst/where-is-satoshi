@_subject: GnuPG with Pegasus Mail 4.01 and QDGnuPG 
I'm a new member on this list.
My englisch is bad, it's very bad. Sorry.
I work with PM 4.01, GPG - GPA and winpt. That's ok.
Now I installed QDGnuPG. After this I had wrote a new mail and marked encryption (without signature) and then I wanted to send the mail. But it came following message:
"error - gpg.exe can not started".
I hope you can help me.
               do you know our homepage?
powered by pegasus - it's a supermailer
