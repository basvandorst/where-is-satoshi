@_subject: restoring ~/.gnupg folder 
I recently installed Fedora Core 1 and kgpg.
I generated a keypair and uploaded it to the mit keyserver.
Everything was working great.
I then fubar'd my Fedora install somehow, and decided the best option to fix it was to re-install Fedora.
Before I did that, I saved my ~/.gnupg directory to a cd, exported my key to a file, and generated a revocation certificate to a file.
After the re-install, I restored my ~/.gnupg directory from cd, and imported the saved key.
Apparently, that was a bad decision.  Now, when I try to import another key, say the Microsoft pgp key, it won't work because it can't find a writable Looking at the list of files in ~/.gnupg, it looks like maybe I should chmod 644 a few of them.
[root root]# ll /home/charles/.gnupg

Now to my questions:
What is the proper way to save my secret key to a floppy?
Can I recover from the present situation, and if so, how?
Please CC: me, I'm not subscribed to the list.
Thanks in advance!
