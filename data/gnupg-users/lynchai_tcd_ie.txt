@_subject: pgp proxy problem 
i hope you can help. i've looked at similar threads, but their suggestions havn't helped me. i'm using gnupg v1.2.4 on slackware 9.1 and i'm having a problem receiving keys from a keyserver through a proxy.
i've run:
$ export http_proxy=
and in ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf i've added:
keyserver-options "honor-http-proxy broken-http-proxy"
when i try to receive a key i get the following error:
$ gpg --recv-keys XXXXXXXX
gpg: can't get key from keyserver: eof
gpg: Total number processed: 0
if any one has any suggestions as to what i need to do, i'd be very grateful to hear them.
thanks for your time.
