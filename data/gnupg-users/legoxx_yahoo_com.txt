i dont want to use keyrings in ~/.gnupg but ./foo.pub
and ./foo.sec (i have created them using gpg --batch
--gen-key -a foo and they seems to be ok) so i modified my script:gpg --no-default-keyring
--secret-keyring ./foo.sec --keyring ./foo.pub
but i got this...
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=2d)
gpg: read_keyblock: read error: invalid packet
gpg: enum_keyblocks(read) failed: invalid keyring

well i want to use foo.pub and foo.sec in the current
direcotory not /home/user/.gnupg
i want to sign a file without importing key to my
keyring, and i need my customer to verify signature
without installing public key to his keyring. Just
simple command line interface. Ideally in batch file

i found the problem:
keys cannot be created using --armor option otherwise
they are not usable as extern keys...
