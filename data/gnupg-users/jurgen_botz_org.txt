@_subject: gnupg-1.2.1: public key not found 
Hash: SHA1
Maybe I'm doing something stupid here... gnupg-1.2.1 as shipped with
RedHat.  I just downloaded the new FreeS/WAN release and associated
signatures and keys... I want to verify the signatures.  So I did
~  $ gpg --import freeswan-allkeys
This seemed to work.  Then I did...
~  $ gpgv freeswan-allkeys.sig
~  gpgv: Signature made Sat 22 Feb 2003 02:40:24 PM PST using RSA key ID
~  gpgv: Can't check signature: public key not found
Hmmm... but doing 'gpg --list-keys' shows that the relevant keys
are in my keyring...

~  pub  1024R/5A7E4731 2002-06-25 FreeSWAN RPM signing key
Strange.  Also...
~  $ rpm -K freeswan-module-2.00_2.4.20_9-0.i386.rpm
~  freeswan-module-2.00_2.4.20_9-0.i386.rpm: sha1 (MD5) (PGP) md5 NOT OK
(MISSING KEYS: PGP
Again, the key id is one of the ones I imported above and which
'gpg --list-keys' shows as being there.
What could be going on?
