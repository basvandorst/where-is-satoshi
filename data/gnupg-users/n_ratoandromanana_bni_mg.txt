@_subject: Signing a message for more than 1 recipient name. 
Hi all,
I used PGP 2.6.3 before and it was possible for me to sign a message for
more than 1 recipient name. Now with gpg, signing is always possible but
when decrypting, gpg request the password for the first signature. E.g:
When signing and encrypting:
gpg -r alice -r bob -u john --sign --encrypt file > file.dat
When decrypting:
gpg -u bob --decrypt file.dat
Goog signature from Alice ...
I am Bob not Alice!
Thanks in advance.

@_subject: How to use those *.mo files? 
Hi all,
This is an another problem or a feature not well documented in GPG hand
book. There are those *.mo file in the W32 distribution and I thought they
are expected to change the output of GPG to a specific language, e.g fr.mo
for french. Then I used:
gpg --load-extension fr.mo --fingerprint keyid
with no luck.
The output is always 'fingerprint=...' while I expected 'empreinte'.

That's fine but is there no way to do that on the command line?

If I understand your problem, this is a suggested solution when you have a
file encrypted for multiple recipient. I don't know if this is a bug or
not but when decrypting, gpg ALWAYS use the first user in the secring.gpg
file even if you specify the user with -u option.
%gpg --export-secret-keys  > gpgtemp.asc
%gpg --no-default-keyring --secret-keyring gpgtemp.asc --decrypt
I hope this helps you.

My apologies; this line should be:
%gpg --export-secret-keys test1 > $GPGDIR/gpgtemp.asc
where $GPGDIR is the absolute | relative path where you put you gpg
executable and your secret keyring. All the remaining is ok.
