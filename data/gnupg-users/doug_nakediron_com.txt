@_subject: "unusable public key" on encryption 
I've run into a bit of a snag this evening.  I'm desperately trying to encrypt something using an RSA public key that someone sent me via email.  After importing the key successfully(???), I am still unable to use it for encryption.  This has never been a problem in the past, but it is also the first RSA key that I've tried working with.
If I run "gpg --list-keys", the key shows up as follows:
pub  1024R/3006DF31 2003-12-16 SWsoft Support Team (Generated for Rusoffice) So, that looks okay...I think?
Just to make sure they have supported ciphers, I check the prefs like this ("gpg --edit-key 3006DF31"):
(1). SWsoft Support Team (Generated for Rusoffice)       Cipher: AES, CAST5, 3DES
      Digest: SHA1, RIPEMD160
      Compression: ZLIB, ZIP, Uncompressed
      Features: MDC
But if I try to encrypt a file, all I get is "unusable public key".  I'm feeling really lame...  :-(
Here's some system info --
gpg (GnuPG) 1.2.3
Supported algorithms:
Pubkey: RSA, RSA-E, RSA-S, ELG-E, DSA, ELG
Cipher: 3DES, CAST5, BLOWFISH, AES, AES192, AES256, TWOFISH
Hash: MD5, SHA1, RIPEMD160, TIGER192, SHA256
Compression: Uncompressed, ZIP, ZLIB

Any insight would be greatly appreciated.

The results are:
hashed subpkt 27 len 1 (key flags: 03)
I'm afraid I don't know what that means though.  :-)
