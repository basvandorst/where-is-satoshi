Hey Folks,
i succesfully installed gnupg on my Win7 machine. I want to use it
with Thunderbird to encrypt personal eMails.
Now I've got some questions:
1) What does happen if I lose my private key? Can I burn it to a CD/DVD?
2) Where can I find the key, I just got the passphrase?
I generated the Keys with OpenPGP-Plugin for Thunderbird. I got the
public key (something_stands_here.asc) and encryption works fine :)
Hopefully looking forward
