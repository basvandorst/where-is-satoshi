Hi, Peter. Thanks for help. I definitely will try your method next time because my colleague do the PC recovery into earlier date. Then, everyrhing goes back to normal. It used to work without signing the identity of public key though.Right now, I have no PC to try it out until next error occurs.  I believe I downloaded this version "gpg4win-1.1.4.exe	17-Feb-2009 17:46	9.5M	" . It is a little bit old but I have a hard time to install newer version on my windows XP SP3. It simplely doesn?t work on my windows XP. I googled it . Some people said , it is not compatible with windows XP SP3 Chinese system.
That is why I only install the older version of gpg4win.  AS for the pictures in the mail, I was not aware of that. I will make a shortcut link next time .
Again, Thanks.
Yuwen Pan

It says "Key validity - Unknown", so it seems you haven't signed the key and GnuPG is refusing to encrypt to a key of which the identity is unverified.
Are we talking about GnuPG 1.1.4? Because that should be exhibited in a museum instead of run on your computer. It is way too old to use.
If it's the GPG4Win version, I can't tell how old it is.
PS: I might be mistaken, but I think you're not supposed to include pictures in mails on the mailing list. It's better to put it on the web somewhere and include a link to it in your mail.
I use the GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG) in combination with Enigmail.
You can send me encrypted mail if you want some privacy.
