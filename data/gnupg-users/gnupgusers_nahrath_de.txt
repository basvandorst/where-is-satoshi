Dear Fabi=E1n,=20
Thanks for your effort!
The need for an easy GPG installer on Windows is urgent (I can't teach my
father how to edit his computer's registry on the telephone ...).
But before downloading one of those 'made easy' packets I have some
questions (not only to you).
 only provides binaries
without an installer. Is there a certain reason for this?
 offers a graphical installer but it is
quite outdated (installs GPG 1.06).
 and offer recent installers (GPG 1.2.1).
But those binaries where built by people I have never heard off.
By principle (please don't take it personal!):
How can I know that these versions are unchanged and don't install trojan
horses or other ugly stuff?
When it comes to software I trust in Werner Koch. At least I have a
trust-path to the key that signed the source archives.
I have no trust-path to you or Keith.
Actually I hardly have a trust-path to any developer whose software I
installed (not even to Apple Computers), but GPG is ... a bit more special.
At  I have not found a link to
 or one of the other installer sites.
What do the GnuPG developers think about the other installers?
I don't want to suspect anyone of something bad.
These are rather general doubts I have about software distribution.
Greeting, Michi

It may be sufficient for you, but you don't write GPG only for your
personal use :-)
Having a decent installer is critical for evangelization.
It may also be critical for security concerns.
I have seen guides on the web whose advice results in storing the private
key file in C:\Programs\GnuPG\ even on a multi-user W2k system - readable
for all other users.
A good installer would use the user's private directory instead (the
- -outdated- GnuPP installer does).
How about adding a link to the download section of "Other distributions using our code" with a disclaimer like:
"We can not guarantee for the integrity of other people's compilations.
You have to check for this on your own."?

Sorry, already 4 GPG related lists are enough for me.
(At least public) signatures are something that need personal contact or
at least good personal knowledge and a long telephone call.
With one exception: I have signed one CA organisation's key (with sig 2)
where I can check the fingerprint with their printed magazine (I know that
not everybody aggrees with this).
They have almost signed 10000 keys alone.
So I don't have a lot of keys personally signed.
But I have set the level of 'trust' high for some people that I have not
met (nore signed) but who are well known as reliable in the OpenSource and
security scene. If someone I have signed has signed their key I have a
stong path to them and to those they have signed as a result.
Many of my trust paths to other people look like this one:
German identity cards are quite reliable documents.
First time you feel stupid to ask someone for it but that is what I do
before signing.
Does this confirm to me that the Fabian I find there is really the owner of
key 0x5AF2A4D5 ?
I have never heared about Thawte in Germany (didn't read anything about
them until yesterday).
Maybe this is a benefit of  and some more
CAs (mainly at Universities) that volunteerily serve as HUBs in the
PGP-web-of-trust and make getting signed rather easy for us.

Last night I compiled GPG 1.3.1 on MacOS 10.2.2.
Works fine until now.
On verifying the signature on David's recent posting my Mail-Plugin got
stuck, so I tried to import his key 0x10F4B2AA on the commandline.
It seems to hang too.
No matter if I try "gpg --recv-key 0x10F4B2AA" or
"gpg --import" and paste the key from
it doesn't finish (for a long time, maybe I quit too early).
If I type=20
    gpg --recv-key -vvv 0x10F4B2AA
the last line printed is (one line)
    gpg: pub  4096G/10F4B2AA 2002-05-23   David Pic=A2n =B5lvarez (High
        Security) nothing happens for about 90 seconds, then it complets with
    gpg: key 10F4B2AA: "David Picon Alvarez " not
        changed
    gpg: Total number processed: 1
    gpg:              unchanged: 1
Now typing=20
    gpg --edit-key 0x10F4B2AA
prints the three lines warning and then waits for 30 seconds before
displying the key-data.
The Mail-Plugin (EntouragGPG) still can't verify the signature. It blocks
until the timeout.
This is my ~/.gnupg/options file:
    no-greeting
    default-recipient-self
    escape-from-lines
    charset iso-8859-1

I also tried
    gpg --recv-key --charset utf-8 -vvv 0x10F4B2AA
it produces a 90 second delay as well.

Sorry I don't have time for deeper testing. Looks quite interesting.
Here just some short ideas after a first glimpse:
Verifying nothing but mail adresses can be valid for a limited time.
Mail addresses cange more often than real-life-identities.
Your signature should reflect this in some way.
Either you give signatures that expire after a certain time (eg 6 months).
I don't know if this is possible and if it doesn't raise a bunch of
compatibility problems.
Or you let the signing key expire (eg after 1 year).
IMHO one encrypted communication path is mandatory. That would verify that
the holder of the mail address is also in posess of the secret key and the
Not everybody will want your robot to sign all UIDs.
OK, they don't need to import all the signatures
but some easier way to choose would be preferable.
At least you might provide advice haow to export ones key striped to one
UID from a local GPG installation before sending it to the robot.
Another way of reducing the load and traffic was to reduce signing only to
mail adresses that are the Sender of the mail that sends the key.
That idea conflicts with the cgi-interface as it makes the ability to
_send_ mail from an address another verification critereia.

Version 1.5.8 dated on 2002-10-08)

Betwheen the "sig" and the 8-byte Key-ID there are 10 characters space.
Where do I find a complete compilation of all possible values they can take
and their meaning?
Rather than getting an explanation what Douglas' "P" means (which was my
original question) I'd prefere to get a pointer to the full documentation.
The second character after the "sig" is new since GPG 1.0.7 and indicates
the quality of a signature. Where can I get more information about this new
model? I haven't found anything about this except the release notes for 1.0.7 and
the dialogs inside the program and those are rather short.

If it works with expiring signatures as well I am fine about it.
But letting the authority's key expire (not revoke it!) was not a problem

Ever since I am wondering if there isn't a command or an option that allow
to do this directly from the command line.
Why isn't there a   "gpg --set-owner-trust --value f 0xXXXXXXXX"
or                  "gpg --edit-key --trust f 0xXXXXXXXX" ?
(Note: the second syntax could easyly make each interactive subcommand of
       --edit-key a command-line otion)
Or does it exist and I simply don't find it by searching the manpage for the
string "trust"?
Maybe not.
The man-page (GPG 1.3.1) contains:
       --update-trustdb
                 Do trust DB maintenance.  This command goes over
                 all keys and builds the Web-of-Trust. This is an
                 interactive  command  because  it may has to ask
                 for the "ownertrust" values of keys.   The  user
                 has  to give an estimation in how far she trusts
                 the owner of the displayed key to correctly cer-
                 tify  (sign)  other  keys.  It does only ask for
                 that value if it has not yet been assigned to  a
                 key.   Using  the  edit  menu, that value can be

So there seems to be no other UI for this value but the edit menue

Signing doesn't express anything about trust. It is about identity.
Signing a CA means that you have checked that the CA's key really belongs to

I guess you did this with key 0xB3B2A12C
The CA is driven by a computer magazine and they print this key's
fingerprint to each edition, so you can verify it (meaning: "this key really
belongs to this company").
So you had occation to verify the key belongs to its (non human) owner by a

How you set the ownertrust for a key is your personal matter.
So you should give ownertrust to the CA's key.

Do you intend to give a "sig!1" to everybody who ever answered to an
encrypted e-mail you sent to them? They all prooved that their e-mail
address is valid.
That is the big danger I see in calling a service that signs allmost for
nothing a "CA". It devalues the real CAs that do check the identity of the
signed very thoroughly if they all get mixed up.
ct magazine and DFN-PCA have strong policies about this (at least for those

may ruin all the good they have done to build up the strong web of trust we
have now.

Indeed there is a trust component on signing. You need trust in the
constitution of this organisation, mainly the trust that they keep to their
policy and will in the future. So reputation and trust is cruical for
accepting a CA organisation as a "legal person".
Imagine 'Heise' would be taken over by another publishing house that doesn't
guarantee the policy of the 'Krypto-Kampagne'.
Would the current Heise employees hand out the full data of the cert-key?
I trust they wouldn't. That is the base that made me sign their key.
I trust that if the organisation would end to exist in the current form the
key would as well.

It is hard because those connections _have_ to be strong. Rather have a lot
of people unconnected (which simply expresses the truth) than lowering the
meaning of signatures.
Weak connections are SPAM to the web of trust.
... accepting that you might ruin it that way?
(Mainly a question. I haven't come to a conclusion yet.)
Even if GPG, PGP and HKP where updated immediately with such a feature
it would take years untill most people had the ability to recognize the
weakness of a robot signature.
People simply don't update their softway as fast as you may wish.
I have thought it over:
Originally you where looking for a way to enable client software to
pre-check the mail-address in a reciepient's key.
Therefore you want to have keys pre-validated by an e-mail validating robot.
That far it is OK. It doesn't raise security in any way but it may raise
comfort for the users of that specific client software.
Expressing the sucessfull check by adding a robot's signature to the key
is not the right way because this is not what signing should be about.
'persona'-signatures might be a solutions but we don't have the adequate
software to treat 'weak signatures' yet.
What you need is a validating keyserver!
Current keyserver take and store each key they get, without any tests.
Imagine a new generation net of keyservers that don't incorporate keys to
their database before they have proove that at least the e-mail address
belongs to the key owner!
Keys should even expire from their database automatically if they are not
confirmed after a certain period of time.
No signatures are given by the robot for this e-mail verification.
Geting listed on such a keyserver is proof enough.
Check out what happens if you want to upload your key to biglumber.com for
an example (they don't have expiration yet)!
If your to-be-written client software only connects to those 'validating
keyservers' you have anything you need to protect granny from sending e-mail
to non existing mail addresses.
And the web of trust might stay what it is meant to:
A strong web built upon strong connections only.

I let this key be signed by the robotCA. I sign your real key with it and

have signed your original key (not to your nearest friends and not to known

new key.
They will import my key to their GPG or PGP and will see the revocation

will be 'f' as soon as they import it.
If they re-check the first signed e-mail I sent to them after they have
imported my key their program will tell them: "YOU FULLY TRUST THIS KEY."
How many of them would still try to confirm the new key's fingerprint with
you personally (at least by telephone) before they start sending sensitive
data to me encrypted or believe what I write to them in signed mails?

It needs two independend things before the ownertrust you set for a key
comes into action for building up calculated trust to other keys.
You need to raise the ownnertrust to this key AND there must be some proof
inside your keyring that this key realy belongs to his owner. This may be
your direct signature but it may as well be someone else's (trusted)
signature.  =20
But you should not do this without personal verification.
Imagine you set ownertrust for key 0x5B0358A2  now.
Currently that won't change anything.
But imagine that next week you had an occation to meet with Josh Huber
(just as an example) and sign his key 0x6B21489A.
Suddenly WK's key will be valid in your keyring and all keys it has signed
will inherit calculated trust. All because Josh has signed Werner.
Let's go one step further. You don't travel that much, but Dragos Necula
happens to visit Boston. He meets and excanges signatures with Josh Huber.
If you had given ownertrust to Josh Huber's (at that time still invalid)
key before with Dragos' Signature to Josh's key at a sudden all signatures
from Werner's key will produce computed trust to those keys that you have
in your keyring and that Werner has signed.

Best thing is you try it out on your own:

Now do 'lsign' and 'trust 4' to this key!
(Just for testing purpose. You may want to gpg --delete-key 0xB3B2A12C
Now check my key again!
It should be (without any further action taken by you!):
pub  1024D/9A4C704C  created: 2001-11-02 expires: never      trust: f/f
[ my key now got validity by the signature from 0xB3B2A12C AND the trust

It has changed to=20
pub  1024D/78F5E034  created: 2001-11-03 expires: never      trust: -/f
Suddenly you "fully trust this key" (in the words of GPG), just because it
is signed by me AND you ownertrust me AND my key is signed by some other
key that has ownertrust given by you AND is valid.
That is how ownertrusting an unvalidated key may have an effect.

gpg --list-sigs 9A4C704C displays the mess (and

I had 7 foreign signatures on my key before I created a third UID last week.
Only one signer (exept myself) has signed the key since, so the new UID
should have only 2 Signatures (including the self-signature).
But now the keyserver displays that all 8 signers have signed my new UID.
I guess because 7 signatures are older than my self-signature GPG marks
those as bad.
I am shure that those other 7 people have not (at least not all of them at
the same time) signed and uploaded my third UID.

@_subject: export single UID of a key 
Hash: SHA1
For e-mail validation after keysignings there are basically two methods:
1. Send a challenge in an encrypted mail to each UIDs e-mail address and
wait for the decrypted answers before you sign.
2. Sign only one UID and send it in an encrypted mail to this UID's mail
Do this for every UID in a key seperately.
Do _not_ keep these signatures in your normal keyring.
If the key owner uploads the signatures to the keyservers he prooves that
he owns the secret key. You get your signature back via '--refresh-keys'.
The second is the way I want to go. Currently I use basically those steps:
gpg --recv-key $KEYID
# START loop: # repeat until only 1 UID left
    gpg --default-cert-check-level 3 --edit-key $KEYID uid 1 sign save
    gpg -a --export $KEYID \
 gpg -a -e -r $KEYID \
 mail -b $MY_MAIL -s "your signed key" `gpg --list-key $KEYID \
 grep " | cut -d "<" -f2 | cut -d ">" -f 1 | head -1`
    gpg --edit-key $KEYID uid 1 deluid save
# END loop
gpg --delete-key $KEYID
gpg --recv-key $KEYID
So the first UID is signed, the full key exported and sent, the first UID
is deleted and now the prior second UID is the first and the game goes on
(with the key getting shorter in each turn).
Currently this only works correctly in GPG 1.2.2rc1 because in earlier
versions '--list-key' and '--edit-key' have different sorting orders, if
the primary UID is not the first.
Of course this should be done on a temporary keyring and the mail sending
could be enhanced. Both is already scripted - but that is not the point.
I have the feeling: There must be a better way to do this!
Something like 1. Sign the full key
2. Export only one UID of the key
3. Encrypt and send the exported one-UID-key
4. Back to 2.
Is there a way to export only one UID?
If not I'll have to stay with the destructive method.
In this case:
Is there a way to sign and delete only one UID of a key without using the
interactive '--edit-key'?

Pure Certification keys or UIDs without e-mail address can't bechecked that
way -- but they can't be checked with an encrypted chelange either.
AFAIKS the signatures are only detached to the UID parts, at least this is
how GPG and the keyservers display it.
Is there a difference in the end if I sign all UIDs in one turn or each by
its own (except from differences in signing time)?
Is it possible that someone owns and uses only the decryption subkey but
not the primary signing key to it?
If the owner of the UID's e-mail doesn't controll the secret key to decrypt
my message the signed key will stay unpacked forever.
After signing and sending it doesn't even exist in my keyring any more.
Sorry, if there es a basical logical problem I still don't get the point.

Thank you for clearing this!
How does this fit to the fact that trust to a (primary-) key gets lost if a
user ID is revoked?
Is there any mechanism to sign somebody else's primary key without signing
any of his UIDs? Maybe this a bit overparanoid two days after a keysigning party where each
of the key owners presented his/her idendity and key-data in person.
Many people find this alone enough to sign keys. E-mail validation is only
be an extra-bonus.
But I understand that technical security is not about probability but about
(even theoretical) possibility ;-)
I underestimated again, that the signing key is "the key" and all
encryption/decription is secondary (sub-*) to it.
