@_subject: tracing the Web of Trust? 
Hi folks,
I'm trying to learn if there's a tool to trace the web of trust
between two keys.
For example, suppose I get an email from someone I've never heard of
and want to learn if there is any valid chain of signatures leading
from me to him.
I imagine that this is a difficult problem.  :-)  Has anyone solved it
for Joe Average user?

@_subject: "official" WinPT site? 
For a long time here's been a WinPT download at  which
includes GnuPG.
As of April 4 there's a GnuPG-win32 download at  which
includes WinPT.
Is one more "authoritative" than the other?  Where should people be
going for the One True WinPT?  I'm guessing that the new g10code.de
one will be better maintained, as they have all the outlgpg stuff as
well?  Any opinions?

@_subject: GnuPG book prepub reviewers wanted 
I'm in the midst of writing a very small book about GnuPG, called "GPG
for the Desperate."  It's modeled after my earlier "Cisco Routers for
the Desperate."
This book will cover the lowest common denominator of GnuPG usage for
the computer-literate user.
I've hit that point where it would be helpful to have outsiders take a
look at what's been finished of the book, and at later chapters as I
finish them.
If you're interested, please take a look at
 for a brief
description of what's involved.  If you're still interested, please
reply directly to me -- no need to clutter the list with this stuff.

Not much to read:

This is in Firefox 1.0.

@_subject: How to check fingerprint without importing? 
I usually import questionable stuff into a different $GPGHOME if I'm
that concerned.
Mind you, there's probably a more elegant way to do this...

@_subject: Bogus Key on Keyservers 
Signatures can help as well.  I trust keys more if I can find Web of
Trust paths to them.
But there's no way to mark the bogus key as bogus.

@_subject: batch mode lack of randomness FreeBSD 
Definitely ask on freebsd-security
I believe you can install this and run it as a regular user, as well,
but I might be wrong.
Not on FreeBSD, but I've never had to generate large numbers of keys.
I pay more attention to mailing lists than messages sent to me.  Email
is no longer a useful personal communications medium for me.  :-(
Good luck!
