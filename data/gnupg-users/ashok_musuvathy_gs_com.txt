If I use the options --keyring and --secret-keyring to point gpg to the
ring files,
How does it affect the usage of random_seed and trustdb.gpg files ?
Would it still work OK if there is no access to ~/.gnupg directory ?

That is just fine.
This is all controlled by the option:
 --homedir  Set the name of the home directory to  If his option is not
 used, the home directory defaults to   It is only
 recognized when given on the command line.  It also overrides any home
 directory stated through the environment variable  or
 (on W32 systems) by means on the Registry entry
 HKCU\Software\GNU\GnuPG:HomeDir.
~/.gnupg translates to something like "USER/Application Data/gnupg" -
but it depends on the Windows version and the localization.  Down
inside gpg the Windows constant CSIDL_APPDATA is used to locate that
The default location for keyrings as well as for the configuration
file is then in the homedir.  You may use the options --keyring,
--secret-keyring and --no-default-keyring to change the location of
these files.
Almost everyone is fine with the defaults.

I am working on a project to convert PGP keys to GnuPG.
Most of the keys created recently have successfully been migtated but I am
unable to migrate the ones created using PGP Version: 4.0 Business Edition.
The error I get is: ( gpg version 1.4.2 )
  $ gpg --import pubkey.pub.asc
  gpg: WARNING: using insecure memory!
  gpg: please see  for more information
  gpg: key 390CA571: no valid user IDs
  gpg: this may be caused by a missing self-signature
  gpg: Total number processed: 1
  gpg:           w/o user IDs: 1
Following is the output from pgp for the same key:
  $ pgp -kvv 0x390CA571
  Looking for user ID "0x390CA571".
  Type bits      keyID      Date       User ID
  RSA  1024      0x390CA571 2003/09/24 KKK   sig            0xCC7AB923             MFF user   1 matching key found.
I have heard that there are compatibility issues between GnuPG and older
versions of PGP but is there any way of getting around this ?
Any help would be well appreciated.

Thanks, I do have the secret keys., could you provide me the pgp command for
self-signing ?
Should I do this using pgp -ke for each one of them ?  ( Have around 50
such keys to be migrated )
Gpg is able to load the key with "--allow-non-selfsigned-uid" but is
unable to use the key for encryption - I guess this will be fixed once I
self sign the key and load into gpg ring.

I am
If you still have the secret key, you can have the key sign itself and
then this error will not occur. Otherwise, you can use the option in
to import the key, and then have it sign itself.
