@_subject: Build Gnupg2 to have bin name gpg 
Dear gnupg-users,
I've been wanting to build gnupg2 to have the bin/executable name gpg
instead of gpg2 but have so far been unsuccessful in tracking down exactly
what bits of the source code need to be altered. I am running a linux i386
system. I know this question might be a bit trivial, but any help you could
give me is greatly appreciated.

@_subject: Change encryption on the secret key 
Dear Fellow Gnupg users,
I recently grew more knowlegeable about of the different ciphers and compression methods. I already generated my secret key but would like to change the symmetric encryption protecting the secret key. I put the following in my gpg.conf:
s2k-cipher-algo AES256
and then I updated my password with gpg --edit-key, passwd. Is that enough to update the cipher on my private key? If not, what should I be doing? Is there also a way to detect the encryption algorithm on a file? Any help with these questions is appreciated.

@_subject: GnuPG 2.0.17's gpgtar option 
Hash: SHA512
Good to see 2.0.17 has been released, but I am somewhat mystified by the
gpgtar option thing I saw at the end of ./configure. I have no idea what
it is. Can anyone help me with this?

@_subject: Future plans for implementation of other algorithms 
Hash: SHA512
Just out of curiosity (this might be the wrong mailing list for this so
I apologize in advance if that is the case), are there any plans for
implementing any other encryption/signing algorithms in GPG and if so
what are they?
