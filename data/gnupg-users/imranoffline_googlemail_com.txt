Can someone please guide me, if there are multiple trust
signatures(tsign) with different trust values and trust depth on the same
key k, what values (trust-value and trust-depth) are stored for the key k.
For instance :
key A----------tsign/3/full ---------->key B
-------------tsign/3/full---------->key D
       \
                     ^
        \---------tsign/2/marginal---> key
i.e. key A assign trust signature to key B with trust value (full) and trust
      key A assign trust signature to key C with trust value (marginal) and
trust depth(2).
      key B assign trust signature to key D with trust value ( full) and and
trust depth(3)
      key C assign trust signature to key D with trust value (marginal) and
trust depth(2)
and assume that key A is ultimately trusted key. than my understanding
and analysis is that if signatures for key D are read in the order of (B,
C), Key D's trust value and trust depth will be evaluated on the basis of
key C's (last read) signature and will be set to '0' for 'trust-depth' and
 'marginal' for 'trust-value'.Have I interpreted it correctly or am I
missing something?
The question is does it depends on the order by which signatures are
evaluated which will eventually store the value from the last signature
Also can someone please answer whether trust signatures are made on the key
or (key,id) pair?
Best regards
Imran Khan.

Thank you very much for your detail reply but unfortunately it got complex
Well, let me rephrase, In its simplest form GPG code says that browse all
signatures on the (key, id) pair, and if it encounter a trust signature, get
trust value from it ,and set it for the current key(not uid), and set
trust-depth of the key to 'trust_depth -1' ( in GPG code this is stated in
validate_one_keyblock( ) function
as: pk->trust_value=sig->trust_value; pk->trust_depth=depth-1;)
Now my understanding is that this code, during a validation of
keyblock, replace trust-depth and trust-value for the current key(pk) with
the values from latest trust signature encountered every time, either on the
same or different id of the key (pk). This definitely lead to
some erroneous assignments of values, or I must be missing something causing
me a confusion.
you mentioned some metrics, like  (min(level_m,level_n),
min((depth_n-1),depth_m)) and in other place u stated, "Combining the two
paths should leave us with the strongest trust". Are these your
own intuition or these things are mentioned in GPG code somewhere?

@_subject: minimum_ownertrust 
Can some one please guide what is the difference between ownertrust and
My understanding is that ownertrust is explicitly assigned to a key while,
minimum_ownertrust is computed from trust signatures(tsign) on the key.Have
I interpreted it correctly?
If this is the case, what is the minimum_ownertrust of ultimated trusted
keys(i.e. user's own key for which secret key is available) for which there
is no trust signature?
