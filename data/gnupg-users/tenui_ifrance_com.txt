Hi all,
When I created my key I chose AES256 as the encryption algorithm. When
I encrypt to self (to encrypt a file on disk, for instance) I get the
warning "gpg: forcing symmetric cipher AES256 (9) violates recipient
The command "pref" gives me "S7 S3 S2 S1 H2 H3 Z2 Z1 [MDC]". If I use
"setpref", what must I add to this string to include AES256? Also, what
will be the result if I set preferences to "none"?

Well, I have tried
setpref S9 S8 S7 S3 S2 S1 H2 H3 Z2 Z1 [mdc]
and I get
gpg: invalid character in preference string
I am using gnupg-win32-1.21-nr1 with GPGshell 2.65. Do we have a bug somewhere here or
am I missing that is obvious to a more experienced user?

Sorry, Dick, I must in turn disagree with you. It is
not the privacy of the recipient that is encroached upon, but rather
his/her personal liberty. For the sender, though, it is a question of
privacy, and maybe more (life, liberty, property, etc may well be at
Agreed, some users may use "for your eyes only" messages lightly, but
if I send such a message it is because I have a good reason for doing
so, and I must assume a priori that any sender also has a good reason.

OK. I can understand your point of view and I think it may well be that of the majority,
But I suspect that our difference of opinion is based on different experience of the need
for confidentiality. It is no longer the case, but during a certain period my life depended on
the confidentiality of the information I transmitted. And when it comes to my life I don't
trust anyone.
But on a more general level, we are talking here in reality about tempest attacks. No matter
how much I trust my correspondent, I have no idea if he may be the target for such intrusion.
So I would be happier to accept the sender's' wishes and, in cases that seemed unnecessary,
tell them that I preferred that they did not use this form of message unless it was absolutely

@_subject: bad signature on clear signing 
Hello all,
Volker Gaibler was kind enough to inform me of a bad signature on a clear-signed message to
the group.
After a series of tests with another (local) gpg user, using 3 different mail programs, I find
that my signature is always bad when I clear sign a message and mail it, though there is no visible sign of alteration to the message in transmission If I transfer the message to another machine via a floppy the signature is good. The problem is specific to clear-signed messages; if I use "sign" or
"encrypt and sign" the signature is good.
The problem is not specific to GnuPG; the same thing occurs when I use PGP 8.
Any ideas from the experts?
(I am using gpg 1.2.1-nr1 with GPGshell 2.65)

Likewise, Dick. A polite difference of opinion is a pleasure.

One of three mailers I used (Outlook Express) had the quoted-printable option enabled
during my tests

Yes, that's what I thought. In any case one the mailers for testing was
Outlook Express with quoted-printable enabled, so the problem seems
elsewhere. I have also verified that it is not my outgoing antivirus scan.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE ===== At 06:52 13/12/2002 -1000
The signatures check out "bad" becausetwo extra lines (CR LF) are inserted in the clear-signed messages, somewhere between the outbox and the recipient.
The first is inserted after the hash id (after the blank line that follows the hash id, according to a hex comparison with UltraEdit).
The second is inserted after the GnuPG or PGP version information and before the
blank line following that information.
The extra lines are inserted no matter which mail program I Use. I
have tested with Outlook, Outlook Express, Eudora, Pegasus Mail and
Foxmail. I have tried three SMTP servers, and checked that my outmail
virus scan is not in cause.
So, I wonder if Windows itself is in cause (or more specifically Windows 2000). If not, I
must have a gremlin some where in my OS.
Do any other Windows users have the same problem,

I think your signature is bad, also, Per. I do not have your public key to verify it, and when I read your
post in my mail program I do not see he extra blank lines, but the extra lines show when the message is copy-pasted to Notepad or when I read the message in hex format.

Hello Per,
With your key, I can confirm that your signature is bad for me (on both of your signed messages),
but Xavier Nodet tells me that the signature on your post to gnupg-users was good for him.
To add to the confusion, Volker Gaibler informed me  that my signature on one message was
good. That makes one good signature from about 50 messages!!

Hi Norbert,
My suggestion was based on a test like you describe above. I created a test=
key and added
two extra IDs with the same e-mail address, then disabled the different=20
keys one by one.
The encryption/decryption worked correctly every time, using the first=20
enabled key in the list.
As I said, I worked through GPGshell, but maybe the difference in our=20
results stems from using
different versions of gpg 1.2.1 (I use the Nullify version).
