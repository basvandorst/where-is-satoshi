I have mailcrypt installed on emacs 20.4 using gpg 1.0.1. Some of the
encrypted messages that I recieve aren't recognized as such by
cryptmail. I get the message 'No encryped message in buffer', yet
sending the encrypted contents to gpg decrypts them just fine. Anyone
have a clue as to why I am having this problem?
