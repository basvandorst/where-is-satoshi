Hi !
Ok many thanks for so many answers but i'm using GnuPg only for
secure-mails (for my old home pc 2,4 ghz machine) and a normal (standard
generated 4096 bit ;-) :-D ) key is (so i hope) enough.
Out of curiosity. It's possible to create a key over 4096 bit? And the
answer is yes (but ... using hacking Gnu-Version ...blah blah). I'ts to
high for me ! The standard version is ok !!
Many thanks to all !!!! :-D  I know my english is verry horrible ;-)
