@_subject: bug - HP/UX 10.20 compile of gnupg fails 
If I build without --disable-asm, it give errors about invalid syscalls
when running gpg. If I build with --disable-asm, it gets a undefined
symbol __udiv_qrnnd at link time.
It built just fine on HP/UX 11.00.
This occurs with HP's C compiler as well as gcc (2.96 20000712).
