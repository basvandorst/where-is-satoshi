@_subject: Using gpg-groups in gnome? 
does anybody here know a possibility to use gpg key-groups under gnome?
groups defined in the gpg.conf
(e.g. "group mygroupname = 0xAAAA9DB0 0xBBBB9540")
do not show up in nautilus' seahorse extension.
kgpg is capable of dealing with groups, but as it is a KDE-application
it ist not usable via the nautilus context menu.
best regards

Yes, you can use nautilus-actions or nautilus-scripts for kgpg, but in
reality used this way kgpg crashes five times a day, "forgets" its
settings like "use untrusted keys" and so on.
That is not acceptable in a productive enviroment with 80+ Users.
I hoped someone would have an idea about a more stable solution.
