@_subject: Problem between version 1.2.1 and hushmail.com 
Hello fellow gnupg users,
I just ran into a problem using GnuPG to encrypt an email message sent
to an hushmail (free) account. Newbie warning : I'm rather new to the
world of GnuPG !
Here's what I've done :
  gpg -r autoXXXX --armor --encrypt my_message
Then I sent the output to the above adress. Here's the error message I
got on hushmail.com : "An encrypted message should only have at least
one public key encrypted session key packet and a symmetricaly
encrypted data packet".
Am I doing something wrong, or is something broken with GnuPG or
Hushmail ?
Thanks for your help !
