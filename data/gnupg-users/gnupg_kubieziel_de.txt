@_subject: Revoking a key with revoke cert 
I have a key with a forgotten passphrase (0x738FECB0) and want to revoke
this with the inherent revoke certificate. I did a "gpg --import cert"
and gpg told me that it imported one revoke cert. But when I look at that
key there is no indication (like [revoked] or something else) that this
key is really revoked. So how can I see if this key is really revoked?

@_subject: Migrating keys 
I'm planning to migrate to a new generated key (0x38CB4232). Currently i
have lots of signatures on my recent key (0xEE0977E8). Therefore I'm
planning to write all signees an signed and encrypted mail requesting for
a signature to my new key. Because they verified my old key and I through
signing with my old key I assure that also the new key belongs to me.
Do you think that behaviour is appropriate or do I have an error in

It is.
I don't want to revoke my old key right now. Instead I want to use more
and more the new one. If then the old key isn't used for some time (maybe
half a year or more), then it will be revoked.
My old key had an expriration date. I changed this some time ago, but
some keyservers couldn't handle that. So I get sometimes complaints that
my key is expired even though it isn't. I created a new key to stop those
bothering messages.
However I understand your other arguments and will better till next
signing parties ...

Complaining people said they're using *.pgp.net, especially I updated my key on those servers.
PS.: You have a list of keyservers on your page. Are those all available
keyservers worldwide?

@_subject: --refresh-keys stops working while processing 
I wanted to update my keyring and did a "gpg --refresh-keys" without
other options. After processing 194 keys it stopped. I got no error
message and the last line which was spit out is:
gpg: Schl?ssel C5836F2A: "Christian Franke (Der Spinner) " Nicht ge?ndert
After waiting some 10-20 minutes I killed the process. When I retried it,
the gpg-process stopped at approximately 110 keys. I can reproduce this
error for every "--refresh-keys".
What can be the reason for this? (I was only the whole time.)
Thanks for any hints

It seemed to be. I chose another keyserver and it worked without further

OK, then assume that I delete the original file. ;-)
Nope, I was just playing around and saw or better assumed that there is
no way to remove the signature. However I didn't tried the easiest way
that Dave suggested.

my Key 0xEE0977E8 had an expiration date which I changed last year. Now I
had a keysigning with a pgp 6.5.8-ckt user and he told me, that my key is
expired. He fetched the key from different servers and "all keys" showed
as expired. Do you know if this pgp version couldn't handle the changed

I told him and he said he did. Maybe it's the same with many users ("I
never touched that ...")
I suggested kjsl and random.sks.keyserver.pengiun.de.

ACK. That should be the first step after generating the key.
You should use a keyserver which synchronises with others. So
subkeys.pgp.net or random.sks.keyserver.penguin.de are both good
choices. Furthermore you can publish your key at your website.
gpg --import $REVOCATION_CERTIFIFCATE
You should also upload this revoked key to a keyserver.
You could check a keyservers webinterface (e.g.
 If the key is revoked, then you'll see
it there.
You can also create a new testuser on your sytem and receive your key.
If "gpg --listkeys" shows the key as revoked, than it is revoked.
Normally you have to do some keysignings. That means you have to meet
other people, check their passports, their fingerprints. If all seems
OK, you sign the others key. If the other one thinks that all is OK,
he'll sign your key. "gpg --list-sigs $KEYID" shows you a list of all
signatures a key has.
If you have signed person B's key and B has signed C's key and you trust
B than you can (more or less) be sure, that C is C.
You can check  I guess
it answers some of your questions.

There is apparently nothing you can do, except you have a revocation
If you have a revocation certificate you could import it. Without it
you're lost.
