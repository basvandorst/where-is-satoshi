If the Sun is hacked, an attacker can (potentially) see every password you type.
You almost certainly want two passwords, first for the ssh connection and second for the gpg.
What I've seen other people do is use two keys one for home and one for work/school. It seems to work pretty well, you can sign them with each other and take both to keysegning parties.

Let me see if I've understood you correctly:
You have a Sun which does all your you normal mail handling, and at whose console you do do your computing. You have another laptop connected to the Sun via a public network which has your secret key. When you wish to use your public keys you use ssh to start a bash shell (or similar) on the laptop, transfer your data, perform your operation and transfer your data back. Possibly you have a script to automate some of these connection/transfer/opration/transfer steps.
If the Sun is compromised, then your ssh connection and password is compromised. If your ssh password is compromised then an attacker can use it to connect to the laptop and get your secret key. If the secret key has no passphrase, then the attacker has all they need.
If you have a passphrase on your secret key, then to perform the operation the passphrase must come from somewhere. If it comes across the ssh connection and the ssh connection has been compromised then your passphrase can be known to the attacker. If it comes off a disk local to the laptop and the attacker has you ssh password, then the attacker can connect to the laptop and collect the passphrase.
If the attacker has access to the sun to install a keylogger (phyicsal or software) they can access any passwords and phrases you type at the Another approach is to have a restricted account whose login shell isn't bash but a script which allows only certain operations to be performed. If you're very good at writing secure code this might be an option. I'm not sure you could use any out-of-the-box security scripting solutions because most of them prioritise the integrety of the system over the protection of some secret which the script has access to anyway.

It's still not clear where are the (ssh, gpg) keys stored, where are the gpg cryptographic operations are performed and where the passwords and passphrases are input and transfered.
Where does the MUA (or the program it calls out to) get the ssh password and the gpg passphrase from?
If the ssh connection is establishable automatically, then an attacker who has compromised the Sun can estalish a connection to the laptop. If the connection is to a general purpose account, all sorts of badness may

You will get a speed-up. Be aware that keys with multiple signatures and uids consume far more space that keys with fewer signatures and uids.
The safe way to start with an empty keyring is:
0) send any new signatures to the keyservers (gpg --send)
1) rename pubring.gpg
2) rename trustdb.gpg
3) import your public key(s) from a keyserver
4) edit your key(s) to make them trusted

I'm guessing that some of the environmental variables are different. The man page lists $HOME, $GNUPGHOME and $GPG_AGENT_INFO as variables the gpg uses. Maybe you could check that these are set as you expect?

@_subject: Revocation of key with only secret portion 
I have a key-pair to which I have mislaid the public key but not the secret key. The public key is not on the keyservers, but some individuals may have it, so I would like to revoke it.
All of my attemps to either generate a public key from the private key or generate a revocation from teh secret key alone have proved unsuccessful. Can I do either of these?
