@_subject: Decrypting files from PGP Mac users (MacBinary files) 
I had a problem as the above and could't find any solutions on the=20
Internet - but I found it my self so here it goes (for the record):
The PGP Freeware for Mac suggest the user to use a specific method when=20
encrypting files so the format is some kind of MacBinary (should be=20
easier to open the files under Windows then).=20
You can test the filetype with the file command:
$ file decrypted_file.txt
decrypted_file.txt: Macintosh MacBinary data, type "TEXT" (ASCII),=20
creator "TBB6"
If you look at the file the first lines are a lots of escape characters=20
and the last lines aswell. And the middle section is pure ascii. You=20
can convert it with command macsave which has to have the input from=20
standard input. You use the option -d to get the file's data:
$ macsave -d < decrypted_file.txt
And now you have a file named something with a data extension in the=20
current directory (the filname may differ more than just the extension):
Now it is in the right format so the final step is to move it to the=20
right filename (and extension):
$ mv secure.data secure_firewall_setup.txt
You can also do the decryption and converting in a oneliner:
$ gpg --decryption file.pgp | macsave -d
Maybe it could be an option for gpg to actualle decrypt and convert on=20
the fly - but that is for me to wish and for the developers to code...

@_subject: Word wrap/Text format? 
It's because the file from Linux is in a unix format where you only use=20
one control character to change lines.
Use the unix2dos command before encrypting the text file or find a=20
Microsoft texteditor which support opening Unix files and saving them=20
as dos files. Notetab Pro is one of them.
