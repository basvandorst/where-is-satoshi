@_subject: use of --passphrase-fd in batch symmetric encryption 
I'm no perl programmer, either, so I don't know what's wrong with
your code. But it's quite easy to do with sh ...
for file do
  gpg --passphrase-fd 3 -c "$file" 3< /home/cbinkle1/.gnupg/pass

@_subject: Building on powerpc-ibm-aix4.3.3.0 
I'm trying to build gnupg-1.0.6 on powerpc-ibm-aix4.3.3.0. I've
tried various configurations, like:
setenv CFLAGS "-g -O2 -mcpu=powerpc"
./configure --prefix=$HOME/usr --enable-static-rnd=none
But it always fails with the following messages (and some more
warning I'm skipping here):

I've found nothing about this problem in the docs, and nothing AIX
specific except the "MPI stuff" for which I've set the CFLAGS as
Any ideas?

Thanks, this works for me, too. (I suppose it causes rndlinux not to
be built, so I didn't have to try what Lars suggested.)

@_subject: Steganography (`stealth') with GnuPG 
For PGP, there's a utility called `stealth' which strips off all
identifying header information to leave only the encrypted data in a
format suitable for steganographic use
It doesn't seem to work with GnuPG encrypted files, however. Is
there a similar utility for GnuPG, or a way to make stealth work
with GnuPG?

I don't have the idea plugin, and AFAICS on the ftp srever, it's not
available currently (and I'd like to avoid a patented algorithm,
anyway). But thanks, anyway.
BTW, how hard would it be to write something like stealth for
OpenPGP (or is it not possible at all)? Though I won't have any time
for it now, maybe sometime later ...
