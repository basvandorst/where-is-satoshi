@_subject: GnuPG and PGP2. 
At present, simultaneously encrypting and signing a message with so called
"RSA Legacy" keys requires using a pretty complicated workaround method.
Is there some fundamental problem in implementing this feature properly or
is it just an unadressed issue so far ? Can I expect future releases of
GnuPG to improve this functionality ?
Thanks for your help.
Best regards,
