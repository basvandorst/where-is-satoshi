Yep, true, the biggest problem comes from the fact some people arrive
late and/or without having done their homework.
And using a new, unknown method for keysigning is not a very good idea
because then you need not only to explain your method but also to argue and convince, a task that requires energy, time, in short all the
possible benefits from your "revolutionnary" method are gone!
(I'm talking by experience...)
It's quite logical that the classical method (one row) works quite well
if people are busy checking IDs & fingerprints all the time.
The only thing you can easily do to accelerate the process and avoid people to queue and wait at the beginning is to make directly a double row instead of a single that folds and becomes also double.
Usual way: (B=busy person, W=waiting person)
        <-   BBBBB
Faster method:
     <-
 BBBBBBBBBBB
 BBBBBBBBBBB
     ->
