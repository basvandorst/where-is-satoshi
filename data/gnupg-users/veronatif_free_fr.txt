@_subject: Non-ascii embedded filename 
Confirmed with GnuPG 1.4.3 on Linux. It seems that in characters
encoding, all bytes that are between 0x80 and 0x9F are munged. Exactly
all bytes between 0x80 and 0x8F are replaced by the 3 chars "\x8", and
all bytes between 0x90 and 0x9F are replaced by the 3 chars "\x9". This
on a correct locale setup, and on a filesystem accepting those bytes in
filenames. It seems the embedded filename is stored OK, and the munging
takes place at the --use-embedded-filename stage.
    Additionally filenames are stored and extracted as they are, in the
current charset. This gives another problem when the locale is not the
same during both operations.
Bye!	Alain.

@_subject: uncleanable expired sig 
I have on my key 0xC1C46015 as fetched on subkeys.pgp.net several
temporary signatures from PGP Global Directory Verification Key. Those
signatures seem all verified, but are expired. With GnuPG 1.4.2 I do
--edit and "clean sigs", and they are gone. Except one of those expired
sigs done on 2005-09-04 stays uncleanable?
Bye!	Alain.

@_subject: codeset conversion issue with GnuPG 1.4.x on HP-UX 11.0 
Hello Mike,
    The HP iconv has non-standard names for charsets. It knows the UTF-8
charset only by the name "utf8". While GnuPG hardcodes "utf-8". If you
are root, tweak the /usr/lib/nls/iconv/config.iconv file to add an
"utf-8" to "utf8" alias.
    By the way: LANG alone suffices to set a value for all locale
categories. Do not use LC_ALL, unless you have a Good Reason.
Bye!	Alain.

@_subject: ISO-8859-1 mails getting marked as UTF-8 
Hello Martin,
    First of all, your Mutt charset setup is quite suboptimal.
Discussing it would be off-topic here, but you could find infos in the
Mutt wiki, and some guidance on the mutt-users mailing list.
    Mutt forces traditional PGP mails to be sent in either "us-ascii" or
"utf-8", period. $send_charset is ignored. That is done on purpose, to
follow some standards, and is not overridable.
    However, as you noticed, this poses interoperability problems with
some other mailers. So Tamotsu Takahashi wrote a Mutt patch permitting
to read and write traditional inline PGP mails containing any charset.
It picks the best adapted first necessary and sufficient charset in the
$send_charset list (just like for non-signed mails). Apply his latest
patch-1.5.*.tamo.pgp_charsethack.1, and set $pgp_charsethack=yes. You'll
be able to send inline signed Latin-1.
    Don't hardcode any given charset. Let GnuPG free to automatically
derive the right charset from your current locale. LANG=en_DK implies
the Latin-1 charset, so all is well. And if one day you switch locales,
GnuPG will immediatly follow, and continue to display things right.
Bye!	Alain.

Hello Werner,
    A charsethacked Mutt can make use of this Charset armor header, if
it exists. Or make use of a MIME charset label, if it exists. Or assume
UTF-8 otherwise. Mutt then converts accordingly the text to the display.
This doesn't impact signature verification, which is done before the
    And when sending, Mutt sets the MIME charset label, as a hint for
the recipient.
    This scheme is not half as robust as PGP/MIME, of course. But in
practice works rather well in cooperation with various other mailers.
Comparing it with traditional PGP in the straight Mutt (forcing UTF-8)
is not crystal clear: One will fail in some cases where the other works,
and the contrary. The balance seems in favour of the charsethack,
though. The standard hurts interoperability, unfortunately.
    If the recipient's mailer supports PGP/MIME, this is of course a way
better solution than any form of traditional inline PGP. All charsets
are then cleanly usable, without any hack or guesswork.
Bye!	Alain.
