G'day Don,
* Don Ferguson  [041207 17:43]:
  You need to get a real email program.  Ditch the Microsoft and get
  something that recognises PGP/MIME.
Basically signatures in the attachments are generated by emailers that
are able to use RFC 2015 (I think - Google for "pgp signature rfc")
which effectively specifies that the (Open)PGP signature of an email
should be an attachment.  The old style signatures are frowned upon
(in some circles) and the argument is that "application/pgp is not
really suited to a world with MIME, non-textual body parts and similar
things"  (from the mutt web page).  Translation - MIME good.
As for verifying the messages...  Um, can you save both the text of
the email and the attached signature and then gpg --verify them?  I
don't really know, mutt (my mail program) does it all automatically
for me!  :-)  As another alternative try one of the many other
programs (thunderbird, ...) that will be suggested by the other
replies I expect you will receive.

It really should be high on your priorities.  Not only does it not
allow your preference with GPG/PGP but it also breaks threading in
replying to emails...  Argh, it'd drive me mad!  ;-)
[Oh and whilst I am bashing you TOFU (Text Over Full-quote Under)
makes reading replies difficult too...  Is there anything else you do
that I can complain about???  :-> ]
There should be a Outlook plugin somewhere...  Did you see this message?
  Possibly that's because the signature is for the _whole_ text message,
so when I view my last message I see something like...
   --===============0790732039==
   Content-Type: multipart/signed; micalg=pgp-sha1;
           protocol="application/pgp-signature"; boundary="envbJBWh7q8WU6mo"
   Content-Disposition: inline
   --envbJBWh7q8WU6mo
   Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
   Content-Disposition: inline
   G'day Don,
 [SNIP]
   --envbJBWh7q8WU6mo
You would need everything between the "--envbJBWh7q8WU6mo" lines.
I should clarify that I am guessing here.
Hope this helps.

G'day DBSMITH,
* DBSMITH  [050419 10:37]:
Hint 1: Use echo to help you debug - i.e.      echo cat $file
    echo gpg ......
  That way you can see what your script is _trying_ to do, not what
  you want it to do.
  What are you trying to do?  Decrypt all the files in the directory
  "/data/files" ?  This script won't do that.  You are passing
  "/data/files" to GnuPG, not a list of the files IN that directory.
  (You will see this when you use the echo hint above.)
  If you want all of the files inside /data/files, set
  var=/data/files/* and that should work.
Hint 2: I find it useful (others will disagree) to put brackets around
  my variables to let the shell be sure what I want it to do...
  So the line:
    for i in $var
  would become
    for i in ${var}
  Then there is no confusion when you want to do something like
    ${var}stuff
  However that is an aside.

G'day Derek,

What shell are you using?
At the start of your program put
  i=0
Inside the loop put something like
  i=`expr $i + 1`
and then use ${i} as the unique filename addition.
This is _not_ what the error was that you sent in your initial email:
  > and the error I get is
  > Sorry no terminal at all requested - cat get input.
The above fix won't fix this error unless I'm missing the point
P.S.  Please don't bother replying to me and the mailing list...

The primary key is a signing DSA type 1024 bits long, the encryption
ElGamal subkey is 4096 bits long.
As they are doing two different jobs the lengths need not be the same.
Have a look at
  for a brief comment on the lengths.
I'm sure there are other more elucidating documents available if you
look around a bit.

I had the same problem.  For some reason GnuPG wants these gpgkey_*

Just symlink them (*) and then submit a bug report - I was and still

I'm not sure what Adam did, but I just used the included .spec file to

Oh, the .spec file is faulty too with regards installing the info

G'day David,
Sorry about the delay in replying, work got in the way of fun!
* David Shaw  [050209 21:43]:
Sorry to say, but this still doesn't work on my FC2 box.  :-(
Two problems:  1) The location of the gpgkeys_* files is still wrong.
 2) The info "dir" file still doesn't get created.
CAVEAT: I modified the .spec file so that it tries to install the
1.4.0 release - I didn't try 1.4.1rc1 so the first problem might have
gone away...  I will have a go with 1.4.1rc1 when I get some more
1) File location problems.
This new spec file installs the gpgkeys_* in /usr/libexec/gnupg/ as
one would hope, but gpg looks for them in /usr/libexec/gnupg/gnupg/!
It looks like there is some doubling up of libexecdir in the spec file
and keyserver/Makefile.am...  libexecdir in keyserver/Makefile.am is
defined as  which would give the extra layer of
gnupg causing the problem.
I'll leave the fix as an exercise for the reader!  ;-)
2) info "dir" file.
I'm not entirely sure that it isn't user error, but I can build RPMs
from pretty much everything else without problems.  :-(
The error I still get from (rpmbuild -bb gnucash.spec) is the
   [SNIP]
make[2]: Nothing to be done for `install-data-am'.
make[2]: Leaving directory `/tmp/fedora/tmp/gnupg-1.4.0'

    Bad exit status from /tmp/fedora/tmp/rpm-tmp.2023 (%install)
When I comment out the "rm ..../info/dir" line from the spec file the
creation of the .rpm goes ahead successfully.
As I said, I'm not sure if this is the fault of something I'm doing,
or FC2, but GnuPG is the only code that seems to have this problem for

G'day David,
Second thoughts on the RPM problem...
I've just remembered that I can get 1.4.0 to install in a non-standard
directory and it works fine (just compiling by hand), so this
definitely looks like a problem with the arguments to configure and
make in the .spec file.  *NOT* a problem with keyserver/Makefile.am
like I suggested before.  I'll claim that it was a lack of coffee that
caused my mistake! I'll have a play around with the spec file and make some more
suggestions over the next few days.

Nope, just a flakey implementation of RFC-3156.  This would make sense

G'day Jason,

Without wanting to start too much of a argument, it seems from my
reading that the preferred way of sending messages should be
PGP/MIME.  The benefits over inline signatures, including being able
to include attachments in the signed message and non-ASCII characters
are significant.
However, many people will disagree...
Well, as they say "every cloud has a silver lining" and at least
Thunderbird / Enigmail does the right thing for properly formatted
You can now trust what we tell you, even if we can't trust your

G'day Entity-that-is-possibly-Melissa,
* Melissa Reese  [050228 18:54]:
IMHO this is a pain.  Some (most?) of us on this list don't use "click"
type mailers.  So for me to get your key I need to unmangle the mailto, workout what subject line I need to use and then finally send it off.  Guess how much motivation I have for doing that?  I'd never bothered even reading your signature so I never would have found out the instructions were there...
Key servers were set up so people didn't have to to something like you have done.  Heck, if you have the power to set up an email account that is an auto-responder, just have it auto-respond to any email, don't make us have to send both a subject _and_ and message body.  I think that we will make the spread and use of OpenPGP grow by making it easier, not harder for people to verify signatures.
So do you only envisage using your key to sign messages?  If you want to use the encryption part then it becomes silly to have your philosophy.  Take as an example someone, who wants to send you an message that your ISP isn't to read.  This person would now have to mail you to get the key - thereby revealing to anyone who was listening in to your communications that entity controlling email address XYZ is interested in talking to you privately.  Then you can get asked questions like "Why does  want to to talk to you?".
Just a thought,
