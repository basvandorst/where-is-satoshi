@_subject: command line password option? 
Is there plans (or could there be plans) to have a password flag so that one could pass everything in a command line?
I'm part of a web based email project that being able to use
gpg from a script so that it's not interactive would be
a great feature.  gpg --password=password --rest--of--flags
I can imagine this isn't something that would be normal for people to use and could lead to security issues, but from
our stand point this would be awsome.  Leaving the
security issues up to us. :)

How about the ability for gpg to talk to a database (postgres, mysql, etc...)
to obtain password and keyring's...so that one could store keyrings and password
information in a database.  What's the chances on this??? :)  Ivan E. Moore II                                      Rev. Krusty
