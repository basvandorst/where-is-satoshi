I can see this too (FF 45.0.2 on Debian testing).
But if you change the top: value in for the "nav ul li:hover ul.sub-menu" selector in your CSS file from 39px to 37px, then the problem disappears for me. I'm not a web designer, so I'm not sure this is the 'proper' fix for the gap.

The option --with-wkd-hash is not implemented in gnupg 2.1.11 (on Debian testing). Maybe change this to "Install GnuPG 2.1.15 or later".
change to "tar xjf gnupg-2.1.15.tar.bz2"
