I don't remember if this was asked, but will 1.4.6 have a Win32 build?

I don't think HTML was why, it could be because of the number of links.
Were there a lot? (it arrived before I subscribed to the list)
Doesn't really matter,though. Just add gnupg-users-bounces and
gnupg-announce-bounces to your address book.

How was I to know?
(I always forget that gnupg-users messages show the original sender and
not gnupg-users at gnupg.org or gnupg-users-bounces at gnupg.org as the sender)

I think that this problem came up before, and that one has to rename
gpgkeys_hkp.exe to gpgkeys_curl.exe (or was it the other way around?; I
can't remember).
