@_subject: secret key (not) available 
Hallo everybody
I use GPG 1.4.4 and have encrypted a txt-file on computer A.
I put this encrypted txt-file to computer B and wanted to decrypt it there.
Then computer B said "secret key not available".
So I exported my keys from computer A and imported them in computer B.
But the error remained.
So I copied the encrypted txt-file back to computer A and wanted to decrypt
it there. But there was the same error!
gpg --list-keys didn't even show any keys on computer A.
So I exported the keys from computer B and imported them on computer A.
Where they were actually created. But it still didn't work.
I have another file encrypted with gpg on computer A and I can decrypt this
gpg -K does not show any keys (!?)
I hope this problem is not too confusing.
Thank you very much for your effort!

Hi HHH
Thank you for your fast answer!
First of all, 2 of three of my files work now. Although I don't really know
what I have done.
I tiped once "gpg --home" (thank you Gou Yang) and then gpg created a file
secring.gpg or so. Is this possible?
Are the keys user specified? I remember that I had created the files and
keys with another user than I tried to decrypt them.
I had not exported my secret keys, I had not generated a key by "gpg
--gen-key" and I have no idea if I had encrypted the files symmetrically or
asymetrically. I had typed "gpg -e filename".
The files I have (by the way I use Windows XP) in my application data folder
gpg -K now shows some keys.
Well, thank you again for your help.
If you have another idea for my third file please let me know.
But it would be ok if you did not write an answer. It is not sooo important.
Have a nice day!
