Since you seem to be requesting it explicitly, I'll share that I'm interested personally.
     thank you,

@_subject: a bunch of questions 
Please forgive me for piling several questions into a single post. If
anyone wants to just answer a subset, I'll still be very happy to read
your advice.
I believe that the key I'm signing this message with is 2048 bits and
will expire next year. If I've got either of those details wrong, please
correct my error(s).
I would like to generate a new key (which never expires) and begin to
transition to using it. Mostly I sign messages, but occasionally I
receive encrypted messages from friends. I hope that in the future I
will use gnupg more.
What size key do you recommend I create in order to be future proof (for
the rest of my life -- I'm in my early 50s)?
I believe that the master key for the subkey I'm currently using will
also expire next year. How would I go about confirming/refuting that
I currently use gnupg with two different email accounts (this one and a
gmail address) and I use different mail clients for each: thunderbird
with enigmail here and claws-mail (and whatever debian gnupg plugin is
appropriate for claws) with gmail. How can I set things up so that I can
switch back and forth between two keys (for signing) until this one
expires in 2018?
I'm on debian 9 stretch on two different computers with this setup.
?? thanks so very much in advance for any answers (or pointers to
appropriate documentation),
????????? ~c

I'm running debian 10 buster (upgraded recently from stretch if that
matters) and i use KDE. I haven't yet tried to logout of my desktop
environment completely (and just use a native console), but I thought
I would see if any of you had any ideas. Here's the problem:

Is getting those first 5 characters into the output of this string
really that amazing? Or am i missing something significant about what
the rest of the seemingly random characters represent?
spoiler, my output was:

i've found that claws, evolution, sylpheed and kmail all integrate
seamlessly with gpg2 (using standard debian packages for everything)
