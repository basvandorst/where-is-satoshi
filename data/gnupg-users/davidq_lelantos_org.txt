(I'm continuing my thread from May 2014.)
I have been reading through this thread.
Most of you don't seem worried about the possibility of 4096 qubits
happening (i.e., of RSA-2048 being cracked) at all before you are dead.
But what about younger people here in their teens, 20s or 30s? What am I
* Is there simply no general interest to address this at this time in the
cryptographic/PGP community?
* Maybe I should ask again in 10 years? If people notice that Moore's Law
is holding up for qubits after 10 years, maybe they'll more eagerly start
looking for solutions?
Right now my main worry is that people will store a lot of encrypted data
long-term and crack it open in 50-60 years using a quantum computer.
Because of this, every time I use PGP I have to ask myself: Do I care if
people crack this after 50 years? It's cumbersome.

GPG encrypted data (using RSA) can be collected today and easily decrypted
after 50-100 years using a quantum computer. See:
For this reason, what I do today is share long keys with people I know *in
person*. We then use regular AES-256 to encrypt/decrypt our messages back
and forth. Every 6 months we meet in person to renew our keys. (To be more
secure, we actually create the keys in portions via in-person at different
places, OTR, SMS, landline phone, mobile phone, and snail mail.)
AES-256 is not vulnerable to quantum cryptography as RSA is, so we feel
much safer this way.
What are your thoughts on these issues? Why do you keep using GPG, knowing
that your data may easily end up out in the open on Google or The Pirate
Bay a few decades from now?
Are there any plans for added security measures in GPG given how
vulnerable it is? For instance, any plans for adding quantum safe public
key crypto alternatives to RSA?
