@_subject: Passphrase not asked when exporting private key (via GPGShell) 
Why does GNUPG not ask for the passphrase when I export a private key?
In this case I'm using GPGShell (Win frontend) but surely that is not
the issue. I deleted the key from the ring and then imported the
exported keypair and yes GPG asks for the passphrase when
signing/decrypting so it is preserved in the exported key (I hope) and
not stored in the TrustDB?

Do not use strlen() on plaintext or ciphertext! Its not really text!
If there happens to be a zero in the bytes your strlen will return a
shorter value!

Also, when decrypting you are using both params as dest and dest
instead of src and dest...
I see towards the end of your code sample is gcry_cipher_decrypt (hd,
dest, strlen(dest), dest, strlen(dest));
But I've never done GNUPG development so that may not be the problem,
or see my earlier reply about not using strlen() on either ciphertext
or plaintext... since its not really "text" even if your input plain
text is just a "string"...

Nobody posts on WinPT-announce ? Im on the list
since a few months but no emails from there...
Or is there some other list where I should monitor for announcements/updates?
