This says the development has stopped and I haven't tried it, perhaps you can
give us some feedback about it when you're done ?

@_subject: GPG and MS Outlook users 
Hi Lars,
I just installed your plugin under Windows 2000, using Outlook 2000.
I would like to know how I can import my private key into GPGA, I tried
specifying a paramaterer in
GNUPG's path at Tools|Options|Encryption|Advanced:
C:\Program Files\GnuPGExch\gpg.exe --allow-secret-key-import
But this does not seem to work. Is there an options file I can specify ?
Where ?
I searched both GPGA docs and your site and didn't find any information on
On a more general topic, why is it that most PGP-based front-ends/backends
assume that we are always wanting to create a private key in the first place
? I'd love to have the choice to importa an existing one, in an easy way...

How about releasing it as a module ? (usable with --load-module)

@_subject: Using keyservers 
I'd like to have an example of using gpg with keyservers. I have been unable
to update/retrieve keys from gpg command line. I have tried direct command
line, the options file, etc. and I always get this:
C:\GNUPG>gpg --send-keys gpg: write failed: ec=87
gpg: can't connect to `certserver.pgp.com': No such file or directory
I tried using different keyservers that all work with the GUI versgion of
PGPi, but I keep getting the same.
Any ideas ?
