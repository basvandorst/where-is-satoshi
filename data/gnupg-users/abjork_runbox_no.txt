@_subject: Timing test of GnuPG and old PGP 
Hash: SHA1
I did test my Celeron 2.0 laptop with 512 MB RAM. I encrypted a 177 MB
compressed ARJ-file. Both PGP 8.03 and GPG 1.2.3-nr1 from Nullify use
3DES for my key.
I encrypted the same file 3 times with each program. On average it took
1 minute and 09 seconds to encrypt the file in both GPG and PGP.
