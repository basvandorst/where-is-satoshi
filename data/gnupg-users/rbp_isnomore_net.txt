I wasn't here, then, so please forgive me if I'm kicking a dead
        I just sent myself a test message with "áéíó??ãõ ? and stuff like
that, and my signature checked ok (--clearsign).
        Indeed. I'm using a few macros to use gpg as I think it's the most
portable way (ie, cleartext, in the message body).
        Not very handy, though, it'd be great if mutt would understand it

        Oops... That's what I was talking about when I complained about lack
of native support for this in mutt - I forgot to sign this message :p
        I'm replying to myself, signed, just to see once more if the
signature checks.
        Sorry :p

        Yeah, so it did here. I don't want to raise a dead issue (though it
seems not to be dead yet), but can someone (possibly himself) explain to me
what Justin R. Miller  meant by:
        That was my target with this "test". I put in some non-English
characters in my message (áéíó?etc) and everything went fine.
        And, again, I'm also an advocate of plain-text signing (and
encripting) in e-mail messages. If it indeed has issues with some character
sets, then it can't be considered a portable and standard method of sending
gpg'ed messages, but if it doesn't...
