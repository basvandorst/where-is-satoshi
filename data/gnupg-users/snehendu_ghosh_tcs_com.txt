Hi Peter,
Thanks for your reply.?
In brief, the background is that we are replacing an existing iHub system which acts as a router for files transfer to and from Oracle EBS. In current system, for inbound interfaces, encrypted files come from third parties to iHub and being decrypted before sending to EBS. Similarly for outbound interfaces, files come from EBS, being encrypted in iHub before sending it to third party system.
Now the problem is the existing iHUb system is very old and it has 1.2.1 version for encryption/decryption. We are assuming all the third parties are using same old version for encryption/decryption in their side. And there is no issue with encryption/decryption in existing system. It is much stable.
We are not expecting any of the third party will make any changes in their side. That is the reason we want to go with the 1.2.1 version to minimize the risk.
Now assume a?scenario, where we implement 1.4 version in our to-be system, encrypt a file with 1.4 version and send it to a third party. We are not sure if that third party will able to do decryption using a lower version.
We are working from Sydney, Australia. I don't know which time zone you are working in.
Can we set up a tele-conference with you today so that we can explain you our requirement ??

You're trying to install a version released in 2002 on an OS released in 2012.
I'm not surprised you can't find binaries! Why do you want to do this? 1.2.1 has
known issues and should not be used these days. It's more than a decade old!
I think your effort is much better spent on changing your workflow to use the
latest 1.4 release. Again, why do you want to install 1.2.1?
