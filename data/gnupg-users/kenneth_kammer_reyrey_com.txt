@_subject: Multiple users of GPG 
I have installed GPG on a virtual server and everything works fine for
me.  I now want to allow users to also encrypt their files using the
public and private keys I have established.  But when another user
connects to my virtual server, they can not see any keys on the keyring.
Has anyone else come across this situation?  Can anyone offer me any
suggestions to fix this problem?

The OS of the virtual server is Windows Server 2003 SR2.  I'm using
Windows XP systems to Remote Desktop into the virtual server.
