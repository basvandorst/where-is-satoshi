@_subject: Importing Keys in Outlook/GPA 
Hash: SHA1
I use Thunderbird for my daily email needs but I do ocassionally use
Outlook because of client requirements and I want to use the key that I
generated under Enigmail/GnuPG/Thunderbird in Outlook with GPA
I tried using the Import feature of GPA but it doesnt seem to recognize
the file I am trying to import.
I tried the pub/sec key I exported out of EnigMail and I tried the
secring.gpg and pubring.gpg files, none of which worked.
Can I import the key I generated earlier into Outlook or do I have to
create a new one?
