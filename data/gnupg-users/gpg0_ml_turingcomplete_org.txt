Your idea sounds good. I would like this feature.

I would try it without 'string'.

Why is gnupg fetching 887BAE72 one time from the preferred keyserver
and the other time from the default one?

@_subject: decrypt multiple files to stdout 
how can I decrypt multiple files to stdout? I have two (or more)
files, a.gpg and b.gpg, and want the equivalent of "gpg a.gpg; gpg
b.gpg; cat a b" without the intermediate files.
"gpg --multifile --decrypt a.gpg b.gpg" does not work. The behaviour
seems to differ from the manual.
And if there is no 'a' and no 'b', they are created.
--output seems to be incompatible with --multifile.

                           When  using  --refresh-keys, if the key in question
                           has a preferred keyserver set, then use  that  pre-

what is the best way to set the owner trust of a key from a script?
