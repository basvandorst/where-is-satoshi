@_subject: Clarification on how revokation works 
This is probably a dumb question, but I just want to clarify how key revokation works...
Am I correct in thinking that really only the public key of a key pair is what is revoked?  (Though the secret key isn't all that useful without the public key being valid, of course.)
We have, in addition to people's individual keys, a shared key used for sending encrypted material to a group of people.  Each member of the group received a copy of the secret key with a temporary passphrase, then (presumably) changed the passphrase to something of their own.
Any member of the group with the secret key can revoke that key, effectively for everyone - right?
At a basic level, revoking a key is really just a matter of creating a signed statement saying "this key is no longer valid," yes?

Do you mean that your mail client doesn't know what to do with them (in which case I agree with the replies that you've already gotten, and I've used both Mutt and Thunderbird with good results), or does your mail program understand what they are and what to do with them, but the signatures do not appear to be valid?
If it's the latter problem, you may have something at the MTA level mucking with the MIME parts of the message before it gets to your inbox.  Adding a signature or corporate disclaimer or something maybe (though that's usually a problem on the outgoing side), or wrapping lines for some (really no) reason, or doing something else to somehow alter the message?
All these things and the many variations on them are all broken, but they do happen anyway.

This seems to be an enigmail problem, because Mutt reports a good

This is some^M

The actual line breaks are in the correct place, and "^M" is actually

When the same sender sends a message that is signed but not encrypted,
it looks fine.
The sender is using Mozilla configured to do in-line PGP:
User-Agent: Mozilla Thunderbird 0.8 (X11/20040913)
X-Enigmail-Version: 0.86.1.0
X-Enigmail-Supports: pgp-inline, pgp-mime

the character set:

Charset: ISO-8859-1
Version: GnuPG v1.2.6 (GNU/Linux)
Comment: Using GnuPG with Thunderbird - But... ISO-8859-1 doesn't seem like a choice that should result in any

Offhand I don't know of any switches that you can use to pass the
passphrase on the command line, though I might be missing one.  If
it's acceptable to store the passphrase in a separate file (probably
no more risky that coding it into a script), you could use:
gpg -a -c --batch --passphrase-fd n filename
which will read the password from file descriptor n.  0 means standard

One thing to note in passing is that most of this worry applies to
cases where other people besides you also have access to your windows
box.  If the box itself is physically secure and you're mostly worried
about making sure the data in encrypted before it leaves the box, then
running GnuPG on Windows should be just fine.
Be aware that you still need to be a reasonably attentive Windows
admin though, and protect the box from network-borne compromises; if a
remote user can use a particular exploit to run their own code on your
box without your permission then they can still exploit the probles
discussed in this thread.
It's up to you to decide what the cost of such a compromise might be
compared with the cost of preventing it.  For me, I don't think it's
frankly much of a worry, but that's something you have to decide.

How does that work?  (Ok, this is probably a dumb question, but...) I had thought that English has only somewhere around 1.5 bits worth of
entropy per character.  A passphrase certainly could have more than
that because it's not necessarily real English, uses a wider character
set, and so on... is that difference really enough?  19.5 8-bit
characters is 156 bits; that seems (intuitively, which granted can be
misleading) to be getting closer to real randomness than a passphrase
would allow.  At least, any passphrase that someone could
remember. :-)  It's only 3.5 characters longer than 128 bits, after
all.

Are there really a lot of such systems?  I've encountered very few
that bounce messages with attachments, and if they discard attachments
then your message is still intact, just unsigned.
Keeping it, perhaps.  Keeping it intact, not so much.  Any
reformatting done by a web browser (which is perfectly legitimate for
the browser to do) will break the signature, of course.  If you force
the formatting with  tags, you've made a concession which allows
the MIME version to work equally well.
Forwarding a MIME message (intact) is, arguably, even easier.
I see your points, but in my opinion they aren't worth giving up the
benefits of MIME -- especially in what one hopes will be a generally
applicable standard.  The ability to sign attachments gracefully isn't
the only plus, for example, but that alone seems to be enough to make
MIME a clear winner.

I'd even disagree with this -- while it's not necessary, I'd say it is

Hrm... PGP/GPG may not be the best tool here.
I think you will either have a key distribution problem, or a lot of work to do encrypting and re-encrypting your 1000 files every time someone leaves or arrives.
You could encrypt all the 1000 files to a single key, and distribute that key to all your clients.  When a new client arrives, you just have to give her the key.   When a client leaves and you want to revoke access, you have to re-encrypt all your files to a new key and then distribute that key to all your clients.
Or, you could collect the public keys for all your clients, and encrypt all your files to all those keys.  If a client leaves, you have to re-encrypt everything to omit the key of the person who left.  If a new client arrives, you *also* have to re-encrypt everything to add their public key to the list.  But, you don't have the (potential) problem with distributing keys that you would in the first case.
There are surely other approaches as well, this is just what comes to my mind. It's not elegant.

I do actually use some passphrases like this, though usually with more
letters and numbers in them (generated with gpg --gen-random -a for
the most part). I make no attempt to remember them; I keep them in an
application designed for the purpose (PasswordSafe).  Given that,
there's really no need to limit the length to 20 - since you're never
going to type it, you may as well use as long a password as your
application will accept.
The drawback to this is that if my password store is not available to
me then none of the passwords in it are either. I also have more
conventional passphrases that I can remember and type, since there are
always some things you're going to have to produce from memory, and
there may be some things you don't want to trust to permanent storage
at all. Pick the right tool for the job.
I find that randomly generated passwords work fine for 90+% of my

I'm not intimately familiar with the way keys and subkeys are related

in the general case, I think the only solution to this problem is to use
some sort of key escrow system. (The real solution is "don't lose your
keys" and key escrow is one way to try to implement that.)
If you design some way of generating several [sub]keys or something such
that the end result is the ability to regenerate a lost key, then you
have effectively shared your key (since others could regenerate it
without your participation). Your policy prohibits that, so whether or
not you can devise a system to do it is academic. Whether or not key
escrow counts as "sharing keys" is a question for your policy-makers.
As a general principle, if a secret key is unavailable, you WANT the
encrypted material it protects to become unavailable. That's rather the
point, no? :-)

The only problem I have run into with this is the occasional client that
doesn't display the message body because, being a separate mime part, it

Let me preface by saying that I am answering based on what I think likely, not what I *know*, so take my comments in that context (and I welcome corrections from anyone who does know, of course).
I don't know.
However, it seems unlikely that you'll know the system internals so well that you can have true confidence in a "yes" answer, even if you suspect it to be yes, or the device maker claims it is yes. Therefore, for any applications where it actually matters, you'd be well advised to assume I imagine that the potential problem can be circumvented, yes, but not simply by using a longer passphrase. I don't know whether it even allows that option, but it really doesn't matter since you don't know what it does with that passphrase internally anyway. Since you don't know, you can't trust it.
However, remember that the device in question is a computer. It's not a phone, or a camera, or a GPS receiver, it's just a computer that happens to have supporting hardware to enable some of those functions. As such, one can write whatever software one wants for it, and that includes a correctly implemented encrypted data storage mechanism which does not require you to trust any decisions made by the manufacturer. *That* is how you circumvent the problem you're referring to.
The android world is more open to third party developers so it's probably easier there, but I expect it should be possible either way. Regardless, if the system relies on code you can't see, then (in principle) you can't trust it completely.
