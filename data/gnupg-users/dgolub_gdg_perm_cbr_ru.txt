@_subject: Automatically encrypt and sign outgoing mail 
There is a good program called email ( that encrypts and sends mail in batch mode.  So, you can make procmail receipt to re-send this mail to your main account.
By the way, you can use it in crontabs, and you will have an additional
value: when the program has empty STDIN, it does not produce any mail.
I'm using it in crontabs of some system users. License is GPL.
