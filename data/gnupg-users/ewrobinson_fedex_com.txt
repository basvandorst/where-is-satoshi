The file actually DOES decrypt correctly but it's failing in our system
because of the above.
Ant help would be greatly appreciated (If you can read this, Thank a Teacher, If you can read this in English,

Ok, will do, in this case they send 10 files each day and maybe 1 a week errors out like this...
Thanks again,

Take a look at how you're transferring the files around.  It's a very common problem where people use FTP in ascii mode to copy the files around and end up with them mangled.

Hello David,
Thanks so much for responding...
We have switched from PGP to GPG and we have some of our customers are still using PGP, ?PGP??N???? ?  is the first part of the message.
What you said below is suspicous, I did notice a null value 00, hex 20 20, at the end of the file, I stripped it out and resubmitted it and it processed fine.
I will go on that assumption for now and edit these files that come in and fail.   If that's the case I'll get our development team towrite a program to strip these out automatically before decryption. Thanks for your time in this.

You've got a bunch of warnings here.  Let's take them one at a time:
Just what it says: the directory /opt/fxnet/gpg is writable by someone other than you.  It's a good idea for you to fix it, but it isn't the cause of your problem.
GPG tries to lock a small amount of memory so you can't accidentally swap a passphrase out to disk.  Depending on how you are using GPG, this may not be significant to you.  Either way, it's not the cause of your problem.
This means that there is no integrity protection packet on the message.  There is a very difficult attack against the old PGP message format that the integrity protected format combats.  This isn't the cause of your problem either.
THIS is your problem.  GPG found garbage in the message that could not be parsed.  Since you say the message was decrypted correctly before the garbage was found, it's likely the garbage is at the end.
Is this an armored (i.e. "--- BEGIN PGP MESSAGE ---") message or binary (not printable ASCII)?

Thanks for the response.  We think it might be the file size.  These are over 4MB. Now we've started with one record, that worked, and we are increasing
the file size gradually, up to 1.9MB, and success so far.  Is there a file size limit on GPG? -----Original Message-----

The file is corrupt, so cannot be processed.  How was the file created?
Try comparing the original to what the customer has.

@_subject: CoreLabs Detects Flaw In GnuPG - any comments ? 
CoreLabs Detects Flaw In GnuPG By CXOtoday Staff Mumbai, Mar 9, 2007 Core Security Technologies has issued an advisory disclosing a flaw in
the GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG or GPG). It is an OpenPGP- compliant
cryptographic software system and is a part of the Free Software
Foundation's (FSF) GNU software project, and third-party email
applications that rely on it for encrypted and signed email
communications. CoreLabs, the research arm of Core Security, discovered this by
exploiting the vulnerability. According to the press release, issued by
Core Security, an attacker can add arbitrary content to encrypted and/or
signed emails in order to mislead recipients about the trustworthiness
of a message. In addition, attackers can use this flaw to bypass
content-filtering defenses, which makes it particularly inconvenient to
detect phishing attacks. The company discovered that the scripts and applications using GnuPG are
prone to a vulnerability involving incorrect verification of signatures.
Unsuspecting users reading a GPG encrypted and/or signed email, using a
mail client or encryption extension, are led to believe that the entire
message was signed by the sender when, in fact, an arbitrary portion of
the content may have been inserted by an attacker. In some cases, the attacker may completely hide the signed portion of a
message and present the user with only the forged portion. It should be
noted that this is not a cryptographic problem. It affects how
information is presented to the user and how third-party applications
interact with GnuPG. This attack method infects systems using: *GnuPG 1.4.6 and previous versions *Enigmail 0.94.2 and previous versions *KMail 1.9.5 and previous versions *Evolution 2.8.1 and previous versions *Sylpheed 2.2.7 and previous versions *Mutt 1.5.13 and previous versions *GNUMail 1.1.2 and previous versions *Other scripts and applications using GnuPG may be vulnerable To address this vulnerability, users of scripts and applications using
GnuPG should immediately upgrade to the latest versions of GnuPG and
Enigmail. Additionally, Core Security recommends that, if a signed message looks
suspicious, the validity of the signature can be verified by manually
invoking GnuPG from the command line and adding the special option
"--status-fd" to gain extra information. "This vulnerability is a good e.g. of how very subtle implementation
decisions on how to interface data communications between two
applications, in this case email front-end extensions and GnuPG, can end
up exposing end users to unexpected security weaknesses," said Iv n
Arce, CTO, Core Security Technologies. "We continue to encourage and
support the use of GnuPG as a convenient way to improve the security and
privacy of communications. To that effect and to prevent traffic
analysis attacks, we also recommend that encryption should be turned on
by default on every email."

@_subject: Erroneous char at the end of a file... 
Hello Group,
I have a customer that is getting erroneous characters in the data at
the end of a file (looks like ASCII ?) when they decrypt.  This does not
happen for every file.  This customer is decrypting our GPG encrypted file with Authora's Edge
We have looked at the data before the GPG encryption and It is clean and
free of characters   Has anyone seen this type of issue with Authora's Edge software?  I
would appreciate any help at all.

Thanks for the response... My hands are a little tied, GPG is 'embedded'
in our application and can't change any values or parms at all.
GPG v1.2.4
Encrypt string:
--passphrase-fd 0 --no-tty --batch --sign --encrypt --compress-algo 1
--cipher-algo cast5 I do not know what the customers decrypt string is.
Not familiar with --textmode   I'll look it up on the site.
Yes, --armour is a parm that I can toggle back and forth.
Not familiar with --no-mangle-dos-filenames

What version of GPG are you using?
What is your encrypt and decrypt strings?
Are you aware of --textmode if platforms differ?
And --armour and --no-mangle-dos-filenames?

iSeries running what?  Linux?
If it's Linux, just compile it like you'd compile it anywhere else.   If it's OS/400, you might take a look at running it under PASE.
