@_subject: Recommended key size for life long key 
============================== START ==============================
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA512
recommends a key size of 1024 bits.
Hi Ole,
There are other problems that need to be considered when creating a
'lifelong' extra large key.
First, you need to consider people on older hardware or mobile
devices. That 10k key might take 10 minutes to do anything with on
modern hardware. But do you think a mobile device will have the kind
of horsepower needed to use that key in any way? Probably not. That
may lock out a significant portion of your contacts from being able to
communicate with you.
Secondly, a long key length won't protect you if 1) an incredibly
efficient factoring algorithm is designed and used, 2) quantum
computers are used against your key, or 3) side channel attacks. In
all of those sceneries, large keys won't protect you at all.
Especially in side channel attacks or qc attacks.
Personally, I trust my 4096 bit key for now until ECC is integrated
into GnuPG. Then, I'll recreate my keys. Looking for a key that will
never be broken is like looking for the fountain of youth: it's a nice
idea but not realistic to plan your life around. Security is always
moving. You have to be prepared to move with it.

Hash: SHA512
Hello Everyone,
I'm designing an application that will run on Windows and utilize
GNUPG. Right now, I'm detecting if GPG is installed by calling it then
parsing the output of the command to see if it succeeded or failed.
This is VERY messy and not my preferred way.
Does GPG4Win install anything to the registry that I could check for
to see if it's installed?

@_subject: Why trust gpg4win?  
If we believe Edward Snowden, the Security Services  likely aren't  working to slip secret code into GPG anymore. Or at least it's not a  huge effort. With the endpoints (operating systems, software, etc)  they don't have to. There are a million different ways that a security  service could get at your data even if your encryption software is  absolutely perfect an unvompromised. Honestly, I'd worry much more  about the surround environment than the gpg code itself. That's not to  say ignore the code and it's integrity, but don't fall into the trap  of believing that, just because the badges check out, you're  completely safe.

While I know it's not a big concern at the moment, we are well on the

to 10 and even 5-6.
Regardless of what the actual timeframe is, I'm wondering what work is
being done in GnuPG to implement QC resistant asymmetric algorithms?

I belong to a mailing list (PGPNET, a Yahoo Group) that provides me with
a "group line" for encrypting to a group of keys. In my gpg.conf file, I
put something like:
group mygroup at domain.com=key1,key2,key
Then, using Enigmail, I can encrypt to the entire group of keys by
selecting it in the UI.
The fact that gpg doesn't complain about the group line in the conf file
means it must accept as a valid option. So why can I not use that group
address when I am encrypting and signing from the terminal. I should be
able to do something like:
gpg -ear mygroup at domain.com filename
But when I do that, gpg tells it has no key for that address. Why can't
gpg understand and properly process my group line from the terminal? Is
this anything that's planned for the future?

email the key holder at their known address and ask what's up. It

that I hadn't noticed before and I strongly suspect this might be the
cause of the problem I'm having.

command, GnuPG connected to the SKS pool and sent a request for all the

gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: Total number processed: 0
gpg: keyserver communications error: keyserver helper internal error

gpg: keyserver refresh failed: General error
IIRC, Stephen mentioned something about the helper program the last time
I posted. This seems to confirm that.  However, since it's not giving me
much information, I can't really troubleshoot further.
This is GnuPG 2.0.3 (GpG4Win 2.3.3) on Windows 10.  This issue DOES NOT
happen on Linux.

There's been some discussion both on and off this list about the fact
that people don't use GnuPG (even with Enigmail) because it's 'too
hard'. I have friends that are reasonably intelligent who just can't
figure it out and, for the life of me, I just don't see why.
Don't get me wrong, GnuPG by itself can be confusing. Who wants to
compose in a text file, drop to a terminal, issue some archaic command,
open another text file, then copy and paste the results into a new
document just to able to send an email? That's pretty rough and there's
no reason any user should have to do that in 2017. But they don't! I've
used GnuPG and Enigmail for a few years now and I only drop to a
terminal when I /want/ to do so at this point. Encryption, decryption,
signing, etc, never 'requires' it and, for the most part, the software
'just handles it'. Sure, if I add a smart card to the mix that
complicates things but most people aren't going to do that.
So I guess I'm asking "what's so hard about GnuPG/Enigmail these days
and what's stopping us from making it better"?
