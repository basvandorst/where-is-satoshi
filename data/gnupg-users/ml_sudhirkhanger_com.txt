@_subject: Restoring GnuPG 
I have a few questions regarding GnuPG.
1. Is secret key the most important part of GnuPG? By important I mean
if you only had your secret key could get back to your original setup
ignoring the imported public keys. My original setup included signing
and encryption key created along with the creation of the key, public
key part and revocation certificate generated by me and uid attached
to the key, of course by me. Can all these be recreated from your
secret key? So as long as you have your secret key you are good to go.
2. "gpg --import secret.key" I suppose this is the command I have to
use to import the secret key on a new system.

I use Gnome EncFS Manager. It leaves a lot of metadata as it encrypts per file basis but works fine generally. I was hoping to get away by not having to rely on remembering passwords or using password manager but looks separate solutions are more popular.

Are you trying to say if I don't import pubring.gpg I won't import the previously exchanged keys and hence I won't be able to send them encrypted messages as I won't have access to other people's public keys?
I currently don't have any public keys imported/exchanged. I am just learning

Thanks. Here is what I did and it worked fine.
gpg --import secretkey.asc
gpg --edit-key KEYID trust
gpg --edit-key KEYID > Chose primary uid > primary > save
It imported both secret and public key with both uid and everything seems to work fine as far as I can tell.

@_subject: Terminal asks for passphrase even when passphrase is cached by 
I have gpg-agent cache passphrase. When I run gpg -c text.txt it asks for passphrase twice like it normally would but Kgpg or KMail don't. What am I suppose to do to make both terminal and GUI apps use cached passphrase instead of asking for one?

It prints the GPG passphrase in plain text. Is the password cached in plain

@_subject: Should I be using gpg or gpg2? 
My understanding is gpg is for embedded systems and servers and gpg2 is for full fledged desktops. I seem to find documentation only for gpg but not gpg2.
Are there any updated how-to  for gpg2? Should I continue to use gpg command

@_subject: Should I be using gpg or gpg2? 
There is no specific reason for using gpg or gpg2 other than that upstream recommends gpg2 for desktop. I have mildly used gpg and if I have to invest my time I might as well start with gpg2.
