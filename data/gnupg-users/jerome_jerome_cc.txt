@_subject: RSA or DSA keylength as an anti-spam feature 
Thanks to the recent bikeshedding, I learnt that doubling keysize on an
asymetric key algorithm based on discrete logarithm or integer
factorization doesn't, by far, double the resistance to bruteforcing,
which in itself is seldom if ever the weak link in a secure
communication scheme.
It increases the resistance to bruteforcing only negligeably, and at the
same time, it increases the CPU time needed to encrypt/decrypt &
sign/verify *a lot*.
Could this last property of bigger keys, significantly increasing CPU
time needed to send encrypted/signed messages, be used as an anti-spam
OpenPGP as a kind of HashCash / proof of work solution to spam?
If this proposition makes sense, that would open the way for a huge
increase in user base! :-)
I'm thinking about automatically sending a reply (Wanna contact me?
Install GPG or use my  OpenPGP.js contact form...)
then deleting unencrypted emails, at the MUA level. Does this make sense?

@_subject: RSA or DSA keylength as an anti-spam feature 
Most of my first contacts with potential new customers or business
partners go through a contact form on my websites anyway, so that
wouldn't be a problem for me.
I'm following the project on GitHub, everyting is GPLv3, I'll open
issues for those two problems, thanks for reporting!
Git is I'm aware that OpenPGP.js is a relatively new project and less secure
than GnuPG, but it might be a step forward to get people interested and
to allow people who make the effort to create a key to be able to
receive messages by end users.
Thanks again for your answer and reports.

@_subject: adele 
I'm Jerome from France, GPG user and cryptoparty organizer in Marseille.
I just joined the list! It seems to be a very friendly place.
I would like to make a french speaking adele (The friendly GPG Robot)
available to the community of french speaking GPG evangelists and beginners.
Is there a source code or a recipe available somewhere? Is it written in
english? If everything is in german, it's ok, i have basic skills in
german, and with a little help from the community, I'll manage to clone
and translate the robot. But I don't have the skill and time to write
another one from scratch.
The only information about Adele I could find about are those two messages:
First message by Werner (2007):
 saying
that it's not a free software.
Second message by Bernhard Reiter (2009)
asking about the development of a free software replacement robot.
English speaking Adele say it's made by  I guess i'll have
to contact them also.
Do you have more information?
Thank you.

This is very good news!
Do you think you could upload the source files to a revision control
system website such as GitHub or any other publicly available platform
so that the community can start working on the update process? To avoid
any copyright issue we might have to use another name, at least until we
get approval to use the traditional Adele name from the copyright holder.
I hope the use of a feminine name to depict a robot doesn't raise gender
issues. Maybe we could choose a masculine name for a change. I suggest
'Werner'. ;-) Or maybe 'Phil'.
Thank you.

@_subject: more bikeshedding about offline primary keys &  auth subkeys 
Thanks to Werner, I learned a new english word today: bikeshedding! :-)
This guide
 suggests
creating a subkey with authentication capability. Most other sources
stress the fact that the primary key and the offline computer must be
used to authenticate other people's public keys.
I'm at a loss.
Can I use an RSA subkey with autentication capability (and cross
certified) to authenticate other people's public keys, will it be
recognized by sks key servers and used in the web of trust?
Or do I have to use the primary key?
Hauke posted comments with critics about a few points, but not about
this issue.
In other developments, I'm impressed by the reactivity of the Arch Linux
community! The security fix 1.4.17 hasn't been released for Debian
Stable at the time of writing. The patch has only been applied to Sid.
