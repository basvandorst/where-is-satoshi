@_subject: Groups of Keys? 
Is there a way to specify a group keys as the recipient?  I need to send
data to different groups of users and having to specify them
individually is tedious.

Can someone explain how to assign a name to a group of keys in gpg
According to man, I thought the following would work:
gpg --group =,
But gpg asks for additional input (Go ahead and type your message ...)
