@_subject: [GEAM] decryption not works 
I installed GEAM as a Content-Filter in Postfix and it works fine.
The filters work like this:
Mail -> postfix (port 25) -> geam (port 10026) ->
-> amavis (Port 10024) -> postfix (port 10025) ->
-> Mail-Auslieferung
But there are any problems and questions:
1. only encryption works
2. where are saved the passwords for decryption
3. incoming encrypted mail are encrypted twice for the same user, if exists a option for encrypt outgoing mail for this user
4. incoming encrypted mails are not handle like an encrypted mails
What can I do. Are my inner-host/outer-host configuration not right?
Whats wrong with my configuration? Are there docs or mailing list for this thema?
My Configuration:
stefan : stefan
sb : DECRYPT
port 10026
inner-host-name localhost
inner-host-port 10024
outer-host-name localhost
outer-host-port 10024
# To avoid mailloops, messages with more that this number
# of "Received" headers are not delivered to the smarthost.
 30
gpg-program /usr/bin/gpg
gpg-homedir /etc/geam/gpg
# The default log file is /var/log/geam/geamd to specify another,
# use this option.  "-" denotes to use stderr for logging
# which will also disable the timestamps.
log-file /var/log/geam/geamd.log
