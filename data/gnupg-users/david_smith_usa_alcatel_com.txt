@_subject: system hangs during key generation 
I have only recently started using GNUpg myself, and have not tried what you
are doing.   However have you tried logging in a second connection to the
same machine and doing other work there while GNUpg is generating the key.
It is my understanding that GNUpg is waiting to gather random events from
other processes.
