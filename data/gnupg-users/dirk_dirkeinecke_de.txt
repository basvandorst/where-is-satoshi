@_subject: Backup my key (private/public) 
I want to backup my public and my private key. Is it right that I've  only to backup my private key? I do it with this command:
gpg --armor --output _secret.asc --export-secret-key max at mustermann.de
The result for importing (gpg --import) the backup file is my public  and my private key. Is the private key automatically re-generated from  the private key?
