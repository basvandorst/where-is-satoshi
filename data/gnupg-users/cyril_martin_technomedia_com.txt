@_subject: Decryption error: open(CONOUT$) failed 
since few days we face of an issue to decrypt files (.gpg) with GNUPG 1.4.9
We get error:
gpg: fatal: open(CONOUT$) failed: The system cannot find the file specified.
secmem usage: 0/0 bytes in 0/0 blocks of pool 0/32768
If issue was due to < the file specified > I think we should get this error :
gpg: can't open `FILE_SPECIFIED'
gpg: decrypt_message failed: file open error
Decryption is processed by a program launched with a Windows service account.
Manually with my personal account, it's OK I can decrypt, but not with the program
I have keyrings under:
Could you help me please?
GNUPG 1.4.9
Windows server 2008 R2
