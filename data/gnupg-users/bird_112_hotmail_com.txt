@_subject: How to create non-standard key pair 
Hello.  I have been searching google for a couple of days now and I can't figure out how to accomplish this.  I need to create a v4 RSA keypair that has a 16384 encryption key and a 4096 (possibly 8192) signing key using AES-256 that I can export to a text file.  Can you guys please provide some guidance on how to accomplish this?  Thanks

I am needing to do some testing with these size keys.  Can someone advise me on how to modify the code to generate these keys?
