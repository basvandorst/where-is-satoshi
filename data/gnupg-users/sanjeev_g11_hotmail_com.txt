I have 2 different vendors an dI would like to sign their keys using 2 different private keys. I don't want to share my public key between them. When ever I try to sign the key the software doesn't give me the option to select my won key, it always use my default key. how can I achieve this. Please help me as I need to finish this project ASAP.
