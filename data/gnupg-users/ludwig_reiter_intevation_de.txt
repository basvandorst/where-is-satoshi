@_subject: gpgme: how to check a key for source of wkd? 
I have read the AutomaticEncryption wiki page To check for level 2 I need to know, if a key has a "wkd" source, but
a key in gpgme hasn't a source attribute.
How can I check with gpgme, that a key has a "wkd" source?
Kind Regards,

@_subject: Work on mailman2-gpg-wkd 
I'm working on an extension for mailman 2.1. It should allow to encrypt (and sign) service mails with public keys fetched from a wkd (web key directory).
The experimental code is under:
 Like the python3-gpg-examples it is in an early state.
More a proof of concept.

@_subject: Examples of use python3-gpg and emails 
Hi folks,
I am working on examples for encrypting and signing mails. It uses python3-gpg (gpgme) and the python3 email lib and is in draft.
The git repo is at gitlab. See:
  If you are interested in learning to use python3-gpg with email context, it should be useful for you. Please write me a mail with comments, if you look
at it.
Also feedback would be nice.
Kind Regards,

@_subject: how to use WKD with python3? 
Hi folks,
how do I get public keys over WKD with python3/gpgme?
I didn't find anything about this in the web. It seems like python3-gpg doesn't support to use WKD.
Can someone point me to a good start point?
Kind Regards,
