@_subject: Local file encryption 
I have been using gpg to encrypt/decrypt files on my computer "for my
eyes only".  I have been using my public/private keypair on my keyring
to do so.   I just discovered that I can use encrypt/decrypt local
files using a symmetric cipher--i.e., you enter one secret passphrase
to encrypt and then enter the same secret passphrase to decrypt.
Since my encryption is only for files for myself, do you think using a
symmetric cipher would be a better idea, or doesn't it matter?    Or
is choice of a passphrase a bigger issue than the type of cipher --
symmetric vs. public/private keypair ?

@_subject: Re-establish keys 
I am in the process of reformatting my hard drive (ext3).   I copied
my user files from the hard drive onto backup medium, but I forgot to
copy the .gnupg/ contents.
My public key is on the MIT PGP server.    I know my passphrase.   So
how do I reestablish my keys on the newly reformatted hard drive, in
order to decrypt my files?
Thanks in advance,
