I have not been able to use OpenPGP since I upgraded to
Ubuntu 14.04 on my 64 bit Laptop.
Can anyone help?
I have other computers where PGP works well:
32 bit Dell B130 with Xubuntu 12.4, Windows 7 desktop

I have not been able to get OpenPGP to work under Ubuntu 14.04, using
Thunderbird. Everything in the
setup seems correct. I always get an error message when trying to sign
outgoing mail. Note: Everything
worked fine under Ubuntu 13.1.  Any hints or tips?
Error Message:  key not found or not valid.
