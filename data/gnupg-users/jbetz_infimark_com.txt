@_subject: Help with decrypting gpg file 
I was hoping to get some help with decrypting an archived file. I am using
the following command:
echo "passphrase"| gpg --passphrase-fd 0 -o output.txt -d input.pgp
The output file is created with no problem, however, there is garbage in the
first record. If I rename the file (or create it) with a .zip extension and
try to open it with WinZip it does not recognize the file as an archive
file. When I do the same operation with PGP there is no problem.
I have scoured the documentation looking for the correct command or option
for indicating to gpg that the file is an archive file, but no to no avail.
Any help I can get with this would be appreciated.

Thanks a lot for your response. I can successfully decrypt files with one
exception - those that are zipped or archived. In this case the source file
was created using Power Archiver. When the file is decrypted, there is
garbage in the first record. It's as if gpg doesn't recognize that the input
file is an archive file. (When I use PGP, the output file is automatically
created as a WinZip compatible archive file when it is decrypted.)
By the way, I did use your recommended command string and got the same
result. I suspect there is some kind of option that is required so that gpg
knows that the output file should be created as an archive type file.
Thank you very much for your help.

Hi John:
I would just do this:
gpg --decrypt input.pgp > output.txt
Let gpg prompt for your passphrase.  That way, your passphrase is not
part of bash history.
If that doesn't work, let us know what error messages are you getting
from GnuPG.

The file is a PowerArchiver file (containing multiple text files) that was
encrypted using PGP.

How was the file encrypted in the first place?

I appreciate the offer David, but I don't have PowerArchiver so I can't
create a sample input file. The file I am trying to decrypt is coming from
another source so I would have to get them involved in order to create a
sample archive file. Because WinZip is compatible, I am able to open with
PGP and then extract the individual files. The problem is specifically with
GPG - and I am using that because PGP doesn't run in batch mode.
My original thought was that there must be something I was doing wrong when
decrypting the file, but based on the feedback I am getting, and my review
of available commands and options I doubt that is the issue.
I think my next step will be to purchase PowerArchiver and experiment with
that....see if I can open the output file with the same product used as the
archive input file.

I'm not sure if that file is legal according to the OpenPGP spec.  It  depends on how it was packed together.  If you can encrypt a sample  file (using dummy data, but with the same number of text files) I  would be happy to take a look at it and see what is happening  internally to GPG.
