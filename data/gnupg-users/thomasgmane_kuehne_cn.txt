@_subject: Primary certify-only key? 
Is there a way to generate the following key collection with GnuPG?
pub  4096R  usage: C
sub  4096R  usage: S
The problem is that I cant create the first key with only "C" the
Using the --expert option and disabling "E", "S" and "A" results in "CSEA".

@_subject: more than one message digest per signed message? 
Is it possible to use more than one message digest when signing a
message with GnuPG?
gpg --digest MD5 --digest SHA512 --clearsign test.txt
-> used digest SHA512
gpg --digest MD5,SHA512 --clearsign test.txt
-> gpg: selected digest algorithm is invalid
gpg --digest "MD5 SHA512" --clearsign test.txt
-> gpg: selected digest algorithm is invalid

If the MIME declaration is change from
multipart/signed; micalg=pgp-sha1; ...
multipart/mixed; micalg=pgp-sha1; ...
OutlookExpress displays the message just like Mozilla or KMail without
encryption plugins.

No, that is a bug with Outlook's MIME processing.
Likely one of the core problems keeping the MIME-versus-inlined war alive.

@_subject: GPG <> PGP6 subkey selection 
Existing DSA(1024)/Elgamal(2048) key.
Adding a RSA(4096) signature and a RSA(4096) encryption subkey.
PGP6 does only support 2048 RSA keys.
Is ther any way to tell GnuPG to use the RSA keys while PGP6 uses the
DSA/Elgamal keys? If I import only the DSA/Elgamal public part into PGP6
it does work, but fails if the whole public key is imported.

Yes. It seems like PGP6 does the same, but after rejecting the the
newer(to big) fails to use the older key...

@_subject: how to handle "bad" signers? 
I've started to analyze the trust relations between the keys of various
keysigning parties. The data below is generalization of several keys
signing parties.
the setting:
* more than 20 potential participants
* more than 15 attendees
* 1-3 keys that signed every single key of all announced participants,
even those that most likely never attended the party
The interesting point is that those 1-3 keys haven't got a single
signature from any of the other participants.
There are 4 possible reasons I can think of
1) Those keys are "roll" or "institutional" keys.
2) The key owners failed to push the received signatures back into the
keyserver network.
3) The key owners pushed the received onto one of the semi/unlinked key
4) The owners are bad signers and didn't take part in the ID
verification step of the signature process.
1) and 3) are defiantly not the reasons in the analyzed cases.
I really hope 2) is the cause, but in at least one case I am sure of 4).
How should 4) be dealt with?
As far as I am aware the is no negative signature or any other way to
mark those keys - except for local trust settings.
