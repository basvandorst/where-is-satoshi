@_subject: gpg2 does not detect smart card adapter 
yes, running and ready.
Do you mean pcscd? Yes it is installed and running.
Executing this command does not work. gpg-connect-agent says it got
wrong arguments. Or do you mean to replace 'SCD getinfo version' by
the version number of pcscd?
Non-root users have read access only - to any USB device. It guess
that pcscd has root privileges; so this is fine?
This file did not exist yet so I created it.
Is "/etc/init.d/pcscd restart" doing the same job?
