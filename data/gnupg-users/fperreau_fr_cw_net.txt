@_subject: HOWTO Revoke a key without having any backup of the key pair ???? 
Hi there,
I've been stolen my laptop and would like to know what is the process to
either revoke a key (private and public keys have been lost, with my

Thanks in advance.
Best Regards,
Franck PERREAU.

Thanks in advance for your support. Any help will be appreciated. :)
