Excuse me for being a bit clueless. I am very new to all this
crytography stuff but I have come to a place where I actually have a
compelling reason to use it.
What am I doing wrong?

Thanks for the help. It didn't seem to work exactly though. Does this mean that there is a problem with the keyserver or does it
mean that the program is not functioning properly.
Could there be a problem with our firewall? We have a pretty open
firewall but we use IP masquerading so that all internal machines
exist on the internet as one IP addr.

@_subject: can't import signature 
I went to the web and found a person whose key I should have and I
double checked it against the fingerprint on his card and they
match. The problem is that it doesn't seem to want to import into
gpg. Why is this? Does it have something to do with gpg not supporting
RSA or something? Sorry for asking so many questions. I'm kind of new to all of this

What triggers this message? Is there something that we can do about it
to make our memory secure? Can you say to Unix, "send me this signal
if you need to swap a page?" or "Don't swap this page or else I will
have to kill err I mean reboot you."
