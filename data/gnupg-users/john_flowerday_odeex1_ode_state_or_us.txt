@_subject: Need Help Understanding the Error Codes from gpg.exe 
I really need to know what the error codes are when gpg.exe returns a code.
I am currently getting a 2 back when I attempt this line on a command line
within an ASP page:
\\159.121.173.72\dev_extranet\apps\helpdesk\gpg.exe --homedir
\\159.121.173.72\dev_extranet\apps\helpdesk --list-keys
Any help would greatly be appreciated.
