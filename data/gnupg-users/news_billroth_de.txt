I started using gpg a couple of days ago so this might be a stupid question. But I can't figure it out myself and the manpage is not really clear about this:
When I sign (--clearsign) a message I can check the signature with --verify and it tells me, that the the signed message is valid. But as soon as I sign _and_ encrypt a message I get an error message. But I can still decrypt the message without issues:
$ gpg --armor --clearsign --output test.sig.asc test.txt
$ gpg --armor --sign --encrypt --recipient john at doe.com --output test.enc.asc test.txt
$ gpg --verify test.sig.asc
gpg: Unterschrift vom Sa 13 Jul 2013 15:17:27 CEST mittels RSA-Schl?ssel ID 12345678
gpg: Korrekte Unterschrift von ?John Doe ?
$ gpg --verify test.enc.asc
gpg: verify signatures failed: Unerwartete Daten
Is it possible to only verify an encrypted message without decrypting it?
Thanks a lot!

Wow that was quick! THX a lot for your answer! I thought it was possible to only verify an encrypted message without decrypting it....

Ah, ok, it also could have been the other way around which confused me quite a bit....
