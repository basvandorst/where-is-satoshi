@_subject: openPGP vs x509 
Hash: SHA1
For which reasons do you want to use X509 for SSL connections?
For the ca of our university I did an inquiry about this issue and
didn't find any CA that certifies OpenPGP keys for Servers. But there
are many uncommercial CAs which certifies without any costs.
My opninion is, that the hierarchical X509 structur is more efficient
because not every client has to know about a special certificate. On the
other side, I have no idea how this should work with pgp-keys in
reality. To encrypt a connection normaly the opponents publickey is used
to encrypt and the secretkey is used to decrypt. This means, that a
server have to know all public keys of clients connecting to it. A
handshake between the server an client maybe solve this prob.
