Most of this will be directed to Werner but I need any input I can get.  I am designing a high visability network and this may get some attention to GnuPG. What I want to do is make GPG more feasable for AD domains, thus get more programers to help us improve gpg in the winhell world.  What I want to do is extend the AD schema possibly with ADAM to incorperate basic keyserver functionality.  Any clues, I know ldap
is outdated but it will work well for AD admins.  Next I was wondering what it would take to make the gpgexch have the ability to do the following:
Rich Text (so I can paste out of word and what not)
Symmetric encryption for mailing lists
Auto key retreveal if it is not in the pub ring (from the perfered key server, perferably ldap) Any clues?
