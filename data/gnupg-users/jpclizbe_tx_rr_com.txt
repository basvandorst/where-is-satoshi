@_subject: encrypt the sent folder 
Sounds unreasonable to me. It's completely beyond our scope to implement.
Why is this unreasonable? You are asking an extension with hooks in certain
steps of a MUA (Thunderbird/Seamonkey) to set policy on an IMAP server out of
our control.
Enigmail gets the message after the user clicks 'Send', does its processing, and
passes the result back to the Mozilla mail-news code for mailing and storage.
The extension has no control or interest in how the user has configured the MUA
to handle sent items.
In both the IMAP case and the local storage case, the message that is saved is
the exact message that is sent on the wire. This is not an Enigmail function,
but a function of the mail agent.
There is no provision for processing a message on multiple paths and specifying
separate handling on each path when sending, nor would it be reasonable to
expect there to be.
There are two RFEs filed in Bugzilla to allow the unencrypted storage of
encrypted items. One applies to sent items, the other to received ones.
These may be possible at some time in the future, but no one is making any promises.

@_subject: encrypt the sent folder 
Once again, this would appear to be a server configuration issue, not a GnuPG issue.
If it is possible for someone to easily spoof a user's credentials and access
their emails, then it's an authentication issue. If you're worried about
eavesdropping on the wire, you want SSL or TLS to secure the link.
In the case given of IMAP, you want  IMAP + TLS or IMAP + SSL
Check with your server admins to determine if your server supports IMAP w/ TLS
or IMAP w/SSL. POP3 and SMTP also may be configured to use one of these suites.
If these are supported, you may select them on the 'Server Settings' tab in
'Account Settings'
It sounds as if you need to sit down and realistically evaluate your security
needs with those who administer your network and servers.  If your threat level
is such that you do not feel the existing tools can meet your needs, it's time
get out your checkbook and call in a professional not continue to seek free

Manual registry editing is not needed - the installer handles all the entries
GnuPG needs.
Likewise, there is no need to copy or do anything else with iconv.dll. As a
general rule of thumb, copying things into %systemroot%\system32 is to be
avoided. The iconv library is only needed for NLS support. If gpg needs it and
cannot find it, it will issue a warning and continue executing.
Werner posted that the installer correctly handles iconv; ie if the DLL is found
in your path, the installer does nothing; if not found or too old, it places a
copy of iconv.dll into the GnuPG program directory. [GnuPG-Devel 2005-03-17]

@_subject: Very Newbie Questions 
I'll try to stick close to the original points.
The values in HKCU are fine. Keyrings on removable media are easily handled by
editing gpg.conf. This allows portability across OSes by keeping OS-specific
path references in gpg.conf. The exact same PCMCIA card with keyrings works on
Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, OSF1/Tru64, and VMS systems. I'd add OS X but
I don't have a Mac. The gpg.conf is practically the same in all cases,  the only
differences being the semantics pointing to the files. HomeDir and gpg.conf
don't move. The keyrings move.
If only portability on a single OS is required, all that is needed is to define
GNUPGHOME as a user environment variable.
Then don't use it. You're 1 in a million. But, please don't extrapolate your
particular set of needs and preferences to the remaining 99.9999% of the user
base. The purpose of the installer is to produce a working installation of GnuPG
in a known valid configuration. Other than the ability and rights to run an
installer, there are no other system manglement skills called for or required.
The phrase "edit the Registry" will cause most Windows users without development
or system administration training to run in fear. We do not wish that result.
Asking them to add the GnuPG program directory to their PATH makes some overly
But you could with GNUPGHOME at either the user of system level, and/or
primary-keyring, keyring, secret-keyring, and/or trustdb-name directives in
gpg.conf.  It is also an advanced configuration that is far outside the scope of
installing for and configuring a new user. This is the rare *exception* not the
I must say, I fully believe you are correct.
I concur. But there is still no need to edit the Registry. _None_.
You may, but it is not a requirement.
I hear your ranting, but it still won't make what you are saying correct.
Application specific DLLs go in the program's directory hierarchy.
Redistributable system elements that are newer may go under %systemroot%. The
Visual C 7.1 C runtime library, msvcr71.dll, is a good example. It wasn't
expected to be found on older machines, so its redistribution was allowed.
Your example of printer drivers being proof of your assertion is specious. Print
driver software is supposed to go there. It is expected to be used by all
programs on the system. What you didn't mention, was that the
monitoring/dashboard type widgets from the printer maker go in a separate folder
under %ProgramFiles%. Example: "C:\Program Files\Hewlett-Packard\HP OfficeJet
Series 600" with directories: Bin, Coverpgs, Data, Docs, Faxes, Help.
Ditto device drivers.
Further, the behavior of other installers is not proof of their correctness.
I hope Vista will seriously limit the practices you describe.
No, you're telling me your understanding of the Windows-development way colored
by your beliefs of what is best. Please check the Microsoft Windows Software
Logo program, You may also want to poke around on MSDN:
Maybe. Maybe not.
The only way to be sure you get it is to place it in the same
directory as the program. Placing it in %SystemRoot%\system32 is *NO* guarantee.
If the DLL is not found locally, then a PATH search is started. An installer has
no way to determine what will or will not be found at program execution time.
Nor can it guarantee that directories in the PATH variable are ordered in a
certain manner.
How many ZLIB dlls of multiple version do you find under %ProgramFiles% (search
for *zlib*.dll)?
The only way to 100% guarantee that the application finds the correct DLL is to
place it in the application directory. Things are even more fun with the spread
of C++.
Finally, include by reference

enough without duplicating what I agree with in another's response.

@_subject: GPG gives wierd data when trying to decrypt 
Yep, that is GnuPG's normal behavior with --decrypt - writing its output to
stdout, your terminal window.
From the man page:
       -d, --decrypt [file]
                 Decrypt  file (or stdin if no file is specified) and write it
                 to stdout (or the  file  specified  with  --output).  If  the
                 decrypted  file  is  signed,  the signature is also verified.
                 This command differs from the default operation, as it  never
                 writes  to  the filename which is included in the file and it
                 rejects files which don't begin with an encrypted message.
If specifying --decrypt, you should also specify either '--output ' or
redirect output, eg. gpg --decrypt encrypted-file > output-file.
Specifying only the encrypted filename to gpg should be all you need to do.
Without any commands, gpg will perform a reasonable action depending on the type
of file it is given as  input  (an encrypted  message  is  decrypted, a
signature is verified, etc...). It should write the decrypted file to the
filename stored in the encrypted file.

You're getting Bad signature because gpg can't find the key. And it can't find
it because the keyserver helper program is being blocked at your proxy server.
In addition to auto-key-retrieve, try specifying http-proxy[=value] as part of
the keyserver-options line in gpg.conf.
From the gpg man page:
  http-proxy[=value]
            For HTTP-like keyserver schemes that (such as HKP
            and HTTP itself), try to access the keyserver over
            a proxy. If a value is specified, use this as the
            HTTP proxy. If no value is specified, the value of
            the environment variable "http_proxy", if any, will
            be used.
If that doesn't work, you may either
  a) ask the Net-gods to open the keyserver port, 11371. Or,
  b) try to locate a keyserver operation on port 80.

I think you misunderstand. You may import the keys to the same keyring file, but

Your existing revocation certs are fine *for each individual key*. If you wish a

certificate and publish the revoked key.
If you delete a secret key, you lose its use. You will no longer be able to
decrypt content encrypted to the corresponding public key.
Do not delete any of your secret keys until you understand the principles a bit
better.  Your present course will lead you to unwelcome and undesired results.

@_subject: Local file encryption 
If your GnuPG keyring files reside on the computer, then either approach is
equivalent -- your protection is ultimately determined by the strength of the
chosen passphrase protecting the secret key or the encrypted file.
Either method will encrypt the file using a symmetric cipher. The difference is
that in OpenPGP, a random session key is generated and that is used to
symmetrically encrypt the file. Then, the session key is encrypted using the
chosen public key(s).
The passphrase is only one protection on your keypair and it's pretty much the
protection of last resort - given an easily guessable/brute-forced passphrase,
it's "Game-Over." if an attacker gets access to the keyring files. Another
protection is to physically secure your keyring files (or at the minimum, the
secret ring) by storing it on removable media of some sort: floppy, PCMCIA flash
card, USB dongle,... and removing that media when you leave the computer. Now,
an attacker must have both the media with the secret keyring as well as the
secret key's passphrase.
If removable media is not an option, or for additional security on removable
media, you may use a disk encryption product such as TrueCrypt to create an
encrypted volume to store your keyring files. (Hint: Use a new key and passphrase.)

I don't don't why you present these as two opposing camps. Both are valid.
The thing is degree. Yes, keys are likely harvested. But I will suggest you'll
get /much more/ SPAM from sending a message to this list than you will from
publishing an email address on a key and sending it to a keyserver.
I created two special purpose keys in early Sept 2004, each with a different
address, and sent them to the keyservers. The addresses are not used anywhere
for email. Since then one account has received 139 SPAM messages, the other 121
- *total*. That's an average of one SPAM message per account about every 6.5
days, roughly one per week.
Those volumes represent about one or two days worth on a couple other accounts.
So, yes - harvesting occurs. But its impact is being portrayed way out of
proportion to its actual effect. I'd have to conclude that the benefits of
having good addresses searchable on the keyservers far outweighs the negligible
volume of SPAM that can be traced to actual harvesting.

Except the OP was referring to gpg2 which does not have any of the Camellia code
in it yet. So concluding that it's Camellia is a bit of a stretch.
Since the error occurred in md_enable, it'd be a safer bet to go checking in the
hash functions.
Also, this is a *known error*, see this thread, 'Algorithm 11 not available',
It stems from the fact that the cipher library in gpg2 does not have SHA-224
(hash algorithm 11) enabled.

Though they may just tell you to ask the Enigmail guys.
Enigmail makes one call to GnuPG when sending.  After 'Send' is clicked and
processing such as line ending canonizations, the message is passed to GnuPG for
whatever processing is requested. The results from GnuPG are then assembled into
the final message and passed back to SeaMonkey/Thunderbird's mailnews code  for
the actual putting the message on the wire,
The only time Enigmail calls GnuPG twice in message processing is to get key
information to display on the status line.
I may be useful to look at that message being examined with a tool such as
pgpdump to determine the size of the individual packets.

Revoking the old and adding a new userID is the route I'd take, but we've

The only reason for keeping your old key is to decrypt anything that may have
been encrypted to it.  If you delete the old key you will lose access to
anything encrypted to that key.
If you /really/ want to use your name to lookup your current key, you could add
a new UID to the old key that doesn't match your name and delete the UID that
does match; eg "A. Berg-revoked". You may use anything you like, so long as it
doesn't match whatever you are using for a search term.

       --no      Assume "no" on most questions.
gpg -ea is only a non-interactive command as long as all recipient keys are
considered trusted *and* the output filename does not already exist.
--batch -ea by itself fails for a non trusted key. Along with the 'encryption
failed: unusable public key' message, you should have received a 'There is no
assurance this key belongs to the named user' message. --batch --yes will handle
the output file already existing, but not the untrusted key.
If you must use batch, the you need to add --yes if the output file name may
already exist (it will be overwritten); and you need to either sign recipient
keys with a trusted key or add --always-trust to the command line.

@_subject: Feature request: load gpg.conf from the same directory as GPG 
I can easily think of two ways of overriding the default HomeDir location,
$GNUPGHOME (%GNUPGHOME% on windows) and --homedir. FWIW, the "look for gpg.conf
in same directory as executable" idea, falls apart if you ever need to have
additional copies of GnuPG in the case of different OS or CPUs. Storing user
data together with programs is generally considered a "BAD Idea?".
Just for reference, here's a relevant chunk of docs\README.W32 (README-W32.txt)
which the installer includes with the binaries:
  Home directory:
  ===============
  GnuPG makes use of a per user home directory to store its keys as well
  as configuration files.  The default home directory is a directory
  named "gnupg" below the application data directory of the user.  This
  directory will be created if it does not exist.  Being only a default,
  it may be changed by setting the name of the home directory into the
  Registry under the key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\GNU\GnuPG using the
  name "HomeDir".  If an environment variable "GNUPGHOME" exists, this
  even overrides the registry setting.  The command line option
  "--homedir" may be used to override all other settings of the home
  directory.
and the file NEWS (docs\NEWS.txt) in the section for 1.4.1 gives the search
    * [W32] The algorithm for the default home directory changed:
      First we look at the environment variable GNUPGHOME, if this one
      is not set, we check whether the registry entry
      {HKCU,HKLM}\Software\GNU\GnuPG:HomeDir has been set. If this
      fails we use a GnuPG directory below the standard application
      data directory (APPDATA) of the current user. Only in the case
      that this directory cannot be determined, the old default of
      c:\gnupg will be used.  The option --homedir still overrides all
      of them.
It would be just as valid to leave gpg.conf in its default location and redirect
GnuPG to the keyring files. There's really nothing 'security sensitive' in
gpg.conf. I do things that way so I can move my keys to machines running
different operating systems without worrying about file access semantics in
For illustration, I'll use the location I use for my keyrings.
If only using GnuPG in a command window...
   SET GNUPGHOME=O:\GnuPG
If you only need to use GnuPG with Enigmail within Thunderbird, you can do this
using Enigmail's preferences. From Thunderbird's menu bar, OpenPGP -->
Preferences. If the 'Display expert settings' box is unchecked, check it now.
Now click on the Advanced tab. In the box labeled 'Additional parameters for
GnuPG', add '--homedir O:\GnuPG' (without the quotes and changing to whatever
path you are using).
To set it for all your applications, you can define an environment variable
using Control Panel.
Control Panel --> System --> Advanced --> 'Environment Variables' button. Under
'User variables' at the top of the panel, click the 'New' button.
   For Variable Name, enter GNUPGHOME
   For Variable Value, enter the location you are using, eg O:\GnuPG
Click OK three times to close the applet. BTW, right-clicking the desktop's My
Computer icon and selecting Properties is equivalent to Control Panel-->System.
(Start --> Run --> sysdm.cpl [OK] also will work.)
If you have not already done so, you should make sure that the PATH entry in the
same set of user variables contains the location of the gpg binary you are
using. In this example, I'd add O:\GnuPG; to the beginning of the string (don't
forget the semicolon).
Changes to user environment variables show up for any newly created process, so
you may need to restart Thunderbird - I don't recall if Enigmail's exec of gpg
creates a new process environment or inherits its environment from Thunderbird.

Don't use pubring.tmp. I remembered that gpg uses that name (and also
pubring.bak) as part of the importing. Try pubring.sav
No, what is happening is that the import will merge both copies of each key and
then apply the cleaning algorithm. Since the imported keyring is a copy of the
original, all that effectively happens is the cleaning.
A reimport after refreshing with import-clean is unnecessary.
After you initially clean a keyring (above), if you set import-clean as both a
keyserver-option and an import-option in gpg.conf, whenever a key is added and
whenever you refresh your keyring, keys will automatically be cleaned.  You
shouldn't need to re-import your keyring to clean it again.

that is a hearty, YES.
Rather than seeing 1.4.x & 2.0.x as different paths to accomplish the same task,
less-experienced users tend to fall into the "greater version # must mean
'New&Improved?' *AND* BETTER" trap.
The "Well, isn't 2.0 better?" question is common.

For those using Enigmail with Thunderbird/Seamonkey, 2.0.x is _only_ required if
one needs gpg-agent support.

@_subject: Naming of GnuPG 
True. Enigmail is a security extension to Mozilla Thunderbird and Seamonkey. It
integrates functionality of GnuPG's OpenPGP implementation to support the
sending and receiving of OpenPGP encrypted and digitally signed email (and
news). It will work with either GnuPG 1.4.x or 2.0.x. It does not provide a full
interface to whichever version of GnuPG it is configured to use. Nor does it add
any additional functionality not already present in the particular version of
GnuPG in use.
Which is why I specified "is _only_ required if one needs gpg-agent support."
It might be best if I speak to what I meant. gpg-agent is required in the case
the user uses more than one key and those keys have different passphrases.
Enigmail's passphrase caching is limited to the cases of a single key or
multiple keys sharing a common passphrase.
So, yes, in general, gpg-agent doesn't get you much. But in these the /specific/
use case I specified it is essential.

@_subject: changing the default keyring location in windows 
The answer to both is yes, but each is a separate solution.
There are four methods that I know. The first three require you additionally
move gpg.conf. All require that you move the three keyring files: pubring.gpg,
secring.gpg, & trustdb.gpg.
1) Add --homedir= to _every_ invocation of gpg. Fine if you don't ever make
tpyos and don't forget to add it.
2) Set the environment variable GNUPGHOME to the location. Best done in the User
variables part of the Environment variable panel of System properties. (Control
panel --> System --> Advanced --> 'Environment Variables' button)
3) Change the value of HomeDir in the HKCU\Software\Gnu\GnuPG key. Some users
are uncomfortable directly editing the Registry. Later runs of the installer may
or may not mess with this. Most likely not, feeling lucky?
4) Set values in gpg.conf to redirect the location. (My preferred method)
Add the following lines to gpg.conf:
   no-default-keyring
   primary-keyring R:\pubring.gpg
   secret-keyring  R:\secring.gpg
   trustdb-name    R:\trustdb.gpg
You may also need
   keyring         R:\pubring.gpg
Depending on the size of your portable storage device, you may find organizing
with directories a bit easier. I use O;\GnuPG and O:\PGP for my keyrings
BTW, I may have forgotten to mention it over the weekend. Please turn HTML
composition off completely with (Open)PGP. It produces messages that usually
will fail signature verification. It will sometimes work, but rarely.
format=flowed is another message composition "feature" that tends to break
signatures. It's most common in Mozilla mailers.

@_subject: using gpg with private keys from openssl certificates? 
I tried this some years ago and concur with Robert.  PGP Desktop will read a
X.509 cert into its keyring. What you get is a RSA key with no expiration date
with a CA certification as a signature packet which has no impact on the key's
functionality once it expires. That's not the way X.509 is supposed to work.
This key pair may be exported and imported into GnuPG where it will be seen as a
nonselfsigned key with an invalid signature packet (the CA certification).
C:\WINNT>gpg --list-key 0xbe81a801
pub   2048R/BE81A801 2005-09-16
uid                  Thawte Freemail Member C:\WINNT>gpg --list-sigs 0xbe81a801
pub   2048R/BE81A801 2005-09-16
uid                  Thawte Freemail Member sig       X  00000000 2005-09-16  [User ID not found]
You can use the raw key material from a X.509 cert in GnuPG after you've
massaged and cleaned it up a bit. But it really doesn't gain you anything. Each
of the two copies have no effect on the other. The CA's certification is ignored
in OpenPGP. Any additional OpenPGP signatures have no effect on the X.509
validity or trust.
IMO, A lot of work for no real benefit.

@_subject: SMIME vs PGP 
S/MIME is common in a majority of email clients
( ), much more
so than its use. The Wikipedia S/MIME article summarizes some of the more common
obstacles to S/MIME adoption as well as a few caveats.
S/MIME itself is not used outside of email apps, however the certificates
(keys), sometimes referred to as X.509 certificates, S/MIME uses are able to be
used by other apps, eg for digital signatures in applications such as Open
Office, MS Office and Adobe Acrobat, and for encryption in IM programs such as AIM.
The creation and management of the certificates themselves, the Certificate
Authority (CA), is usually the major task of establishing an enterprise PKI.

That will sign everything in a given directory, but won't recurse.

@_subject: Moving from PGP to GPG 
At the present, keyring files in PGP and GnuPG are just sequential collections
of key packets.
GnuPG is expecting the .gpg extension. You don't have to rename the files, so
long as you tell GnuPG what the names are:
   no-default-keyring
   keyring O:\utilities\pubring.pkr
   primary-keyring O:\utilities\pubring.pkr
   secret-keyring O:\utilities\secring.skr
included in \gpg.conf, or specified on the commend line by prefixing '--'.
I usually import the files:
   gpg --import secring.skr
   gpg --import pubring.skr
Either way, there's one detail to take care of: key trust. PGP calls it
'Implicit Trust' and stores it as part of the key. GnuPG calls it 'Ultimate
trust' and stores it in trustdb.gpg.
You set it by editing the key:
   gpg --edit-key 0xdecafbad trust
Select 5 to select Ultimate trust, confirm with y, then exit with save.
For the passphrase issue: the times I've seen this, it is usually due to the
passphrase having characters that don't map into the command line code-page.
You may wish to try clearing the passphrase in PGP before copying the keyrings
and then resetting it in GnuPG.

Since the original decrypts fine, I'd check and compare the hashes of the two

Small errors can creep in during transfer that will invalidate later decryption.
Comparing the outputs from md5sum or sha1sum will alert you to the error.
GnuPG may also be used to generate the file hashes:
    gpg --print-md algo [files]
algo may be taken from the listing produced by 'gpg --version'.
    gpg --print-mds [files]
will generate hashes for all available algorithms.

Ummm, yeah. It does.
You should take that as a sign. The canonical response here is that building for
Win32 is only supported on Gnu/Linux systems using the MinGW cross-compile
It took a LOT of effort on the 1.3 tree to get GnuPG 1 to build cleanly on an
MSYS hosted MinGW. Even then, there were still small nits that showed up and
were fixed later.
Before building trunk head revisions, it's best to first verify that you have a
working build environment by building a release version using release, not
development, versions of any dependent libraries.
Building from the svn head is for folks who know about the pitfalls of life on
the Bleeding Edge of software development. They also know why it's called
Bleeding and they're willing to deal/live with those reasons.
From just a cursory look, it looks like the linker isn't finding libgcrypt. Did
you build and install it? Where?
Which library is configure finding and where? If it's finding a Cygwin copy,
have you installed the dev package for it... Have you tried telling configure to
look in some other location, eg --with-=/usr/local ?
There's nothing in 2.x that I need so I haven't invested effort in getting it
built/running on any of my Windows boxen, so there's not much specific guidance
I can furnish.

@_subject: question about hkp protocol 
HKP is implemented with HTTP over port 11371. It is not itself a browser protocol.
However, many keyservers operate web interfaces as well as the automated
responses. These web interfaces also operate on port 11371.
For restrictive firewalls, I know of several modern SKS keyservers that also
listen on port 80. And three that will accept commands via email.
hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net is equivalent to Web server interfaces are primarily used for searching.
It's easiest to let GnuPG handle the details of submitting your key:
  gpg --keyserver keyserver.gingerbear.net --send-key 0xdecafbad
If you /really/ need to use the web interface, just don't type hkp:// as part of
the URL (you may type  but it's not needed) and be sure to add :11371 to
the host name
  keyserver.gingerbear.net:11371
Most browsers will automatically prefix http:// if it is absent

(or 'Upload Public Keys' from the Keyserver pull-down menu). Select one of the
existing servers or type in one of your choosing, only the server name is
needed. Click OK.
Wait about an hour before pinging keyservers to see if your key is there if you
used random... or pool... It takes a while for servers to synchronize. If you
use a single server, you can check it right away. But it may still take 1-2
hours to show up on all the servers.

which sticks  on the end.
Does running DIR or ls -l on the passphrase file show it to be longer than it
actually is? (Add one byte for end-of-file plus one for CR and another for LF)
You can run a hex dump utility such as dump from the cygutils package to verify
this. The last bytes will be 0D 0A for CR-LF. You can get cygutils from :
If so, running dos2unix on passfile /may/ solve things. It's available from a
variety of sources. The GnuWin32 project is a handy source - it's also in the
cygutils package. It worked for me with the other batch decrypt problem
yesterday, but not yours today.
Using the Gnu version of echo with the suppress newline option 'echo -n' to
create passfile is also an option, probably the best. echo is part of the
coreutils package and is also available from the GnuWin32 project:
Using 'echo -n' to create passfile is what worked for me using your command from

Your question is neither stupid nor ridiculous.
You can copy trustdb.gpg along with pubring.gpg and secring.gpg.
It's a good application for a USB drive: you can copy the files to the
USB drive and redirect GnuPG to use the keyring files on that drive.
You can copy the first set and then use --import to merge in the keys
from the second keyring to form the common keyring. You'll have to set
ownertrust individually, I don't believe there's a way to merge trustdb
You'll want to use strong passphrases and keep a backup copy (or two) in
case the USB drive gets lost or damaged.

I'm not sure how you came to "almost abandoned" conclusion. It doesn't
seem to have been by posting and asking for help on the [sks-devel] list.
SKS is a fairly mature product. It was based on RFC 2440 and the latest
bis drafts of what is now RFC 4880. As such, there is little ongoing
maintenance that needs to be done.  The greatest problem is
reconstructing the documentation from sites that have dropped from the net.
1) LDAP  Most LDAP server platforms can function as a keyserver by
   extending the server's schema. There are a couple very notable
   differences from other keyservers: a) while other servers merge
   updates, the normal function with LDAP keyservers is to replace;
   b) it is possible to delete keys from LDAP keyservers.
   The schema changes and a how-to were posted to this list some time
   back. I can forward a couple relevant emails if you'd like.
2) ONAK is another OpenPGP compliant server, see
   3) OpenPKSD is yet another keyserver. It's written in Ruby and
   maintained by Hironobu Suzuki. See 4) CryptNet. The last OpenPGP compliant platform I know about is the

Most MUAs remove both the Usenet sig ('-- ') as well as the OpenPGP sig,

@_subject: Exposing email addresses on key servers 
Enigmail actually has two ways this mapping may be done:
1) in advance, via per-recipient rules
2) ad hoc, via selecting keys in the key manager when sending.
   This is also the more cumbersome of the two
IAWTC. Crypto with email is difficult enough. Making it more so isn't
helpful to the adoption process.
I think the relative risk of keyserver SPAM is badly overestimated. Yes
it happens, but I don't believe it's anywhere near the degree people who
keep bring up this UID mangling "solution" must think it is.
Several years ago, the Enigmail team were discussing the very topic and
we wanted to quantify just how bad a problem keyserver SPAM was. So a
couple UIDs with heretofore unused email addresses were added to keys
and sent to the servers. At the same time, two email accounts were setup
 on GMail but left unused. After three months, the volume of SPAM to the
keyserver UID addresses was statistically indistinguishable from random
noise SPAM landing on the dormant GMail accounts. The volume itself was
quite small in comparison to what I received on a regular basis on the
ISP account used at the time for this and other technical lists; 20-30
per month versus 1000-1200 per month.
That was around 2004/2005. Folks are welcome to repeat the process to
see if the numbers have substantially changed.
I agree. Specific spam defenses are in many ways worse than useless.
They stop an insignificant fraction of spam and add a layer of
complexity to your system.
Trying to plug up every single route by which a spammer can discover
your email address is both specific, and it has a terrible game-over.
Once it's out, it's out.  Boo hoo for you.  All that sacrifice and
inconvenience for naught.
General spam defenses are very useful; e.g., Bayesian filters in MUAs
and MTAs. A good spam filter, though -- if a spam gets through, you can
teach the spam filter to not let another one like it through.  General
defenses do not easily fall into game-over states. You can teach the
filter to avoid false negatives as well as false positives.
There are better ways of fighting SPAM than making it difficult for
others to communicate.

    Many users and vendors who prefer the name "Linux" point to the inclusion
    of non-GNU, non-kernel tools such as the Apache HTTP Server, the X Window
    System or the K Desktop Environment in end-user operating systems based on
    the Linux kernel. As stated by Jim Gettys, originator of X:
        "There are lots of people on this bus; I don't hear a clamor of support
         that GNU is more essential than many of the other components; can't
         take a wheel away, and end up with a functional vehicle, or an engine,
         or the seats. I recommend you be happy we have a bus."
The distros I use most often are 'Slackware Linux' and 'Red Hat Enterprise
Linux', no 'Gnu' there and no amount of fervent pedantry is likely to get it
You are free to call it GNU/Linux if you wish.  Likewise, others are free to

@_subject: multiple subkeys and key transition 
Big ACK to what Rob just said.
Why 8192? 4096 RSA is extremely *unlikely* to ever be a default. Over the
summer, readers of the [Cryptography] mailing list were reminded that in 1993
folks thought that 1024-bit RSA 'should be ok (safe from key-factoring attacks)
for "a few decades".' A later post in that same thread went on to compare
equivalent strengths of RSA, symmetric keys and Elliptic Curve (ECC) keys.
How do elliptic curves compare to RSA today?
From the National Institutes of Science and Technology (one of the gold
standards for engineering know-how):
 RSA    ECC    Sym
 1024   160     80
 2048   224    112
 3072   256    128
 7680   384    192
15360   512    256
These recommendations can be found on page 63 of NIST Special
Publication 800-57, Recommendations for Key Management, Part I. 2nd Revision,
8 Mar, 2007.
112-bit symmetric is usually a reference to [three-key] 3DES.
(It's worth noting that most people in the crypto community are *deeply*
skeptical of any claims that 3DES can be cracked.  If 112 bits of
symmetric encryption are good enough for your purposes, then RSA-2048
should also be good enough for your purposes.)
That is to say, a 3072 bit RSA key is as tough as an ECC key based on a 256
bit field, which is as tough as a 128 bit symmetric key.
ECC cryptosystems on 256 bit field are practical today. 3072 bit RSA systems
are not.
The NSA's 2010 Suite-B[4] recommendations are:
     Type     Symmetric   Elliptic Curve    Hash
    Secret       128         256             256
   Top Secret    256         384             384
A key aspect of Suite B is its use of elliptic curve technology instead of
classical public key technology. During the transition to the use of elliptic
curve cryptography in ECDH and ECDSA, DH, DSA and RSA can be used with a
2048-bit modulus to protect classified information up to the _secret_ level
So, depending on the source, a consensus seems to be forming that beyond a 2048
or 3072 bit modulus for DSA2 or RSA, folks need to switch to ECC.
2048-RSA is the current default in GnuPG. OpenPGP cards will support up to
3072-bit RSA; GnuPG up to 4096-bit RSA and 3072-bit DSA2. ECC in OpenPGP is on
its way toward becoming a RFC and being included in OpenPGP. Larger and larger
RSA keys aren't the solution, ECC is. The balance of power has tipped away from
RSA and toward ECC.
Feel free to ignore everything I've told you. There's no reason you should trust
me. But by all means, keep asking questions. But everything I've read agrees
longer RSA are not the path forward.

An /interesting/ thesis, However, to be taken seriously you need to back it up
with more than conjecture. There are plenty of obstacles to the widespread use
of encryption in the computing literature without grasping at straws to create more.
Widespread perception? Indeed? Please quantify. There are over 2.8 million keys
on the SKS keyservers with an average of just under 350 new keys added every
day.[0] The "keyserver SPAM" discussion surfaces maybe three to four times per
year across three lists. Odds on users will get more SPAM from asking a question
on a public mailing list such as this one than they will from that attributable
to keyservers.

I've seen errant ideas criticized, not any person. The only irritant for me was
a breach of email etiquette.
I think most of us agree that the publishing of another person's key(s) is
mostly attributable to a) accident, or b) ignorance. I don't think malice
normally is a factor.
This is partly due to the fact that it is more difficult to mine addresses from
BigLumber. But you are only a factor of 4 or 5 away from what I measured due to
keyserver SPAM five years ago.
The original statement I made that started this entire discussion was, "> It is
also a good idea to send your key to the keyservers."
IIRC, we do this in the Enigmail Handbook[5]. But I've been distracted with
family issues as of late.

it was. The pros and cons have been discussed, on this list, on the Enigmail

likely only encrypt with GnuPG if the external party needed to restrict access
to the file on their end.

@_subject: 4096 bit keys 
Depends more on the quality of your PRNG.
Could be in OpenPGP later this year. Camellia was fairly fast.
As I recall, there is some coordination among the OpenPGP ECC author and the
maintainers of other FOSS crypto software so they implement things in a
compatible manner. I believe they may be waiting for a SHA-3 algorithm to be
picked. It was discussed on the IETF-OpenPGP list late last year.
"It certainly isn't in the commercial PGP." Not Yet, although as Rob said, I'd
be surprised if PGP (symantec) didn't already have an ECC-enabled branch waiting
to release once the ECC OpenPGP Draft is adopted. Two reasons:
  1) One of the main initiatives of Suite B is the use of COTS,
     and the USG represents a VERY large market for PGP.
  2) The ECC-OpenPGP draft itself. Andrey Jivsov, the author,
     is with Symantec Corp (read PGP Corp).

You're much better off with MinGW and dependencies or Cygwin. There was a move
to try to write project files for Visual Studio some long time ago, but I don't

@_subject: Current key servers 
See below.
Well,... that's _my_ list of keyservers. You are correct that they are
private IP addresses. There are over 110 SKS keyservers online right
now. They're not all in datacenters. :-)  If you have a local keyserver
it doesn't make a lot of sense to go hit the router only to be port
forwarded back to the local IP address.
If a public facing server (keyserver.gingerbear.net or
sks.keyservers.net ) goes down for some reason, another can be put in
place with a couple mouse clicks. They all "talk amongst themselves" so
they are all always up-to-date.
Why do I have 5 1/2 keyservers running on my local net?
I do a "fair" amount of code work on SKS, the keyserver platform,
Production and test boxes for two public facing keyservers gets me four
of those. They're also used to test for portability to other operating
systems. (Who would think one could run SKS on Windows? sks-db works
fine. Still have timing issues with sks_recon.)
There was a DNS issue some time back. That led to the addition of a
large number of secondary nameservers. Kristian Fiskerstrand has also
been working on the pool selection code to make it more robust.
[sks-devel] is a fairly quiet group, but we're attentive and working.

@_subject: Malformed Revokation Certificate? 
As it is an extension, we don't. SKS also does not recognize the CA
certification on X.509 certificates converted to OpenPGP by PGP. I haven't
checked with GnuPG 2, but GnuPG 1.4 doesn't recognize the CA certification on
those keys either.
Uploading a bare revocation certificate currently fails with an Add Error.
Kristian has modified this for the next release to be a more informational
    "Add failed: This is a stand-alone revocation certificate. A revocation
    certificate should be imported to the respective public key before being
    published to a keyserver"
Another alternative is to work the desired behavior into the standard. For
example, the present SKS development trunk supports Elliptic Curve Public keys
(ECDSA, ECDH) which are an extension to RFC 4880 contained in RFC 6637.

@_subject: Why hashed User IDs is not the solution to User ID enumeration 
Having keyservers support no-modify requires that they first support crypto.
That's a really big step.
To my knowledge, no one is working on such an initiative in SKS or any other
I believe LDAP is the only platform that presently can handle no-modify, but
does keyserver.pgp.com even support it? I don't recall that it does.

Which is why I also wrote in that message:
To repeat: OpenPGP and the keyserver network were NEVER designed to operate in
the manner you wish. I doubt they ever will operate in that manner. You cannot
blind a UID from other UIDs on a certificate. The day keyservers selectively
return certificate information is the day the keyservers no longer are trusted.
Like Rob, I'm done. There is no more to explain. Adios. Sayonara. Goodbye.
I'm going back to work on getting SKS to run on Windows.

@_subject: can someone verify the gnupg Fingerprint for pubkey? 
Secret agents may or may not be here. Actual operatives one doesn't know if
they're here. It's often said the best way to hide is in plain sight. I can
think of a high-level InfoSec official for a branch of the CIA, a former
employee of the NSA, and a few folks paid by agencies of, or directly by their
gov't to write crypto software. Those folks ain't hiding at all.
Poke about on [Cryptography] and [IETF-OpenPGP] you may even find a few more :-)
Just because you don't see a nsa.gov or fbi.gov return address, or the English
or German equivalents, doesn't mean they're not here. Most are regular folks
and like the rest of us, have an interest in crypto and its uses. Sometimes
this interest meshes with their "day job", other times it's orthogonal.
You don't see them, but they're here and on the other crypto lists. ;-)

I don't think the network as a whole would be adversely impacted. Where the

See logging/leak discussion below.
Which is why we suggest folks us one of the sks-keyservers.net pools.
There are multiple pools to choose from besides the basic
pool.sks-keyservers.net. See
 for a description of the
various pools.
Another good reason to use one of the round-robin pool addresses rather than a
single keyserver.  I have to go back and check but I believe that that level
of logging is a 5. SKS defaults to 4 and most operators never change it. Only
we crazy developers go for logging that detailed
You remember where that was? Sounds interesting, and I have plenty of
