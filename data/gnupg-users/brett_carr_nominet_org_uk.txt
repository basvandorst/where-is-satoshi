@_subject: gnupg compilation problems on Solaris 10 64 bit 
I'm trying to build gnupg 1.4.9 on a clean build of Solaris 10 Sparc 64
Bit, the configure stage goes through without any problems and creates my
Makefile, when I run the make things seem to be going fine but after a few
minutes the compile falls over, I have pasted in from where it starts to go
wrong below, any help greatly appreciated.
Note the problems occur if I build as 64 bit, building as 32 bit works

Thanks this fixed the problem, out of interest what does this disable?
