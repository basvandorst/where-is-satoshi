@_subject: version report 
I have installed GnuPG 1.0.7, downloaded today (6/25/2002) from The VERSION file in the tar says 1.0.7. But
gpg --version
gives 1.0.6, as well as other operations with gpg. Am I using really the
right 1.0.7 version (so developers forgot to update the message)?
Otherwise, is anybody aware of where to get the right version from?
