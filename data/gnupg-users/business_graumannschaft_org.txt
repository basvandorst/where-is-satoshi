@_subject: Fedora: Smart Card Reader access as root, but not a normal user ... 
============================== START ==============================
I have a smart card reader attached to a fedora 25 box. 'gpg2 --card
status' works fine for root, but NOT for a normal user. Writing a udev
rule is the first thing that comes to mind, but there's no group
'plugdev' too add to and 'tag+="uaccess"' doesn't seem to work either.
What do I have to do to get this to work?
Thanks for any hints.
Sincerely, Joh
