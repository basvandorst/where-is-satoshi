Sorry, I thought that was obvious. I want to check the file, in this
case the ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf file for proper syntax, etc. I am attempting
to use in in the same fashion that I use "postconf" to check Postfix's
configuration files. Many applications have utilities to check their
config files, "Dovecot", "ClamAV", etcetera. I thought that the
"gpgconf" utility would accomplish the same thing.
While the documentation does not specifically state that it DOES work
on the gpg.conf file, nothing says that it doesn't either. In my humble
opinion, the documentation is slightly ambiguous.
Sorry to have wasted your time.

OK, I thought it was self evident; however, I guess I need to explain
the difference more clearly.
I am not sure what terms mailman uses, so I will use "open-posting"
and "closed-posting" The meanings will become self evident.
The basic FreeBSD forum is "open-posting". A poster need not be
subscribed to the forum. What that means is that anyone may post to the
forum. To see a response, they will either have to convince every
responder to the post to CC him/her or view the replies on the web
Now most, but not all, forums are "closed-posting". If a non-subscriber
attempts to post to the forum, they will receive this response:
Your mail to 'Gnupg-users' with the subject
    Testing
Is being held until the list moderator can review it for approval.
The reason it is being held:
    Post by non-member to a members-only list
Either the message will get posted to the list, or you will receive
notification of the moderator's decision.  If you would like to cancel
this posting, please visit the following URL: (URL removed by me)
This is an actual reply from a test message I sent awhile ago.
Now, unless the poster intended to wait an indefinite period of time,
said time varying from a few hours to a few days, depending on the
forum, there is virtually no likelihood that anyone would waste their
time posting if they were not subscribed to the forum. Now, I am sure
that someone will make the statement that they wouldn't mind waiting an
indefinite period, hoping that their message will be approved and then
hoping that the responders to said post actually do CC them. I have a
term I use for people like that.
It takes only 3 minutes or less (I once subscribed to a forum and
responded to the email in less than 3 minutes) to subscribed one's
self. If the poster cannot take the time involved to subscribe to a
list, then they don't have the time to be posting to the list.
Now, this is all very simple to me; however, I am sure that someone is
going to tell me what a burden subscribing to a list is. I actually
find that rather amusing since I wonder if they find wiping their ass
after taking a crap a burden too.
Now Doug, I hope I have explained it to your satisfaction.

specifically asked not to receive one and have configured Mailman to
not send me a CC'd copy. I am not sure why this one got through.

I used to get the "Gee" bit to when I asked for a raise. Anyhow, I am
willing to bet that most, if not all banking establishments do not
verify signed mail, or if they do they want S/MIME since their user
base is vastly Microsoft orientated and S/MIME is favored on that
An unverified signed document is about as useful as tits on a bull. I
receive from time to time a signed document on various forums that is
shown as bad by my MUA (claws-mail). Usually, it is just out of date.
Occasionally, I get a revoked one though. Again, it is usually due to
the PEBKC phenomenon. In any case, I have never considered the
signature to be of any importance in a mail forum environment. I know
that some users do, and that is their right. The only problem I have
is with those friggin "inliners" whose signature Spams up the page and
makes a "sig-delimiter" impotent. Then, of course, there are
those intellectually challenged who fail to trim out that superfluous

Which would equate to the majority of non-Windows users. However, of

believe that majority employ S/MIME, if for no other reason than it
works seamlessly in MS Outlook. As I stated elsewhere, I use S/MIME on
my MS Windows machines because it is just easier to do. I really,
really like the KISS principal. For that very reason, on my FreeBSD

quite well. Others are certainly entitled to their own opinion.

I take the opposite approach. Due to the way "inline" messes up the
format of a message, and obviously renders the "sig-delimiter" useless,
I prefer to use "PGP/MIME". Plus, so many morons, I could use
"intellectually challenged" if you prefer, fail to trim a replied to
messaged; ie, they leave all of the superfluous "inline" garbage plus
other parts of the replied to message intact rather than strip it out,
just adds to the annoyance factor.
Supporting the "inline" method is like supporting a grown child. If you
keep supporting him/her, they will never leave home. Stop supporting
them and they will leave. The same is true for "inline" PGP. If support
for it were to cease, it would also.
I totally agree. I have never seen or heard any logical excuse for the
signing of list traffic. What am I going to do, attempt to use the
identity of another poster? What purpose would that serve anyway? As
you so eloquently pointed out, "A signature from an unvalidated
key belonging to an unknown person whom we don't know from Adam doesn't
mean much, if anything at all."
By the way, "unvalidated" is probably not a word; at least accord to
Merriam Webster .

The Thunderbird bug was fixed I thought awhile ago. I did not notice the
version of Thunderbird that you are employing. You could try the latest
version, V.9.0.1 and see if that corrects the problem.
This is an "OPT-IN"list. Some lists, like FreeBSD are open, but not
this one. Therefore, the use of a CC is neither required, nor in many
instances, appreciate. In actuality, it serves no purpose at all on an
"OPT-IN" mailing list.
The net is littered with ideas from people who were well liked and
respected whose ideas never made it into an RFC. The "Reply-To" works
well for those who use it. Unfortunately, some MUA's have just never
gotten their head around the concept. Filing BUG reports and basically
making yourself a "pain in the ass" to the developers of those
applications can work wonders.

Well, each to his/her own I suppose; however, I would not approve of
the file being sent to my PC regardless. There is always the
possibility of the email being intercepted and exploited or my PC being
compromised. If I want confidential information delivered to my PC,
that should be my business. If an institution wanted to offer that
option, and thereby being issued a released of responsibility, I have no
objections to it.
I do not consider the clicking on of a secure link and downloading the
document to be an inconvenience, but rather a security feature,
especially when the documents(s) can be downloaded in several formats.

Much of the discussion has been about what analogy comes closest. Prosecutors
tend to view PGP passphrases as akin to someone possessing a key to a safe

compelled to hand over the key. Other examples include the U.S. Supreme Court

This sounds more like a bug to me. I'll probably gather all the info I
can and submit it and see what happens.

I am not sure about that. If a good data compression algorithm was
employed, they might be able to save the space of a solar system or two.

I seriously doubt that a nation, such as North Korea or China, a nation
that openly runs over its own citizens, would much care what anyone
thought. However, I do agree with your general premise.
While that is probably correct, it could also be attributed to some
intelligence agency trying to test a 'proof of concept' in the real
world in real time. Never-the-less, I think that Ockham's Razor applies

@_subject: Bulk removal of expired keys 
On the URL:
there is a listing for "pgpclean.ps1" that I have used successfully
on my Windows machine. Is there any similar program for use on a
FreeBSD based OS? My primary goal is to remove all expired keys and
refresh the remaining ones if necessary.

Well, if you are not going to put a rush on it, I guess I will have too. :)

If this is the wrong place to ask this question, I apologize.

I have not been able to refresh the keys on my system. I have run the
following command with the error as shown.
gpg2 --refresh-keys

I don't believe it is a firewall problem, since there is no entry in
the firewall log to even suggest that gpg2 tried to access anything.
I have a Windows 10 machine that is using Kleopatra, on the same
network, and it is working perfectly.
I was hoping that someone could give me some suggestions on how to
debug this problem.

FreeBSD 11.4 / amd64
gpg (GnuPG) 2.2.20
libgcrypt 1.8.5
This is probably a stupid question, but precisely what is supposed
to happen after running "gpg2 --refresh-keys"?
This is the log file created from running the above command:
If I run the same command immediately after it completes its
first invocation, the same log file is created. I thought that
running 'refresh-keys" would remove deleted keys and update those that
had new expirations dates or other modifications. Obviously, I must be
in error. So, precisely what does the command accomplish?
