Hash: SHA1
For some of us relatively new Ubuntu Linux users installing the latest
gnupg can be a challenge.  I usually end up putting Ubuntu into some
strange state before everything works.  I propose a method to help us
newbies.  Successful installation steps on a brand new Oracle VM
VirtualBox installation of Ubuntu 14.04 should be published.  A new
install has no non-standard libraries etc and so should be
reproducible for everyone starting from scratch.  Working in a virtual
environment doesn't mess up your normal installation and you can save
various stages to try something new.  As an example here is what is
required on a new Ubuntu install for Gnupg 2.0.25:
1.  Download, unpack, and verify: libgpg-error-1.13, libgcrypt-1.6.1,
libassuan-2.1.1, libksba-1.3.0, pth-2.0.7
2.  cd new directory, ./configure, make, sudo make install, make
check; each of above in order
3.  sudo apt-get install gtk+-2.0
4.  Download, unpack, verify: pinentry-0.8.3, do the steps in 2 for
pinentry only
5.  Download, unpack, verify: Gnupg-2.0.25
6.  Do step 2 for Gnupg-2.0.25 only
6.  This is garaunteed to pass all 28 tests on a virgin install of
Ubuntu 14.04 and should work on your actual working Ubuntu install
with other versions of Gnupg present.
Now I ask the help of the group.  I have been unsuccessful in doing
the same for the beta version of Gnupg-2.1.  Simply installing npth,
libpg-error, libgcrypt, libksba, and libassuan does not even come
close to succeeding.  npth requires LDAP that requires something
called BerkelyDB that seems to be satisfied by sudo apt-get install
libdb-dev, libdb++-dev (I think).  Even then the compile limps along
and fails 27/29 tests.  If anyone has succeeded in doing this
reproducibly on a virgin Ubuntu install I would appreciate seeing the
detailed steps (and I'm sure others would too).
Hopefully yours, Sandy

Thank you Werner, you are right about npth.  The dependency call came
when ./configure of Gnupg-2.1 was attempted.  Then comes the message
***  You need a LDAP library to build this program.
I am getting closer!  After sudo apt-get install libdb-dev and sudo
apt-get install libdb++-dev, Openldap-2.4.39 installs without error,
provided I use the four commands: ./configure, make dependencies,
make, sudo make install.  Then after sudo apt-get install gtk+-2.0,
install pinentry, and installing Gnupg-2.1, all tests pass until it
hangs on whatever follows the test: detachm.test.  It also seems to
hang on --gen-key once the proposed password is accepted.  But I am
hot on the trail.  Unless someone beats me in revealing a successful
gnupg 2.1 install on a new Ubuntu 14.04 environment I will keep trying.
Getting there, Sandy

Success!  I finally got a consistent install of beta version
gnupg-2.1.0 on a fresh version of Ubuntu 14.04 inside VirtualBox.
These steps work:
1.  Download, verify and unpack npth, libgpg-error, libgcrypt,
libksba, libassuan.
2.  Install each in order using the commands:  ./configure, make, sudo
make install, make check.
3.  sudo mv /usr/bin/gnome-keyring-daemon
from hijacking gnupg)
4.  sudo apt-get install libdb-dev
5.  sudo apt-get install libdb++-dev
6.  Install Openldap 2.4.39 using commands: ./configure, make depend,
make, sudo make install  (dont bother with the check, it is too long
and weird)
7.  sudo apt-get install gtk+-2.0
8.  Install pinentry-0.8.3 using step 2
9.  Download, verify and unpack gnupg-2.1.0, install using step 2
10.  The make check seems to hang on genkey1024.test (right after
detachm.test) but don't give up.  It actually took 20 minutes by my
watch on my HP Envy i5 3 GHz machine to complete this step, then
completed all tests successfully.
Now we Ubuntu users can play with elliptical curve crypto, google's
end-to-end encryption scheme, and also help Werner evaluate this beta
version.  Keeping it on VirtualBox is the ideal way to evaluate this.
Thanks for all the help and comments - Sandy

Pete - beta 864 compiled perfectly for me in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.  I
suspect you need to use super user powers here.  If you want a
practice version try in a safe directory try:
sudo make -f build-aux/speedo.mk native
otherwise if you want it installed on your machine ready to go use
sudo make -f build-aux/speedo.mk native INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local
and Thanks Werner for putting in the INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local to make
it work instantly, for us non-unix gurus :)  I am now using gpg2.1 as
my main version 2.  If there is anything truly mission critical I can
always use version 1.x until the stable version of 2.1 comes out.

Problem solved.  The error in finding the shared libraries was

using the INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local option on my ubuntu 14.04 machine:
sudo ldconfig
To summarize the following worked for me on a fresh installation of

sudo apt-get install libldap2-dev, gtk+-2.0
install pinentry-0.8.4
unpack then cd gnupg-2.1.0-beta864

Now we await the stable version!

Making the switch to Linux (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS) has opened up whole new
vistas in Gnupg.  Installing the newest GPA was a bit of a challenge
but well worth it.  With Gnupg-2.0.26 installed I was never able to
get GPA fully working.  Errors such as: relocation error: gpa: symbol
gpgme_op_spawn, version GPGME_1.1 not defined in file libgpgme.so.11
with link time reference, Unknown option, gpg-agent: no agent running,
Certificate not recognized, etc, etc, etc.  Finally I installed
Gnupg-2.1.0-beta783 on top of Gnupg-2.0.26 and GPA came to life.  The
gpg-agent runs, all certificates are recognized (where did all those
expired ones come from???), and all error messages are gone.
I vote beta783 version is ready for production!!
Anybody know what would happen if I delete all those old expired

Yes, GPA-0.9.5.
Done!  Thank you.
Everything seems to be in order now.  The result is: libgpgme.so.11 =>

 I tried to delete a few of them using gpa 0.9.5 but kept getting the
error message:  GPGME library returned an unexpected error at
gpakeydeleteop.c:208.  The error was:  No public key
These do not show up with the gpg2 -k command on my machine.

In response to vedaal's question - installation of gnupg v2.1 is
significantly different from v1.x and even v2.0.  For my Ubuntu
machine hHere is a brief summary of the steps, in order
1. Install latest libraries: npth, libgpg-error, libgcrypt, libksba,
2. Execute the following command: sudo ln -sf /dev/null
3. sudo apt-get install libdb-dev, libdb++-dev, libbz2-dev
4. Install Openldap-2.4.39 using ./configure, make depend, make, sudo
make install
5. sudo apt-get install gtk+-2.0
6. Install pinentry, gnupg-2.1
Of course your milage may vary, machine blow up and hard drive

I am definitely having fun with Speedo.  After playing around with it
in a virtual box Ubuntu environment I can see the advantage.  It
immediately downloads and installs the required libraries as
advertised and builds an executable gpg2 in PLAY/inst/.  Unfortunately
for me I cannot then get it to perform its duty.  I execute the
suggested command
typed exactly as written above, and then nothing happens.  gpg2
continues to execute as the previously installed version.  Any ideas?
Ok, onward to the w32-installer.  Immediately I am stumped by the
simple requirement to put the source packages in ../tarballs.  I
admit, I am relatively new to Linux but can somebody give me a hint as
to what is meant by ../?  A simple command to create the required
directory would be very helpful.  Something I can copy and paste to

Phillip, if you are encrypting/decrypting or signing emails with gpg2
and having no problems with error messages then you don't need to put
in the command of step no. 2.  The symptoms of a hijacking is that
when gpg2 tries to put up a pinentry box gnome keyring hijacks the
process and puts up its own box.  Recent versions of gnupg-2.0.x will
then display an error message in the terminal and bad things happen.
Either you only get one attempt at changing passphrases or the whole
process crashes.  The process may succeed or not, it is unpredictable.
If you wish to witness it first hand I recommend using virtualbox.
Set up a fresh install of Ubuntu inside virtualbox (really easy and
fun) and then install Gnupg-2.1.0 without the command in step 2.  Then
try to generate a key, if you can.  The virtualbox environment is
perfect for experimenting with new beta versions and playing with ECC
keys and subkeys, without disturbing you regular production environment.

someone would be willing to lend a hand.
Joshua - If you are willing to give GnuPG modern (2.1.X) a go the
included Speedo method makes the compile process easy.  Here is the
entry I also posted on AskUbuntu:
1. sudo apt-get update
2. sudo apt-get install libldap2-dev gtk+-2 libbz2-dev
3. after unpacking the latest gnupg-2.1.X tarball and cd to the new
folder, run the command:
4. sudo make -f build-aux/speedo.mk native INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local
sudo ldconfig
5. download the latest pinentry-0.9.5, run ./configure && make && sudo
make install.
6. test it out:  gpg2 --version
I noticed your build attempt was on gnupg-2.0.X which unfortunately
does not have the speedo method included (that I could find) but if
you want to have the newest features including elliptic curve crypto
then 2.1 is the best!  Good Luck.  -Murphy

Specifically G13 and WKS tools are not supported.? Am I missing some
dependencies?? Preferably they should be available via 'sudo apt-get
install' since this is checked for in new compiles and not reinstalled.
The bash file works on a fresh install of Ubuntu 16.04, 17.10 and
Raspbian Stretch (for Raspberry Pi).? Any suggestions for improvements?

Thanks to all for the suggested improvements!!
One think I forgot to mention was to add the configuration:
nano ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry-gtk-2
This is required since pinentry is not compiled from source but
installed as an Ubuntu package.

Hi Dmitry - I haven't finished testing Werner's suggestions but this
will work on Ubuntu 16.04:
1.? create an empty file: gpg223.sh and cut, paste and save the following:
cd ~/Downloads
wget wget tar xf $version.tar.bz2
cd $version
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libldap2-dev
sudo apt-get install -y gtk+-2
sudo apt-get install -y rng-tools
sudo apt-get install -y libbz2-dev
sudo apt-get install -y zlib1g-dev
sudo apt-get install -y libgmp-dev
sudo apt-get install -y nettle-dev
sudo apt-get install -y libgnutls28-dev
sudo apt-get install -y libsqlite3-dev
sudo apt-get install -y adns-tools
sudo apt-get install -y libreadline-dev
sudo apt-get install -y qtbase5-dev
sudo apt-get install -y pinentry-gtk2
sudo apt-get install -y pcscd scdaemon
sudo make -f build-aux/speedo.mk INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local
speedo_pkg_gnupg_configure='--enable-g13 --enable-wks-tools' native
sudo ldconfig
2. run the above in the location you saved it: sudo bash gpg223.sh
3. after maybe 5-10 minutes it should complete the compilation, check
the install: gpg --version
4. create subdirectories (if necessary) with: gpg -K
5. use nano to create a configuration file: nano ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
6. add the line: pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry-gtk-2
7. save by ctrl-x, y, enter
One final note for 32 bit machines or operating systems (VM in 32 bit
mode or Raspberry Pi) I found the following change is needed:
1. sudo nano /etc/ld.so.conf
2. add as the first line:? include /etc/ld.so.conf.d/libc.conf
3. save
4. sudo ldconfig
Hope it works for you!

Note that the last lines of the bash file in my previous post didn't
print right (arrrgh, my attempt to clarify backfired).? It is probably
best to leave it as Werner hinted anyway:
sudo make -f build-aux/speedo.mk native INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local
sudo ldconfig

Thanks Robert and Werner.? Goal accomplished :)
OpenPGP:?? yes
S/MIME:??? yes
Agent:???? yes
Smartcard: yes (without internal CCID driver)
G13:?????? yes
Dirmngr:?? yes
Gpgtar:??? yes
WKS tools: yes
The deletion of adns-tools, libgmp-dev, nettle-dev and libgnutls28-dev
from my bash file resulted in a failure to find a suitable c/c++
compiler when using a new install of ubuntu.? I'm not sure which one
loaded the required compiler yet...or which compiler it is... but I'm
still looking (a new installation of Ubuntu for each change takes time
;-)? The pcscd and scdaemon was to enable the Yubikey smart card (per
their recommendation)? I will also try without the Ubuntu version of
scdaemon to see if it still works.
Thanks (I feel complete now)

@_subject: Complete Ubuntu compile of GnuPG 
Thanks to all for suggestions.? For a complete compile on a fresh
install of Ubuntu, I managed to get the bash file down to a minimum of:
cd ~/Downloads
wget wget tar xf $version.tar.bz2
cd $version
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libldap2-dev
sudo apt-get install -y gtk+-2
sudo apt-get install -y rng-tools
sudo apt-get install -y libbz2-dev
sudo apt-get install -y zlib1g-dev
sudo apt-get install -y libgnutls28-dev
sudo apt-get install -y libsqlite3-dev
sudo apt-get install -y libreadline-dev
sudo apt-get install -y pinentry-gtk2
sudo apt-get install -y pcscd scdaemon
sudo make -f build-aux/speedo.mk INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local \
? speedo_pkg_gnupg_configure='--enable-g13 \
? --enable-wks-tools' native
sudo ldconfig
Without the libgnutls28-dev install Ubuntu is without a suitable
compiler or even the make command.? This installs make, gcc+-7 and
probably lots of unnecessary stuff but at least it is a one-liner.? For
the Yubikey smart card the Ubuntu package scdaemon seems to be required
as gpg --card-edit complains and fails if it is not included in the
ubuntu installation list.? This bash file has the advantage of using
only Ubuntu packages and speedo, so the only update change needed is
changing a single digit in version=gnupg-2.2.3 for the near future
upgrades.? No unnecessary repeat compiles are done since pinentry is a
package, although it is necessary to include the configuration file at
least once:
nano ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry-gtk-2
or the pinentry version of your choice (-gnome3, -qt, -tty, -x11,
-curses packages are all available for install and configure).
I'm sure this can be improved upon and I am eager to see if it can be
made even smaller and faster while keeping the convenience of changing a
single digit and renaming gpg223.sh to gpg224.sh.
Thanks - murphy

Yes, the permissions and gpg-agent.conf creation is a problem I would
like to find an easy way around.? As it turns out a fresh install of
ubuntu 16.04.3 already has /usr/bin/pinentry-gnome3 installed.? That,
plus the fact that libgnutls28-dev also installs a bunch of stuff on my
bash file means I can reduce it to:
cd ~/Downloads
wget wget tar xf $version.tar.bz2
cd $version
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libldap2-dev
sudo apt-get install -y gtk+-2
sudo apt-get install -y rng-tools
sudo apt-get install -y libbz2-dev
sudo apt-get install -y libgnutls28-dev
sudo apt-get install -y libsqlite3-dev
sudo apt-get install -y libreadline-dev
sudo apt-get install -y pcscd scdaemon
sudo make -f build-aux/speedo.mk INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local
speedo_pkg_gnupg_configure='--enable-g13 --enable-wks-tools
--with-pinentry-pgm=/usr/bin/pinentry-gnome3' native
sudo ldconfig
Of course the line "sudo make -f ... native" is all one line.? This
enables pinentry-gnome3 without having to do a separate creation of
gpg-agent.conf and the whole issue of permissions is avoided.? I would
like to thank Werner, Robert, and Phil for the very helpful suggestions.

@_subject: compilation error for libgpg-error-1.28 on armhf 
Hi - does anyone know how to force speedo to compile using
libgpg-error-1.27 for the latest version of GnuPG (2.2.5)?? I came
across a bug in libgpg-error-1.28 while using the speedo method on a
Raspberry Pi 3 running the latest 'Jessie' Raspbian:
function '_gpgrt_log_printhex':
error: incompatible type for argument 4 of '_gpgrt_logv_printhex'
???? _gpgrt_logv_printhex (buffer, length, NULL, NULL);
???????????????????????????????????????????????? ^~~~
note: expected 'va_list {aka __va_list}' but argument is of type 'void *'
?_gpgrt_logv_printhex (const void *buffer, size_t length,
This has been identified previously by dkg and is being worked:
 at lists.debian.org/msg1592390.html
As a work-around I found everything compiles nicely if libgpg-error-1.27
is used instead.? But then I cannot use the beloved speedo method!? Is
it possible to easily make speedo use v1.27?
Best Regards - Murphy

Hi Ajax - For what it is worth I put up a github bash file that should
build the latest version of gpg using the fabulous speedo method in a
Debian based environment.? I ran this yesterday and it works on Ubuntu
18.04 and the latest Raspbian Stretch (Raspberry Pi OS based on Stretch).
I also noticed that the database had not been updated and chose to wait
until it was found and corrected.? It happens sometimes.? I hope you
find this useful!

Hi Stefan - I don't know your use model but you can't beat a $5 USD Rapsberry Pi Zero V1.3 for a cheap offline platform that can compile and use GnuPG 2.2.15. murphy

@_subject: error msg from gpg 2.2.26 on Ubuntu 20.10 for raspberry pi 
Hello gnupg users - I came across a strange error message from GnuPG 2.2.26 using the raspberry pi 4 and the new Ubuntu 20.10 64 bit operating system for ARM. The GnuPG speedo compile went to completion without any problems. However after a reboot trying to bring up gpg gives:
 ? $ gpg --verbose --version
 ? gpg: symbol lookup error: gpg: undefined symbol: gpgrt_access, version GPG_ERROR_1.0
Interestingly this error does not show up in a regular compile of GnuPG 2.2.26 in the normal raspberry pi OS and also is not a problem in Ubuntu 20.04 on my regular AMD Ryzen 7 3800XT desktop. I have been afraid to test it on my laptop running Ubuntu 20.10 for fear of ruining the current version 2.2.25 which runs fine (that's why I always test on RPi first). I suspect (from googling similar errors) a problem with LD_LIBRARY_PATH, but have not found a solution. Anybody else out there try this and find a solution?
Happy Hollidays, Murphy

Hello again gnupg users - I found a solution to the problem. It is actually an old problem that cropped up for me on 32 bit machines that I didn't expect on the 64 bit Ubuntu 20.10 on the Raspberry pi.
$ sudo nano /etc/ld.so.conf
type in as the first line:
include /etc/ld.so.conf.d/libc.conf
save and then:
$ sudo ldconfig
And now gpg --version recognizes and runs GnuPG 2.2.26 without error msgs.? I hope this is of some use to other RPi Ubuntu users out there who like to use the newest version of GnuPG.
Cheers - Sandy (Murphy)

With a new version of raspbian out for the raspberry pi I'm having

Also when I try to download swdb.lst directly it fails with:

This seemed to work fine a couple of days ago - anybody know how I can
fix this?
