@_subject: Keyserver Software Recommendations 
I am setting up a keyserver for private, internal use in my company;  it will not synchronize with the global keyserver network.
All clients will be running the latest version of GnuPG distributed  through the Ubuntu Dapper repositories.
The servers (there will be multiple, and will need to be  synchronized) will be running Debian Sarge.
I'm having trouble figuring out which keyserver to install.
OpenPGP Public Key Server  is easy to  install and configure, but hasn't been updated in three years.
This message  from 2005 recommends SKS. I've attempted to  install SKS, and had some issues, but haven't gone all-out in  installing it. Should I make the effort?
A year later, is SKS still the most-recommended keyserver software?
Thanks very much!
