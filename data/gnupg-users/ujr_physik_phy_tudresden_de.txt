(please Cc: me for replies, I did not want to subscribe to another
 list because of this single bug(?) report - according to  this is possible - thanks!)
 I compile gnupg 1.0.2 successfully on IBM AIX 3.2.5 using
./configure --enable-static-rnd=none --with-included-gettext \
            --with-included-zlib --disable-nls --enable-m-guard --prefix=$HOME
make install
 I copied my keys from a Linux system, but my password is not accepted
 when I want to sign files. On Win98 with the supplied binary from
  signing works fine with the very same keys.
 Is there any known issue on AIX?
  Ulf
P.S.: AFAICT, gcc was used.
