@_subject: How to verify the file was successfully encrypted... 
Why do you need to use gpg for this task when you only need a symmetric
cipher. You would be better off going to CPAN (perl) and download AES
(Advanced Encryption Standard) module and use all of the features coming
with it or use libcrypt (used by gnupg) and use this. The other
solution, I can think off (if you use linux), is making encrypted pseudo
file system (file) of requested size (size of CD/DVD or other backup
medium) and copy the data on this file system (it is transparent). When
you finis this move the pseudo file system (file) to your backup medium. Regards Martin Poz

@_subject: sign and encrypt 
I have seen in the spec rfc3156 that a message should be signed and
then encrypted, but hypothetically if send a message to someone I do
not like and sign it and then encrypt it he/she can forward it to
someone else pretending that the message was originally from my self.
Is there anything I have missed in spec or in gnupg to forbid this?
Thank in advance

@_subject: GnuPG internals 
I have found on the Internet that Mr. Koch gave a speech about gnupg
internals and I would be very interested if any documents exist about
this presentation or in any other doc about gnupg internals. I know that
the source code is the best internal docs but I need a very quick
overview. Thanks in advance and best regards Martin.

Yes, I meant this. I can thing of other solutions as s-e-s or
signing the header of email messages in separate mime part, but it would
consume cpu, as you would not be able to sign a message and simply
encrypt it n-times  with recipients keys. So the best way around this
problem is to educate users. Thanks for your comment Martin

Sorry to bother, but are there any differences between gpg and gpgsm
apps. The only difference I can see is the supported standards
(OpenPGP, S/MIME). Should I see gpgsm as a supplement to gpg and
pre-version for gpg2, which is the version with both standards
Thanks in advance

Can I say about gnupg that is modular? If yes, does exist a map of the
modules?  Thanks in advance Martin

@_subject: GnuPG modules 
Dear all,
I have found a very nice picture of project Agypten(I am missing gnupg).
This made me thing about gnupg modular approach. So, I would like to ask
you for revision of my thoughts. Gnupg is a modular application composed
of a crypto module based on libcrypt(independent development), a
compression module, a key management module, a communication module
(managing HKP, etc.). This model is easy to be extended in any of the
arrays of this model. For instance adding new crypto alg. without
disturbing other parts of the app(apart of utilitization of this new
feature). Above all, Gnupg is used as a background by gpgME, which
should be used as the preferred way of communication with the app by
another program. Have I forgotten anything. Thanks in advance for your comments. Best regards
