@_subject: Python Bindings for GPGME 
Hello all,
I'm looking to write a GUI around the existing philosophy-of-use of
EasyGnuPG ( as part of my GSoC project
this summers. I was therefore looking to find the best ways to wrap GnuPG
from Python scripts rather than using outputs from gpg2 binary. I see there
are two principal bindings available PyMe and PyGPGME.
Both seem to be relatively un-maintained for the past few years now (2008
for PyMe and 2012 for PyGPGME):
Some of the features I'd like to be working with are:
1. Encrypting/Decrypting files. Decryption done using user's default
2. Listing keys and encryption sub-keys.
3. Maintaining contacts
4. Generating new keys
So, my question is - has anyone worked with Python and GPGME? Which
bindings are better in your opinion?
