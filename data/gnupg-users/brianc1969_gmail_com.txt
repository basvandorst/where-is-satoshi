I can answer why the passphrase is needed: You are using the -s option
which tells gpg to sign the file, which requires your private key.

@_subject: gpg encrypt always creates a new encrypted file 
Writing over the original file as "gpg -encrypt foo && mv foo.gpg foo"
would do will also :potentially: leave remnants of the original
unencrypted file around. The encrypted file will most likely be smaller
(if plain text) than the original, thus not as many blocks may be
used... also, I don't think a file system would ensure the :same: blocks
will be used, so writing over the original file may not actually
overwrite the original at all.
I would suggest after creating the encrypted file, use a command such as
"wipe" to securely delete the original file rather than trying to
overwrite it.
