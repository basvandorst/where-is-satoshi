I know that it's possible to remove the comment line from
ciphertext via the command line:
--comment ''
... but is it possible to remove the comment line via the
options file?

I originally tried no-comment in the options file but it
doesn't actually work, that's why I was asking about it.
After some trial and error I came up with the solution:
comment ""
... single quotes don't work - go figure.
