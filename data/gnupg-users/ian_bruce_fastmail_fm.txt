@_subject: exporting secret keys 
I recently wanted to move an ElGamal/DSA keypair to another machine. I
used the "--export-secret-keys" option to write a keyfile. After
importing the key on the other machine, it appeared that only the secret
key had been transferred, but not the public key. I have a few questions
about this.

It appears to me that there is some mutual misunderstanding involved in
this conversation. As far as I understand, the situation is as follows:
The human user is physically seated in front of his own laptop computer,
on which is stored his GPG secret key. There is an SSH session
connecting that laptop to a remote Sun computer. The mail client is
running on the Sun machine, with its console I/O tunnelled over SSH to a
terminal process running on the laptop. It is proposed that when the
mail client sends a message, it will first provide the message text to a
script running on the laptop, using the same SSH session. That script
will then prompt the human user for the GPG passphrase, sign the message
text, and return it to the mail client on the Sun. The message will then
be sent using the normal SMTP protocols.
As far as security is concerned, the important point is that neither the
GPG key nor passphrase will ever leave the laptop. They are entirely
separate from the SSH key. If the Sun machine or the SSH session are
compromised, the worst that can happen is that the human user will be
tricked into signing a bogus message.
Is that about right?
Assuming that it is, I have to ask why you wouldn't just run the mail
client on the laptop and avoid all the extra complication. You can then
either tunnel the IMAP and SMTP connections over SSH or just use
IMAP/SSL and SMTP/SSL directly.
