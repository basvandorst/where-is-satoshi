@_subject: Key signing parties 
are there some mailing list / blog / ..others.. where are mentioned key signing parties ?
I expected to find something at
but it seems this site does not contain any info about such parties.
Thanks for attention.

Thanks David.
Indeed good website to find people in nearest area.
However can their Key Exchange Service be considered as 'acceptable' as it allows key signing without physical meeting with respective ID approval ? Or should this service simply be avoided ?

@_subject: Keyserver refresh period after gpg --send-keys 
I updated the expiration (via gpg --edit-key using expire option) of my key and (re)sended it to a keyserver (via gpg --send-keys [my key id]) to keyserver subkeys.pgp.net.
However key is still not updated after few hours.
What are normal delays ?

Well, I still cannot see any refresh of my keys...sent 4 days ago.
Should I try again ?

is it possible to change 'comment' attribute, ie. via gpg options like --comment  [string] or --no-comments ?

@_subject: Keyserver refresh period after gpg --send-keys 
it seems to works better now but all changes are not reflected.
Via 'gpg --list-key' I'm able to modify keys expiration, add / remove uid and delete uneeded signatures. Save and list reflect my changes.
However, after export, only new expiration and uid are present, other removed items are still present.
How to export all the changes ?
Thanks for attention.

@_subject: decrypt and secret key location 
I received an encrypted file called 'test.asc' (recipient is correct, hereafter it is truncated) but trying to decrypt it I have following error :
gpg --decrypt test.asc
gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit ELG-E key, ID 0CC897B5, created 2006-06-11
      "Bruno Costacurta "
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
Is it only key location?
If so, how / where can I indicate my private key location ?
If not, what type of problem ?
Many thanks for help,
Bruno Costacurta

I'm not able to decrpyt message as I received hereafter message about using subkey instead of primary key. Is this correct ? Could it be the problem relies on the usage of this subkey ?
If yes, how to manage my keyring regarding this subkey (which is obviously used for en/decrypting not for signing) to be able to decrypt ?

Sorry but indeed I have the secret key for 0x2E604D51 and it's valid (I just installed my gpg keyrings on a new computer and use it for signing).
The 0CC897B5 is a subkey and was created automatically with 0x2E604D5 creation and never ask specific password.

Hello Charly,
thanks for your attention and help
Unfortunately I cannot decrypt your test message : gpg --decrypt charly.asc

gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
Is there a way to modify subkey attributes, eg.  adding decryption capabilities. If not, can I'll create a new subket with correct attributes. Considering I (probably) already lost (mean: cannot decypt) received encrypted message but will be able to use future messages encrypted with the new correct subkey.

@_subject: decrypt : primary key or subkey ? 
Hello David,
(note: I'm able to revoke this subkey (done but not sent to keyserver yet)).
The problem is that subkey comes alone and automatically when keypair is generated (and related keyring created).
During creation there is only one password required which is linked to the primary key. My secret key and related password are OK.
Where in this process is the secret part (and related password) of subkey specified ?
How to specify correct attributes for subkey like encrypt & decrypt ?

@_author: Bruno Costacurta 
@_subject: decrypt : primary key or subkey ? 
(sorry for delays. I was off and abroad).
Correct. But at least the revoked key will not be used anymore for future encryption I cannot decrypt. And future sender will use a valid encryption / decyption setup.

@_subject: decrypt : primary key or subkey ? 
(sorry for delays. I was off and abroad).
I simply revoked the subkey Elgamal and sent update to keyserver.
Looks like now this is reflected and so I do not (currently) have any key for encryption. This what I intended to do as I was not able to decrypt.
Later I'll created a new subkey and update it the same way (after verification of correct encrypt/decrypt behaviour).
I think that the problem came few months ago : as I changed computer I exported secret key only,  but not secret-subkey. And so I installed the keyring but without secret part of my subkey on my current computer. Question: An export-secret should be followed by a export-secret-subkey ?
Correct ?

@_subject: decrypt : primary key or subkey ? 
Humm...so I can definitely not explain why my subkey was unable to decrypt  message as secret key was not found. Remind: signature validation works fine.
Anyway this not-working key is now revoked...
...and now what is the best way to create / add a new subkey with encryption / decryption capabilities (under Linux) ?

@_subject: 'export-secret-subkeys' between 2 computers 
Hello to all,
I work on two computer and, as I created a new subkey on the first (test on this new key are OK) I'm trying to export this new secret subkey to the second computer (keyring and main secret key already present on it) 'gpg --export-secret-subkey > myfile' on computer A
'gpg --import myfile' on B
However subkjey doesn't appear on B and indeed I cannot decrypt on B (but works on A) as secret is not found.
(sorry do not have more log yet as currently present on A)
Are my commands correct ?
Or is there something specific to do to update / exported secret subkey between two computers ?
