@_subject: certified with a trusted signature 
this means that the signature on the server might have been generated by me and uploaded by me of the person that you are recieveing mail from
to prevent this from happening the keys are signed by the owner and some trusted party known as the introducer since there is no link between the sender and the reciever the signature will show the mesg that you are seeing !

i use gnupg with mutt. Mutt automatically downloads pubkeys from a
keyserver to verify a signature if the pubkey isn't yet in my keyring.
But everytime a sig is checked i get following output:
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!               gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the \
what does that mean? Many of the keys of which this happens are signed
by many people.
When verifying my own mails this message doesn't appear.
