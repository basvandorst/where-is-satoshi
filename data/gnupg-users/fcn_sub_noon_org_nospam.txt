@_subject: GnuPG 1.0.6 patch for Cygwin 
To whom it may concern,
I've a patch for GnuPG 1.0.6 to allow it to compile on MS Windows
using Cygwin.  Some stats:
This patch alters GnuPG 1.0.6 to compile cleanly under Cygwin.  It
uses /dev/random ("rndlinux"), but does not support dynamic loading.
The tiger module is statically linked.
Tested under Cygwin 1.3.2 on Windows 2000 SP2.
Fails 3 of 25 "make check" tests:
  encryptp.test
  armencryptp.test
  multisig.test
Note: Uses pagable (insecure) memory.

Thanks; evaluating the Cygwin /dev/random output was on my "to do"
list.  I would have thought it could be implemented as well as rndw32
or egd; perhaps it will be improved in the future.
Yeah, I was wondering about why one would use it; but "it was there,"
so what the hell.
Evaluating the failures is also on my "to do" list.
Thanks for the comments!
