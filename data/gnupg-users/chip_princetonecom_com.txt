If you're writing in Tcl, why not something like this:
    if  [ catch { exec gpg --batch --passphrase-fd 0 \
                      --output ${dst} --decrypt ${src} \
                      << "${passphrase}\n"} foo ] {
        send_user "${foo}\n"
        }

@_subject: insecure memory warning on Solaris 2.6 
I've just built a Solaris 2.6 SPARC pkg for gnupg, built with gcc 2.95.2, make 3.76.1, on a E250.  Installed on the E250, 2 3500s, 1 E450.  gpg installed suid-root.  On the E450 I get even when running as root.  Not so on any of the other machines.  Any ideas where to look for the cause?
