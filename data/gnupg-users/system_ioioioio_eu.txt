@_subject: gpg-rsa-key decryption with a mobile 
"Here, we describe a new acoustic cryptanalysis key extraction attack, applicable to GnuPG's current implementation of RSA. The attack can extract full 4096-bit RSA decryption keys from laptop computers (of various models), within an hour, using the sound generated by the computer during the decryption of some chosen ciphertexts."

@_subject: gnu-pg mechanics 
dear group-members,
due to the necessity keeping user data save, iam working secondarily on the mechanic to implement such behaviour (gnupg) to a service, iam currently working on.
iam still using sha3.keccak to build hashes in the frontend with compiled javascript ( with google window toolkit ), but as ive read, the keccak-algorithm is still not save to be enough. i was wondering, why they didnt implemented larger hashes then 224/256 bit within that logic, i was expecting something like 2k or 4k at least, beside performance aspects, but my brain is obviously to small to enhance the keccak saveley to a larger keylength.
anyhow. hashing the password is a one-way solution, but i want to encrypt/decrypt the whole communication between the browser-frontend and the server-remote-procedure call with something like gnupg, but to be honest, my knowledge in math and stuff like that is to poor to do it on my own. i wont build shity services, just claiming buzzwords, so my question is:
is there a documentation regarding that topic?/
to make it clear, iam using java as domain language, as i had excellent results, using these technology. one will smile about it at and bring some prejudice into that talking, but dont be afraid, iam working with a stop-watch during the development. as reward, i would build a small search engine to index the papers on the site with nosql techniques. another topic would be, to serve a open-source-framework with these results on github or somewhere else.
i know, its a huge workload to bring such idea to life, but as i droped a lot of time into that project, these forecase would make it for me, to ensure the service to any other ( customer ).
thanks in advance and TGIF

consider *cydia* for jailbreak/iphone, as it uses apt-get routines to deliver software somehow. that could help understanding the mechanics behind the itunes/wall. some sort of software is prohibited for/from apple, so check usage of encryption software as well on us.import/export rules as well to safe energy for this project.
a browser based piece of software would be more in the focus, i mentioned some weeks ago.
anyhow, good luck with xcode ( dev. enviroment for iphone/ios )

@_subject: fulldisc encryption 
dear mailinglist,
as truecrypt gave up developing the software any further, the question raised up, how to encrypt the full disc with gnupg. i looked into the web and found something like
but iam not pretty sure, if its the best way / best practise to do so. any suggestions ?
