@_subject: 1.4.10rc1 and v2 OpenPGP cards/3072 bit keys 
I have successfully created 2048 bit RSA keys with a v2 OpenPGP card
from kernelconcepts, using an SCM SCR-335 reader. I have no problems
with signing, verification and encrypting & decrypting.
However, I cannot decrypt a message encrypted with a 3072b key, also
generated on-card. I'm 100% sure I'm entering a correct PIN but still
1.4.10rc1 gives me
gpg: public key decryption failed: general error
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
in the end. It works flawlessly with a 2048 bit key.
I'm using 1.4.10rc1 from here
I've attached complete --debug-all sessions for both 2048 and 3072 keys.
 I'd be happy to provide more information if it's needed but I'd need
some hints for what to do next.
