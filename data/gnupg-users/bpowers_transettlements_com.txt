@_subject: Batch mode and PassPhrase problems 
I have downloaded the GNUPG version for WIndows NT and I need to be able to
run it in a batch mode in a production environment where no prompts are
popped up.  I see that there is a batch command but it doesn't seem to work:
 <<...>> I saw the other comment about using the passphrase-fd n command and I have
not had any luck with it either.  I was basically trying to find some
documentation that explained how to install and run these commands.  I found
some documentation but it would start talking about Linux commands and ways
of doing things.
If you could assist in helping me I would be greatly appreciated.
