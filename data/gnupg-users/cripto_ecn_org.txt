@_subject: mobile GPG installation 
I have read about a project that built a Java-only SSH client which can be
run from any (Java-enabled) browser, with nothing to install on the
local computer. Look around for anything similar for OpenPGP...

Assuming text-only communications:
Attachments could be encrypted/decrypted locally (ie. copies on hard
disk) before/after sending/receiving.

'Becky2' supports PGP/MIME (by means of plugin) just fine.

@_subject: anything like a --target-directory option? 
`gpg path/to/foo.gpg` decrypts to path/to/foo
`gpg -d path/to/foo.gpg >target/path/foo` decrypts to the specified
`gpg --multifile path/to/foo1.gpg path/to/foo2.gpg ...`  puts all the
decrypted files in path/to/
Is there any way to "bulk-decrypt" a bunch of files to one specified
target directory?
