Hash: SHA1
Ol? Pessoal!
Eu gerei um par de chaves em meu Gnupg..... depois eu as exportei com
gpg -a --export-secret-keys 3a1386c7 >secretkey.asc
e em outro Comnputador
gpg --import secretkey.asc
por?m o Gnupg n?o  lista as minhas chaves quando digito o comando
~ gpg --list-keys
Eu estou fazendo corretamente  ??
Estou usando isso no windows!

Hello, I am thinking about creating a community of GNUPG here in Brazil,
because here he is little used and little known.
I would like to know the e-mail of Projeto GNupg's founders and where I
can seek help and support for this community's creation.
Observation: Excuse me for English, I am using a translator.
