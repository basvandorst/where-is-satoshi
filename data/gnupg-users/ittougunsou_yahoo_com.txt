@_subject: Converting from Pgp 6.5.8ckt 
Hi All,
I'm fairly new to using GnuPG but have years
experience using PGP versions 2.6 and 5 thru 6.x.  I'm trying to move completely over to GnuPG from Pgp.  I have three questions I hope to get answered.  1.  How may I transfer my pgp version keys, both private and public to GnuPG?  I have tried exporting from PGP the public and private keys but am unable to import them to GnuPG.  2.  I have gererated a GnuPG key pair with the
correct RIJNDAEL253 command in the options file.
How do I verify the cypher?  When I export the public key and import it to PGP 6.5.8ckt, it reads as an
 AES-128 key. 3.  Is there a GnuPG compiled to DOS which contains
the IDEA cypher?  I would like to use my existing RSA
 key pair originally generated on PGP 2.6.
Well thats about it...I'm looking forward using GnuPG
on a consistant basis.  I love the idea of a standard
rather than having one company (NAI) determine worldwide
standard.  I'm using GnuPGshell and find it is a GREAT help!

Thank you Karol for your help with the "IDEA" enabled version of
GnuPG. It seems to have cured the problems I was having with
the (Ming32-Dec22,2000 compiled version.  I was getting
the "memory not secure" prompt with that version as well.  Even
though I negated it in the options file.  Everything works cool
I was able to import all of my PGP key pairs into the GnuPG
keyring. Keypairs made with CAST, IDEA, and AES-253 using PGP
5.6.8ckt and 2.6.2 have imported and work well.  Still searching for a way of verifying the cipher used to create
these keys.

Hello all,
Just for the heck of it I tried to import my GnuPG Key pair into
the freeware version of PGP 8.0.  All seems OK until I attempt
to encrypt. The program complains of a bad passphrase.  Any idea
why this happens?  Doug R.

Hello All,
Sorry about that.  I found the answer in the ARChives.  Make the
password blank prior to exporting.  BTW, I like PGP for
home/personel use and MUST use Open Source for work.  I want to
use the same KeyPair for both.
