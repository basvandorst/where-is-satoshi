I am coordinating work on the GnuPG documentation, including the user manual.
The documentation project URL is - From there is a link to the current user manual draft.  We intend to
package this user manual with the GnuPG 1.0 release.
This documentation has only been seen by a couple of people.  I am
therefore very much interested in feedback so I can make revisions before
GnuPG 1.0 is released.  Factual errors need to be corrected in particular,
but regardless, please send any comments or suggestions you may have.

Hash: SHA1
Several people have given some good feedback on the manual.  Thanks!
Some people have asked for the DocBook source.  I've added the source of
the current snapshot to the web page as well as updated the corresponding
HTML and postscript.
Others have commented on the badly-formatted graph in Figure 3-1.
I agree, it's bad!  I would like the figure redone in xfig, but I use
xfig rarely, and it always takes me a while to figure out how to use it.
If someone proficient could redo the diagram and mail me the xfig file
for it, I can take care of getting it converted to a format that I can
include on the web pages.

Hash: SHA1
Have a look at the GnuPG user manual for a discussion about this.
To summarize, you cannot get rid of old email addresses unless you
have the cooperation of everybody who has a copy of your public key.
The best you can do is revoke your self-signature on the user IDs you
want to discard.  This does not invalidate the key but should discourage
correspondents from using the user ID to identify you.
The user manual elaborates on why this is the rules of the game, but
I certainly sympathize with your wish to have a "clean" key.  It just
doesn't work that way I'm afraid.
I am trying to collect scenarios of how people manage their keys and use
GnuPG depending on their security needs.  I want to use such concrete
examples in subsequent revision of the manual.  If anybody out there
wants to contribute, please submit.
Blatant plug to all on the list: if you have not checked the documentation
project page since you downloaded GnuPG 1.0, there have been additions
to the manual in which you may be interested.

@_subject: Key revoking 
Hash: SHA1
Yes, it explains how to generate the revocation certificate but not
when to or the consequences of applying the certificate.  I've put
this on the todo list.
It is the certificate.
If you import it, and the public key that it revokes is on your keyring,
your copy of the public key will be revoked.
When you sign, you use your private key, and that is not what gets
revoked.  So yes, nothing stops the bad guy from forging messages if he
can bypass the encryption protecting your private key.
When the public key is revoked using the revocation certificate, however,
then signatures made *after* the revocation will be flagged as invalid
when checked against the revoked public key.  Signatures made before
the revocation will be checked normally.
Typically, you revoke your own copy of your public key using your
revocation certificate and then distribute the revoked public key as
best you can.  The problem is distributing your revoked public key fast
enough and far enough.  A bad guy could fool your friends before your
friends get a copy of the revoked public key.
It's a social key management problem.

The wording being quoted by Horacio comes directly from the gpg manual page.
If someone could post a clarification, in terms of the algorithms being

fix both the English and Spanish versions once and for all.
