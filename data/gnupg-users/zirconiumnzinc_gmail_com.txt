@_subject: Displaying signature algorithms when doing --check-sigs, disabling 
Is there a way to display hash algorithms along with public key
algoritms (and its lenght) of signatures when issuing "--check-sigs"
(or check in the "--edit-key" shell)?
I also would like to know if there is a way to force that GPG will not
accept signatures made with a certain hash or public key algorithms,
when calculating validity of keys trough web of trust?  In the case of
public key it should be possible to specify key length.
I didnt have luck finding answers to my questions in documentation,
only a partial solution to my second question:
There is an option "disable-pubkey-algo" that will totally disable
choosen public key algoritm, however it only works after doing
--check-trustdb with that option, otherwise it still accepts key
signatures (certifications) made with disabled algorithm, as a valid
signatures (for example when calculating key validity, or when doing
"--check-sigs"). It can create problems when changing from
"trust-model pgp" to "trust-model direct", beacuse as GPG says, there
is "no need for a trustdb check with `direct' trust model". But is
that really true that that there is no need for trustdb check? Im not
sure, but GPG doesnt allow that.
So while "disable-pubkey-algo" can be used to disable signatures made
with certain public key algorithm when calculating validity of keys
trough web of trust, there is no way to specify key length. Also there
is no such option for hash algorithms. No "disable-hash-algo" or
"disable-cert-digest-algo" or anything like that.
Could you point me to specific portions of documentation?
Thanks for help

Hi again
I have problems with finding that message with search engine. Do you
remember when that disscusion took place? At least the year?

Thanks ?Jerome.
"GnuPG supports reading a trust "map" generated by an external process
that can use whatever trust rules it likes."
This requires another piece of software (or programming skills). I
don't know of any software that does this, and i lack programming
skills. So this solution is not for me :(
I'm not a cryptographer, however I think that those issues are
serious, because as we know, algorithms that are now considered
secure, will probably become broken one day. While this most likely is
not going to happen overnight, suddenly and unexpectedly, it could be
still good for users to enforce their policy regarding minimal
strenght of algorithms accepted by their web or trust., or if person
is using "direct" trust model, it could be useful when person is doing
--check-sigs (or check in the --edit-key shell), to display
signatures, along with their algorithms, and signers key/uid validity,
to have enough confidence when setting validity of keys/uids signed by
other people. Of course new versions of GnuPG could enforce minimal
strength of algorithms, however it doesn't allow users to decide about
confidence/security level, so in my opinion GnuPG should only set sane
defaults. Also it will allow someone who ?is still using older version
of GnuPG for some reason (like older packages in distributions
repository) to use strong enough algorithms to verify authenticity of
new software.
Should i crosspost the first message of this thread and this one to
gnupg-devel? Or maybe i should contact Mr. Koch directly?
Werner if you read this thread please reply. Thanks.
