I read recently about Elliptic Curve Cryptography and how it provides much stronger security with much smaller public key sizes.
Does anybody know if Public Key Crypto has any plans to move to this with an update to the standard?

So will it be possible for me to generate an ECC key when the beta becomes stable? I use S/MIME for everything when I use GPG with Enigmail. Seems like I should create an ECC key and start using that. Will the manual be updated with the commands for creating an ECC key?

@_subject: why is SHA1 used? How do I get SHA256 to be used? 
Here's the result of ShowPRef for my key:
Cipher: AES256, AES192, AES, CAST5, 3DES
     Digest: SHA256, SHA1, SHA384, SHA512, SHA224
     Compression: ZLIB, BZIP2, ZIP, Uncompressed
SHA1 is showing up second. So when I sign a message, why isn't SHA256 used? The headers on my emails appear to show SHA1 as the hash being used.
I no longer consider SHA1 secure. Neither does the U.S. Government. So I don't want it to be the default hash being used.
How do I get SHA256 to be the default hash used when I sign emails and encrypt them?

Yeah, there's still people on Internet Explorer 6 & 7 too and they cause all kinds of problems for web developers. If people using really old versions can't read something, that's really their burden to update their software. SHA1 is no longer secure. I'm not going to cater to people using really old versions, especially when security is involved.

My feelings as well.
SHA-1 is considered cryptographically broken.  It does not provide the
level of security it claims.  Practically, collisions can be generated
for 75 of the 80 rounds[0].  I hardly consider an algorithm this close
to a collision "just fine".  There's no need to run screaming to the
exits, but a quick and orderly transition has been appropriate for some
time.  The time to move to something else is ending soon.
I don't generate signatures with algorithms I consider insecure because
that leads to people being able to forge signatures in my name.  If I
use MD5, even for one message, that allows a moderately determined
attacker to replay that signature on what is likely to become a fairly
large set of messages.  I'd rather avoid that, thank you.
The question is, will GnuPG fall back to SHA-1 if it's not in my digest
preferences?  I'd much rather fail to generate a signature than generate
one using an algorithm which is very weak.

What is the difference between "personal-digest-preferences" AND "default-preference-list"
My understanding is that "default-preference-list" will define what is used for new key generation. Based on what I recently read in this mailing list, "default-preference-list" also defines the "showpref" command,
which other users can see on my public key to know my preferences. Assuming this is all correct:
what does "personal-digest-preferences" do?

@_author: Sam Smith 
@_subject: cert-digest-algo clarification 
It's overriding the recipient key preferences. So "default-preference-list" is embedded into the public key to tell others your preferences. But if I set a string for "personal-digest-preferences" then this string will override the "default-preference-list" that the other user set in his public key?
This is not clear. Say I want to tell everyone, "Hey, I prefer you use SHA256 when communicating with me." What command should I use to communicate this? "default-preference-list" right?
So "personal-digest-preferences" overrides this?
Am Do 12.07.2012, 11:27:03 schrieb Sam Smith:
Why don't you simply have a look at the documentation?
--personal-digest-preferences string
Set the list of personal digest preferences to string.  Use gpg2 --version to get a list of available algorithms, and use none to set no  preference at all.  This allows the user to safely override the algorithm chosen by the recipient key preferences, as GPG will only select an algorithm that is usable by all recipients.  The most highly ranked digest algorithm in this list is also used when signing without encryption  (e.g.  --clearsign  or --sign).

The "setpref" and "showpref" commands appear to only relate to what is stipulated with the "default-preference-list".
Setpref just resorts back to the "default" settings if "default-preference-list" is not given. So if one sets "default-preference-list" it's not necessary to set "personal-digest-preferences", right? I mean how are "personal-digest-preferences" even seen by others if SETPREF does not embed them in the key?

Yes. Overrides the order (but cannot make missing elements available).
 This information is (or rather can be) embedded in a key. Either by default-preference-list being defined at the creation time of the key or by --edit-key setpref.
Have you read the documentation about --default-preference-list?
--default-preference-list string
Set the list of default preferences to string. This preference list is used for new keys and becomes the default for "setpref" in the edit menu.
I don't find that unclear.
The personal-digest-preferences setting in the configuration of *other* users may override the setting you may have made in your key. Your personal-digest-
preferences setting is irrelevant for the signatures of others.
You should read the documentation for the commands showpref and setpref, try them (in combination with --default-preference-list) and see what happens.

Thanks everyone for all you help explaining. I really appreciate it. Although Hauke did get a bit mean. And Hauke: I did read ALL the documentation (printed it off)--prior to sending out the first question. I read several different pieces of documentation over the preceding days prior to emailing here. I also read Q&A stuff online. And I'm not stupid.
A big thanks to Nick for helping me finally to understand exactly what lists are being compared. Here's what I understand, hopefully I got it right this time:
1) the setpref command will embed this list into the public key so that the list is viewable by others
2) the highest preference listed in each category is used to generate new keys with
personal-digest-preferences AND personal-cipher-preferences AND personal-compress-preferences
1) these lists are used to find a "best fit" by comparing what's in them to the other person's default-preferences-list. Seeks to match highest preference of both parties. (this is what was confusing to me--at first, I thought the default-preferences-list of both parties would be compared.)
2) the highest preference listed is used for --symmetric encryption

Stop trying to understand it from reading, you obvously have problems with that. Take two keys, give them different preferences, make encrypted signatures with different settings of personal-digest-preferences and have a look at the results.

Yes, someone can export my secret key from my computer and then they can import my secret key into their computer. But to actually sign anything with my secret key they will have to know the password. This is great. So I see now that even if they can export and import my key they cannot use it.

This makes it a trivial task to steal someone's secret key. All that's needed is access to the machine for a few seconds when no one is looking. I am not technically know-how enough to configure SELinux or app-armor. Does this mean there is no way to safeguard the Secret Key, other than the obvious of not letting anyone use my user-account? or is there any security measures that you guys use to protect secret key from being exported by someone else?

David, I downloaded the GnuPG program. I then ran --verify and was told that the key was signed with 0x4F25E3B6 key. I download 0x4F25E3B6 key from a key server and then asked people on this mailing list to confirm that I downloaded a legit key. Several people on this mailing list confirmed the fingerprint of this key as a legit key. I then marked the key as trusted because I verified the fingerprint. I then gpg --verify the gnupg program and got a Good Signature. Of course it would be good to meet Werner and look at his passport and all this nonsense. But that is ridiculous because it's never going to happen. I read the GnuPG manual and what I did is what the manual describes as good practice. What you describe is just nonsense. Yes, it is truly secure and everything but you know completely impractical, so why did you even write it?
My question was an honest one and made in good faith about trying to learn and be humble that I don't know everything. But I struggle to find what can be learned from your email. I did follow your link to the posted public key. However I had already downloaded from a keyserver the key that was identified as being the one that signed the gnupg program (0x4F25E3B6). And others verified the fingerprint. So do I still need to download the key that you posted a link to, aren't they the same key???? Strangely, before I downloaded key 0x4F25E3B6, I searched the website looking for a public key to download but did not find the link that you provided.

@_author: Sam Smith 
@_subject: can someone verify the gnupg Fingerprint for pubkey? 
Okay. So please let me know if I understand correctly what I am supposed to do (or what you guys are recommending be done) with key signing:
I downloaded the GnuPG program and ran gpg --verify. I am told the keyID that signed the program. I download that KeyID from a keyserver. I now ask people on this list to verify the fingerprint of the key I got from the keyserver as a legit key. (So far this behavior is okay, right)? Since people on this list verified the fingerprint, I have enough confidence to verify the GnuPG program with the key. BUT I do not have enough confidence to mark the key (the one I got from the keyserver) as Trusted or to Sign the key because I have not met with Werner Koch in person and seen credentials. Summation of Proper Key Signing Behavior: 1.) I should NOT sign a key as trusted unless I have actually met with the person and seen his/her credentials. I can sign if I KNOW the person and verify the fingerprint with that person. But even these situations run the risk of dealing with a "secret agent."
Applying this rule, since I have not met Werner Koch, I should not sign his key. Verifying the fingerprint on a downloaded key is enough to use the key to verify software, but it's not enough to actually trust and sign the key. Hence using it to verify runs some risk because the key is not totally trustworthy.
Every time I use Werner Koch's key to verify a GnuPG program, I will get the warning that I am verifying with an untrusted key. You guys all get this warning because all of you are also not signing keys (even if you've verified the fingerprint with others) because you have not met with all the people needed in order to sign all the keys you have. Right? You guys all get this warning whenever you "gpg --verify", right?
In short, I should always be seeing the notice that I have verified using an untrusted key when using Werner Koch's key unless/until I actually meet him and see credentials. The only time you guys don't see this notice when verifying a key is when you use a key that you have actually met the signer of face to face, right?
Do I understand correctly. Is this all accurate? With this behavior, would I be doing Best Practices and what you guys all do?

I have to agree with Peter. I mean, everyone has to trust someone/something at some point. I mean you trust Windows OS or your Linux Distro that it is not doing bad things. It is calling up all these APIs etc. Have your verified everything your OS does? Have your verified every signing key used by your Distro or Windows certificate?
At some point you have to trust the integrity of something. And this trust is never going to be perfect. There should be caution and if you want assurance you should check sources. This was what I was trying to do by asking this list. I asked this list after I had already looked other places to verify the fingerprint.
If absolute trust was sought for everything, nobody would ever be able to do anything because so few things would be trusted enough to move forward on anything.

I tried every GUI I could find for GPG over the past 2 years. My absolute favorite is GNU Privacy Assistant (GPA). I do believe I have tried every GUI option there is for Windows and Ubuntu. Originally, I couldn't find anything I liked on Windows and consequently was forced to learn the command line (which is probably not a bad thing). Later, on Ubuntu I discovered GPA and Seahorse. Seahorse is good app, but GPA is much much better IMHO and I always find myself using GPA as default app for dealing with keys.
I could not figure out how to get GPA onto Windows. It looked like it was available for Windows but in the end I could not figure it out. Regardless, I mostly use Ubuntu now and I am always happy to be able to use GPA. When on Windows, I always have to use the command line because I do not like any of the other options.
This is wonderful app and you have done fantastic job with it!  I do encourage you most fervently to not abandon it because I think it's the best. You really do great work and it is so appreciated by all of us so much! Thank you so much!

I did not mean to imply that all other GPG GUIs are no good. GnuPG Shell is a fine app and there is much to like about it. I did (if I remember correctly) have trouble figuring out how to use it to list signatures on keys. And how to sign keys. Overall, I found GPA to be a better experience.

Gnu Privacy Guard has everything I want and need. Unfortunately it's not available in Ubuntu 12.04. So I'd say all that needs to be done is make GPA available for Ubuntu 12.04 :) Then a GPG GUI that does everything is available.
or is the discussion about a GUI for use on Windows?

@_subject: way to see what cipher/algo was used to create your key? 
I see that --edit-key > pref lists out preferences. I'm assuming the first S is default cipher, first H is default algo, etc? so if a key is generated it will use the first S, first H, etc. But why are all those other S and H options listed? when would they ever be used to create keys?
Lastly, if you created your key some time ago (on a different machine) and don't know what the default cipher/hash was at the time, is there a way to find out what cipher and hash was used in the creation of your key?

@_subject: why is CAST5 used instead of AES for seckey encryption? 
Curious as to why the encryption standard AES is not used to encrypt secret keys for GPG? It appears users have the option to use AES for sec key encryption, but it's not default. Do people generally change the cipher to AES when generating their secret key?

Doesn't the IETF openPGP standard call for 256-bit key for TWOFISH? Could someone verify that the TWOFISH cipher uses 256-bit key length in GnuPG?

Does anybody know a way to learn what cipher & hash was used to create the secret key? Also, does anyone know a way to make AES256 & SHA256 the default cipher/hash combo for --symmetric encryption? I can create these using --cipher-algo etc but is there a way to make them default for if I use this command: gpg -a -o file-encrypted -c file

@_subject: "SHA1 Protection" from way to see what cipher/algo was used to 
when running the command: gpg --list-packets there is an outputted line that reads:  "SHA1 protection"
I did some looking online and saw that this line stays even when people change their hash algorithm to something else (like SHA2).
If the "SHA1 protection" is not indicating the use of SHA1 hash, what is it communicating? If a SHA2 hash is being used to mangle the passphrase of the secret key being stored on the disk, why is the line "SHA1 protection" being shown?

Thanks for this detailed explanation. I really appreciate it.
I've read of theoretical attacks against SHA1. whenever I hear of such things I start to be leery when using such Hash. Seeing the advanced attack capabilities demonstrated by Flame/Stuxnet leads me to believe theoretical is only temporary. I agree though that "SHA1 protection" implementation sounds good. But seems to me it would be safer to use SHA2 for the hash used in producing the symmetric key.
