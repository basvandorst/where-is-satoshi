@_subject: Signed headers (was Re: Evolution signatures) 
Since we already got Message-ID in the headers maybe something like a Host-ID
(think SSH) could help. The Host-ID could then be included in
your public key as a comment and be used like any other public key.
A sends B an encrypted mail with his/hers public key (with the Host-ID
fingerprint as a comment).
When B recieves a encrypted and/or signed mail (s)he checks the headers
for A's Host-ID. Sure, this doesn't come close to signing the headers and since everyone
can add any Host-ID with the help of extra headers the above example is pretty much
worthless but it might work given some time.

You can use --recv-key  to retrieve the key from a keyserver or
--search-key  to search for it. Depends on what software the keyserver is running, but the key should be
available on the other keyservers in a couple of days.

That is correct.
Then the best way is probably use the keyservers own interface for
searching and viewing keys.
It doesnt overwrite anything, just appends for example signatures to
your key.

Hi, keys.se.linux.org runs on the usual ports, the webpage is available on
port 80 with links to the server interface so searching, fetching and adding keys is possible thru a firewall. This setup is probably the most common, so access to many keyservers are possible thru a strict firewall but requires some manual work and a pain

@_subject: key-signing for pseudonyms 
to be honest, i wouldnt sign a key with a pseudonym unless i've known
the person for some time.
one option, however, could be to use another factor of identification
besids passports etc:
. i send him/her a random string
. i recieve a random string from him/her
. we verify the random strings when we meet.
but it's of course up to you if you think this procedure is acceptable.
the key fingerprint has the highest priority, then name (with the help of an photo-id).
if you use a pseudonym, why attach a photo? doesnt that break the idea
of pseudonyms?
but yes, in general i'd say it adds , maybe not credibility, but quick
way for identification.

to belive the "six degrees of seperation"-theory for that to work.
imho the 2/3 you have as an example (email and fingerprint) isn't as
valuable as the 2/3 most people check (id and fingerprint). primary
because an email isn't usually printed on a goverment issued photo-id.

You're absolutely right, but what are the alternatives? Yes, only signing keys for people you have known for 15 years is an
option, but it's not really practical. In the end, it's all up to you
and your paranoia level who or what you want to sign.

@_subject: key-signing for pseudonyms 
This is actually a very good rant, identification and trust is probably
the hardest part of GPG.
You're right, but as mentioned before the name is only 1/3 of the identification
process. If one of the three "steps" (photo-id, key fingerprint, email) isn't valid
or impossible to perform the signature doesnt end up on the key.
If the id doesnt match the person and/or the name on the key; no
If the key fingerprint isnt correct; no signature.
If the two steps above is accepted, you mail the signed key to the
uid:s email adress in a encrypted and signed mail. It the email adress isnt valid; no
Yes, and as Atom wrote in a previous mail, the literature needs to be
somewhat updated.
Real names makes it easiler to identify a person with the help of
id-cards. sure, id-cards can be copied, falsified and so on, but at the
moment i see no real alternatives (sorry to say).
If you know the person behind the key, there is no problem.

Keysignings is in a way a threat to privacy. It's not to hard to create
a sociogram of a persons key, mapping the date of the signature and name
of the signer. if one wants to be blunt: gpg protects your communication but not your
privacy. but that is probably pushing it a bit.
i would rather see a semianonymous signature type which would only allow the owner of the key and the signer to reveal the signature info (name, date,
email etc). almost like Chaums group signatures.

i used the term holder (which might be the incorrect word, sorry about
that) since the secret key could be stolen. owner, which hopefully is the creator of the key pair, has the same meaning. sorry for the confusion.
you're right, using a signature type only viewable by the signer and
the person whose key have been signed will break the WoT. It will
however make the creation of sociograms based on the info available on
available key servers impossible.
you could generate keys all day long and pollute the web of trust now if
you wanted to. there wouldn't be much difference.
