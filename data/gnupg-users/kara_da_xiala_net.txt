@_subject: Newbie: Installing Build Dependencies to gnupg-2.2.13 update from 
dear members of gnupg-users,
hello my name is daniel. if i may introduce myself, i'm not an entirely sophisticated or seasoned unix/linux user and usually dependend on whatever snippets of information i can find in forums and on the web that give me usually a ballpark idea of what i can or cannot do via the command line. i understand that this approach doesn't always make sense or seems abit farfetched to the more experienced programmer. that said, i recently learned when trying to update my outmoded gnupg 2.0.22 on my Ubuntu 14.04 LTS distro, that i ran into some major issues for which i'm currently looking for advice on how to resolve them and get my update to work. so, if there's anyone who has the patience and the time necessary to give this problem a fair introspection, your help would be greatly appreciated. thanks.
the deal:
trying to install gnupg-2.2.13 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, including build dependencies libgpg-error-1.35, libgcrypt-1.8.4, libassuan-2.5.3, libksba-1.3.5, npth-1.6, pinentry-1.1.0 & gpg-agent
largely dependend on the information i deployed from a website called i tried and followed the instructions there blindly, save for a few alterations. 1. for instance i wrote (copy/paste) each line of code separately for each building routine, instead of using &&. 2. I also did a detailed log of each command (copy/paste) that I ran on the shell in gedit, for each building block, including error messages that I got in return. 3. instead of  as the mainsource from which to recover the tarball, I used for instance
$ sudo wget -c ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/pinentry/pinentry-1.1.0.tar.bz2
as the protocol on the website suggest, i first cleaned up the older GNuPG 2.0.22 build, by sudo apt-get --purge remove gnupg2
mistakenly, I also removed gnupg-agent at first, because I thought it also took an updated version. however re-installed gnupg-agent at a later point in the process, when my enigmail add-on to thunderbird, seemed to have trouble making the connection.
the next step I created directory /var/src/gnupg22 with mkdir.
the contents of var/src/gnupg22 currently look like this:
daniel at daniel-ThinkPad-X240:/var/src/gnupg22$ ls
gnupg-2.2.10.tar.bz2         libgcrypt-1.8.4.tar.gz.sig
gnupg-2.2.10.tar.bz2.sig     libgpg-error-1.32.tar.gz
gnupg-2.2.13                 libgpg-error-1.32.tar.gz.sig
gnupg-2.2.13.tar.bz2         libgpg-error-1.35
gnupg-2.2.13.tar.bz2.sig     libgpg-error-1.35.tar.gz
index.html                   libgpg-error-1.35.tar.gz.sig
libassuan-2.5.1.tar.bz2      libksba-1.3.5
libassuan-2.5.1.tar.bz2.sig  libksba-1.3.5.tar.bz2
libassuan-2.5.3              libksba-1.3.5.tar.bz2.sig
libassuan-2.5.3.tar.bz2      npth-1.6
libassuan-2.5.3.tar.bz2.sig  npth-1.6.tar.bz2
libgcrypt-1.8.3.tar.gz       npth-1.6.tar.bz2.sig
libgcrypt-1.8.3.tar.gz.sig   pinentry-1.1.0
libgcrypt-1.8.4              pinentry-1.1.0.tar.bz2
libgcrypt-1.8.4.tar.gz       pinentry-1.1.0.tar.bz2.sig
I did check and verify each signature of the respective tarball file!
installation procedure:
then I ran in the same order as on the website the complete /.configure cycle, including
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
$ make
$ make check
$ sudo make install
for the configuration of pinentry for instance, the return i got was:
now for instance if i run: $ aptitude search pinentry-gtk-2
i get no search results in return! same is true for all other build dependencies (libgpg-error-1.35, libgcrypt-1.8.4, libassuan-2.5.3, libksba-1.3.5, npth-1.6, pinentry-1.1.0),  including gnupg-2.2.13.
one of the main problems of the build, seemed that libraries like libgcrypt-1.8.4 couldn't detect it's build dependencies like libgpg-error-1.35.. so the
$ make check of libgcrypt-1.8.4
 >>>>>>>>>>returned 27 Test failed!!<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
the $ make check of libgpg-error-1.35 returned PASS: 1 test passed;
All 9 tests passed
and after $ sudo make install: the contents of usr/local/lib currently looks like this:
daniel at daniel-ThinkPad-X240:/usr/local/lib$ ls
libgcrypt.la         libgpg-error.la         node_modules  site_ruby
libgcrypt.so         libgpg-error.so         pkgconfig
libgcrypt.so.20      libgpg-error.so.0       python2.7
libgcrypt.so.20.2.4  libgpg-error.so.0.26.1  python3.4
On a website called:  someone mentioned, that I probably did this mistake: "You configure your environment for your compiling and installation, but not for running. Thus, old original libgpg-error in system was used, and failed."
My folder/directory libgpg-error-1.35 looks like this and so do all the other dependencies, including gnupg-2.2.13:
daniel at daniel-ThinkPad-X240:/var/src/gnupg22/libgpg-error-1.35$ ls

gpg_error_libs="-L/usr/local/lib -lgpg-error"
 >>>>>>>>>> or usr/bin/libassuan-config for instance returns:
# Configure libgpg-error.
cflags=" $gpg_error_cflags"
on the website  finishing the build via command line goes:
echo "/usr/local/lib" > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/gpg2.conf && ldconfig -v
however, i don't exactly know what that is supposed to do?!! the return i get is:
bash: /etc/ld.so.conf.d/gpg2.conf: Permission denied
 >>>>>>but instead in directory usr/lib for instance i find:
 >>>>>>>>>in /usr/local/bin$ i find:
gpg-error-config   libgcrypt-config
gpg-error  gpgrt-config
 >>>>>>>>>>and in /usr/local/share$ i find:
the directories usr/local/sbin; usr/local/etc; and usr/local/src
are empty!
So this is about the gist of my troubleshooting. perhaps if you find the information helpful that i supplied, it would be great if you could give me a hint, where and how to fix my build. if you need any further information on my initial configuration and install process i be happy to comply with more detailed analysis as far as i can supply the resulting outputs i stored safely of each step. again, your input would be greatly appreciated.
thank you for your consideration,
kindly yours,

Again thank you for your reply, you've all been very helpful and I appreciate it greatly.
