@_subject: compiling on AIX 5.3 for gnupg-2.0.9 
I am trying to update our version of gpg to the latest and greatest.  I
am having too much fun compiling the code.  For some reason I have had
to modify install scripts so that that configure and gmake find the zlib
libraries and iconv libraries.  Okay good.  Now I get a core dump during
the tests.  Let me give some detail.  I am on :
X:[su]/usr/local/gnupg-2.0.9>oslevel -rq
