@_subject: Problem with Key Protection 
Hi everybody!
Thank you Bob! Your hint was the critical piece to the solution of our problem. However I came up to another strange thing, but we solved that:
The "official" windows version of GnuPG (1.2.0 and 1.2.1) do not support the new protection as well - at least we weren't able to do that; so we couldn't change our passphrase to apply the old protection.
However most "gpg-newbies" are using Windows, so we tried the Cygwin-gpg-version which really works! We built a batch file for that, copied the corresponding cygwin-dlls and the gpg executable into a downloadable archive and this seems to work.
If anyone somehow runs into similar problems, he/she can download our solution from:
Thank you

@_subject: keysign parties 
Hash: SHA1
Usually there are keysignings during most Linux and OSS Conferences like
the LinuxTag this weekend.
I don't know of any list, where all keysigning parties are announced. In
Hannover (Germany) some simply searched BigLumber (
and set up our own mailinglist. If you visit an exhibition here, you
should sign up and see, who has time.
Otherwise you can email the people listed in BigLumber for your region
and meet them.

@_subject: Charset of gpg --with-colon 
Hash: SHA1
I just needed the output of
gpg --list-keys --with-colon
I saw that some keynames are printed in UTF-8 and some with a local
charset. I thought I somewhere read that --with-colon uses UTF-8, but
maybe I'm wrong.
What is the correct charset? And why are there keys that are somewhat
different. And more importantly: How can I correclty get the names ;-)
Thanks in advance

@_subject: Deploying GnuPG into University Administration 
Hash: SHA1
Hello there,
I'm a student at TU Clausthal and, as a member of our LUG, did a
workshop for gnupg which was intended to convince students to use
e-mail-encryption and signing.
We had good luck and it was a great evening and so our administration
asked us to do the same for them.
That should be no problem but there's one question, where I'm not quite
sure, what to say: Since I only used gnupg in private environments, I
don't know how to centrally manage about 30 keys.
1. In my imagination there should be a central certification key which
is used by the IT departement to sign all keys for the users.
2. The users should then fully trust that key, so that they needn't sign
all keys of all employees.
3. The keyring should be centrally updatedable.
My question how to achieve this. To create a central certification key
is no problem and the administrators could modify the log on or user
creation scripts accordingly, so that the central key is stored in the
keyring and full ownertrust is set.
But how to centrally manage all keys? One could create a central
read-only keyring, which is used by gnupg where all employees' keys are
stored or one could set up a keyserver?!
I would like to know if anyone has deployed something similar and how
they dealt with that and probably arising problems.
Thanks in advance

Hi Everybody!
I have a question about keysigning: What do you think of signing a
person (or having a keysigning party) which is conducted through a video
On the one hand it would be a great opportunity to establish trust (you
can show your passport into the camera, the picture must match the
person), on the other hand you're doing this through an untrusted medium
(internet- or telefon-line-link) which you could indicate through the
What are your opinions about this topic?

Hash: SHA1
Hi Martin!
I think "Benutzerkennung"
I'd stick with Subkey as a technical term...
Passwort, I think Mantra is bad. Passphrase is better but Passwort is
best I think.
Complicated :-) Isn't there any possiblity to use the verbn widerufen
and not a noun for this? Like: "Der Eigent=FCmer hat widerrufen"?
Otherwise I would stay with revoker as I have no good word for this in
Just my 2 cents :-)

Then it should be "Passwortsatz" but not Passphrase. It sounds stupid in

Hash: SHA1
Hi list!
That would be indeed a great idea, because one could adjust these
settings to the others' singing policies and could consider using the
signature levels.

Hi all!
Sorry, sent this only to Greg but not to the list...
Here it is...
I think the main problem here is that this pathfinder only returns one
possible path.
You may use another one like although this one do not know John Millington's key :-(

@_subject: Signing a specific UID identified by an e-mail-address 
Hash: SHA1
During the CeBIT I attended a keysigning party and obviously I had to
sign some keys.
For validating the e-mail-address I decided to only sign one uid and
mail the key with only that signature.
Because I'm lazy I decided to automate as much as possible and have
following problem:
If I do a gpg --list-keys the primary uid is always the first one.
However using gpg --edit-key uid 1 selects the first created which
needn't be the primary.
So I look for a way to do something like
gpg --edit-key uid email
to select a specifig userid which I can extract before by using the
gpg --list-keys command.
Is there anything like this?
Thanks in advance

@_subject: Keysigning CeBIT 2004 
Hi everybody,
is anyone aware of keysignings at this year's CeBIT in Hannover? Or is anyone willing to meet somewhere there in order to extend his/her and (my ;-) WoT? I will probably attend on the 18th, 20th, 21st.
If you are interested just drop me a mail.
