I'm using Gnupg2.0 and I'm in a situation where I need to restore my
I have an ascii armored export of my private key which looks like
-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----
Version: GnuPG v2
-----END PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----
When I try to import his using "gpg --import", I get:
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: Total number processed: 0
Any ideas?

Here is the output I get with the -vv option:

That's what I feared looking at the output.
Now, I have two questions:
- Can I somehow recover from this? I guess that, at least theoretically,
the public should be "derivable" from the private key?
- How did I end up with this truncated export? As far as I remember -even
if it was long long time ago- I followed the standard instructions for
"storing my private key in a safe place".

Thanks for the reply. At least I know where things stand now, which is not
a good place :-(
I guess this is another *fine* example of the principle that an
insufficiently tested DR arrangement, will always break down when you need
I'm still puzzled about this partial export, however. I'm quite sure that I
made it using something like this:
$ gpg2 -a --export-secret-keys [identifier]  > private_key.asc
Now the question as to what I used as identifier, I'm not sure. The most
likely option is that I used the email address used to create the key and
maybe a key identifier. I definitely have no recollection of using the
exclamation mark '!' you mention.
Could this be linked to using an earlier version of gpg? Or could it simply
be a bug? The installation is running on a Synology, using GnuPG included
in the SynoCommunity package (
Anyway, this looks like water under the bridge.
Thanks for your help.

Hey guys,
Interesting development: I rebuilt my whole setup, generated a new keypair
etc. and am now in the process of creating another copy of the secret key
for safekeeping and back-up purposes.
And lo and behold: the problem reappeared, so I'm now in a position to
reproduce the problem. The export command I'm using produces again a
truncated result. By that I mean that the export I'm doing right now again
produces a file that only contains part of the data, just like the old
"*.asc" export that was unusable. I can see this by looking at the size of
the exported file and also by doing:
 $ gpg --list-packets secret-key.asc
which gives:
# off=0 ctb=9d tag=7 hlen=3 plen=966
:secret sub key packet:
        version 4, algo 1, created 1482831890, expires 0
        pkey[0]: [2048 bits]
        pkey[1]: [17 bits]
        iter+salt S2K, algo: 7, SHA1 protection, hash: 2, salt:
        protect count: 851968 (154)
        protect IV:  f1 59 85 06 71 0a 90 df 65 88 e9 c7 a7 2f 9a 61
        skey[2]: [v4 protected]
        keyid: 9305D7AA9D2311A4
# off=969 ctb=89 tag=2 hlen=3 plen=287
:signature packet: algo 1, keyid 16F92AB569F91A22
        version 4, created 1482831890, md5len 0, sigclass 0x18
        digest algo 8, begin of digest 90 08
        hashed subpkt 2 len 4 (sig created 2016-12-27)
        hashed subpkt 27 len 1 (key flags: 0C)
        subpkt 16 len 8 (issuer key ID 16F92AB569F91A22)
        data: [2046 bits]
The command used to build this export was the following (executed with the
-vv option to get all the info):
  $ gpg2 -vv -ao secret-key.asc --export-secret-keys gpg: writing to 'secret-key.asc'
gpg: key 69F91A22: asking agent for the secret parts
gpg: key 69F91A22: error receiving key from agent: End of file - skipped
gpg: key 69F91A22/9D2311A4: asking agent for the secret parts
It asks twice for the passphrase during this process and then produces this
"truncated" file.
Any ideas?
