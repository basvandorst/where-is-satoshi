When receiving an encrypted and signed message, I want to be sure that it is comming from a specific person.  I am running GPG in a batch file and would like to be able to specify who I am expecting to have signed the document.
If I receive a file that should be from "Bob" when I decrypt it using
gpg -d thefile > output
It decrypts the file and tells me "Mary" signed it.  I can't come up with a way to tell this from a batch file. I want to be able to reject the file from within the batch file if it's not from "Bob".
I need something like
gpg -d --from Bob > output
where gpg does an errorlevel if file is not signed by Bob.
Any Ideas?
