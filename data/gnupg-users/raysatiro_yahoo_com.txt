@_subject: Getting more verbose details of a key 
I would like to know why --list-key (or --list-keys) doesn't always show
subkeys and their expiration dates.
gpg (GnuPG) 2.2.1
libgcrypt 1.8.1
To reproduce:
cd foo
set GNUPGHOME=.
gpg --import CBA23971357C2E6590D9EFD3EC8FEF3A7BFB4EDA.asc
gpg --list-key CBA23971357C2E6590D9EFD3EC8FEF3A7BFB4EDA
pub?? rsa4096 2010-02-16 [SC]
????? CBA23971357C2E6590D9EFD3EC8FEF3A7BFB4EDA
uid?????????? [ unknown] Brad King
uid?????????? [ unknown] Brad King [EMAIL REMOVED]
uid?????????? [ unknown] [jpeg image of size 4005]
Notice no subkeys w/ expiration, and yet:
gpg -a --export CBA23971357C2E6590D9EFD3EC8FEF3A7BFB4EDA | gpg
gpg: WARNING: no command supplied.? Trying to guess what you mean ...
pub?? rsa4096 2010-02-16 [SC]
????? CBA23971357C2E6590D9EFD3EC8FEF3A7BFB4EDA
uid?????????? Brad King
uid?????????? Brad King [EMAIL REMOVED]
uid?????????? [jpeg image of size 4005]
sub?? rsa4096 2010-02-16 [E] [expired: 2017-08-12]
sub?? rsa4096 2015-08-13 [S] [expired: 2017-08-12]
Is that a bug? Also, is that the best way to get key details? I seem to
recall there was a way to list a key and all its subkeys in more detail
with sub key fingerprints and expiration? How can I do that? I know of
--with-colons but it's not a human readable format.

@_subject: gpg in windows hanging rarely 
I'm using gpg and I notice rarely I will run a command and it will just
hang. What could be the reasons for that? The two commands I've noticed
it happening are --import and --delete-keys. I've noticed it in my
regular key database and was able to reproduce it once when I set
GNUPGHOME to an empty directory to make a new database (unfortunately I
did not have the foresight to run --debug-all at that time).
gpg (GnuPG) 2.2.1
libgcrypt 1.8.1
In an attempt to coax out the hang I imported in a loop a few thousand
times, but it didn't hang.
cd foo
set GNUPGHOME=.
then I run a batch file ..\a.bat that does the loop:
gpg --debug-all --import c:\fedora.gpg
rm -rf *
goto restart
One thing I did notice was I ended up with a number of gpg-agent
processes that did not immediately terminate. After a minute they did
though. I also notice there's 4 gpg-agent processes still running from
earlier in the day.

@_subject: --verify with foo.gpg file does not assume signed data in foo? 
I downloaded an Ubuntu preview ISO [1] recently along with its hash and
signature, SHA256SUMS and SHA256SUMS.gpg. I expected to be able to do this:
gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.gpg
gpg: no signed data
gpg: can't hash datafile: No data
Instead I have to do this:
gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.gpg SHA256SUMS
My question is why is that necessary with gpg files? I know for xxx.sig
files it would strip that extension and then "gpg: assuming signed data
in xxx"
