@_subject: using the same key from PGP and GPG 
I have  2 computers, one Linux server and on Window PC. I would like to share the same encryption key form both platforms. On the Linux box, I'm using GPG 1.06 and from the PC box, I'm using Eudora with PGP 7.03.
I tried to generate a key from GPG and export it to the PC box and encrypt/decrypt from both platforms. It appears that the PGP version cannot decrypt a message encrypted from the  box. I got an error "Bad packet" on the PGP version.
I tried different version of the export command, including changing the  gpg -a --s2k-cipher-algo 3des --compress-algo 1 --rfc1991 proposed in the FAQ of GNUPG. It did not work, I still get the bad packet I did also the other way experiment, meaning generating keys on the pgp box and exporting them to the GNUPG box and that seemed to work just fine.
Since I'm more confident in the open source software than in the PGP version, I would really like to be able to generate my keys with GNUPG and exporting both the private and public keys to the PC.
Does someone has a solution to this issue?
