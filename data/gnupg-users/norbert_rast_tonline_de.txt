@_subject: GnuPG and Windows/Office XP 
Hello there,
first I'd like to say THANK YOU for giving GnuPG to the world!
I'd really like to use GnuPG on my system, but there's one question
left: Will GnuPG work under Windows XP and can I run the Outlook-plugin
with Outlook XP?  Sorry, if I've overlooked something, but I found no
system requirements at the GnuPG-sites.
It would be great if you could send your answer per email. I didn't sign
in for the mailing lists yet...
Thank you for your help and best regards
Norbert Rast
