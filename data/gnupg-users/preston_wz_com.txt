@_subject: perl script to clearsign documents automatically 
I want the perl script to read a directory and clear sign each file in the directory without asking for the passphrase.
How do I automate this process on a Linux/Apache system?
--passphrase-fd n is not in my gpg -help file.  Can I use it anyway?
--bach  bombs with:  "clearsign failed: secret key not available"
