@_subject: It's more GNU/Linux than GnuPG 
I have two GNU/Linux computers syncing their ~/.gnupg directories.
"alice" is my username in one computer, "bob" is my username in the
other one.
I have a CA certificate stored in my home directory of both computers,
and would like to keep it there.
Into the ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf file, I wrote the following line pointing to
that CA cert:
But that line does not seem to work because of "~".
Everything works ok in one computer if I write:
and in the other computer if I write:
But then, by specifying names, when syncing, that line won't work in one
of the two computers because of the usernames.
Is there any way to specify "user" without writing their name?
Any other suggestion?
Thank you

Hi again,
I was wrong, suggestion 2 does not work either.
I have tried with
keyserver-options ca-cert-file=../keyserversCA.pem
keyserver-options ca-cert-file=symlink_to_home/keyserversCA.pem
keyserver-options ca-cert-file=$HOME/keyserverCA.pem
I also tried moving the certificate into ~/.gnupg/ and did:
keyserver-options ca-cert-file=keyserverCA.pem
keyserver-options ca-cert-file=./keyserverCA.pem
None of them works. Any other suggestion without writing the full path?
I would like it to work for both Alice and Bob, but would like to keep
the certificate into the home directory.

Everything works fine if I set the full path. If I use relative paths
and try, for instance, gpg --search-keys user at domain.tld, I get the
gpg: searching for "user at domain.tld" from hkps server hkps.foo.tld
gpgkeys: HTTP search error 77:
gpg: key "user at domain.tld" not found on keyserver
gpg: keyserver internal error
gpg: keyserver search failed: keyserver error
I can also see I have 2.1.11 installed. However, I always use the gpg
command, I have never used the gpg2 command.
I have just tried now:
$ gpg2 --search-keys user at domain.tld
gpg: keyserver option 'ca-cert-file' is obsolete; please use
'hkp-cacert' in dirmngr.conf
gpg: failed to start the dirmngr '/usr/bin/dirmngr': No such file or
gpg: connecting dirmngr at '/home/Alice/.gnupg/S.dirmngr' failed: No
such file or directory
gpg: error searching keyserver: No dirmngr
gpg: keyserver search failed: No dirmngr
So it seems I have version 2 installed, but not that dirmngr thing.
What kind of problems? I never had a problem when the full path was set.
Will relative paths work if I use version 2?
In that case, what should I do for the upgrade?
Any explanation or link is welcome, I don't know anything about version
2 and that dirmngr file.
