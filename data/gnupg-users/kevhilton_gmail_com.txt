Hmm, thanks for the suggestion.  I believe gnupg2 requires gettext
0.17 or greater -- cygwin ships with 0.16, with no higher version
available in its mirrors.  I downloaded the 0.17 sources from here:
ftp://mirrors.kernel.org/gnu/gettext/, compiled and installed.  I'm

gettext package correct?  For some reason the cvs sources of gettext
will not compile.  I'm stuck in dependency hell!  I'm finding not much

I think I've seen this piece of advice before, and for the most part I

defaults, but my contention is, at least tell me what the defaults are

@_date: 2008-02-04 21:26:14
@_author: Kevin Hilton 
@_subject: Can you clarify when data compression is used? 
Im aware of the personal cipher preferences and personal hash
preferences, but when talking about the defaults I specifically asking
if gpg were installed from source -- no modifications made -- and gpg
keys were created - what default cipher and hash would be listed first
in the list with the keys?
Without any intervention
It appears to manually choose a DSA signing key (DSA vs DSA2 --
ambiguous since the man pages contain a switch to --enable-dsa2 in the
gpg.conf file) with SHA1 hash -- or at least the SHA1 hash is ranked
first in the key preference list
For the encryption key - a ElGamal 2048 bit key is the default with
AES chosen as the first cipher contained in the key cipher preference.
Basically I'm aware of the --default-preference-list option in the
gpg.conf file that control preferences during key generation.  I know
how to use this option, but sadly I think the explanation is really
--default-preference-list string
          Set  the list of default preferences to string.  This prefer-
          ence list is used for new keys and becomes  the  default  for
          "setpref" in the edit menu.
What I want to know is obviously GnuPG comes with a
--default-preference-list "built-in".  If I dont specify this setting
in the gpg.conf file, what string is used by default?  This would
basically reveal the order and list of all the defaults for ciphers,
hashes, and compression settings.

@_date: 2008-02-04 22:18:01
@_author: Kevin Hilton 
@_subject: Can you clarify when data compression is used? 
You are absolutely correct about these settings.  Perhaps this should
be included in documentation (and changed when needed), since I would
consider these to be the default settings for cipher, hash, and
compression choice.
This seems peculiar to me.  Why is this setting turned off by default?
 I'm not at war with anyone in these forums, but many have
acknowledged the shortcomings of using 160 bit hashes -- at least with
the SHA1 hash.  In the same vain, aren't keys sizes larger than 1024
bits actually now recommended?
The default fallback allows the creation of a 1024 bit DSA key
utilizing the SHA-1 hash -- the preferred preference.  Again I know
nothing about cryptography but based on the links provided by users'
of this forum, it would seem that the choice or a larger DSA key and
different hash would be preferable?.

Just to clarify for some other users,
What version of GnuPG were the DSA2 keys (or longer DSA signing keys)
and the additional SHA hashes introduced?
A little of topic, but I'm predicting a future foreseeable bump in the
road when the Secure Hash Standard is named in 2011 (or whenever the
recent NIST hash analysis is concluded).  I guess however the
personal-hash-preferences would bypass this problem and default to
SHA1 if a new hash (or series of new hashes) is introduced.
Hopefully md5 support is abandoned, however I guess for historical
purposes this would be unlikely to happen.
Even more challenging will be when longer DSA keys become the de-facto
standard.  I would guess there is not any similar workaround.  I guess
users of older GnuPG versions would simply have to upgrade.

Interesting.  Are the higher or lower bits truncated?
Ok.  So back to the ever asking defaults question, so why when I
produce a 3072 bit DSA signing key, why isnt my first digest hash
preference or choice SHA-256?  Here is what I am getting:

@_subject: Are DSA2 signing keys backwards compatible? 
My reason for asking these questions is in regards to a documentation
Im trying to compose for a user's group.  Obviously I'm very much a
novice in both the mathematics beyonds GnuPG but in also its
implementation.  Its clear to me you are following both the FIPS and
OpenGPG RFC 8440 in implementing the program, however the truncation
of longer hash products, along with attempting to predict which hash
the program based on the output available will actually use is very
troubling and extremely difficult to document given all the nuances of
the program, particularly in relation to DSA keys.  Given the above
example (just one example), where a 3072 DSA key actually uses either
a SHA256 or SHA512 bit hash (truncated to 256 bits), despite what is
listed when showprefs is displayed -- How do you actually document
this scenario?  Im sure the situation is similar with 2048 DSA keys.
This is particularly troublesome given the fact that many actually
recommend the use of 2048 DSA keys -> meaning all hashes used are
going to be trucated to 224 bits and that 160 bit hashes will never be
used despite what would be suggested by the preference statement.
Are RSA signing keys subject to some of the same nuances as DSA keys?
Practically could a 1024 bit RSA key be used with a 512 hash?
Again its all very confusing to me -- math aside and practical
considerations why you wouldn't want to mix and match key types and
hash lengths.  Again Robert Hansen has wisely suggested use the
defaults -- I'm understanding this more and more -- however when I see
showpref statements that would suggest SHA-1 is the default hash, when
in actuality with larger DSA keys it is not, I get rather frustrated.
Thank you for your help.

@_subject: Are DSA2 signing keys backwards compatible? 
Sorry I was writing my last reply when I received yours.  Thank your
for clarification. I understand the difference.  However given the
fact that I could produce for example SHA256 hashes, wouldn't I prefer
the same hash length in return for security reasons?
Meaning woundn't it be preferable for the showpref statement to read
SHA256, SHA1, RIPEMD160
rather than
SHA1, SHA256, RIPEMD160
Again, Im aware of the default-preference-list within the gpg.conf
file,  This controls the preference order of the hashes, ciphers with
key creation within my own set of keys.  Other than consulting this in
the gpg.conf file, there is no other place this default list could be
consulted?  Meaning this is no command I could type that would give me
the Hash Algorithm I would be using before signing the document --
once the document is signed its easy to see the hash that was used.
I suppose the same discussion type could be stated with cipher type.
Other than consulting the default preference list within the gpg.conf
file (is there is one), is there any way to predict or show a
preference list in relation to my own keys?
Again if the showpref statement is meant for the other party, is there
an equivalent statement or command for myself?

 Historically, what ciphers were eliminated -- For example what

the SHA-3 (Secure Hash Algorithm version 3).  No doubt the winner of
this consult will eventually be added to the gpg standard.

@_subject: Question about history of hash and cipher collections 
I dont have any feelings or objections about any of the ciphers or
hashes included or excluded (ok maybe serpent should be included),
however I can imagine that deleting old ciphers and hashes would cause
a problem with backwards compatibility.  Why md5 and cast5 are still
included is beyond me, other than for backwards compatibility.
Lastly, who is this governing body that decides what algorithms should
be included? The IETF OpenPGP group?  As a regular user of gpg, but
novice when it comes to the history of PGP/GPG this discussion on the
history/politics of GPG/PGP has been very interesting for me.

@_subject: Question about history of hash and cipher collections 
Just a few follow-up points
My advice has been the same for years: unless you know precisely what
you're doing and why, stick with the defaults.  GnuPG's defaults are
excellent.  They make good sense.  They interoperate well.  Don't mess
with them unless you know precisely what you're doing and why.
However in your link: you recommend other things (as discussed below).
1024-bit DSA signing key, a 1024-bit ElGamal encryption key, a 3DES
symmetric cipher, and SHA-1 hash.
In your link however, you recommend the creation of 1024 or 2048 RSA
signing and encryption keys (or DSA2 signing key with RSA encryption
key??), and to choose something else other than the SHA-1 hash.
It would seem from your the information in your link, it would not be
best to follow the default settings in terms of signing/encryption key
creation, and hash algorithm.  What hash algorithm should I be using,
if SHA-1 is not preferred? SHA512??
Who chooses the defaults in terms of DSA/ElGamal signing/encryption
keys?  Is this set by the GnuPG programmers or they OpenGPG standard?

a lot of errors during the make process.  All are problems related to
the gettext module.  By default cygwin is installed with gettext
version 0.15 however I did go ahead and install version 0.17 from

installation.  I'm still getting errors however.  Does anyone have any

As others have mentioned there is another pidgin encryption technique:
 .
This project also seems to have stalled if I'm looking at the release
dates as an appropriate indication.
The OTR website specifically addresses this plugin with the following:
"How is this different from the pidgin-encryption plugin?
    The pidgin-encryption plugin provides encryption and
authentication, but not deniability or perfect forward secrecy. If an
attacker or a virus gets access to your machine, all of your past
pidgin-encryption conversations are retroactively compromised.
Further, since all of the messages are digitally signed, there is
difficult-to-deny proof that you said what you did: not what we want
for a supposedly private conversation!"
This explanation doesn't make a lot of sense to me.

@_subject: Anyone know what became of the Gaim-E Project? 
I'm going to try to steer this back onto a relevant topic
I love your "off the cuff feelings" about things.  Its when you are at
your best.  Question:
What value do signatures serve then however other than to provide data
authentication but not sender authentication? How can you be sure in
any case that if you get an unsigned transmission, that the data is
secure, was altered, or that a signature was just mistakingly not
appended?  As a counter argument -- if the private key was stolen and
a message signed using the stolen signature, it really doesn't act to
prove sender authenticity either -- but I guess it does serve to prove
data authenticity.
So in the best case scenario if the private keys are kept truly
private and secure, the signature mechanism works as designed.  In
unideal circumstances however, this "trust" mechanism falls apart
however.  Seems like somewhat of a quandary?

@_subject: Question regarding s2k algorithms 
Just wondering specifically is the option
Does this option specifically refer to one particular digest algorithm
or a list of algorithms.  I'm just thinking there may be a problem
with a few different scenarios if this refers to only one algorithm if
for example the SHA256 algorithm is used.
1. Symmetric Encryption -- Using symmetric encryption to specifically
password protect a file, the chosen password is salted and hashed with
the algorithm specificied with the s2k-digest-algo.  I would assume
however if this file along with the password was distributed, that the
recipient's gpg version would need to specifcally have to have the
SHA256 enabled in their build or a problem would result.
2. Asymmetric Encrytion -- Am I wrong to assume, but isn't the session
key salted and hashed in the same manner?  Again, wouldn't the
recipient need the specific hashes installed.
If you are using a "stock" gpg.conf file, and say for example this
variable is set to Camellia, or IDEA.  If you use this "stock"
gpg.conf file with another gpg version that doesn't have these ciphers
compiled in -- What results?  A default back to CAST5?  What if you
change this parameter after keys are already stored on the keyring?
Will this confuse things?
And lastly what specifically is the purpose of the -for-your-eyes-only
flag?  Is this option currently still in use, or only included for
backwards compatibility purposes.

@_subject: Session Key Questions 
Thanks for rapid response -- I guess I'm missing out on some of the
more basic details.  Just a quick followup.  If I'm planning on using
gpg to symmetrically encrypt a file for example, and choose a
password.  This password is salted and hashed.  Say for theoretical
reasons SHA512 was used to perform the hashing producing a 512 bit
hash result.  Would then hash then be rounded, or the right most bits
excluded if it were to used with AES encryption (which requires a 128
bit key)?  In the opposite situation, say SHA1 produced a 160 bit hash
result and I wanted to use AES256 (which requires a 256 bit key) --
would "extra bits" be added onto the hash result to pad the results up
to 256 bits?
Using the defaults as provided in the standard gpg.conf file -- what
hash is used in the normal salting/hashing process during symmetric
encryption?  I dont believe this is the s2k-digest-algo since this is
for key protection.

@_date: 2008-10-21 10:52:49
@_author: Kevin Hilton 
@_subject: Session Key Questions 
Ok -- so just some points of clarification.  What is the default
s2k-digest-algo?  Lets say its SHA1 or for the point of argument I set
it to be SHA1.  SHA1 always produces 160 bit resultants.  Say I want
to use the AES256 cipher.  If I am understanding what has been
reported previously, this requires a 256 bit key.  If the process you
described above works, wouldn't a 160 bit hash always be produced?
Just to clarify in my own mind your process --  If the hash output is
not enough and an extra 0x00 byte (which I think you are telling me
0x00 = 256 0 bits) is added to the passphrase and then rehashed with
SHA1 - wouldn't another 160 bit hash be produced again?  How would a
256 bit hash ever be produced is the SHA1 hash was always used.
Thanks -- I have a feeling I'm getting off in left field here and
missing some understanding of some basic concepts.

@_author: Kevin Hilton 
@_subject: Session Key Questions 
Sorry about my last reply, went I sent my question, David had not
responded as of yet.
Ok, so just to clarify, say I have a 160bit hash product (produced
from a salted password) Using the SHA1 hash.  In my theoretical
example, AES256 requires a 256 bit key. To construct this key
 0-159 = the salted hashed password (with 0 octects added)
 159-255 = the leftmost 80 bits of the salted preloaded password
with 1 octet zeros and then hased.
To produce the full 256 bits, the results of operation 1 and operation
2 are combined -- meaning result  is shifted 80 bits and then  is
added to Randomly generated session keys -- once produced are these salted and
hashed similiar to passwords?  Or is the generated session key the
required length for the chosen cipher?
When passwords are salted -- how long is the salt?  Is this appended
or prepended to the chosen password?

I'm sure its probably contained in one of the RFC's, however when was
DSA signing keys and ElGamal Encryption keys, along with the AES-256
cipher and SHA1 digest chosen as the defaults for key generation?  Any
particular reasons these were chosen as the defaults?  (This is not an
attempt to lure people into a discussion of which is better than

@_date: 2008-09-16 23:51:25
@_author: Kevin Hilton 
@_subject: GnuPG Defaults 
Im slighly confused.  I thought in terms of GnuPG - AES256 was the
default cipher as of version 1.48.  I thought 3DES was still the
standard cipher according to the OpenGPG spec.  I dont use PGP,
however it would seem that you were implying 3DES is still the default
cipher type in this product?
Any knowledge on why ElGamal was chosen over RSA as the default
session key cipher?

@_date: 2008-09-17 00:27:54
@_author: Kevin Hilton 
@_subject: GnuPG Defaults 
Just one point of clarification since I'm not using the proper
terminology, but I thought ElGamal/RSA was used only as the asymmetric
algorithm which acted to encrypt/decrypt the session key.  As with all
asymmetric key encryption algorithms, each has 3 parts: the key
generator, the encryption algorithm, and decryption algorithm.  I
thought however once the encryption key was generated, this key would
be used to encrypt the randomly generated session key -- which would
be later decrypted, and then used as input to the symmetric cipher to
decrypt the ciphertext to plain text.
And lastly -- not to beat a dead horse, but using gnupg 1.4.10
compiled from svn with the IDEA module included -- I generated a new
key and then viewed the key preferences (no changes have been made to
the gpg.conf file -- the file is in its default state).  I received
the following as the preferences:
Cipher: AES256, AES192, AES, CAST5, 3DES, IDEA
Digest: SHA1, SHA256, RIPEMD160
Compression: ZLIB, BZIP2, ZIP, Uncompressed
Features: MDC, Keyserver no-modify
Would not this output seem to imply the key was generated with
preference for the AES family over 3DES?  I am aware that at a minimum
keys are always created with 3DES included in the cipher preference
list.  Possibly both you and I are confusing the idea of default.  I
am aware of default in terms of compatibility that 3DES must be
included in any OpenGPG compliant implementation, however I thought as
a "default", gnupg preferred AES over 3DES (as over 1.4.8).

Thanks, I was definitely misguided.  However just a quick followup.
My gpg version contains far more capabilities (ie TWOFISH, BLOWFISH),
than what was listed in the key.  Why were these not included in the
"capability list"?
If I do not specify a personal-cipher-preference or cipher-algo within
the gpg.conf file, 3DES will always be chosen as the cipher algorithm?

Based on the lack of vulnerabilities of those limited set of

to be prudent to "refine" the number of acceptable algorithms.  When

3. Is it possible to decrypt a gnupg encrypted message if I know the
decrypted session key?  How could this be accomplished?

Hmm,  this method works different than what I thought.  For example if
I specify a manual session key on the command line:
gpg -se -r KevDog --override-session-key 9:345DFG session_key_test_original
But then ask gpg to reveal session key
gpg --show-session-key session_key_test_original.gpg > decrypt
I get:
gpg: session key:
I must be doing something wrong.

So what is GnuPG's default implementation is no symmetric cipher is
specified?  Since it includes AES-128, CAST5, and 3DES in all recent
distributions, does it use AES-128 or 3DES as the default symmetric
cipher if no cipher is specified on the command line, or within the
sender's gpg.conf file?  I would assume that it would look at the
preferences of the public encryption key, and likely pick the first
cipher on the list.  Since in most recent versions of GPG, AES256 is
the first algorithm specified (as demonstrated with the showpref
command), that the sender in turn would reply with an AES256
symmetrically encrypted message (if possible).  If an older version of
GPG were being used that didnt support AES, it would likely then
choose among rank ordered subsequent algorithms as shown in the
setpref commad.  Following this logic however, it would seem for me
that CAST5 would be chosen preferentially rather than 3DES:
Cipher: AES256, AES192, AES, CAST5, 3DES, IDEA
Other than for backward compatibility purposes, I thought the
encryption community had turned their backs on CAST5, but not 3DES.

I take it there is not encryption equivalent -- making it in one
session using gpg with the symmetric option.

I think you are using the wrong command within your gpg.conf file
These control what cipher/hash will be used when using other people's
public key.  showpref allows you as the sender to be aware of the
capabilities (ciphers/hashes) that are available on the recipients
machine.  You wouldn't want to send someone for example, a message
encrypted using the Camellia cipher, when the recipient would not have
capabilities by virtue of their gpg version to decrypt the message
because Camellia was not compiled into the executable.
personal-cipher-preferences (or digest) allows you as a sender to
choose algorithms that you prefer.  The firstmost algorithm contained
within your personal preference that is also within the key preference
list is chosen to encode or sign the message.
Preferences that are set at key generation time are controlled by the:
--default-preference-list string
    Set the list of default preferences to string. This preference
list is used for new keys and becomes the default for "setpref" in the
edit menu.
Hopefully that is clear.

I think the problem is with the word preferences.  The use of this
word in the setpref command and in the
personal-cipher/hash-preferences really doesn't convey what
preferences are preferred over each other.  The sender's preferences
always trump the recipient's preferences.  The use of
personal-cipher/hash-preferences performs a verification based on the
list contained within the recipient's public key, that the recipient
has the capabilities to decode/verify the message, whereas the use of
the non-recommended cipher/digest-algo avoids this check altogether.
Its straightforward once someone explains it, however the use of the
word preferences on both the public keys and the sender's preferences
does not convey any information on the hierarchy of the preferences
(with senders > recipients).

Thats a great explanation.  Perhaps this should be included in the
Lastly however this is assuming the sender is not using the
options.  From my reading of the documentation, this will force the
use of a particular cipher as dictated by the sender, even if the
algorithm is not contained in the list of the public keys.  I know
these two options are not recommended for use, however since they are
included as possible options, I think that they should at least be
covered by a "what if" scenario.

The prefs associated with your key, is advertising to the sender what
you would prefer.  However the capabilities to decode an encrypted
version is really determined by your gpg version and what ciphers it
was associated with.  Unless you force an algorithm -- with the
cipher-algo preference, if your personal-preference list and the
preferences associated with the public key (showpref or pref) have no
matches in common (this is not a union of the sets), then 3DES is
chosen by default.  I believe all gnupg version since inception have
had the capablities to decode 3DES encrypted messages as dictated by
the OpenPGP RFC specifications.  (I could be wrong on this very last
statement).  The use of personal-cipher-preferences rather than
cipher-algo is preferred, since it prevents the problem of sending an
encrypted communication that the recipient can not decode.  If there
is a null union of the personal-cipher-preferences and the key
preferences, then 3DES is chosen.

Not to beat a dead horse, but this statement isn't exactly true.  The
sender can force the use of a particular algorithm that is not on the
list.  I take objection to the use of the work "never".

To all  the contributors who helped in writing the documentation,
please do not consider my questions regarding preference choice
disparaging in any way.  Documentation in many problems is very
tedious and its contributions oftentimes overlooked, however I do
sincerely appreciate your efforts and time spent in order to make the
gnupg project very successful.  In order to provide effective
documentation, contributors must know all the nuances of the project
and have a very good working knowledge of the various options.
Its clear that the preferences among how the different ciphers or
hashes are chosen seem to be a point of confusion for many, including
me, however the mailing list has seemed to clear up a lot of my
misconceptions.  As stated by David Shaw in a previous correspondence,
it would be impossible to fully explain the decision making tree or
methods effectively in the context of an individual man page.  Perhaps
the man page could link to a particular website for a more in-depth
discussion of the decision-making methods, and perhaps the methods
could be fully explained in detail on one of the web pages of the
GnuPG project.  I think this may help to eliminate a lot of the
confusion surrounding about individual ciphers and hashes are chosen.

Now that the algorithm has been changed for picking preferred
algorithms, can someone please explain how the new algorithm works if
the personal preferences are omitted?  Someone had previously posted a
very informative example with three users with their key preferences,
and showed how the choices progressed from the last key on the list up
through the first key.  I thought that example was very informative.
Thank you very much.

Robert can probably give a better explanation that I, however with
3072 DSA signing keys, the SHA512 and SHA256 algorithms "functionally"
produce the same length hash since the lower 256 bits are dropped as
per the FIPS specification.  I've often wondered the consequences of
such an action -- whether this makes the chance of a collision higher
or equal in comparing the SHA512 modified hash product to the SHA256
hash product.  Perhaps someone could elaborate on this.
Of course with RSA keys, no such limitation is in place.  Just an FYI.
(And just another summary, the battle between RSA vs DSA signing keys
has been waged many times prior on this mailing list -- Google for it
if you don't believe me -- and to summarize the conclusions of many on
this list -- this is no functional advantage of using one over the

Thanks for the quoted sections from Applied Cryptography.  Just to
throw more fuel on the fire, however from the quoted material, it
would seem that Serpent and 3DES have a lot in common -- slowness, but
security.  Again a lot of ciphers are already included in GnuPG, many
it seems for historical reasons, that could be made read only as many
have suggested.  How a cipher like cast5, but not Serpent could be
included, other than for historical reasons, is beyond me.  Again as I
have been told on this list, in selecting an AES winner, a lot more
factors were considered than just plain security, hence the reason why
Serpent was never the AES standard.
I'll stop ranting now.

What's the motivation for abandoning the AES also-rans?  I can see the
motivation for not including them in the OpenGPG specification,
however wouldn't it be a mistake to move toward one algorithm (or two
in the case of AES and 3DES)?  I guess I'm just confused how
critically evaluated algorithms (as per the AES competition), such as
Serpent and Twofish, are moving towards the opinion of being
abandoned, whereby Camellia is moving towards adoption by the OpenGPG
committee.  On the surface, there seems to be a lot of double-talk
regarding the abandonment/ or reasons for not adopting some
algorithms, but on the other hand using similar rationale to except
other algorithms.
Since I don't really understand the process of cryptography other than
on the surface, I could be mistaken.  However on the surface --
mathematics removed -- these decisions seem to be more political than
based on proven concept.

With this entire transition from DSA to RSA default signing keys, and
the gradual migration to the use of SHA2 hashes, will this same type
of difficulties be repeated when SHA3 is adopted?  Is it anticipated
that DSA2 or RSA keys will be "compatible" with SHA3 keys?  Maybe this
question is much too premature, however it would seem the actual
implementation of SHA3 is not too far off in the distant future with
the winner of the NIST competition to be named around 2012.
