@_subject: I have keys - now I want to encrypt a file 
Hi all,
I have just installed gpg on my Solaris system.
My requirement is to encrypt small flat files and send
them to outside recipients.  I have successfully
imported two public keys from these recipients.  Now I
want to encrypt 'testfile' to prepare it for FTPing to
one of the recipients.  What syntax should I use?  I
have thus far tried gpg --encrypt-files testfile --recipient
somebody keyname
but I get the message 'you did not specify a user ID'
I have checked the FAQ and do not find the answer
thanks !
