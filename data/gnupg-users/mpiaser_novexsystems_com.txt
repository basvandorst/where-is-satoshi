@_subject: GNU Privacy Assistance Signing help 
I'm hoping somebody can give me an idea of what I'm doing wrong.  I can't get any of the keys to show up in the Sign As box.  I had a key there yesterday (and have been encrypting and signing with that key for two years).  Today I'm trying to implement a new key and I deleted the old key.    The key says it can be used for signing but I can't get it in the Sign As box.  Please email me your ideas at mpiaser at novexsystems.com
Thanks in Advance
