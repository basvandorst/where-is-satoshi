@_subject: Question about FAQ section 7.1 
Thank you Mr. Shaw, Smasher and Williams for your answer(s) and
feedback :^) It was very useful in my first series of mental hurdles
on the path to using GPG.
Is there a wiki for updating the GPG-FAQ? Or perhaps someone working
on update keeping track commits and other less direct changes?

@_subject: Question about FAQ section 7.1 
Hello List :^)
In section 7.1 of the FAQ the last paragraph states:
"There is a small security glitch in the OpenPGP (and therefore GnuPG)
system; to avoid this you should always sign and encrypt a message
instead of only encrypting it."
(  )
I am wondering if this is still the case, and if this means that one
should also not use 'conventional' encryption, as the language appears
to possibly be saying that as well. And has this 'glitch' been fixed?
I apologize if this has already been discussed a few times, if that
bothers anyone, I did look over a bit of the message archives and
didn't see this question, or the answer ;)
Also, does anyone see any basic problems in encrypting =<700MB files
using --recipient (My-Name) --encrypt (File), i.e. encrypting to one's
self for files only for yourself. Is it better to encrypt with say
TWOFISH, or a Key-pair even though you are only encrypting to
Or I if I take the section in the FAQ above correctly I should add
--sign to the commands, right?
Okay, thanks for reading, and thanks in advance for answering, I
By the way I am presently using GnuPG 1.2.4 on an MS-Windows system.

Josef, don't troll!
While I'm only a lurker, I have to say your last email was the most vitriolic-loaded post I've ever read here and really goes against the overall helpful and peaceful tone set here by Werner, David, and the many other fine people who keep this list and gpg going.
Please leave the baiting and so on out of gnupg-users, as it's really unpleasant.  Anyway: relax (as you said yourself).
Thanks for reading,
