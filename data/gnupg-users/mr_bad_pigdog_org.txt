Email verification is one of the main uses of public-key encryption
tools (like GPG). So, you're definitely not alone. :-)
Your user -will- generally need to have his secret key available on
the machine that his/her mail program is on. The user will _sign_ the
message with his/her secret key, and then you can use their public
key to verify the message. The steps necessary are probably as
1) The user should use the "gpg --export" command to export their public
   key to a file. You can then use the "gpg --import" command to import
   their public key into your personal keyring.
2) If they will be working from a different machine, the user should
   copy their secret ring to the new machine (just copying ~/.gnupg works
   fine). They can also use "gpg --export" to export the key, and
   re-import it on the new machine.
   NOTE NOTE NOTE that the secret key and secret key ring is the
   _MOST_PRECIOUS_ item in GPG, and utmost care should be taken in
   moving it around. DEFINITELY make sure that he/she doesn't leave
   the key or keyring anywhere out of his/her control! This cannot be
   emphasized enough.
3) The user can then use a mail program to "sign" the message. If
   their mail program doesn't support GPG, they can write the message
   in a text editor, and then use the command "gpg --clearsign
   [message]" to sign the file. They can then cut-and-paste the file
   (with signature) into the mailer. NOTE that some mailers like
   Netscape or Outlook will convert plain text mail to HTML or RTF by
   default. Make sure that they use whatever settings necessary to
   make the mail "plain text."
   The "signature" will be a few lines of text around the body of the
   message. You can see an example in this current email message.
4) When you receive the message, you can use a GPG-aware mailer to
   "verify" the signed message. If you don't have a GPG-aware mailer,
   you can save the message to a file, and use "gpg --verify" to
   verify that the message is indeed from your user.
Another method that may be easier is to have your user log on to the
machine where you already have GPG installed, and use a mailer
there. HOWEVER!! Please note that they should use a secure terminal
program to log in to the machine, like SSH. ****Using Rlogin or telnet
is very bad****, since they will send their GPG passphrase over the
network without any encryption. Don't do that! Repeat: don't do that!
I hope that that helps somewhat. There are a number of GPG-aware mail
programs available from this URL:
One that is very popular is Mutt (
Anyways, good luck.

OK, well, I wanted to bring up one of GnuPG's "special features,"
anyways: there's a backdoor built in so that if you can't find the
passphrase for your key, you can always just type in the word
"password" and that will work, too. Typing in your user ID (name and
email address) will also unlock the key.
Haha! Just kidding! Did I scare anybody? B-)
Levente: It's actually really, really, really hard to recover a
passphrase. (Note that when people talking about encryption say
"really hard," they mean "lifetime-of-the-universe hard.") This is
part of the security that GnuPG gives: someone who got access to your
computer couldn't just go into the encrypted files on there
willy-nilly. They'd have to know your passphrase, and the passphrase
is stored in a super-secure way.
Normally, you're ass-out in this case. Of course, that doesn't help
for me to remind you of that, so here's what I'd recommend:
        * Really, really try to remember the passphrase. Wait a while,
          take a couple of days, let it come to you by
          serendipity. These things usually come to me when I'm taking
          a shower or just falling asleep, so I recommend you take a
          lot of naps and showers. B-)
        * Try and recover the data another way -- see if you forgot to
          delete the source files somewhere, or if you can retrieve
          them from someone else who has 'em, or whatever.
        * If you can't recover your data any other way, you -could-
          try running a password cracker on GnuPG. I don't know of any
          crackers that do that right now, but you might want to type
          "password crack" into the Google prompt and see what you can
          find. A lot of password crackers are customizeable so that
          you can tell them what program to run and how to pass the
          password in.
          Note that if you used an even half-decent passphrase (like,
          not your name or "password" or what have you) it's entirely
          possible that the password cracker won't work.
I wish there was another way to help you, but at the same time I'm
glad there's not another way to help you. B-) Next time, use a
passphrase you'll remember!
