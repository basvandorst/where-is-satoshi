@_subject: Yubikey keytocard: "Bad secret key" 
I have tested this for you with my Yubikey 5 NFC.
It worked like a charme. I can now move my 4096 RSA keys to my Yubikey
without any problem.
You have to enter in admin to enable `key-attr` command in the gpg console:
$ gpg --edit-card
gpg/card> admin
gpg/card> key-attr
Perhaps a more explicit error message could be a good thing.
