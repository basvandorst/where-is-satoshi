never been connected to a network. Remove all hard drives for good measure.
Or, you could store you signing key on a CD-R in a safe deposit box 3
hours drive from your house, with the passphrase stored in another safe
deposit box 3 hours drive the other way from your house.
Or, you could just make damn sure you are the only one with access to
the computer... with a GOOD passphrase on it.
In some ways worse (and by far more common) is not theft of the private
key, but losing it completely. Make sure you have both a backup of it
and a revocation certificate.
As for the encrypted file systems... Windows supports whole disk
encryption in various forms as well.

Don't sign their keys?
Tell them if you do get a chance to sign their keys, "I am not going to
sign your key because you do not understand the implications of the web
of trust" and make them revoke their signatures on all the keys they
have signed without verifying them?
If you are lucky, they will be level 1 signatures, so you can exclude
them. If you are unlucky, they will be nonrevokable level 3 trust
signatures 10 deep.
Setting ownertrust to "none" in these cases is a good idea; at least
then your WOT won't be contaminated by their signatures.
However, I find it unlikely that they would even enter into your WOT to
start with; if that is the case, you need not even worry about what
their signatures are doing. Just set ownertrust to "none" and forget
about it. Use the --always-trust option when encrypting (IIRC GPG will
still "warn" you but will at least let you encrypt).

PGP newbies (because it's TOO easy to use, and the instructions likely

made local signatures on the keys, but didn't, and PGP automagically
"refreshed" their entire keyring, spreading these signatures into the
wild. For an excellent example of this, check the PGP global directory

non-local signing, and many keys in the keyserver network have PGP GD
sigs on them, again due to "automagic" refreshing (most likely through

Disclaimer: I'm not a developer, hence I haven't crossposted to -devel.
Any answers given here are my own opinions and might be completely
wrong. You have been warned.
KGPG is available for KDE and SeaHorse is available for GNOME.
There shouldn't be.
Either; they should be the same.
You /can/ encrypt thing symmetrically only using the --symmetric option;
keep in mind that this requires you and the recipients to have somehow
securely agreed on a passphrase to be used for such purposes. I suggest
Diceware ( be used to
generate such passphrases.
Signing with a symmetric algorithm is useless, because in order to
verify the signature you would need to have the key used to sign the
message digest (hash); however, if you have the key, you can generate
your own signature!
Public Key crytography relies on asymmetric algorithms, with a public
half and a secret half. If you have the public half, you can communicate
with (encrypt messages to and decrypt (verify) messages from) the secret
half; if you have the secret half, you can communicate with (encrypt
messages to (sign) and decrypt messages from) the public half. But if
you only have the public half, you cannot read what someone else has
encrypted using the public half.
Not entirely sure. I think it might actually do both, depending on your
Well, they /should/ be. The best answer I can give is the manpage entry:
You can use --openpgp to be sure.
A radiation source. Failing that, HotBits
( Failing that, dice. Failing that,
the Entropy Gathering Daemon ( which was
designed for use with GPG. The EGD homepage has instructions on how to
configure GPG to use it. EGD is the most practical of all these suggestions.
C is "certification" - I believe this means that you can sign other keys
with it (not entirely sure). A is "authentication" which I think means
you can use it for eg. SSH authentication, unlocking your computer -
authentication keys are probably most useful when on a smartcard.
Because not everyone has the internet bandwidth or processer/memory
requirements to encrypt/decrypt with anything much bigger. It's also
believed that at present, such keys are "sufficiently large" to prevent
all known attacks for the forseeable future. Again, no guarantees.
It shouldn't...
No idea. Probably for future uses.
Yes, although this can be disabled. The reasons for why you might want
are far too long to detail here.
It's also possible to generate RSA keys which do any combination of
signing, encryption and authentication, and DSA keys can any signing
and/or authentication (I think).
Note that ElGamal keys can NOT be used for signing, only encryption. I
believe that ElGamal signing keys leak the secret key.
Yes. I have no idea what the actual key structure is though.
If a sign+encrypt key is compromised, you stand to lose far more than if
only a signing or only an encryption key is compromised.
As I stated above, ElGamal can *NOT* be used for signing.
No. I have no idea what Diffie/Hellman keys are or how they work. Note
that Diffie/Hellman can also refer to the key exchange protocol or DSA
(DSS?) keys; it's possibly the most ambiguous term in public key
cryptography - "trust" comes a very close second.
The simplest (most understood) system is that which RSA uses. Wikipedia
has a fairly detailed article on it, available in:
 - English (
 - German (
 - French (
 - Italian (
 - Dutch (
and several other languages. Yes, the selfsigs bind UIDs and subkeys to the primary key. All UIDs and
subkeys are signed with the secret part of the primary key. If the
selfsig on a subkey was the the selfsigned fingerprint of the primary, I
could attach my subkey to anyone else's primary key.
I believe so.
Apart from to ensure that the secret part of the primary key exists and
that the subkey does indeed belong to the primary it is attached to, I
don't think so.
That the owner of the key is making a claim that they are who the UID
says they are?
Because subkeys are a relatively new thing; many keyservers (and
probably much software) cannot correctly deal with subkeys. Apart from
that, it makes no sense. I can't tell you exactly why; I just know that
it doesn't make sense.
The UIDs are connected the primary by 1) being attached to the primary
key, 2) being (self-)signed with the secret part of the primary key. GPG
(or any other OpenPGP program that I know of) won't allow you to change
a UID once it's been created; you can only add, delete and revoke UIDs.
Signatures are made with the keyid; hence you can have signing subkeys.
Yes. However, this *does* affect how trust calculations are done, since
signatures are made *to* the UIDs.
You might use the "primary" flag on a UID to indicate "I check this
email address every day; the others I only check once a week" or whatever.
Yes, although the last 2 are extractable from the signature itself,
depending on the particular software, keytype and such.
I think so.
The encrypted hash using (I have no idea what hash algorithm) of the UID
as a UTF-8 string. I think.
I believe that they are functionaly equivalent.
And the timestamp, verification level, expiry date, revocation status,
and notation data (eg. policy URL).
It contains whatever the UID says it contains. There are also PhotoIDs
and "freeform" UIDs, with the possibility of expansion in the "user
attribute packet" area (currently used for PhotoIDs).
Not entirely sure how these are stored; I believe as a packet attached
to the UID, with the selfsig timestamp updated whenever prefs are changed.
The GPG man pages. MDC lets you know when an encrypted message has been
tampered with; I have no idea what keyserver no-modify does and cannot
find it in the man page.
Notation data? Not entirely sure.
Policy URL is stored in signatures; to communicate a policy URL via a
UID, self-sign your key while specifying the policy URL. Photos get
their own UIDs.
I don't think the anything but the selfsig makes any claim about the
prefs on the key. Hrm. Maybe selfsigs *are* different.
There have been many suggestions on this. Read and ask around some more,
lots of people will tell you what they think. I have no personal opinion
on the matter (that I'm aware of).
No. It sounds more and more like selfsigs are indeed "special".
Whatever meets your security needs and keytype...
No. The s2k-* options determine how your secret key is stored locally
(or how it is exported, if you export it). Changing it does *not* change
the secret key, only how it is stored.
Note that if you change any s2k-* options, you need to change your
passphrase (even to the same thing) before the changes take effect.
What you put in your UID is up to you, but the contents will determine
who will/won't sign/trust your key.
If you planned to expire or revoke one... again, not entirely sure.
Aha! It lets you send signed email from an "insecure" environment
without exposing the secret part of the primary key. An excellent

Good idea, this one is pretty long :)
ECC is (apparantly) on it's way in a future version of OpenPGP; I
believe that there is a keytype reserved for it. The same goes for
ElGamal primary keys existed very briefly, but were found to be
incredibly insecure. I believe that they have been dropped from OpenPGP.
Wow, that's old :) Try the GNU Privacy Guard Handbook:
Yes. Earlier this year new timing attacks were published against SHA1
which have severely weakened the value of DSA keys, due to the fact that
current DSA signatures don't actually say in the signature block itself
which has was used. At present, RSA is "recommended" by various people,
myself included. Again, I'm not an expert - I haven't even properly
studied cryptography.
Bit-for-bit, ElGamal is believed to be "marginally" more secure. Several
people I have spoken to have done exactly this; generate an RSA
sign-only primary key, and add ElGamal encryption subkeys. It's even
possible to add extra RSA signing keys - I did this to "fix" my current
DSA key in the short-term.
Not exactly...
It's possible to fake the last 32 bits of a key, ie. the shortid. The
most common example of this is 0xDEADBEEF. However, I believe that the
other half (usually secret) of such a key is impossible to produce. Not
entirely sure though.
Forging key fingerprints is (as yet) not possible.
No guarantees of "correctness", EVER, but it's a reaonsable choice.
SHA384 is /useless/. It's just a truncuated version of SHA512. In my
mind (and remember, I'm just some guy answering your email), it's a
security risk.
RIPEMD160 is currently the best choice for a 160-bit hash algorithm,
provided you use an RSA key. SHA1 is not completely broken *yet*, but
it's a lot less secure than it was before Februrary.
MD5 is completly and utter broken, in real time.
Since you "don't care" about Windows users, bzip2 is fine. GPG is pretty
good though; I use Windows and don't have any problems with bzip2.
Join a Linux User's Group, put your key on Biglumber, and attend
RSA-S/ElGamal-E with your prefs should be OK; prefs can always be changed.
Set your s2k-* options as strong as you can and use the best RNG you can.
A lot fuller than mine :)
These are settings in gpg.conf and are only applied when making signatures.
Keep in mind that you will be "called on" to help debug new them if you
get one :)

The only place in the GPL where libraries are mentioned is in reference

instead of being able to interface with PGP on Windows systems.
In that case, it appears that GNU/Linux has the upper hand, because at

Since you're asking about 160-bit hashes on the GnuPG mailing list, I'll
assume that you're asking about using the "DSA2" option to use truncated
hashes with DSA keys that have q=160.
Now, I could be completely wrong, but "common sense" seems to suggest
that there's no reason why it's any safer; in fact, you may be worse off.
The reasoning for this answer is as follows: since DSA OpenPGP keys
don't have a hash function firewall, it just gives an attacker more
oppurtunities to find a hash collision; instead of having to pick from
SHA1 and RIPEMD160 as the hash algorithms to pick a colliding message
digest from, they can now add the SHA2 family of algorithms to their
choices; plus, instead of having to collide 160/160 bits, they now only
have to collide 160/{224,256,384,512} bits.
Again, I could be completely wrong, but that's what "common sense" seems
to suggest.

now. However, most versions of PGP will ignore the key flags on an RSA
subkey, so you may end up getting messages encrypted to your signing

@_subject: signature comments? 
From the man page:
--comment string
         Use  string  as a comment string in clear text signatures and
         ASCII armored messages or keys (see  --armor).   The  default
         behavior  is  not  to use a comment string.  --comment may be
         repeated multiple times  to  get  multiple  comment  strings.
         --no-comments  removes  all  comments.   It is a good idea to
         keep the length of a single comment below  60  characters  to
         avoid  problems with mail programs wrapping such lines.  Note
         that comment lines, like all other header lines, are not pro-
         tected by the signature.

The ownertrust format is:
where trust is:
0: (not settable)
1: expired (not sure what this means)
2: undefined
3: none
4: marginal
5: full
6: ultimate
128: disabled
If you want to set all valid keys with unspecified trust to marginal trust:
gpg --list-keys --with-colons --with-fingerprint `gpg --list-keys \
--with-colons | grep "pub:f:.*:-:" | sed -r -e \
's/pub:f:[0-9]+:[0-9]+:([A-F0-9]+):.*/0x\1/'` | grep "^fpr:" \
Note that this isn't entirely foolproof and may have unintended
consequences - make backups of your keyring(s) and trustdb first. I've
mainly used it semi-automatically where I check the status of some keys,
run the script, and then re-check the status of the keys.

@_subject: Two servers...one KeyPair 
As someone a lot smarter than me pointed out in a message I can't find
when I suggested "just copy the .gnupg directory" (and with a bit of
background info thrown in, and I'm not a cryptographer and haven't
really studied the GnuPG internals so I might be wrong):
GPG is a hybrid cryptosystem; messages are (symmetrically) encrypted to
"random" session keys, which are then (asymmetrically) encrypted to a
number of recipient public keys. Part of the security of the system is
that the session key is "random" or as close to it as possible; because
GPG will work on many different and varying systems, there is no
guarantee of a system-wide random data source, so you can't just read
from /dev/random or /dev/urandom every time you want a bit of random
data, because it might not exist (and these have their own problems).
So, GPG has it's own internal pseudorandom number generator. In order to
speed things up a bit, it normally has an internal seed of pooled random
data - which it stores in .gnupg/random_seed while it's not using it.
When GPG decides it wants some random data, it generates it using this
file as the seed - so if you know what the random seed file was, it's
(somewhat) easier to predict what the next lot of random data is going
to be. So, you don't want two installations of GPG to have the same
random_seed, because you're going to start producing deterministic output...
