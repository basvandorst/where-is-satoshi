Is it possible to send the key passphrase to gnupg in the initial
command when clearsigning to prevent an input prompt?
Thanks for any help,

Hi John,
Thanks, I found the MLM from Google so I didn't know about
 :o)
I found a post which gives me exactly what I need, although for my own
sanity can you tell me how GnuPG knows that $passphrase is the
passphrase and $msg is the message in the stdin?

Can anyone see anything wrong with this script line? It's part of a PHP
script although should be the same in most C based languages.
$command = "echo '$passphrase\n$plaintext' | gpg --clearsign --batch
--passphrase-fd 0";
Thanks for any help,

It goes through a bi-directional pipe which I think prevents any
security issues. I was wondering whether you can see any mistakes as
it's not working.
