Most/many/all key servers have an email interface which many may find
preferable if for no other reason than that by keeping the mails they
have a clear permanent record of what was done and when.  It is IMHO
unfortunate to give the impression that "the web" is the best way to
do everything just because it is there.

Is it true that keyservers influenced by NAI seem happy grab keys from
public servers like those cooperating with pgp.net but are unwilling
to share their keys with the likes of pgp.net?  Is it also true that
recent PGP software has been distributed to put keys only to the NAI

The above conjecture seems to be consistent with my limited
observations.  It is however only a conjecture.
So, to repeat the original question, where is _the most effective_

One compelling reason for PGP signing all mail is so that you have
creditable deniablity when someone falsifies mail making it look as if
it came from you.  To be creditable you want to have established the
pattern long before the trouble arises.  It is more important in this
connection to have a well established history of signing all mail than
it is that each correspondent be willing or able to verify every
signature.  With news and mailing lists there is a good chance that
someone besides you will spot a PGP message that does not verify.  In
my experience the only significant mail based process that has been
persistently unable to handle PGP signed mail was the domain
registration services at NAI but that problem was easily solved when
other registrars became available.  (BTW and ironically, forged and
spoofed domain registration templates was the first impersonation with
material consequences that I had to deal with.  I would estimate that
during the last 8 years or so I have seen at least two or three
incidents of email impersonation among my acquaintances.)
Another reason is for recognition.  When you use one signature
consistently for many purposes folks can recognize the owner of your
PGP key as a consistent "network identity" even when they have had no
way to verify your real world identity through the web of trust.  GPG
'lsign-key' is convenient for keeping track of such keys.
Finally the social and political reasons for making visible and
routine use of cryptography, including signatures, is at least as
important now as it was ten years ago when Phil Zimmerman and others
urged folks to PGP sign all email.  One can now choose signatures that
are smaller and less obtrusive than was possible just a few years ago.

PGP Guardian worked well for me at first but not with GPG keys even
after they claimed to be using a version of PGP with which I was
inter-operating in the hands of others.  Two of their help desk
supervisors strongly suggested not to use PGP in any version.  I'm
afraid I cannot recall when this was but the troubles persisted for me
during several months when my GPG produced signatures were being
verified by other PGP users.

I found a registrar with a simple web site using SSL and from which I
have since received excellent service.  I do not believe this is the
place to discuss the pros and cons of the Domain Registrars other than
perhaps to mention that  lists legal
issues which lead me straight to the registrar that I choose.

Compared to what?  I don't like web interfaces either but given a
choice between NSI's "Mail-From" or "Crypt-PW" and SSL it was easy for
me.  Could an expect script civilize the web interfaces?

I'm using the internal driver.  No pcsclite.  Experimenting with
pcsclite (Debian package libpcsclite1) did not help so I purged it.
Just now, running without 'use-agent' in ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf, I noticed
that just after 'gpg --card-status' gives the expected result I see
the following:
,----[ gpg --use-agent --card-status ]
gpg: selecting openpgp failed: unknown command
gpg: OpenPGP card not available: general error
Then 'gpg --card-status' gives the expected result but then after that
I see:
,----[ gpg2 --card-status ]
gpg: OpenPGP card not available: Unknown IPC command
I get the similar but not identical results on a Dubian etch box with
the following: On the etch box, 'gpg2 --card-status' gives something like:
        gpg: DBG: connection to agent established
        gpg: OpenPGP card not available: Unsupported operation
when the immediately preceding 'gpg --card-status' gave the expected
result.  Without 'use-agent' in ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf and before doing
'gpg --use-agent --card-status' I did not notice any difference
between the two boxen.
What can I do to better isolate or characterize this problem?
