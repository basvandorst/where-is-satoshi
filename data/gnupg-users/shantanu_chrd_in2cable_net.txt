@_subject: GPGrelay configuration problem 
Hash: SHA1
I am a new user of GnuPG and seem to be having trouble configuring
GPGrelay to work with 2 email accounts.
I have current editions of GnuPG, GPGshell and GPGrelay.
My operating system is Windows XP
I use OE latest version for the GPGrelay
I am trying to configure two email addresses surgeon
and the present one to work with GPGrelay
When I try to configure the second SMTP and POP with GPGrelay, I get a
message saying the port is already taken
According to the GPGrelay web site on installation, I should change
the port 32025 to 33025 when I add another SMTP and the port 32110 to
33110. This should enable another email connection through GPGrelay on
Windows XP.
The problem is that the GPGrelay says that the 32025 port is already
taken when I add another SMTP. It also says the port 32110 is already
taken when I try to add another POP3.
Unfortunately, when I do this, OE says that it is unable to connect
with 33025 and also 33110 ports.
I have tried this a dozen times by now.
How do you connect more than one POP and SMTP through GPGrelay?
It wasn't until quite late in life
that I discovered how easy it is to say,
'I don't know'.

Hi Kevin,
Thanks for your reply.
I have already configured for OE as I pointed out:
The problem is that the GPGrelay says that the 32025 port is already
taken when I add another SMTP. It also says the port 32110 is already
taken when I try to add another POP3.
According to the GPGrelay web site on installation, I should change
the local port 32025 to 33025 when I add another SMTP and the local port 32110 to
33110. This should enable another email connection through GPGrelay on
Windows XP.
Unfortunately, when I do this, OE says that it is unable to connect
with 33025 and also 33110 ports.
The remote ports for GPGrelay are 110/25 for the POP/SMTP
The local ports as described above are exactly as recommended on the
GPPrelay web site.
Thank you being there.
I have yet to see any problem,
which, when you looked at it the right way,
did not become still more complicated.
So the inbound POP data from your ISP would be:
==>Incoming mail==>GPGR port in 110/GPGR port out 6110==>
    Eudora port in 6110
For outbound smtp mail:
Eudora smtp port 625==>GPGR port in 625/GPGR port out 25==>ISP
If you have a second account it must have different port numbers
assigned and not match the 6110/625 used above.
The "Remote Port" field in GPGR's Relay Configuration Screen for POP
SMTP should be 110/25 as these can be shared and be the same for each
account. The Local Port field must be unique and different for each
Pardon the lousy schematic. I'm no artist. Hopefully, you'll get the

For windows users, Nullify is the easiest install.
How does one upgrade to GNUPG 1.2.5 after the Nullify install?
