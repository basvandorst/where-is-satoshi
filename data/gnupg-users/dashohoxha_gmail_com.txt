@_subject: Procedure of deriving a pruivate key from the password 
To my understanding, the key is not derived from the passphrase, it is
generated independently of it. The passphrase is used to encrypt the
private key, in order to protect it. This is symmetric encryption and the
passphrase is stored nowhere.
I am not sure whether this helped you to understand it or made you even
more confuse.

GnuPG is also aimed at people comfortable with working at the command line.
So I would say that the potential audience of EasyGPG is greater than that
of plain GPG.

here that are not accustomed at them (me and you).

@_subject: Using a passphrase FD from variable and piped data for encryption 
Thanks for comparing me to  Phil Zimmerman. I am taking this as a
compliment :)
What I mean is that the security of `pw` depends on `gpg`
It can use both symmetric and assymetric encryption, depending of how you
want to use it.
I also try to be careful on the script about not leaking the passphrase
somehow. This is for the case of symmetric enryption. For the assymetric
encryption the passphrase is handled by the pinentry, so it is as safe as
`gpg` itself.
I don't think that the encryption used by KeePass (and other tools like it)
is stronger or safer than the encryption of `gpg`.
If there are any problems, most probably they are on my script, and I
beleive that they can be fixed.

Any comments or feedback is welcome. Actually I would prefer the task tool
of GitHub [5] for reporting bugs and feature requests, but either way is Ok.
I would like some help on these issues (if somebody can help):
 - How to use `egpg` properly with mutt, alpine, etc.
 - I think that it should be possible to customize Linux desktops (LXDE,
XFCE, GNOME, KDE, etc.) to add key-combinations (shortcuts) or
context-menus, to run some command on a selected file. This could be useful
for the commands `egpg seal`, `egpg open`, `egpg sign`, `egpg verify`, etc.
But I have no idea how to do this.
 - Write a script/command that automates the process of copying a key to a
smartcard [6]. I could have tried it myself but I don't have any smartcards.

I have added a feature to egpg to export the key and convert it to 3D
images, included in a PDF file:
This PDF file can be printed and used as a paper backup. It can be restored
with the help of a webcam and a barcode reader program (like zbar).
What do you think of paper backups, are they useful? I have seen some
advice that recommend them, and even claim that they are safer and
more durable/reliable than digital backups.
I think that lots of people are still familiar and comfortable with storing
keeping hard-copy documents safe and secure (although we live in the
digital age).
It could also be nice to generate a PDF page that has the gpg key
in the format of a business card: name, email, fingerprint (maybe in barcode
format as well). It can repeat several copies of the business card in the
page (for example in 5 rows and 2 columns).
Any idea or advice on how to implement this? Maybe starting with a latex
template and converting it to PDF? Or any simpler way?

@_subject: Paper backup 
The idea of Paperkey is to reduce the output, so that it can be easily
typed by hand
(when you need to restore the key).
For a 4096 key, the output of Paperkey is still too big to be typed by
hand, and even
too big to be QR-encoded straight away. You have to split it and QR-encode
each piece
But once you have to split the data and QR-encode it, it doesn't make much
difference whether you have 2 pages of output or 8 pages. So, it doesn't
make sense
reducing the output, and it doesn't make sense using Paperkey anymore. At
this point
Paperkey only makes things more complex, instead of making them simpler.
Thanks to everybody for the feedback.

I think that certify and sign are very similar, so it doesn't hurt if the
primary key is both "cert" and "sign".
I do it in batch mode like this:
 - Anyway, I generate a sign-only subkey later, and gnupg-2.0 picks by default
the latest sign subkey, when it comes to signing, so the primary key
normally will not be used for signing (which is what you want).
I use the script above for automatic (batch) key generation.

@_subject: Automating the generation of master keys 
You are right, it only works with gnupg-2.0. For gnupg-2.1.11 the tricks
above do not work and I had to change the script:
 - I don't remember exactly why they didn't work, but I think that in gnupg-2.1
the pinentry is used more frequently and I couldn't find any way to send
data to it from stdin.
I wish that the batch mode was more pervasive in gpg2, so that my scripts
could do the interaction with the user and then just use gpg2 in batch mode
to get the job done.
I couldn't find out how to use --status-fd properly, and maybe using it
make the logic of the scripts more complex, because my script would have
to take care of all the possible outputs of --status-fd, in all the
possible cases.
I agree, this is a stupid trick.

I tried to change the script to match the version of gnupg, but it didn't
work well.
I was getting password prompts from pinentry for each subkey that I was
adding, and I couldn't manage to automate the interaction with the pinentry.
Finally I decided that the interaction was more complex than what I wanted
it to be,
so I dropped the generation of additional subkeys. Now there is only one
main key for cert/sign and a subkey for decryption (these two are generated
in batch mode).
If I have to answer also the questions "Are you sure you want to do this?"
and "This is a weak password, do you really want to use it?", I think that
this is more complex than it should be.
A simpler interaction would be: this is the action that I want to do and
are the options/parameters, please do it for me. No questions involved,
especially no pinentry prompts, and no unneccessary output.
A good example of this is the batch mode of key generation.
But I know that this is not possible right now. Even if extended batch mode
is planed to be implemented, it will not be there before version 2.2 or 3.0
For the time being I am satisfied with what we have.

This is a well known issue. If you install haveged: `apt-get install

What is entropy and why it is slow? This is beyond my understanding.
After importing your key, you also need to sign it as "ultimately trusted",

can be done with `gpg --edit-key` and then either `sign` or `trust` (try

Hi Bernhard, thanks for having a look at it.
On Mon, Mar 21, 2016 at 3:05 PM, Bernhard Reiter Yes, but the overall number of commands and options supported
is 10 times smaller than those of gpg2. Tutorials about egpg are also
much shorter. And the default values of the options are more suitable
for a beginner (at least in my opinion).
I hope that the transition will be smoother, once they are familiar with
the basics.
I have heard that you can use shell scripts on Windows (with cygwin).
To switch from using egpg to using gpg2 you just need to change GNUPGHOME
from '~/.gnupg' to '~/.egpg/.gnupg'.
I don't think they clash because that is a contracted job this is a
software project.
The problem with Python is that I am not familar with it (and there may be
other problems too, that I don't know).
But if you could fork egpg and re-implement it in Python, it could be great.
I guess these two are suggestions for EasyGpg2016.

Ok, criticism is always good, although I know from my experience that 90%
of it is wrong.
There is plenty of documentation about gpg out there, both old and new one.
Maybe I am not smart enough, but believe me that I have spent a huge time
with gpg documentation, many years ago and recently, but I still feel lost
at it. For example I have seen some tutorials which explain some best
practices about how to move the private key offline. I believe that it is
time to write some scripts to automate these best practices, instead of
writing more tutorials about them.
There is no pupose in using a different homedir, except for being prudent
not to mess with the existing keyring that people may already have. If you
want, you can modify the config of egpg to use the default homedir, but you
should not do it unless you are confident with using egpg.
The expiry of one month is good for beginners, who may play around and
don't really know what they are doing. If they loose the passphrase, or
just forget at all about gpg after playing with it for some time, this is
not going to have long lasting consequencies. Those who still remember the
passphrase can always extend the expiration at any time, and make it as
long as they wish.
For simplicity, egpg tries to make sure that there is always only one valid
private key at any time.
And yes, there are still some bugs and things to be improved, it is not
perfect yet.
If you don't like this approach and think that you can do something better,
this is fine, just give it a try, I have nothing against it. If you think
that gpg is great and it needs no improvements, this is still fine.

This is an important point (using the API), because trying to use `gpg` in
scripts is terribly difficult. I don't understand why `gpg` does not follow
the unix philosophy of being easily used in scripts and cooperating easily
with other commands.
So, if there are some things to be improved on gpg, this is one of them:
make it more scriptable. Alternatively, make a bash wrapper of Gpgme (which
can be used on bash scripts).
The other option (for EasyGnuPG) is to be reimplemented in Python or Ruby

@_subject: A better interface to the GnuPG-Framework (Re: EasyGnuPG) 
I think that deciding the desired use case(s) is important.
In a certain use case only 5-6 commands/operations/options may be needed,
not 300+.
In my opinion this is one of the problems with `gpg`. It is so generic that
it tries to cover all the possible cases. Consequently, it is huge, and
difficult, and suitable for none of them. It is more like a library than
like a user interface. Any GUI that tries to follow it faithfully will be
difficult, confusing and unintuitive. Each GUI should try to simplify
according to its specific use case.
Another problem that people have noticed with PGP (and inherited to GPG by
trying to follow PGP faithfully), is the confusing terminology (private
key, public key, etc.). In egpg I have tried to improve this by using the
term "key" for the personal key-pair, and using the term "contact" for the
public keys of the people with whom we communicate. This term ("contact")
maybe does not have an exactly correct meaning, but it is widely popular,
even among dummies who have never used anything but a (non-smart) mobile
phone. If you say "contact" they immediately think about the details of a
person with whom you want to communicate
The names of the commands and options can be improved as well, to better
fit the use case on which the GUI app is being used. I have also tried to
make sure that there is only one valid (unrevoked and unexpired) private
key at any time. Allowing more than one would increase the complexity of
the interface and make things more complicated. In certain cases you may
need more than one valid keys, but these cases are rare and can be handled
by other means.

I find the Lego analogy very suitable. This is how unix/linux tools work.
For example, converting from binary to asc format can be done by an
external tool, through piping. No need to cluter the code, the interface
and the docs with extra options. I am sure that there are other cases as
well, if one thinks carefully about it.

I don't think that automagic would be a good thing.
I still think that the colons format is a bit difficult to process and not
so suitable.
But most importantly, I think that these two options are not enough, it is
not as easy as that. For example there is also --passphrase-fd,
--command-fd, --logging-fd etc. and sometimes I still don't manage to
control properly all the input and output, or I have to do spectacular
things that complicate things a lot. I think that it doesn't have to be
that difficult.

The implementation will not break, as long as it is based on the latest
stable release.
When the next stable release of gpg is out, the implementation will be
adjusted to match it.
You are right, I find it strange and counterintuitive too. I can try to fix
it on egpg.
Regarding your main question above (I have also answered it previously), I
think that `gpg` (the command) is monolithic, bloated with functionality
and options, the docs are like a maze and not clearly structured, the
number of commands and options is huge, there is no clear distinction
between the commands and the options, the supported use cases are not so
clear (it actually tries to support everything), the default values are not
well-thought, the terminology is confusing and counter-intuitive, etc.
Do you think these can be fixed with simple patches?

You got this wrong. It does not enforce 1 month expiry. Right after
creating the key you can change its expiry to 10y, if you wish. But if you
say nothing, after 1m you will have to renew it (if you still remember the
passphrase). This is like a safety measure for people who are not familiar
with gpg.
What is wrong with that? As long as there is a subkey for encryption, gpg
will use the subkey for encryption, even if the primary key is capable of
I did not judge the people who built GnuPG. And I know that it is easier to

This should tell gpg2 to get the passphrase from the stdin (terminal).
If it doesn't work, try also `--passphrase-fd=0 <<< "your-passphrase" `
You can also try to through `--batch` in the mix, and then it should
definitely work (stop complaining).

Thanks for this explanation.
I beleive that an A key (or subkey) that is never used, does not hurt. So,
my default is to create one.
On the other hand, if an A key is created, I beleive that it is better for
it to be a subkey, rather than a primary key. The reason is that an A key
most probably needs to be used frequently (for example daily), but you may
wish to keep a primary key offline, and these two requirements conflict
with each-other.

So, maybe they will be safer if they don't use GPG at all? No efforts to
facilitate GPG should be made because this will undermine the security of
the users? GPG is only for the super-experts?
I don't get this logic. I beleive that in certain conditions and under
certain assumptions, only a small subset of GPG is needed. The rest can
just not be used or have reasonable defaults. I beleive that simplification
is possible and useful.
