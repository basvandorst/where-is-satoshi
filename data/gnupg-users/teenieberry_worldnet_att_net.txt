I am new to gnupg, and as such do not always understand the gpg.man.  So
I may have misunderstood the command.
I am useing gpg 1.06, and windows 2000 with service packs one and two
The command follows:
( --export-ownertrust )
I have tryied this command with the command ( --output c:\trustdb.txt ).
But he output always is put on the screen.  Never a file.  The only way
I have been able to export the file is to use ( --enarmor trustdb.gpg ),
this gives a armored back up which I can dearmor.  I hope that this way
is alright as a work arround.
Thank you for your time.

Hello Erik;
Thank you for your help.  It does work.  I do not see you example in the
manual.  I did not add ( > ) after just the file name.  I did not have
to do so when exporting
my keys.   Is this the only case or should all file outputs begin with
 > ).
As a related question do I need to put ( > ) in the import ownertrust

Hello Jim;
Does this ( > ) redirect only work for exports.  I did not have to use
it when I exported my keys.  I just put the file name behind.
I suppose that redirect means output only, but I will ask because I
never have had to use it before.  Is this a Linux command ?
Hope it does not anger, amusement is fine.

@_subject: notes 
Greetings From:
Palm Bay, Fl. USA
Hello WinPT Users;
As a "newbe" to gpg, I have had a journey so to speak.  Hope my findings will help others.
So was born " NeWbe NoTeS ".
Newbe note one:
In some situations the Command ( --output [ file name ] ), may not always work.  A user told me that on windows, or in windows it might not always work.
But as I was told the redirect command ( > ) does.  So please try them.
I found that I could not export  the trustdb file unless I used ( > ).
Thought I had found a bug " :>) ".  But I did not.  Just found that I did not know what I was doing.  I sure am glad that you the user did.
Newbe Note two:
Importing your secret key into a clean system, or one in which the program GPG was reinstalled is not enough to make it work.
You will have to go into the edit menu, and " enable the key ".  If you do not do so you to may spend days trying other things out.
Like downloading and reinstalling "gpg" on a number of different pc's, running a number of different versions of windows, I did.  Thought I had found a bug.  Did not however, just found out how much I did not understand.
Whether it is not understanding what you may have read or not.  Or perhaps it is just being afraid to ask. Hence newbe notes was born.
If you all have any other things that are not spoken of but would be a help.  Please let me know.  I will may be put out " NeWbE nOtEs " on a regular basis.  If you have a question about "gpg", or "winpt", and can not ask.  Let me know, I will.
The remarks above are in ( no !, no ! ) way meant to be critical of the work of others.  I am not a programmer.  I have been told that a port of a program from one operating system to another may have quirks in it.  Also I use Windows 200 pro with service packs one and two installed.  You may not know it but different versions of windows do not act, or react the same.  Nice of them to make it that way.

Hello Again;
The only help I can give is on one item.
Do not send your "private key", only your "public key".  Also try a few
servers, also try useing your email adrress to send.  I did this in
"winpt" with no real problem, except had to try about 3 servers.
On a nothe not,  You may want to try "winpt", because it has the Current
"gpg" in it if you download the installer.  Also you do not have to
register "gpg" or do anything to your "autoexec.bat".

@_subject: gpg and gui 
I have found in my very little use of "gpg and gui's", that a good idea
may be to stick with one "gui", and use the command line when you can
not do something in the "gui".
An example I cound not use my "private key" when I imported it back into
"winpt".  I had to go into "gpg" command line and "enable it".  This
then made the key useable.
I also found that I could cause "winpt" not to open up after I changed
key trusts and removed key user id's.  I would have to reload the
program, and import my keys back into it.

@_subject: diskperf-y ? 
Thank you for your respones.  I was just wondering because when I used
"pgp", it told you how big.  Some would even go as high as a "8k" key.
I did try and make one once it took 36 hours to make a "8k" RSA key.
And "1" hour to encrypt a small file.
My version of "gpg" does not allow one to generate a "rsa" key.  I
suppose a future version will allow one to generate a different key.  A
newer version of pgp263 does allow one to generate lots of different
ones.  But I also understand that I can change the cypher used in "gpg".

@_subject: Changeing hash/algorythm 
I am more than a little confused with changeing the different
encryption, and signing hash.
I thought that when a key was made.  A preferred set was encoded into
the keys.  That you could not change this.  Except after the fact.  By
editing the key properties.
Confussion,  what is the option or command to use a different
encryption. or signing hash do then.  How is this communicated to the
user, who has your key which says you use something else.
Hope I was not confussing.
Also I read in one of the manuals that you could compile "gpg"
differently, so you could pick a differrent pair at key generation.  If
I id not misread this.  Is this avaliable for downloading any where.  Or
is this a feature of 107, I have read that the key management was

Second,  Have the gpg developers considered adding something like this
to gpg.  Even if as a download from their site as a gpg utilty.  If in
gpg asa command like ( gpg --menue ), or ( gpg --dialog ).
I do like it and it is a reall good feature for people like my self who

My response to this:
I think that the "gnupg" programers are very carefull in not
quickly releasing a product for Windows.  I asked before and
was  told  that it is not a simple task, and some things may
not work after being ported to a different " OS ".
I  know very little about  "gnupg".  But the folks doing the
work  seem  to be very carefull about what they do, and what
they let "gnupg" do, or how it's done.
Also  one  person  told  me they do not have lots of Windows
programers  helping out.  This may have changed.  But I like
not haveing to download new releases after a new version has
been  posted  because  of  speed.  Being a non - programer I
just  have  to  trust  those who are.  If it where easy more
Windows folks would help out.

Hello GNUPG - USERS,
I  just  read  the post on locking the list to non - subscribers. If you
are looking for someone to scan or look at non - subscriber posts. I may
be able to help you out.
I  did  get help from the group prior to subscribeingto it. It is a nice
feature,  and  goes  along way to makeing the group freindly to possible
new users of "GPG".
I  would  ask  that you consider asking the non - subscriber to put in a
subject  like Non - Subscriber Post. This is so I can add a filter to my
e-mail client.
I  also think that a " mail to" line would be a good thing to ask for as
well. This is so the poster would get a response, and I will not.
Since  I  have  a e-mail client that is feature rich, more things then I
know  what to do with. May be someone on the list would let me use their
e-mail address as a trial to get it to work right.
I believe I can either redirect the posts, or forward them.
I will not edit in any way the post. I will not keep e-mail addresses. I
will also ask for some guidance on things not to send.

I am haveing problems changeing my keys preferrances.  I have this line
uncommented prior to generating a key.
" # default-preference-list S3 H3 "
I then generate a " Test " key useing the defaults from the menue.
After generateing the key I go back and recomment the above option.
When I chose this key to use for either encrypting and signing a file.
Or to clearsign a text file I find that my signature perfaerance is not
being used by thr key.  My encryption preferance CAST5 is used.  But my
signature preferance RIPEMD160 is not being used, SHA1 is always use.
I can verify this by useing the " -v " switch in the command line, or by
placeing " verbose " in my option file.
Am I ueing this option incorrectly.  I would like to generate one
non-standard key for my personal work.
