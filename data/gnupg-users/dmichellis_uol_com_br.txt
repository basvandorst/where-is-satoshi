@_subject: Getting Started with gnuPG 
Hi all!
I download the gnuPG for Windows (no jokes, please!) and I am completely
lost about how to start to use it...
When it will generate the pairs, gnuPG ask for the key (768 bytes or more).
This key is "buyed" from some organizations (like VeriSign), or I can just
make my own key and use it?
Thanks a lot for take your atention!!
