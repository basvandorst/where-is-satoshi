@_subject: GPG on Windows 7? 
Is it possible to use GPG on Windows 7 (32 and 64 bit)?
We have kept using Gpg4Win 1.1.4 for some time since when we tried the
version 2.0.0 it killed certain functions on our PC:s (I think for
instance Outlook went haywire).
But now our IT person says GPG does not work on Windows 7, so what is
the final verdict here?
We use GPGee for encrypting files since we cannot use Outlook email
encryption, so we need this to work in the Explorer for Windows 7 too.
Or is there a  new version that can handle the Outlook emails
properly? Note: we do not want to change into only using plain text

On Wed, 17 Nov 2010 08:45:16 -0500, Jerry Well, GPGee was installed with the GPG4Win 1.1.4 that we use. It makes
it very simple to encrypt files from Windows Explorer.
We essentially do not encrypt email because of the various problems
encountered with Outlook versions. People in the organization use
Office 2003, 2007 and possibly 2010 and it has been such a lot of
problems when we tried to use GPGOL in Outlook so we decided it was
not worth the effort.
Instead we enter the confidential information into files, which are
really documentation of the projects we work on. These files are then
encrypted using GPGee by right-clicking the file in Windows Explorer
and selecting the GPGee encrypt pop-up menu item.
When I posted it was because my co-worker had reported that the IT
person at his end had told him that GPG does not work in Win7.
The PC he had at home was a Win7 whereas the work PC was a WinXP where
the GPG4Win 1.1.4 installed GPGee is working just fine.
He wants to get GPG also on his Win7 PC so he can process the files
also at home.
I have to ask him if he runs the 32 bit or 64 bit version of Win7.
Today I have googled the problem a bit more and found:
1) GPGee seems to have died so there is no new version
2) It is replaced in GPG4Win by GPGEx (explorer extension)
3) GPGEx does not work on Win7 X64 because Microsoft requires pop-up
plugins to Explorer to use 64 bit DLL:s and GPGEx is a 32 bit DLL...

Thanks for the tip. I will advice the use of this combination to my
collegue. I have downloaded and installed GPGshell 3.76 on my XP PC
and it works just fine together with my GnuPG 1.4.9 installation. :-)
So now I have two context menu items (GPGee and GPGshell).

I downloaded and installed GPGshell 3.76 in my WinXP pro machine and
now I have both GPGee and GPGshell context menus....
But I guess that on W7x64 I would have to use the GPGtools program to
encrypt a file, right?
Or go via the GPGtray program, rightclick the tray icon and select

Now I have tried to install from scratch on a Win7 X64 PC.
I used these:
- GnuPG 1.4.11 windows client binary
- GPGshell 3.76
I had to manually add the GnuPG install folder to my system path for
GPGshell to work.
After this I could import my keyrings and start using GPG on Win7.
Seems to work for file encryption even though it is a big drawback
that the Explorer shell integration is missing. Now I have every time
to navigate a long way in order to encrypt a file instead of doing it
directly from Windows Explorer.
Now another GPGshell problem:
GPGshell insists on showing all its dialogs in Swedish whereas I want
them to be in English. I tried to find a language configuration dialog
or something but failed.
Is this program really so stupid that it insists on using the language
of my keyboard layout as the dialog language??? I can't belive it, so
I ask if someone here could explain how I can change it?

GPGshell does not really give me any convenient way to encrypt files
since Explorer integration is missing...

I want to get my hands on the utilities shipped with Gpg4Win
(Kleopatra, GpgEx etc) but I do *not* want to have my GnuPG 1.4.11
clobbered in the process.
Unfortunately the Gpg4Win 2.0.4 installer lets me choose if I want to
install *all* of the extras by having a checkbox for each. But the
GnuPG itself is *not* optional! And it installs the less stable 2.0.14
So there seems to be no way to keep the existing GnuPG 1.4.11 and
still get the tools installed. :-(
Or did I miss some workaround for this?
Note: I already have the latest GPG (from about a month ago) but it is
based on the 1 tree rather than 2.

Thanks, I am just grasping for some way to get this stuff working
*comfortably* with Win7 X64.
Microsoft has decided that 32 bit applications cannot be allowed to
integrate with the Windows Explorer context sensitive menu. This is
where I do almost all my work by right clicking the file I want to
process (edit, copy, open, encrypt, decrypt etc). But now since i got
my latest laptop at work it came with Win7 X64 Professional and a
*lot* of my applications that were earlier integrated (in XP Pro) are
now invisible including GPGee, GPGshell (tested today) and my old
workhorse UltraEdit.
So I am trying to find *something* that can work for encryption use in
Win7 X64. I don't particularly like the command prompt for that...

Which version of WinZip?
I use WinZip 9.0 SR1 and it won't show up in Win7X64 Expolerer pop-up.
So I had to install z-zip in order to easily create new zipfiles...
My UltraEdit is version 8.20 and the same thing happens.
I also used to put a few other commands manually into the explorer
pop-up by entering data in the registry, but that does not work
anymore either.
But if it is possible for 32 bit applications to integrate into the
Windows Explorer on Win7X64, then surely the developers of the GnuPG
add-ons like GpgEx and GPGshell should be able to do so as well?
Why haven't any such application integration appeared?
Unfortunately I am not a programmer on that level so I could not help
out myself, otherwise i would have done so.

Winzip was just used as an example of an application that had lost its
context menu entry in Win7X64. What I am really after is the context
menu for GPG operations on files since for GPG there is no GUI
application to use instead, just the command line...

But unfortunately for some reason the installer failed to start. I

I have already the GnuPG 1.4.9 installed via GPG4Win and the newest

Should I uninstall everything first or can I just run the installer

I found a note in the help pages that I should uninstall first, which
I did. Now I got version 2.0.4 installed and working, but with a very
irritating misconfiguration:
Some pages in Kleopatra and GpgEX display text in Swedish even though
I selected English as the language during install.
I have not yet found a way to fix this and curiously Kleopatra
Configuration shows the same behaviour itself! All tabs excpet the
rightmost are English, whereas this one is Swedish.....
I want all of my windows and dialogs to speak English. :-(

Warning - Long answer:
I tested GPG4Win 2.0.0 in Feb 2008 and found that:
- The GpgOL plug-in made my Outlook 2003 crash
- I read about the switch from GPG1 to GPG2 that there were many
issues, so I assumed that the crashes were caused by GPG2 or/and GpgOL
in that distribution.
In previous versions of Gpg4Win using the GPG1 tree the GpgOL plug-in
did not work all that well, it seemed to only work for me but not for
my co-workers who were located on the corporate LAN. So we stopped
using the Outlook plug-in. But to stop the crasches of Outlook we had
to uninstall Gpg4Win 2.0.0 altogether and instead install Gpg4Win
1.1.4 (still not using the plug-in).
I have been following (infrequently) the Gpg4Win development since
then but all the time there have been disclaimers about the Outlook
plug-in making me believe that it is not a worthwhile thing to use.
But now that GPGee has disappeared from the Windows Explorer context
menu on Windows 7 X64 I need to find some other solution to use for
file encryption on Windows and with a GUI interface. This is the
reason for this and a couple of other of my threads.
Today I tested the version 2.0.4 on a virtual machine running XP-Pro
SP3. Had to uninstall the previous 1.1.4 version first.
It seemed to work for file encryption in my environment (actually my
existing keyrings were carried over, which was one of my concerns
regarding uninstalling).
Then I connected a VPN channel to the company and started Outlook
2003, which is set up on this virtual machine to use Exchange mode.
Then I made an email (simple one using the HTML editor) to my private
address and set it to be encrypted.
A new dialog popped up requesting me to select certificates for the
recipient and twice for myself.
Then it started sending the message, which took a while and then
seemed to succeed.
However, after a short time I received back an error message claiming
that the recipient address could not be reached.
So I made another email to the same recipient but without encryption.
This succeeded without error messages.
Only the last one actually reached my external account....
So my conclusion is that GpgOL is still not usable, but now at least
it does not crash Outlook 2003. Question is if it does crash OL 2007
or 2010?
For your information the system setup is as follows:
My normal (non-virtual) system:
- Windows XP Pro SP3 attached to the company domain
- (The XP PC soon to be replaced with a Win7X64 one)
- Outlook 2003 in POP3 mode, because I work 10000 km from the company
- Internet connection by way of ADSL and a POP3 gateway in the
firewall at the company
Co-worker systems:
- PC:s located on the company LAN
- Windows XP and 7 in different combinations
- Outlook 2003, 2007 and possibly 2010
- Email via Exchange server on company LAN
- Internet connection via company firewall
My best bet would probably be to test installing Gpg4Win 2.0.4 but
making sure to unselect the GpgOL plug-in, I guess....

@_subject: How can I drop a file for encryption on the GPA FileManager 
I have now installed Gpg4Win 2.0.4 on a Win7X64 machine where I
previously had installed GnuPg 1.4.11. I first uninstalled GnuPG.
My problem now is how to actually encrypt files when the Explorer
pop-up menu is missing....
It would be OK if there was a way to start the GPA FileManager with a
file path on the command line. Then I could add a manual entry in the
Registry that would invoke the proper exe file with the selected file
as the argument.
I hope that the File Manager would show up with my file in the list of
files to process.
But I need to know which executable to start and what command line
arguments to use.
Can someone please enlight me on this?

@_subject: How can I drop a file for encryption on the GPA FileManager 
Found the solution by experimentation:
The GPA executable is gpa.exe (surprise!) in the GnuPG directory.
I also found that if I send it a file on the command line it opens up
the File Manager window rather than the key manager that is otherwise
So I have added the following to the registry to get a context menu
item when selecting a file, which opens the GPA file manager. From
there I can easily select the operation to be performed.
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\GPA Manager]
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\GPA Manager\command]
 \"%1\""
As you can see I have installed Gpg4Win *outside* the Program Files
directory tree in order not to have Windows messing with my files.

I wonder why they make an installer that does not deposit the user
manual, especially if one checks that option in the setup screens....
But I have used it many years so I don't need the manual right now
The Gpg4Win website has an on-line version of the documentation, which
you might want to take a look at, though.
My problems here come from the fact taht Microsoft in its wisdom has
ruled that in Win7X64 no 32 bit plug-in will be allowed to the Windows
Explorer, not even when running the 32 bit version.
And the OpenSource people are really mostly interested in Linux
solutions so they will probably not be in a hurry to fix this.
That is why I embarked on my own search to solve the problem a bit.

I WAS WRONG!
I found that the installer creates 2 different start program folders,
one named "GNU Privacy Guard" (which is the one I looked into) and one
named "Gpg4win".
In the latter is a Documentation subfolder where you can find full and
extensive documentation! :-)

this is clicked the application thinks for a while and then

I installed Gpg4Win 2.0.3 in December and have started to use it for
exchanging sensitive data files. I used to use PGP/GPG a lot sevaral
years ago and so I have a fair collection of public keys...
My public keyring thus has a lot of recipients, but I normally only
communicate with a few of them. Most often I send an encrypted file to
3 specific persons, so I have to select their keys from the mess of
keys in the GPA list. And the names of these persons are not
alphabetically close either. So I have to scroll a lot! :(
Is it possible to bunch several of the keys together into a group of
recipients such that I need only select one single entry to encrypt to

For example I found this on the tab "GPG for OpenPGP":
"Options controlling the configuration"
Default key
In all cases there was a dropdown to the right of the name saying "Do
not use option" or "Use custom value".
Then to the right of this and empty edit box with no indication on
what to enter or do....
In similar cases in other applications there would be a button to
click and then possibly a dialog box asking for the name of the item,
in this case the group. THen tghere would be a list of valid items to
choose from into this grouping. None of this happens with GPA. :-(
I really need to get some help in doing this properly.
Say that I have three public keys to my collegues that I want to add
into a simple to use group for encryption. What do I do in this
dialogue to make it happen?

encrypt to someone??

Here I found a text part where it looked like one could add a group
So I went ahead and added this line:
group developers = 0xDBC3175B 0x9209B308 0x8A51A0EE

written after the group marker was now visible in the configuration

No it will not...

keys to select from and nowhere at all is there any sight of my
developers group! :-(

Seems like noone can answer this question....
If I add a group definition in the configuration file of GPG, either
through the GPA "Edit/Backend preferences" or by directly editing the
conf file, how can I then use that group name to specify for whom the
file should be encrypted?
I am using the GPA application that comes with Gpg4Win 2.0.3 to do my
GPG tasks. I am using Windows 7 X64 Professional.
What I want to do is to encrypt a specific file before sending it as
an attachment in an email. I need to encrypt it several times a week
after it has been revised because it is a live specification document
and it is very tedious to always sift through the long list of keys to
select the keys for the development team members...
A group would have made life so much easier.
Is there any other way to encrypt a file than using GPA?

that the file is not open in MS Word. If it is then there is a very
strange error message about an illegal argument...
Funnily, if I use PGA to encrypt the doc file while MSWord has it
open, then encryption works just fine.

Link is broken. This is the correct one:
For now I have reverted to a batch file which I can just doubleclick
and it will encrypt the specific document to the group.
The remaining problem I have now is that I have to remember to close
MSWord so it does not have the document file open before I use the
batch file.
Otherwise gpg will not be able to encrypt the file, instead it gives a
very strange error message.

need for the particular file I work on. So now I encrypt by running
this batch file. The command in the batch file uses the group notation
for recipients.

Now back home and have repeated the error:
I opened the document in MSWord and then started the batch file.
The command in the batch file is (modified file name):
gpg -r devgroup --encrypt XXX_Specification.doc
The output from gpg is:
gpg: 0x8A51A0EE: skipped: public key already present
gpg: can't open `XXX_Specification.doc': Invalid argument
gpg: XXX_Specification.doc: encryption failed: Invalid argument
The first line is probably because I am part of the devgroup and my
key is also set as the default key so it will encrypt to that key
The error indicates a problem for gpg to "open" the document file,
which may be understandable since MSWord is currently having the file
However, GPA is able still to encrypt the file if I use that, so there
must be some gpg option or such that makes it open the file as
read-only when encrypting it. I have failed to locate that though...
And if I close the document in MSWord, then the batch command is able
to encrypt the file.

On Thu, 13 Jan 2011 20:04:54 +0000, MFPA Or writing my own program. I don't know if GPGShell actually shows the
groups defined in the gpg.conf file anyway...

@_subject: How do I list the GPG groups? 
I have defined a group in the gpg.conf file.
If I encrypt and use this group as recipient then it works just fine.
But if I try to list the existing groups I cannot find a command that
does that.
gpg2 -k
this just lists the public keys on my keyring and it does not say
anything about any groups.
Is there an actual command that can be used to list the groups that
have been defined for GPG?
Or (horror!) do I have to programmatically locate the gpg.conf file
and parse it myself for the groups and their members?
Since I could not find any I am going to write a GUI program for
handling GPG that actually will work in Win7 too and which recognizes
the groups as recipient entries....
Then I will have more control myself.
I might even do it with FPC/Lazarus to make it cross-platform.

@_subject: How do I list the GPG groups? 
Thanks, I knew there would be such a command!
Is there an on-line manual where all commands like this are listed?
I have looked at the documentation here:
but I could not find the commands I looked for....
And of course the first command (--with-colons) is a bit, shall we say
"strange", at least not self-evident to do what I wanted.
Anyway, now I know how to list the public keys on the ring and also to
list any groups there may be. I can also split the group into its
members by comparing the hex code with the key list.
I also know how to call gpg to encrypt and to decrypt, so now I am on
my way to making my own GUI gpg program!
Thanks again.

On Fri, 14 Jan 2011 18:57:40 +0000, MFPA OK, so I downloaded and installed GPGshell 3.77 to test it. Result:
- This application tries to install stuff into Winows/system32!!!!!
- When using GPGtools to encrypt, it opens an explorer window on
These two items alone would be cause not to use GPGshell. All programs
should keep off of the windows system folders!
- Even though a few tools were set to install to quick-launch they are
- No Explorer integration at all...
- Not possible to use "lists", the menu says - No menu command to create a list...

@_subject: What does the "sub" entry of a key mean? 
I am building an application for GPG encryption, which ultimately will
be integrated into the Win7X64 Explorer context menu.
I have used the command line command "gpg2 -k" to retrieve a ley list
for the current key ring. Works fine. Now it is time for parsing and I
have a few questions:
The output from the command looks like this (shortened):
C:/Documents and Settings/Bosse/Application Data/gnupg/pubring.gpg
pub   1024D/C50DAFF8 2006-08-19
uid                  Bo Berglund sub   2048g/011AD792 2006-08-19
pub   1024D/41C6E930 2003-04-10
uid                  Richard Jones uid                  Richard Jones uid                  Richard Jones sub   1024g/40AD97DF 2003-04-10
Now, I understand most of this but I would like to know the
significance of these items:
1) In the pub line the first item is a number + a letter. I assume
that the number is the bit length of the key, but what does the letter
mean? And which are the possible letters?
2) What does the last line of each key mean, which starts with sub?
Notice that there is a different hex code and different letter
following the key length...
3) Some keys have several uid lines, is there a maximum or minimum
number here? It looks like a number of email addresses attached to the
key, is this correct?
4) I only have one public keyring, but I assume that it is possible to
have several? If so will the -k command list these after each other?
The first output line seems to be the actual keyring location.

THanks, indeed the --with-colons gave a completely different output...
I was just about to ask of the date format (if it changes between
operating systems or such) but now I have a different problem in
understanding the machine readable format.
Very hard to understand. Is there a parsing guide somewhere?

came up with unusable suggestions.

@_subject: gpg command output language??? 
When I run the "gpg2 -h" command I get a result that is a mixture of
English and Swedish words, which does not make a lot of sense.
I am running Windows XP-Pro *English* version but because I am in
Sweden I use the Swedish keyboard.
I DON'T want to have anything fed back from programs like gpg in
Swedish, though....
It beats me why a program like gpg should detect the keyboard type and
change its language like this, language setting should be a volontary
change by the user always! Just think how good it would be for an
English speaking user to try and use a PC that happened to be set for
say a Slovenian keyboard. Not possible to understand the output,
So how can I change gpg such that it sends its responses in English
only? I have checked gpg.conf, but there is no language setting there.

@_subject: gpg command output language??? 
How do you locate the "GPG man page"??
Sounds like a very strange way to do this, an environment variable
that is not even named with reference to GPG can affect all
applications on the PC....
A more appropriate way would have been to have this entered in the
conf file or at least named GPG_LANGUAGE instead of the generic name
it now has...
Additionally: What am I supposed to enter as "langid" in such an
environment variable? "ENGLISH", "EN", "409" or what?

What is gpgme? I found a very short reference on the GPG website:
But it talks about a "library" that applications should use to access
gpg. What does "library" mean?
I looked at the download, but it looks like a source tree for some
kind of C program. :-(
I am programming in Pascal (Delphi or Lazarus with FPC).

Now looked a bit longer at the downloaded files and found a subfolder
"complus" where ther is reference to a Windows com server gpgcom.exe.
According to the README the gpgcom.exe should be part of the archive,
but it is not...
  * Because you are reading this file, you probably have already
    unpacked it distribution using a unzip utility :-). You should
    find these files:
       README      - This file
       gpgcom.exe  - The Gpgcom server <== Cannot be found!
       vbtest.html - A Test webpage        vbtest.vbs  - A VB script to be used with the cscript utility
So it seems like on Windows one is out of luck and must go the long
(And all because GpgEx won't work on Win 7 X64....)

On Sat, 15 Jan 2011 19:17:27 +0100, Bo Berglund Hi, Bo.  There should be a file called DETAILS (in doc/DETAILS in the
gnupg source, or maybe included with your local installation) that
describes in detail the meaning of the --with-colons output.  It's
exactly the reference you're looking for when writing a program to parse
the --with-colons output.
Good luck!
$ head gnupg2-2.0.14/doc/DETAILS
                                                              -*- text -*-
Format of colon listings
First an example:
$ gpg --fixed-list-mode --with-colons --list-keys \
   --with-fingerprint --with-fingerprint wk at gnupg.org
$

Yes! This did the trick. Now the language is indeed English.
Both on Win7 and WinXP.
