@_subject: get signed file out of signed&encrypted one 
a few weeks ago there was a posting about saying that it is possible to get the signed file out of a signed&encrypted file.
So now my question is:
1. When (which release) will gpg support this?
2. Could someone explain to me how to do it exactly with PGP6.5 ? (I know that's not the proper list.)

@_subject: sdk library available 
I just wondered if there is also some kind of sdk library available for gnupg as it is for NAI/PGP?
If not, is there some ongoing development?
Or is it rather "easy" to replace gpg itself and just using the appropiate functions which gpg also uses somehow?

@_subject: filename inside a signed file 
how is this done, that GnuPG "remembers" the original filename inside a signed file?

Hi again,
how can this option be used on WIN32 gpg?

@_subject: only compression 
is there a way to abuse gnupg to only compress a file? No signature, no encryption!

That's totally I am thinking about it, too.
I just encountered a mailing list for gcrypt, the GNU crypto library, isn't that supposed to be such a library??? How about that? Died?
