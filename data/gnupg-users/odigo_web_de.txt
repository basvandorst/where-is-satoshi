@_subject: Prolem with gpg --with-fingerprint < keyfile 
first, sorry for my bad english. I'm not a native speaker.
I use gpg in a linux shell script to extract the fingerprint. Every key is
in one file. I use gpg in the way that i put the file stream into gpg like
this "gpg --with-fingerprint < keyfile". I need that for a project at my
university. Usually that works fine. But now i found a problem i can't
solve. This key for example doesn't work in this way, i don't get the line
with fpr at the beginning:
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: GnuPG v1.4.5 (GNU/Linux)
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Does somebody know why and how i can solve the problem? Other keys with
multiple EMailadresses works fine too. I can't import the keys to get the
fingerprint, that's no solution (then it works without problems). I need
that very urgent. Please help me
