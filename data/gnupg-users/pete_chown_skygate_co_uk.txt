@_subject: "attach a meaning to this prompt"? 
It's complicated; suppose that a CA signs your key.  Your key is going
to be a second-level CA for another organisation.  The top level CA
wants to restrict you to signing keys for people who are in your
organisation.  The regular expression defines which keys are in your
organisation and which are not; for example it could restrict you to
signing keys which are under a certain domain.
Next question...  Does the GNU PG support regular expressions?

@_subject: Netscape plugin anyone? 
Good luck; I would like to use your plug-in if you manage to get it
working.  I looked into this a while ago and it seemed then that
Netscape plug-ins only support new MIME types.  You couldn't (at that
time) use them to extend the mail reader.
An idea I once had was for a program that implements SMTP.  You then
point your mail client at this program instead of your usual mail
server.  On the first line of the mail message you put commands like:
Encrypt-To: Joe.Soap
The SMTP program then acts on these commands before passing the message
on to the real mail server.
For inbound messages, the server decrypts them, checks signatures and so
on, and puts explanatory text at the start of the message to say what it
did.  (Of course you would have to make sure that it was not possible
for senders to forge the explanatory text.)

@_subject: Warning messages. 
Isn't the problem that things written to the paging area can be read out
after the event?  If I was raided by the secret police, there might be
something in my paging file that they could use.  On the other hand, if
they gave me the machine back I would be unlikely to use it without
checking very carefully that the gpg binary (and kernel, etc.) had not
been interfered with.
What would be quite nice is a way of telling the kernel that a
particular page must be encrypted before being written to swap.  If the
machine is powered off, the session key is lost and so the page is
unrecoverable.  This would be better than locking a page in physical
memory because there would be no need to restrict its use.  The CPU time
taken to encrypt and decrypt would be charged to the process concerned
so it would not introduce any scheduling "unfairness".

If there was a power failure at the wrong time you might have some left
over bits and pieces.  I suppose you could alleviate this to a great
extent by having something like fsck for swap spaces which would zero
them on bootup if there had been a "disorderly shutdown".
If your information is so secret that this matters, though, you probably
shouldn't be swapping at all!

@_subject: DSS Standard 
This is true, but DSS will not be used in this situation.  There is a
variant of ElGamal encryption that works with DSA style keys, but it
is not in wide use and OpenPGP does not use it.
No.  DSA uses two parameters, one 160 bits and one which is 512 to
1024 bits.  These parameters can be shared among as many users of DSA
as you want without weakening security.  Then, of course, a user has a
public and a private key as with simpler systems such as RSA.  So each
user will have his or her own public and private key.  Then there will
be two parameters which might or might not be the same as the ones
used by other people's keys.
You can attack DSA by solving one of two discrete logarithm problems.
One is in a group of order 160 bits and the other is in a group of
order 512 to 1024 bits depending on the length of the other
parameter.  However, some types of discrete log are easier than
others; it is believed that the two problems are about equivalent when
the variable length parameter is 1024 bits.
There is therefore no point in making the variable length parameter
longer than 1024 bits unless you make the other one longer as well.
AFAIK there is no reason not to do this, but because SHA-1 is 160 bits
it doesn't make any sense in the context of the DSS (which specifies
SHA-1 as the hash function).

@_subject: Using gpg-created DSS keys with PGP 6.5.3 
I don't know if it is still like it, but at one time pgp and gnupg
used different symmetric algorithms for encrypting private keys.  The
solution is to remove the passphrase using gnupg and then put it back
using pgp.
I certainly moved a pgp 5 key to gnupg without problems, but I never
tried to do the reverse.

@_subject: gdb pgp 
Well, I've just managed to get pgp interworking with gnupg the way I
want after a painful day that ended up with me running gdb on pgp
(6.5.1).  As a few people here have had similar problems I thought I
would write it up -- it should provide another data point.
First of all, I created a secret key with gnupg.  I then exported the
secret key -- it will be shared by several people and some use pgp.
Now I tried to import the secret key into pgp.  It didn't work.  It
would import the secret half but not create an entry on the public
keyring.  Eventually I discovered that if I imported the secret key
pgp -ka filename.asc
and then the public key with:
pgp filename2.asc
it would create an entry on both keyrings.  Interestingly giving pgp
the -ka argument in the second command would result in a funny error
Unfortunately now pgp would ask for a passphrase and would not accept
anything that I typed in.  The original key had been created without a
passphrase.  This was the point where I built pgp from source and then
ran gdb on it.  It turned out that the secret key hadn't imported
correctly and this error condition is not handled right -- it looks
like a definite pgp bug.
I then messed around for a while trying different things.  Eventually
I discovered that if I export the key from gpg with the --rfc1991
option, pgp imports it correctly, creating entries on both keyrings.
Why, I don't know.  The whole thing makes pgp look like a thoroughly
unreliable piece of software.
Now I discovered that when signing with gpg I had to give the
--force-v3-sigs option; of course this is a FAQ but I still managed to
waste a lot of time on it.
Encryption still didn't work though.  I would encrypt with gnupg; pgp
would accept the message but would not write any output.  If I
encrypted a message using the same key under pgp, pgp (and gnupg)
would decrypt it quite happily.  It turned out that because the key
had started off on gnupg, it contained cipher and compression
preferences that don't work on pgp.  Again, pgp didn't display an
error when it encountered a cipher that it didn't understand; instead
it just ignored that packet.  I regard this as a bug as well.
Eventually, after dumping the packets of the pgp and gnupg produced
messages, I came up with the following command:
gpg -es --armor --compress-algo 1 --cipher-algo cast5 --force-v3-sigs filename
At last I could decrypt and verify with pgp!  It would be nice to be
able to modify the preferences on the key, though -- does anyone know
if that is possible?
Anyway, I hope this helps someone...
(As an aside, some list members will have read about the security hole
recently discovered in pgp 5's random number generator.  The version
of pgp I was using is now at nearly half a million lines of code, and
is about five times the size of gnupg.  Now, I found a good handful of
bugs, although none with security implications.  But I do wonder how
anyone is going to do a meaningful security audit of a program that

This is true, but hopefully it makes cryptanalysis more difficult.  By
the time you get to a 1024-bit modulus, it will take roughly the same
amount of time to solve either of the two possible discrete logarithm
problems.  With a 512-bit modulus, it is (counterintuitively) much
easier to attack the 512-bit discrete logarithm problem rather than
the 160-bit one, because they have different characteristics.  (I am
sure you already knew that though.)
There is no reason why you couldn't have a DSA key longer than 1024
bits (that I am aware of).  However, to get any benefit from this you
would need to make the other modulus longer than 160 bits.  This would
mean using a hash function other than SHA-1, for example Tiger/192.
