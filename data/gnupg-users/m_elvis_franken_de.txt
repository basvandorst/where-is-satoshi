It is the same with real signatures. If the CEO of ACME writes on
a sheet of paper "You're fired.", signes with "Unk, CEO of ACME" and
sends it to you, you can also put it in another envelope with your
collegues name on it. So you just have to take the same care writing
and signing your email als with normal letters.
