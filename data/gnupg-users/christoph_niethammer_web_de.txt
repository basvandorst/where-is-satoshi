@_subject: New subkey or edit expiration date? 
As you can see my subkeys will expire in near future.
Now I'm thinking about the two possibilities
1.) create a new set of subkeys using addkey and let the old ones expire
2.) change the expiration date of the existing subkeys
So what is the preferred way for this problem?
