Hey all,
I was wondering if there's any place on the web (or anywhere) that I can
find out all the parameters that can be used in the gpg.conf file and
their syntax.  Especially parameters dealing with
cipher/hash/compression preferences.

That would be great to have.  In fact, that's about what I was looking
for.  The man page is also a lot to slog through to find something.  I'm
surprised there isn't a 'man gpg.conf' file like there is for a lot of
other programs.

One Caveat, The Bat! has a few quirks and things that need fixed with
it's GnuPG support that work right when using PGP.  They're bad enough
that I'm now using Thunderbird with Enigmail for email.

Ahhh! I remember Mutt fondly from when I used Linux all the time.
As I have an IMAP server, Mutt doesn't really do it for me.  What
didn't you like about TBird with Enigmail?
That'd be a nice thing. :)
I accidently sent this to Markus on his email account...  Anyone know
how to get TBird to send mail to the group when I click reply?  This
seems to be the only mailing list I have a problem with.

Wrong kind of group.  Don't have any problems with newsgroups, it's
replying to this list that's a problem.  When I click reply, it
addresses it to you and not to the mailing list.  All the other mailing
lists I'm on don't have this problem.  It looks as if Tbird isn't
honoring the Mail-Followup-To header.
