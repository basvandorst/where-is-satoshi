@_subject: Output file to specific directory? 
I'm using the Windows port of GPG and am trying to place the encrypted
or decrypted file in a different directory than the one where the
original file resides.  So far, I've found no way to push the output to
a different directory.  When I run GPG from the desired directory, it
still places the output in the directory with the original file.
Any ideas on how to make this work short of batching a move after the
encrypt/decrypt?  Is this even possible in GPG?
Thanks in advance.

Any samples of that VBScript you mentioned earlier?  It may work
better than the batch files I have in mind right now.
Thanks for your time,

No luck.  I don't want to specify the filename, just the directory it
will go to.  For the most part, stripping off/adding PGP/GPG is
sufficient.  With --output, I have to specify directory and filename
from what I can tell.
Of course, I could be way off base here, in which case, please let me

It will, but that assumes I know what the output file name will be.  I'm
trying to batch this as much as possible and am not too good with batch
programming.  If I knew how to strip the .pgp or .gpg off of a filename,
I would probably have little trouble.  Encrypting isn't too hard,
stripping off that extension is a little more troublesome.  I guess I'd
settle for that, but I'm working around it right now by decrypting and
moving the file after the decrypt operation with a wildcard character.
Any ideas on stripping .PGP/.GPG in a DOS/NT environment if this can't
be done right now through GPG?

Won't `gpg -d file > path/to/file/foo.bar' work?

@_subject: Output file to specific directory? 
Unfortunately, that doesn't work.  It still decrypts the file to the
directory the original is located in rather than the current working
directory.  Seems strange to me, but I guess that's the way it's
designed.  Is this by design or is that a bug?
I might be wrong, but how about doing something like:
  Find the current directory.
  Find absolute path of file.
  Cd to output directory.
  Invoke gpg command on file with absolute path.
  Cd to previous directory.
Would that work?

@_subject: Output file to specific directory? 
it was a bug was because other implementations I've seen output to the
current working directory rather than the same directory the file is
located.  No need to specify an output directory in the output file
extension - it's decrypting and stripping the PGP/GPG extension that
gives me trouble.  I'm resorting to some MOVE statements to move
eveything that matches my parameters to the desired directory.  Not my
first choice, but it works.
output to a specified directory without needing to know the filename as
well - just whatever comes out, place in directory X.  Seems the only
way to do that is by specifying the directory as part of the output file
name.  That answers my question.  May not have been the answer I wanted,
but I can make it work other ways.
Thanks again,

I did not follow the discussion, however what's wrong with either
  set filename=whatever

I am sure there are ways to mangle filenames even under Windows.

I know that it works with directory and filename specified as output
parameters.  I was just hoping for something that would output the file
(regardless of or without knowing the name) to a specified directory.  I
guess my original query wasn't too clear.  I'm not a great programmer
and stripping out the .PGP or .GPG extension in a DOS command line is a
little fuzzy to me.  That is what was giving me trouble.  I've figured a
way I can work around it with a MOVE command after the encrypt, so this
isn't a huge deal, but I was curious if there was a way to output to a
directory short of specifying directory + filename as output.  I've seen
other implementations of OpenPGP do that and was wondering if GPG could
as well.

@_subject: Update on directory output - DOS/NT 
Found this after some searching.  This will strip off an extension in
%1 - filename passed in to batch
%~n1 - filename without the extension
I don't quite know how I would use this with a variable within the batch
file yet, but this is what I need for my batch file.  I think I'm
relatively content now - no more move command necessary.  :-)
Now to investigate the FOR command in DOS.  Who knew I'd become a batch
programmer?  :-P
Thanks for all who replied to this and rendered assistance to this
PGP/GPG novice!

@_subject: Entering passphrase under Windows XP 
Luigi, try this at a DOS prompt:
ECHO YourPassPhrase| c:\gnupg\gpg.exe --passphrase-fd 0 --quiet --batch --yes --output C:\%NEWFILE% --decrypt %1
This should attempt to enter your passphrase through a DOS command as an input parameter to the decryption.  If this works, it's probalby not DOS, but the way the program runs the DOS shell or passes the parameters.  If you can see what it runs in the shell, you might be able to add a PAUSE statement to see any error messages that are popping up as well.

I am using gpg 1.2.3 under xp. It works fine. I use it through Enigmail and WinPT. Now I have install GPGshell. This tool runs a dos box to perform the gpg operations. My problem is now that the dos box does not accept my passphrase. Does the dos prompt include any unwanted charachters or does the usage of german characters (e.g. "?") disturb?
Does anyone knows how to solve this?
Thx, Luigi.

@_subject: GPG problem Urgent please 
Just to chime in here, you can do this, but watch out for spaces before
the | character.  Spaces will be read as part of the passphrase.
For those saying it's insecure - it is, but this allows us to transfer
encrypted files via FTP, then decrypt them locally inside the firewall.
Add some security on the directory/files for the scripts and it's not
too bad, especially since we're more concerned about interception
outside than interception inside.

Just a note on the quote below - according to the GnuPG site, there is
not an official 1.2.6 build for Windows because the bugs fixed from
1.2.5 to 1.2.6 did not affect Windows.  Can we lower the min required
version to 1.2.5 in light of that?
You can find it on ftp.gnupg.org. Any _official_ version should work. The minimum required version is GPG 1.2.6 (but you can also use 1.3.x!).

@_subject: Issue with WinPT and GPG versions 
Tried to run the latest version of WinPT on a new workstation.  For some
reason, it can't determine the correct version of GPG with GPG 1.40a for
Windows.  The latest version tells me I need to run something higher.
Going backwards in the WinPT.exe and dll, it keeps giving me version
problems even to the point of saying GPG 1.21 or higher.
Has anyone else encountered this?  What is the problem/fix if you have?

This sounds like a problem with 0.9.14. But this is not the latest

Anyone know if one exists?  I've got a workaround that uses a shell
command to build a command-line and exec it, but no native
module/wrapper code.  The only module I've been able to find is one from
SourceForge that will work on Linux/Unix, but not in Windows due to some
dependency modules that don't exist in Windows.
If anyone's got something that works in a more native fashion and can
pass that on, I'd appreciate it.

I will sometimes start my PC and when the WinPT program launches, I have

@_subject: Corruption of KeyRing (possible WinPT related?) 
Timo, I'm using 1.4.1 on my PC.  I was just a little concerned as I
don't use GPG on a regular basis so when something reports that one of
my keyrings is corrupt, it's probably one of my manager-type programs.
Current running WinPT and the Outlook plugin.  Those would be the only
programs I can think of that would be touching the keyring.
If there's something else that could be affecting this, please let me
know.  I'll check into it.
I heard about this problem one or two times, but fact is that WinPT
never writes to the keyring directly. The backup is also a one-way
process which means: the pubring.gpg is copied to pubring-bak.gpg but
not vice versa.
What GPG version you use (1.4.1)?
