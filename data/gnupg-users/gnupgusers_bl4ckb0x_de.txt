I am sorry for my late delay.
Yep. Creating RSA-1024 or RSA-2048 directly on this card works fine.
I don't know, if this is correct, but when I do create an RSA-4096 key with GPG directly on my Gentoo notebook and move this one to the card with "keytocard", it works and a RSA-4096 is shown on my card. Seems to work somehow, that RSA-4096 is possible?
I will give a try.
Thanks for the explenation.

I've bought an OpenGPG Smart Card v2.1 and trying now to generate a 4096 bit key for me.
Using it with my ThinkPad X260 and a Alcor Smart Card Reader.
$ gpg --version
gpg (GnuPG) 2.1.13
libgcrypt 1.7.1
Supported algorithms:
Pubkey: RSA, ELG, DSA, ECDH, ECDSA, EDDSA
Cipher: IDEA, 3DES, CAST5, BLOWFISH, AES, AES192, AES256, TWOFISH,
        CAMELLIA128, CAMELLIA192, CAMELLIA256
Hash: SHA1, RIPEMD160, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, SHA224
Compression: Uncompressed, ZIP, ZLIB, BZIP2
Before creating a key, the card is found:
$ gpg --card-edit
Reader ...........: 058F:9540:X:0
Application ID ...: DXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Version ..........: 2.1
Manufacturer .....: ZeitControl
Serial number ....: 0000XXXX
Name of cardholder: [not set]
Language prefs ...: de
Sex ..............: [not set]
URL of public key : [not set]
Login data .......: [not set]
Signature PIN ....: not forced
Key attributes ...: rsa4096 rsa4096 rsa4096

PIN retry counter : 3 0 3
Signature counter : 0
Signature key ....: [none]
Encryption key....: [none]
Authentication key: [none]
General key info..: [none]
Now, when I do start the creation of the key, it fails with a card error at the end:
gpg/card> generate
Make off-card backup of encryption key? (Y/n) Y
What keysize do you want for the Signature key? (4096)
What keysize do you want for the Encryption key? (4096)
What keysize do you want for the Authentication key? (4096)
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
        = key expires in n days
      w = key expires in n weeks
      m = key expires in n months
      y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0)
Key does not expire at all
Is this correct? (y/N) Y
GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.
Real name: John Doe
Email address: john at doe.com
Comment: JD
You selected this USER-ID:
    "John Doe (JD) "
Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O
gpg: key generation failed: Card error
Key generation failed: Card error
What does card error means? The card is now not anymore accassible.
I am only able to access the card again, when I do restart the laptop
