FWIW: A tool with a similar goal is GNOME Keysign:
 (Note that the repository will move, so this link will become defunct)
Contrasting caff or monkeysign, it does not rely on keyservers.

@_subject: Python GPG libraries 
As far as I understand, the GPGME-based pygpgme is the
embraced library: The others don't use gpgme but call gpg themselves.
There have been many discussions on this list and elsewhere
discussing the ability to use gnupg as a library from Python.
The python-gnupg ones are easier to use, but lack features like signing keys.
pygpgme does not seem to be actively maintained and lacks support for,
e.g. exporting secret keys (or public keys in a --export-minimal) fashion.

@_subject: Defaults 
Is there anything in this listing that would allow me to quickly copy and paste
(e.g. double click and middle click) in order to further work with the key,
e.g. edit or encrypt to?
The short key id would probably do, but the "rsa2048/" prefix prevents me from simply double clicking it.
The fingerprint would probably be better to identify the key, but, similarly,
the spaces prevent me from selecting it easily.

                 ^^^^^^^^
I thought short keyids are dangerous and should not be used,
cf. .  If that's the case then it might be a good
idea to fade them out as much as possible.

@_subject: A problem in the web of trust model or a gnupg bug? 
Can I tell GnuPG that I, as a user, am convinced that the superseded
revocation reason is correct?
I've grepped through the gpg man page and only found "superseded" once,
not related to evaluating trust in a key.

@_subject: Unattended/batch key signing 
That's already quite helpful.
Can I make GnuPG not save the signature for a name in the local keyring
but export it to, same stdout?
The reason is that I don't necessarily want my regular keyring to carry
the signature just yet. From what I understand of the currently
believed best practices, I would want to send the signature to the
email address first to verify that the person does indeed have access
to the mailbox.
Currently, this seems to require a rather artistic dance of exporting a
key, deleting all but one UID from a key, signing, and minimally
exporting. For each UID on a key. ?Not even gpgme seems to be of help
here. Mainly, because I don't see how to make gpgme work with the
default secret keys, but a temporary public keyring.
