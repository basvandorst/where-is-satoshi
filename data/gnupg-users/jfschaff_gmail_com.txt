@_subject: Problems with GPGME1.8 and Python 3.5 bindings 
I'm new to gpg, and trying to use the Python bindings included in
PGPME. I'm using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
I have done the following things:
- compiled and installed libgpg-error-1.26
- compiled and installed libassuan-2.4.3
- installed swig2.0 (sudo apt-get install swig2.0)
- installed python3-dev package (sudo apt-get install python3-dev)
- compiled and installed gpgme-1.8.0
Everything seems to build and install as expected, but when I finally
try to use the python package (import gpg) I get the following error:
(venv) jfs at Danube-linux:~/webdev/mms$ python
Python 3.5.2 (default, Nov 17 2016, 17:05:23)
[GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
Traceback (most recent call last):

Am I doing something wrong?
Note that I'm running that in the virtual environment, not sure if
that could be related...
Any help would be greatly appreciated :-)

Thanks for your advice, I could fix that and use the lib from Python.
Do you know if there is any plan to better document the python bindings in
the GPGME doc? I may be able to help with that if needed.

Thank you Justus for your advice, I could fix that and use the lib
from Python. I had not realized that both gpg and gpg2 are installed
by default on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
Do you know if there is any plan to better document the python
bindings in the GPGME doc? I may be able to help with that if needed.
