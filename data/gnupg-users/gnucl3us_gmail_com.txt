@_subject: GnuPG (Windows XP) Problem 
Hi, I have a problem. I have 2 computers and I set one up with GnuPG(GPG) with a
key. I use Thunderbird to send and receive encrypted email with no problems.
The second computer is not set with any key. I want to setup the second
computer with with the "Same" email like the first computer with a key, but
it doesn't work. When I start to generate my key, it fails. Here is what I
did. I typed in my name, enter the "Same" email, basically everything is all the
same. Once I entered my pass phrase, it starts generating the key. After a
couple of minutes, I get the below error. gpg: no writable public keyring found: eof Key generation failed: eof gpg: can't create `C:/GnuPG\random_seed': No such file or directory *My path variable under mycomputer/properties/path is the following* Files\Zone Labs\ZoneAlarm\MailFrontier" Some people add the path ";c:\program files\GNU\GnuPG" after MailFrontier or
whatever their path is set to, but I'm assuming that I don't need to do that
because on my other computer it is setup with GnuPG and has the same path as
mentioned above and still everything is ok. I'm all out of ideas on how to fix this. I've googled all day and I found a
few people with the same problem, but theres were in linux and mine is in
Windows. The solution for linux was to make sure it had read and write
access(something similar to that) and a few other things which looked pretty
easy to fix by the way. I tried grabbing some of those hints and applying
them to Windows, but it doesn't seem to work. It was at least worth a try
tho......... smile.gif But so far I've found nothing related to Windows. That's about all the
information I can think of right now. PS, If there's a way to fix this, please inform me. Detailed instructions
would be nice by the way. Thank You. Running....... Windows XP and latest version of GnuPG

@_subject: Weird Error Message 
I have a computer setup with GnuPG and everything so far is working ok. I
recently sent a "Signed email"(not encrypted) to one of my friends at
hotmail. She responded back, her message came through ok but then there was
an error. The below is the following error. OpenPGP Security Info Error - signature verification failed gpg command line and output: G:\\Program Files\\GNU\\GnuPG\\gpg.exe --charset utf8 --batch --no-tty
--status-fd 2 -d gpg: Signature made 08/15/06 01:19:02 using DSA key ID FJEIFLSA gpg: BAD signature from "My_name "; ^ What does the above mean? Should I be alarmed?

@_subject: Problem retrieving encrypted email 
I don't know if this is a Thunderbird issue, a GnuPG issue, or a Engimail
issue. I'm assuming it's Thunderbird's problem. I also don't know if I
should post this to you guys or Thunderbird or Enigmail, but anyway I hope
this is the right place. So far everything is working ok, BUT whenever I send a "Signed and
Encrypted" email to myself, it goes through Gmail but I can't receive it
with my Thunderbird email client.
When I log onto my Gmail account, the signed and encrypted email is there in
my inbox, but when I try to retrieve the message from my Thunderbird email
client, it doesn't work. It doesn't give me any error messages or anything.
*I use the latest Thunderbird and Engimail*
How would I retrieve the signed and encrypted email that I sent to myself
with my Thunderbird email client? I'm thinking this is a configuration issue. I just don't know where to look.
I've checked the Thunderbird configuration settings, but it doesn't give me
any hints. Maybe one of you guys/gals can lend me a hand?
Thank you.

EDIT: I just confirmed that if the message is "signed" by me and when I send
it to myself using Thunderbird, I can't retreive it back. BUT when I log
into Gmail's account, the "signed" email is there in my inbox. What's going
on here? How come I can't retreive signed and encrypted emails with my
Thunderbird email client?

@_subject: Problem retrieving signed and encrypted emails 
I'm sorry if you guys/gals recieved multilple copies of my post. It's just
that I had problems posting up on this forum. I accidently posted 3 of the
same post, which I then deleted 2 and kept the other one. Anyway it was just
a mistake and I apologize.
Ok this is to Charly Avital. I checked my pop settings in *Gmail* The below
is the settings for my POP Gmail account.
Fowarding is disabled(Keep Gmail's copy in the inbox is selected) The status for POP Download is "Enabled for all mail that has arrived since
When messages are accessed with POP
delete Gmail's copy
^ The above is my settings for POP Gmail. I also checked over my Thunderbird
Junk Filters, but no messages are stored there. I even tried sending a
signed and encrypted email to myself to see if it would be stored in my
Thunderbird Junk Folders, but no. Maybe my firewall is blocking it? I have ZoneAlarm Suite. The below is my
settings for "Email Privacy" in ZoneAlarm Suite. But I don't think that
ZoneAlarm is the cause of this because I believe ZoneAlarm is setup for my
OutLook Express(which I don't use) I just thought I point this out, it might
give you all some hints ?? File attachment is enabled.
Outbound MailSafe Protection is enabled.
Junk E-mail filter is enabled.
*Thunderbird is selected as my default email client* Hmmmm what else should I mention........Oh I sent a signed and encrypted
email to myself using Thunderbird. When I go to my Gmail account, it is in
my inbox. When I try to retrieve the message with Thunderbird, I get none.
But when I reply back to myself using my Gmail account, I can retreive it
with my Thunderbird client.
If you go to the below link, that is how I setup my Gmail with Thunderbird
Other additional settings/configurations that I added to Thunderbird Client
is the following:
Server Settings(tab) - Empty Trash on Exit is checked
Composition and Addressing(tab) - Compose messages in HTML format is
OpenGPG Security(tab) - Enable OpenGPG support (Enigmail) for this identity
is checked. Use email address of this identity to identify OpenGPG key is
Local Disk(tab) - Empty Trash on Exit is checked.
That's about it, the others are all default. If you guys/gals want me to
give you the complete configurations for Thunderbird or Gmail account, just
ask ok? Well that's about it, hope the above can give out some clues.
