Hi all,
while compiling gpgme-0.3.7 I get the follwoing error:
gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I.. -I../assuan -O2 -march=3Di686=20
=2Dmcpu=3Dpentiumpro -O2 -march=3Di686 -mcpu=3Dpentiumpro -I/usr/include -W=
=2DWcast-align -Wshadow -Wstrict-prototypes -c ath-pthread.c=20
=2DWp,-MD,.deps/ath-pthread.TPlo -o ath-pthread.o >/dev/null 2>&1
mv -f .libs/ath-pthread.lo ath-pthread.lo
make[1]: *** No rule to make target `ath-pth.c', needed by `ath-pth.lo'. =20
make[1]: Leaving directory=20
make: *** [all] Error 2
After all I wonder what's ath-pth.c. I only have ath-pthread.c and ath.c

Well I looked into CVS and found that file there. Seems that the tarball=20
from ftp.gnupg.org isn't complete.
It compiles now ;-)
