I have a few newbie questions that might perhaps suit in the faq?
I hope they are not stupid.
1. Could one give a figure about the safety of an encrypted message? Something like "it would take [n] years for the Big Blue computer to crack a secret key out of the corresponding public key, or out of an encrypted message with key unknown".
2. What does 1024 bit key mean? Is it that there are 2^1024 combinations to try in order to crack the key?
3. Is it easier to crack the secret key from an encrypted message of only a few sentences, than it is from an encrypted document of a 100 pages?
4. Is the risk of getting the secret key cracked increasing for each new encrypted message that is sent over the net, or is the situation the same no matter how many postings are done?
