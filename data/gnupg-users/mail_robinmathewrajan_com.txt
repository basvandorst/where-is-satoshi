Where can I get my keys signed? Does here anyone provide keysigning services through video conference? :)
Thanks and regards,

Hello David, :)
I already uploaded my public key to a public key server some months ago. But there's no local Linux users group where I live! I sent emails to some people listed at biglumber.com with my Government issued ID card attached. But no reply came from them. :( Some of them are CACert Assurers! If someone could sign my key over video conferencing, that would be very much helpful to me. Yes, I know it's much less trusted than actual person-person meetups in real world. But at the same time, it offers an easy solution for someone living in a very remote area. And it's also particularly helpful if he/she can't afford travel expenses to get keys signed. I think it's just like performance vs. security in cryptography. Signing someone's key through video conferencing is less secure but at the same time it's an effective solution for remote areas. I think key signing through video conferencing, might help in reducing 'crypto divide' (like that in 'digital divide'). :)

Hello Tobi, :)
This shell script might help you.
(Semi)automatic GnuPG keysigning for busy people. Sign GPG keys, upload signatures to keyservers, and mail signed keys to their owner, including support for multiple private keys to sign with. All that?s left to do is verify fingerprints, type your password, and answer any questions asked by GPG.
It requires mktemp and an MSA like mutt or mailx.
Usage options
Usage:  gpg-sign-keys.sh [options...] [-u keyids] [-f keyring] [keyids...]
        -f file  Get list of keyids to sign from keyring file
        -u ids   Key(s) to sign with, multiple -u id1 -u id2 or -u 'id1 id2'
        -x ids   eXceptions - don't process these keys (multiple like -u)
        -c addr  CC all signed key emails to address
        -b addr  BCC all signed key emails to address
        -a file  Append content of file to e-mail message
        -n name  Override your name normally obtained from /etc/passwd
        -y       Assume yes on most questions (-Y for no questions asked at all)
        -I       Don't import the -f keyring into the default keyring first
        -S       Don't sign any keys - just do the sending/mailing
        -K       Don't send signed keys to your default keyserver
        -M       Don't mail signed keys to key owners
        -E       Don't encrypt mails with owners key
        -U       Don't update the trustdb after processing all keys
        -v/-h    Display version/help and exit
The script will guide you through signing all keys in the -f keyring, or just
the keys explicitly specified. All GnuPG operations are done in your default
keyring. You will be asked to confirm every mail being sent unless -y is used.
The -u, -c, -b, -e and -n options override the env vars MYKEY, CC, BCC
and OWNER respectively. For more details, read the source.

Hi all,
I edited gpg.conf and set the parameters as like this:
default-preference-list SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 SHA224 AES256 CAMELLIA256 TWOFISH AES192 CAMELLIA192 CAMELLIA128 AES CAST5 IDEA BZIP2 ZLIB ZIP
personal-cipher-preferences AES256 CAMELLIA256 TWOFISH
personal-digest-preferences SHA512
personal-compress-preferences BZIP2
And used 'setpref' to include those newly updated preferences to my existing GPG Key!
I confirmed once again with 'showpref' if those preferences are set correctly. Saved the key and quit the GPG console.
Using Kleopatra, I deleted my GPG Key and imported it from the backup. After the importing, when I checked if those earlier preferences are retained in the key, I got quite astonished. Those preferences are not retained. The output is like this.

No bro. You got me wrong. :(
I referred these two manuals before I made the change in gpg.conf.
1) "--default-preference-list string
    Set the list of default preferences to string. This preference list is used for new keys and becomes the default for "setpref" in the edit menu."
2) "Re: Difference between setpref and options in the configuration [In reply to]
That's because the personal-*-preferences don't change the preferences
in the key itself. They merely change the order of ciphers, hashes,
and compression methods that you prefer when communicating with others
(so long as you both support those algorithms).
According to you'll want to use "default-preference-list" followed by the list of
preferences for your key. For example, putting
"default-preference-list SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 SHA224 AES256 AES192 AES
CAST5 ZLIB BZIP2 ZIP Uncompressed" in your gpg.conf file and then
generating a new key (or running "edit-key KEYID", "setpref" with an
empty string for the preferences, and "save" on an existing key) will
set the key preferences to that string.
Those are the two manuals I mainly referred before editing the gpg.conf.
The backup file was made after the changes made in the key. It's not made before I edited the gpg.conf and used setpref. The backup file is made after I used the setpref option.
And that's why I'm confused about it. Even though the backup file was made after the changes made in the key, why the properties set by setpref are not included in the key? I'm confused. :(

Hi gnupgpack, :)
You can delete these values from your current gpg.conf.
s2k-digest-algo SHA256
s2k-cipher-algo AES256
cert-digest-algo SHA256
digest-algo SHA256
Reason 1: Those values are used when options like 'personal-cipher-preferences', 'personal-digest-preferences' and 'personal-compress-preferences' are not given! But here, you already gave those three options already.
Refer: Reason 2: Those values are known to break the OpenPGP standard. OpenPGP is nothing but a set of guidelines which instructs on how the PGP concept should be implemented in various softwares.
Let's quote an example to get the idea of 'IETF standards' effectively.
We all know how a Desktop Computer looks like. Mouse, Keyboard, LCD Monitor, A case in which the CPU, Motherboard, HDDs are included and a unique OS etc. That's what a typical desktop computer look like. We can call that 'typical' desktop computer to be 'reference model.' Or in another words, that computer could be a 'standard computer'.
Now let's have a look at another Desktop Computer.
Based on the earlier reference model of Desktop Computer, another one built a Desktop Computer. This computer has all the features of earlier reference model, plus, the features of its own. This one includes: bigger case with lots of fancy lights, liquid cooling systems, SSDs, GPGPUs, OS with more features etc. None of these extra features are not in the earlier reference computer.
Both are Desktop Computers. But what's the difference? The former is a reference computer with all the essentials built-in which respects compatibility. The latter one is a high-end one which includes fancy options but not compulsory to be in a computer. And moreover, since the OS second computer holds more features than the reference model, when connected to a network, the both computers can't communicate. To communicate, both computers should know a common language with common instructions. If the communication language is different, there will be no communication.
It's just like we humans use 'English' as a common language. We all come from different nations. We all have different languages. But there should be something in common to communicate. Moreover, surprisingly, the English language itself has different accents around the world. I'm an Indian. We use Indian accented English. So does people from other parts of the world. But since the accents of English language is fragmented, there should have one reference accent which all other people from all nations should consider learning. And that's the native accents 'British' or 'American' accents mainly.
That's the same OpenPGP does. OpenPGP standard is just a reference model. Anyone can modify it and include unique features. But it's not necessary to be those 'unique features' to be included in every OpenPGP implemented products. But when it comes to communicating each other, there comes the problem if there's no common standard rule.
With those settings, the communication between Symantec owned PGP products and GnuPG will be problematic. That's why we have to stick to the reference standards as much as possible.
But there's a caveat with strict implementation of standards. In cryptography, there's a Performance vs Security thing. If we tend to move more towards Performance, the Security will be low. And if we tend to move more towards Security, the Performance will be low. We have to maintain the level of Security vs Performance trade-off, to be medium as possible.
As because there are so many OpenPGP implementations, we can't really guarantee which configuration is more compatible and which configuration is most secure. If we tend to move more towards compatibility, the level of security will be low. And we tend to move more towards security, compatibility will be an issue.
That's why I chose, these four extra configurations which I believe most secure with fewer compatibility issues with newer releases of OpenPGP implementations and other softwares. These preferences won't break the OpenPGP implementation, but at the same time, offers high security too.
default-preference-list SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 SHA224 AES256 CAMELLIA256 TWOFISH AES192 CAMELLIA192 CAMELLIA128 AES CAST5 IDEA BZIP2 ZLIB ZIP
personal-cipher-preferences AES256 CAMELLIA256 TWOFISH
personal-digest-preferences SHA512
personal-compress-preferences BZIP2
But at the same time, these settings might be incompatible with older softwares. But that's something we should decide personally. Should we choose the most compatible configuration or the most secure configuration? Let's that decide ourselves.
Refer: Reason 3: You have set 's2k-digest-algo', 'cert-digest-algo' and 'digest-algo' configurations to SHA-256. But at the same time, you have set 'personal-digest-preferences' and 'default-preference-list' configurations to SHA-512.
That's incompatible and contradictory configuration. Our, Robert J. Hansen already said that in another thread in 2012.

Re: A mixed case of keys and AES256 vs CAST5
Please don't do this.  This overrides GnuPG's built-in algorithm
selector.  The algorithm selector makes sure that your traffic will be
readable by your recipient's OpenPGP implementation.  There exist a lot
of OpenPGP implementations (particularly PGP 7.0 and prior) that don't
support AES256.  This option will make your data unreadable by those
It is enough to have AES256 listed as your most-preferred cipher.
These two lines contradict each other.  First you say SHA256 is your
preferred digest, then you say SHA512 is.
I don't have an answer for why you're seeing two different algorithms
being used, I'm sorry.  I have a few guesses, but no certainties.
This is what the "hidden-encrypt-to" option is meant for.  You don't
need symmetric encryption."
Refer: Additionally, by typing this command, we can see how our existing keys are encrypted.
For Linux: gpg --list-packets ~/.gnupg/secring.gpg
For Windows: %APPDATA%\gnupg\secring.gpg
For example, C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Roaming\gnupg\secring.gpg
Replace 'Admin' with your user name.
So it becomes, C:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\gnupg\secring.gpg
