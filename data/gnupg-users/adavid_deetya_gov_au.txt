In order...
What is capable of 3584 bits? Generally for a public-key algorithm
it is a total waste of effort.
Twofish is designed for and submitted as an AES candidate
See  .There are other candidates
that each have their merits (except possibly MARS)
A 128bit session key is far beyond what is required for security against
a brute-force attack. Somewhere around 90bits is sufficient. Check out
how long distrubuted.net has been spinning cycles for to crack a 64bit
RC5 key.
Forgive my ignorance, but what does your compression of keys question
refer to?
Why bother. PGP doing 16kbits is, as I said, a total waste of effort and
is more for marketing than practical use.

An easier method is to use
gpg --send-keys felkarp  --keyserver that exports and uploads your public key automagically!
Copy everything, the "ASCII armoring" will get stripped off.
I'm sure the keyserver will whinge if you make a mistake...:-)

Telnet is interactive. Telnet is not a good way to go however, especially
over a cable modem as it is trivial to sniff other traffic. Wiretapped Australia reported a number of other security issues with
Use ssh so when other users on your subnet hijack your session, they
will only get encrypted data and not your passwords.
Better still, generate the keys on a standalone Linux/*BSD box and
get your ISP to install them via floppy.
If you still think the risk is OK, run a find command agaist a large
filesystem in the background while you gen your keys on the server.
Hope this helps

Thanks for the info.
Oliver mailed me back to say he found rndcontrol ref in the list
archives. I ommited that reference because he didn't state his OS.
In hindsight...

Total        1625236682      201
But then the above OS (Sol 2.6) needs to to use egd...
