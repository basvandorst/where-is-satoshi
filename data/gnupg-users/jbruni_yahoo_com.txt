@_subject: gpg 1.0.7 on Tru64 4.0F 
Hello all,
Just wanted to post that I've been able to get GPG 1.0.7 to compile and install
on Tru64 4.0F using the default C compiler (I didn't need gcc.) The only option
I had to specify was -std in order to get cc to recognize the "extern" keyword.
I was able to do that through the CFLAGS variable.
I also had to apply the malloc(0) patch because it appears that libc returns
NULL for a zero-length malloc.

@_subject: building GPG 1.2.1 on HP/UX 11.11 
Hello all,
When building GPG 1.2.1 on HP/UX 11.11 with the non-bundled C compiler, I ran
into a snag with the ./intl/gettextP.h file. It appears that HP's compiler
doesn't recognize the "inline" keyword, and dies when it hits the definition of
the SWAP function.
Adding " inline" to the header file allowed me to compile gpg just fine
using all the default options. Perhaps a test could be added to autoconf to
look for C compilers that don't support "inline"?

This was a clean source build. During my attempts at getting this to compile, I
always blew away the directory and untar'ed the source again, just to make sure
there were no cooties left over from previous build attempts.
If autoconf does check for "inline" what does it do if it's not available?
Perhaps the code in gettextP.h is not using whatever macro autoconf is setting
