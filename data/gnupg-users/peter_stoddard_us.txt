@_subject: Compile of Gnupg 2.0.1 failed - no libintl 
Thanks for the suggestion Doug.  I tried configure --disable-nls, and  I got further in the make but it eventually failed with the following  collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make[2]: *** [kbxutil] Error 1
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make: *** [all] Error 2
I don't know what other configuration options to try, and I don't  understand what *any* of them do, so I'm going to bag gnupg 2.0.1 and  wait until I can find out what is going on, or maybe wait for a  macosx binary.  I'm running 1.4.5 and its working fine for me.
