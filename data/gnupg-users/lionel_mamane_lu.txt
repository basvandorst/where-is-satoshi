You might run it after GnuPG in the script (maybe only if the keyrings
have changed, or ask teh question (if none of the arguments is

that make the "secret key modification attack", but with a trojaned

Hmm... If one person is able to edit your keyring, why won't she be
able to trojan the GnuPG binary, the gpgsafe wrapper, or simply run

@_subject: Certification-only key 
I tried to generate an RSAv4 certification-only key with GnuPG, but
failed, even in "expert mode".
What I mean is a primary key that can be used to attach a subkey to
it, or _maybe_ also to sign UserIDs of other keys (for the Web of
Trust). But not for data signatures. As I understand the RFC, I want a
primary key with key flags 0x01 (or maybe even 0x00?).
But GnuPG only presents me with three "bits" to flip:
 - signature, which seems to set key flag 0x03
 - encryption, which seems to set key flag 0x0C
 - authentication, which seems to set flag 0x21
I tried turning all three bits off, but then the key doesn't have a
key flags subpacket (packet 27) at all and seems to be treated by
GnuPG as a "everything is allowed" key.
Is this impossible with GnuPG? Is it a bad idea? Why? Do I
misunderstand the RFC?
Thanks for your explanations,

@_subject: Certification-only key 
OK, thanks.
I would obviously have at least one data-signing subkey. I presume
these people would take a signature from such as subkey. Or decryption
of a nonce they sent me encrypted to an encryption subkey.
First, separation of roles. Doesn't hurt. More importantly, my wishes
on the primary key and on data signature keys are different. The
primary key is my electronic identity; it should be humongous. If it
can hold secure for all my life, then I want it to. My data
signatures, on the other hand, for most of them, a week of security is
enough (but sometimes a few years is nice). Paying the cost of big
signature size is less worth it, at least until computers again get
too fast or factorisation becomes easier or ... Maybe I even *want*
them to fade away into fakability over time. Who knows what I will be
in twenty years? I may be so unlucky as to be a politician then. I
wouldn't want some of my teenage opinions or acts to haunt me back,
would I?
You could argue I could have this without marking the key as
certificate-only, by never issuing data signatures with the primary
key. That's harder on me. I have to be more cautious. Over the course
of twenty years, I *will* screw up.
Now, I'm starting to wonder if I can retroactively change the
capabilities of the key. I just have to reissue the self-signature on
the UserIDs, right? (Yes, I'd have to hack GnuPG to allow me to change
the key flags.)

kernel32.dll falls under the following language in the GPL:
 However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not
 include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or
 binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)
 of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that

Not unless that PKCS module "is normally distributed with the major

But that subkey is attached to the primary key by a signature of the
primary key. Isn't then control of that subkey enough to "prove"
control of the primary key?
 1) Signature scheme cryptographically broken. We have a bigger
    problem.
 2) Primary key owner has done stupid things, like sharing subkeys
    with others. But if we assume he has done that, we might as well
    assume he would sign the challenge a man-in-the-middle attacker
    has forwarded him or shared his primary key or ...

Ah. Good. I just hope mutt doesn't pass the KeyID with an exclamation

The application does not link to the display driver. On Microsoft
Windows, the display driver is part of the kernel, and AFAIK
applications communicate with the kernel through syscalls (eventually
wrapped by gdi32.dll, kernel32.dll, etc), not linkage. On a Unix
system, the program communicates with the "display" through the
networking layer, so there is also absolutely no linkage.
But there is indeed a case to be made that if the library implements a
well-known, standard ABI, then linking to it is not a GPL
violation.  Legally it depends whether the linked program is a
"derived work" from the program or not.
On a Unix system, again, programs don't link with a printer
driver. They exec() lpr over a pipe and dump postscript to it over the
pipe. Just a matter of passing data around to another process, no
library linkage.
Yes, show me, I'm curious.

Because you send is a PGP/MIME (RFC3156) message, which is the better

I dunno if KMail can do that. Look for a "old method" option or "plain

Because by then the information over which charset the text was in is
lost. This is meta-information attached to the attachment, by saving
it you "loose" it.

GnuPG doesn't *link* to RAID drivers or video drivers. They don't end
up "running linked together in a shared address space". They
communicate over syscalls or sockets; mechanisms that are well-known
as to be "GPL-safe" (as long as the coupling between them isn't too
tight). See
 .
On the other hand, some people interpret the GPL in a way saying that
if a library implements a "standard" ABI, then one can link GPL
software to it.  I think it is a good idea to stick to the
copyright holder's interpretation.

I thought we were talking about PKCS "drivers" for specific cards,
and that you had to link this driver into your program (dynamically at
run-time) in order to use it. That _driver_ would be gpl-incompatible.
I had understood that it was not a _protocol_ but a library API. HTTP
is a _protocol_ for data interchange over the network. I thought
PKCS was a _library_ API and that you linked (dynamically at
run-time) a particular "implementation" of it (the card driver) into
your program to use it. If that's not the case, my previous messages
are void and meaningless.
Again assuming that the provider implementation is a library you link
against: That may or may not be true. I don't think that's legally
clearly established yet.
There are two statements:
This one says essentially the same thing as what you quoted
before. Some say standard ABI -> not combined program, but I don't
think this has been "proven" by case-law yet. It may be found true by
courts, or not.
A license means what the licensor means by it. If the licensor has
clearly told you that by *his* reading of the GPL that-and-that is
forbidden then you'd be in a tricky situation in front of a judge
explaining "I know that the licensor meant to forbid that, but the
text he gave me permits it, so he has permitted it.".
I had misundertood what you meant by "these drivers". I thought you
meant the display and printing drivers.
LGPL is not GPL. The difference is exactly that it permits linking to
non-(L)GPL code.
I downloaded opencryptoki-2.2.0.tar.gz . It is not GPL, it is under
the "Common Public License Version 0.5".

Please do so. I'm curious how you will handle:
 1) Pointers being passed
    By copying the whole address space back and forth at each call and
    return? "Morally" that's not running in separate address spaces!
 2) A library that calls exec() or fork() or setuid() such a
    "process state changing" syscall.
I don't think you can keep the semantics of all libraries in this

No. I was so intent on looking at the smartcard side
of things that I missed this. I took the "secret key parts are not
available" to refer to the _new_ key and thought "duh, obviously it
isn't available: it is locked away on the smartcard".

@_subject: Finally: Login via SSH authentication with OpenPGP smart card 
Big news for you: We are here precisely because we prefer OpenPGP to
S/MIME. And *I* certainly don't use S/MIME. I use X.509 when really,
really forced to (for TLS/SSL HTTP, jabber, POP3, IMAP4, ... servers),
and then usually in a "flat" mode (self-signed certs, my own CA,
I don't even know what CMC is, and in the PKCS galaxy, which one n=1
and n=8 refer to. Maybe I use them without knowing it?

You seem to use "commercial" antagonistically to "free". A software
can be both free (as in freedom) and commercial (that is, written in
the goal of earning money).
Realistically, in the crowds I hang out with, it is OpenPGP that has
the mindshare. So even if I would prefer S/MIME, I'd be forced to use
OpenPGP by the network effect.
Other crowds force you to use S/MIME through the network
effect. That's the nature of social crowds.
And AFAIK, there is free software that supports S/MIME, isn't there? I
have never tried to use them (by lack of any necessity or usefulness:
nobody to communicate _with_), but I'm not hearing that they don't
work or don't interoperate with proprietary implementations.

And isn't PGP like waaaaay older than S/MIME anyway? The release of
PGP 1.0 was in 1991. (Not that we are still interoperable with
it. Comparing with PGP 2 would probably be more fair... I dunno when
that is, but PGP 2.6.2 is 1994.) S/MIME seems to be born with RFC
1847, October 1995.

@_subject: Changing GPG's default key type? 
Yes, it is. RSA keys are marginally safer, and in my view of the
world, DSA keys were introduced in the OpenPGP world (GnuPG and PGP
and friends) only / mostly for historical reasons that don't apply
anymore, namely that RSA was patented and DSA/DH/ElGamal was not (the
patent had expired). The patent for RSA has now been expired for a few
years (since 2003) and has actually been releases prior to expiration
back in 2000.
RSA keys are in very wide use nowadays.
Only people using rather old versions of GnuPG or PGP (from 1997-2000)
will have any trouble with RSA keys. If they use GnuPG, they can
install a plug-in that will enable RSA for them. I don't know if a
similar option is available for PGP.
For a key to be used only for a couple of years, it may not be worth
the bother, but you can make it a bit stronger by following the
directions in
The difference in security between not following these directions and
following them may very well be irrelevant for you, because the
weakest link in your security may be elsewhere (e.g. penetration of
your computer or home).

@_subject: Certification-only key 
Also, when my signature subkey expires, it would (I guess) silently
start using the primary. Which makes me _very_ happy I chose to make
my primary certification-only, because signatures started to fail
instead, which gave me notice and allowed me to issue a new signature
subkey :)

@_date: 2017-06-02 14:42:56
@_author: Lionel Elie Mamane 
@_subject: Certification-only key 
Yes. However, if I publish the secret signing subkey after it expires,
the cryptographic certainty is gone. Don't need expiry for that, but
it is a self-reminder. Also to consider whether I maybe want to use a
longer key now.

Right to be forgotten. The signatures I made a long time ago were made
by a different person, although there is a continuity between the
