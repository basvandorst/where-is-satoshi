I am getting this error when attempting import a new public key.
I have found this error in the archives and I can't seem to find the answer.
Any help would be appreciated.

Ahhh jeez... sorry about that post. The clock was off on my computer.

@_subject: possible security hole 
I've created a php script which uses pipes in execting a shell such as:
"echo $sensitiveinfo|gpg  --homedir /my/home/dir --always-trust -ear me|mail
the script runs as nobody
the secret key has never seen the server
the script only encrypts
I don't care who the message comes from I only want the $sensitiveinfo
I was told that this is insecure (even if no one breaks root!).
Could someone with more expertise PLEASE give me an opinion?
p.s. I know that you are sick of these questions
(thank you for your program and your patience Werner!)
Thank you
in advance

thank you for your input.
Could I bother you to "briefly" explain encoding to base64?

There is no telnet access or any other command line access to anyone other
than root on this server. Is there a way to examine the environment of the
shell process strictly through cgi?

@_subject: newbie question "Public key not found" with PHP 
How did you set it up - running under your username or under the PHP user
"nobody"? If you access it with php it wants "nobody's" keyring. I set it
all up through scripts like so: (easy as all heck)
echo "response to --gen-key:";
while( $res=each($e) )
echo "$res[1]";
then run
echo "response to import:";
while( $res=each($e) )
echo "$res[1]";
I also tried setting the environment variable as well and that works too.
I hope you find some of this useful,
To the group -> This is a great program but i think that it would be helpful
to have another mailing list dedicated to CGI so as to separate these issues
from the critical encryption issues. Any takers?

I am having trouble with a public key import
gpg: error reading `/my/path/myring.gpg':general error
gpg: import from `/my/path/myring.gpg' failed:general error
gpg: Total number processed: 0
The key is there and readable.
It is from the command line logged in as 'nobody'

Is it possible that this is because the key was generated on a windows
machine and is being transfered to a *nix box?

Thank you for replying,
GPG is going to be called from PHP which runs as 'nobody'
doesn't each user need its own keyring?
Is it possible that it is because the file was not --armor when I exported
it and transferred it to the webserver?
as for additional info, i have had my isp install gnupg on lhis linux box
and then I asked him to log in as nobody and import my public key which was
in my directory and he got the following message:
gpg: error reading `/my/path/myring.gpg':general error
gpg: import from `/my/path/myring.gpg' failed:general error
gpg: Total number processed: 0
