that's the point even without cleartext: if one of 3 recipients decides to
disclose the message he naturally poses a risk for other 2.
When you send the SAME message for more than one person (be it encrypted or not)
you should consider how ALL recipients are trusted by you and by each other.
Encryption does not like publicity so i do not see why to send the
same message to several persons. the solution is to create a special
key for the whole group and use it as the group's key.

In other words
[1] free buying

To my mind
whether software belongs to [1] is for author to decide
whether software belongs to [2] is for users to decide
These are natural rights of each side.
And any law (like copyright law, DMCA etc) that states otherwise
is compromised and should be balanced - if you restrict users
in [2] then producers should give some control to users over [1]

I think the most important thing is underlying ideas of
what is free (libre) software and how to ensure it is free.
One idea is that everyone has equal right to compete on it.
The software itself may cost some money but it is important that
if person finds your service too expensive then he/she can go to
ftp.gnupg.org get the source at the same price as you did and go do
himself by himself what you did and are asking money for.
The other important idea is INTEGRITY - when one says GnuPG all others
expect we are talking about the same thing. It is important to keep
integrity and i think *integrity issue* does not create problems to
*free(libre) to use and compete issue*
To my mind the whole movement for libre software is based on the
assumption that competition is more important than private property
and the following law primary one:
Everyone is free (libre) to use(buy and consume) and compete(produce and sell)
if that does not restrict anybody else right to use/compete
When we have limited resource this law creates the notion of possession
(private property), but if resources are unlimited (like software is)
than we do not need possession notion at all.

In my previous post i have made some gramma mistakes
(like using than where then was meant) but i hope the
ideas are clear.
I want to add a couple of words
The use and compete law is indeed primary to private property
D> Everyone is free (libre) to use(buy and consume) and compete(produce and sell)
D> if that does not restrict anybody else right to use/compete
D> When we have limited resource this law creates the notion of possession
D> (private property),
This is because if i take resources from you then i automatically
restrict your right to compete with me
D>  but if resources are unlimited (like software is)
D> then we do not need possession notion at all.
And if some of you still feel the need to possess unlimited amout
of certain resource then that means you want to control how people
use it, you want to become a master. Do we want a world like that ?
One more comment about the english word *free*.
I think both meanings (libre and gratis) of it coincide not accidentally
When you want some money for a libre software then this software automatically
tends to become gratis. This is because there will always be someone
willing to grant for others what he/she managed to get.

I do not think this is a good idea - imagine someone has generated
exactly the same key someone was using in the past, now they both
have the same private key. So the list of revoked keys is needed
to determine your new key was not used before. I wonder how
many keys are possible is it 2^N ? Is this number big enough if
someone decides to start continuously generate and register random keys ...

Yes indeed, if too many keys are sampled from the pool of 2^N
then it becomes easy to crack by randomly generating new keys and
looking whether you've generated a key already in use :)

I keep explaining it all the time to the people i meet :)
What i don't understand quite well is why OSI,GPL and alike
licenses are not compatible with free competition rule.
The rule i find to be more important than 4 freedoms you mentioned
Here is an example:
GPL'ed software is offered (for extra money) to those who are not satisfied with GPL
conditions, that means in fact that those who use the software under
GPL are discriminated compared to those who use the same software
under modified and less restrictive conditions.

It's great that Steve tried to explain what  is all about
now i see that my understanding of it is quite different from yours, Frank
For me  means first of all freedom to compete on it,
and what i see in GPL - it does not really garantee such a freedom

So what =3F What is there to hide =3F Do not your words conform that people dont really care to keep their information secret=3F This is the real answer to the subject question.
Read-only access to information can't cause real harm. Bad things are cause by evil-driven people and not by the information accessability to the public.
Where encryption is really important  is in protecting the rights to manage things i.e. who and what can change/operate/manage/control. Email is not used for such things
(well SMTP protocol could probablly be used for it but it is not the prefered protocol)
All the importance is mostly in identification - i want to be sure who exactlly sent me that paticular email,
who is requesting write access to the databases.
It is much better to assume that anyone can read the information and then think about how to make the system work safely

That is most likely reason. I constantly get reply mails from

appropriate recipients there was a virus,
meanwhile i never sent those messages i even did not know the recipients existed.
As i figured out some of my friends (who have my email in their

The autentification of the sender becomes more and more urgent issue.
