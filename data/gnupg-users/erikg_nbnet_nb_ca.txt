Can I import somenoe else's key if he uses PGP X.X?
Also, earlier I tried to import a key, the one that RedHat uses to sign their RPMs and everything they distribute and here's the message I got:
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
gpg: key CBA29BF9: unsupported public key algorithm
gpg: key CBA29BF9: no valid user IDs
gpg: this may be caused by a missing self-signature
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:		w/o user IDs: 1
[ducky ducky]$
Now, RH site DO say they use GNUPG, how could it be using an unsupported key algorithm? Is there a way to add other algorithms to GNUPG that I'm not aware of?  Why does it keep saying using insecure memory! ?
