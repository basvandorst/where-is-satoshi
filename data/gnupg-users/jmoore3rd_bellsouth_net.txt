The "2nd" Key you reference above is the Encryption Sub-Key to the
Main/Signing Key above it.  I believe that the 'Authentication" Flag
_must_ be 'placed' on the Signing Key at the time it is
Generated...there is no reason for the Encryption sub-Key to have any
other Flag.
Many folks have a Main Key with both a Signing sub-Key & the Encryption
sub-Key.  I haven't done it, but perhaps You could add a Signing sub-Key
to your existing Key and add the 'Authenticate' Flag at this time.

@_subject: GnuPG 2.0 
Hash: SHA512
This was/is performed by the various GUI's for Windows Installations;
the most well known being GPGshell, WinPT & Enigmail.  There is also
S/MIME support within GPG 2.0.  In fact, 2.0 is far more bloated than
the 1.4.x BRANCH.
The Bottom Line is that nothing is /missing/ in 1.4.x Builds.  GPGshell
& WinPT will *not* work on Linux so GPG-Agent is the Linux version of a
'Shell' for easy manipulation of GnuPG within Linux.
Because Linux Users secretly resent the variety of variety of GUI's
available to Windows Users. (expect Lance & Alphax to rebut here)  More
& more Linux Users are not proficient in Command Line use nor do the
ones who are particularly enjoy having to resort to it for routine
Communication.  Not everyone uses T-Bird/Enigmail with Linux.  Also,
there are these other Library dependencies in GPG 2.0:
 * The *gpg-agent* is the central place to maintain private keys and
   to cache passphrases.  It is implemented as a daemon to be started
   with a user session.
 * *gpgsm* is an implementation of the X.509 and CMS standards and
   provides the cryptographic core to implement the S/MIME protocol.
   The command line interface is very similar to the one of gpg.  This
   helps adding S/MIME to application currently providing OpenPGP
   support.
 * *scdaemon* is a daemon run by gpg-agent to access different types
   of smart cards using a unified interface.
 * *gpg-connect-agent* is a tool to help scripts directly accessing
   services of gpg-agent and scdaemon.
 * *gpgconf* is a tool to maintain the configuration files of all
   modules using a well defined API.
Notice the 3 Items that GPG 2.0 brings to Linux Users:
1.)  Smart Card Use
2.)  S/MIME
3.)  gpg.conf
There is also cached passphrases; but basically, GPG 2.0 provides Linux
MUA's many of the features that Windows Users take for granted.  It just
integrates them into the GnuPG Build.
IMO:  You are not being denied anything by sticking with 1.4.x on your
Windows Box.  My hope is that now that the 2.0 version has been
released, more attention will be devoted to development of the 1.4.x BRANCH.

While I heartily endorse Robert's suggestion; You specifically requested
Help with Outlook Express/Outlook.  For this application I suggest that
You install either GPGshell or WinPT.  Both will give You a Frontend
(GUI) for using GnuPG within any Compose Screen displayed on your PC.
I am a Fan of GPGshell which can easily be found with a Google Search.
I simply cannot recall the Link off the top of My head.  Both
applications will provide You with Key Management & Edit functions in
addition to the ability to Sign, Encrypt & Encrypt/Sign.  With GPGshell
the only real 'Secret' is that routine Signing is accomplished by using
the 'Clearsign' option from the Rt. Click context menu.

Nonsense; the only 'dumb' Question is the one not asked!
Some folks 'protect' themselves from this by storing their Keyrings on
removable media. (USB Memory stick, etc.)
The built-in protection for this is the use of a very secure passphrase.
 By using a passphrase hardened against Social Engineering and
Dictionary attack; then even if Your 'Secret Key' falls into the wrong
hands You are reasonably protected from compromise.  Of course, if You
are involved in situations where torture may be implemented to force You
to divulge the passphrase; then harden yourself or throw yourself under

There is somewhat constant debate over the best method.  Many believe
that Email addresses are 'harvested' from the Servers by bots intent on
increasing the Spammers database.  Many others argue that they haven't
been affected by /increased/ Spam and not publishing to the Servers
negates the ability to Verify a Sig from a Key not currently existing on

and use that key with GnuPG?  Our subscription to PGP Desktop is about
to expire and it says the functionality will be reduced to that of PGP
Freeware.  All we do with it is encrypt files (not emails), so I think
this is ok.  I'm not sure if the PGP Desktop gui interface will stop
working or not, so thought we could use GnuPG and Gpg4Win which we
currently use on another project to replace PGP Desktop.
I was unable to 'trim' this Reply cause You have a word wrap issue.
However;  for what You are doing, the Freeware version should perform
just Fine.  Answer to Main Question; YES, You can Import your PGP
Keyrings into GnuPG.  Fact of the matter; I know several individuals
using *one* Keyring for both PGP & GPG.
Personally, I prefer GnuPG over PGP for several reasons; the most
primary being that I find more functionality in GnuPG.

In this context it will mean "like mechanical prevention" but only for
those Users who have Updated Your Key with the Revocation on their
Keyring.  GnuPG will _not_ Encrypt to a revoked Public Key.
However, if You never tell Me that You have revoked the Key and it is on
My Keyring and I Encrypt My annual Christmas Email to You using that Key
then it will not show Revoked on My Keyring and You will not be able to
read My Greetings unless You have kept the Secret Key for the revoked
Key on Your Keyring.  This assumes that I have been too lazy to
'Refresh' Your Key from the Servers prior to writing My yearly missive.
An easy method for handling this is to also send the Revocation
Certificate to all Your correspondents in addition to Sending the
Revoked Key to the Keyservers.  I would then recommend keeping a copy of
the Revoked Key available somewhere prior to deleting it 'just in case'
You ever receive a message Encrypted to it from someone You forgot to

Hash: SHA512
Robert's statement above is quite correct.
That said; I personally [subjectively] feel that Elgamal is bit-for-bit
more secure.  In My former career I was 'privileged' to attend several
In Service Training lectures regarding this and even discuss at length
these concepts with folks who most certainly knew what they were talking
about.  Needless to say, much of their 'proofs' were so far over My head
that I didn't even feel a whiff of wind. :-D
Since they were employed by the same Government Agency as I & their
specific job function was to analyze these very areas; I have no problem
accepting their conclusions on faith.
In the 'Real World' of practical, non-tactical Communication the
differences between Elgamal & RSA are probably negligible.  The issue of
'time' as originally mentioned by You is also negligible today.  We are
now in a realm of Ghz processors and multi-core processors so 'time' is
now measured in increments of a second.  Hardly a viable consideration.
Ultimately, You, alone, must determine what algorithm best suits Your
needs and comfort level.

I disagree!  I much prefer using the 1.4.x Branch in static format
because it is faster, smaller and not dependent upon accessing so many

How do You reach this conclusion?  "different GPG's" is far from
accurate since the Cryptographic code is identical in both the Branch &
the Trunk.  The only 'difference' is the inclusion of S/MIME capability
within the 2.x Trunk.  This 'feature' is used by a small minority & I
see no reason to force 'extra capability' upon those who have no desire
for it. :-\
Default = forced, IMHO.
The WG has discussed this and backwards compatibility [as pertains to
the mandatory cipher] has been somewhat agreed on.  I am confident that
some form of backwards compatibility will be present when ECC becomes
commonplace. :-D
At present the majority of R&D is focused upon the 2.x Trunk and
desirable features & fixes are rapidly backported into the 1.4.x Branch.
 What caused You to assume different?

another Human Being.  They just don't realize that this is what they are
doing.  "Weighing Risks" is done with every transaction with another
individual.  I feel that every encounter with another person is a 'trust
calculation' and is based upon the logic of past experience applied to
'1st impression' re-calculated with increased observation of behavior.
This is why the majority of people will kill to defend "Mom" because She

Hash: SHA512
"Implemented" = Yes; in that it is present but Camellia is *not* Enabled
by default.  In order to Enable Camellia You will need to Build GnuPG
with the --enable-camellia Flag in place.  Before You rush to do this
however I think You should re-read the Cautionary Message from David
Shaw regarding the advisability of this:
Some people have noticed that I recently committed support for the
Camellia cipher in GnuPG.  Here's the story behind that.
Camellia is not currently part of OpenPGP, and will also not be part
of the upcoming "2440bis" updating of RFC-2440.  It has been proposed,
however, that right after 2440bis is published, the OpenPGP Working
Group take the necessary steps to add Camellia.  To simplify
interoperability testing between different OpenPGP implementations,
I've added Camellia to GnuPG.  Naturally, it is disabled by default
and the only people who should really enable it are those doing
interoperability work.
While it is impossible for me to stop people from enabling and using
it, be warned of a few things: first, Camellia isn't part of OpenPGP
yet, and if for whatever reason it doesn't become part of OpenPGP, you
won't be able to decrypt anything you've encrypted with Camellia.
Similarly, as Camellia has not been assigned an OpenPGP cipher number,
I've picked 11 (the next unassigned number).  If Camellia gets
approved with a different number, you won't be able to decrypt
anything you've encrypted with this version of Camellia.  Finally, if
there is some error in the current GnuPG usage of Camellia that we
later fix, you again won't be able to decrypt.
I'm not going to go into whether Camellia is considered strong or not,
as it's not really relevant to this discussion: even if Camellia was
the strongest cipher in the world, you should still not enable it for
the reasons given above.
Rest assured that if/when Camellia is approved (or even on a
reasonable track to approval), it will be enabled for general use.
I "re-printed" this here to refresh the memories of folks who may have
missed/forgotten David's original comments on Camellia.

however, once the Key is in circulation with those preferences listed on
it then should the placeholder values later be changed and a Sender
fails to 'refresh' Your Key from a reliable source then potential
confusion could exist. :-\
I may be mis-reading Your question.  Upon re-reading I am of the opinion
that what You desire may already be covered with use of the
preferred-algo-preference string placed within gpg.conf.
Anyway, just My 2 cents and I shall wait until I am clearer on what You
are suggesting.

The 'armor' icon indicates that the .exe File has a companion detached
Signature file.  Had You also downloaded the Sig File You could have
verified that the .exe File had been signed by the Author.

OK, I'm Back and find from parsing My Inbox that I have been "quoted"
and 'covered' by others.  Sorry I wasn't here all day feeling insecure
enough to 'speak' for Myself.
Robert J. Hansen & David Shaw have both 'answered' Your Question
succinctly; but I personally feel they have missed the essence of Your
Question based solely upon Your 'Previous' Post regarding how to see
what GPG is "doing."
Remember how I told You how to 'showpref'?  Well, now You can tell
gpg.exe what You'd prefer to be broadcast on Your Public Key by changing
'showpref' to 'setpref' and then using a string like this:
setpref S9 S2 S13 S10 S4 S12 S8 S11 S7 S3 S1 H10 H9 H8 H11 H6 H3 H2 Z3
Z2 Z1 Then You'll need to provide Your passphrase and follow the prompts.
It should be noted that You will need to then Upload Your Key 'again' to
the Keyservers so they will reflect Your changes.  You will also need to
then require /every/ correspondent to 'refresh' Your Key so the Key they
have for You on their Keyring reflects Your 'New' Preferences.
Bear in mind also, folks using Ubuntu may not have Z3 available [BZIP2]
but that isn't relevant because this is a "Preference" and their
installation will compare it with the native ability to Encrypt to  what
You "prefer" so if it isn't  possible it will default to the next
You wish to 'force' something specific then You enter this line in gpg.conf:
digest-algo SHA256 [or whatever]
*ALWAYS* Keep In Mind that anytime You _force_ an algorthim, hash or
compression You are making the Recipient dependent upon Your choices.
If their installation cannot 'handle' it then they will Holler.
setpref will broadcast to the Recipient's Keyring what You desire but if
You wish to _demand_ Your installation to use Your Preferences then You
will need to add the following lines to Your gpg.conf:
personal-cipher-preferences S9 S2 S13 S10 S4 S12 S8 S11 S7 S3 S1
personal-digest-preferences H10 H9 H8 H11 H6 H3 H2
personal-compress-preferences Z3 Z2 Z1
Now, PAY ATTENTION:  These are the lines from MY gpg.conf and unless You
have built Your version of GnuPG to Support TIGER192 [H6] or Camellia
[S10, S11, S12] then those designations will _break_ You being able to
use Your installation.
There are Members of this List who understand I 'break rules' and some
call Me an I-D-I-O-T', I prefer the term /Bleeding Edge/ but this in NO
way makes Me correct.  DO NOT think Me anything other than a 'breadbox'

Robert, John Clizbe, Werner, David & Marcus are very correct, accurate

ID's, Length of Relationship,Key Fingerprint verification etc. are all
just individual methods of determining Who has control of a Key.  The
WoT is only conferred based upon the 'Depth of Trust' conferred with the
Signature.  PGP refers to this as 'Trusted Introducer' [Black Pencil]
and GnuPG displays this 'depth' with a numerical notation.
Basic 'Exportable' Signatures [0x10, Yellow Pencil] are as common [&
useful] on a Key as a pocket full of business cards after returning from
a convention.  "Yeah, We met & exchanged some Contact Information."

2 ways are easily available depending upon the size of Your Flash Drive.
 You could use GPG2GO and do everything from the Command Line or You
could simply Copy Your GnuPG Directory/Folder to the Flash Drive and
then use the GPGshell Portable Utility [located at the bottom of the
Start Menu list] and then run with a GUI.
How secure is Your passphrase?
Robert already covered the issues involved in using an untrusted PC.
Also keep in mind that not having control over the PC also means no
Control over the Swap File, whether or not any Keyloggers are present,
etc.  Another consideration is that many Public PC's have the ability to
launch any .exe File blocked.  This is particularly true in Library's
and other places where there is a concern that Students will attempt to
install malware, etc.
If You are just going to be using the USB Drive for Email then there are
Applications like Mobility Email & Portable Thunderbird w/Enigmail + GnuPG.

I am unsure about how You could be exporting Your Key incorrectly.  I
was able to Import Your Key 'automatically' via
hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net but did receive the "invalid Signature"
Error.  Therefore, I would appreciate Your sending Me Your Key as an
attachment via Direct Email.  I shall be glad to receive Your Key and
compare it with the one retrieved from the Keyservers.
What I am noticing at present is that You have a DSA 1024/4096 Key with
a 1 year lifespan [as currently configured].  A 4096 encryption sub-Key
is not the considered 'Default' for DH/DSS [DSA] Keys so I assume that
this was created deliberately.  What My Enigmail Console indicates is:
gpg: armor header: Hash: SHA1 gpg: armor header: Version: GnuPG v1.4.7
(MingW32) - WinPT 1.2.0 gpg: original file name='' gpg: Signature made

These 2 Questions both require knowing whether You mean the actual Key
or User ID's on the Key.
It might be important to Note here that a single Key can support many
different Email Addresses through the use of multiple UID's. [User ID]
There is no reason to create a separate Key for each Email Address.
Yes, it matters!  Without the Secret half of the Key a Revocation
Certificate _cannot_ be generated.  Best Practice dictates that whenever
a Key is created/generated that a Revocation Certificate be immediately
created and stored in a Secure Location should the need to use it ever
arise. [this is particularly true if the reason revocation is needed is
due to a forgotten or compromised passphrase]
Absolutely nothing.

I only know that I have an x.509 Key that may be used to Send an S/MIME

As a General Rule it is hoped that Passports are checked for Identity
Authentication by the issuing Authority.  I know that when I am
'confirming' the Identity of an Individual I require that I be shown a
narrow selection of Documentation.  Documents that I am comfortable with
the level of difficulty of forgery.  This is why it takes presentation
of 'Proof of Identity' to several folks to obtain a Named Certificate.
They 'Ping' the Email Address to confirm control of it.
Which is why the level of Trust in any Certificate may be Edited by the
End User.
But all this discussion of x.509 Certificates is somewhat far afield
from the purpose of this particular List.  If everyone here was
comfortable with S/MIME then We wouldn't be using GnuPG.

This is very accurate.  The third Department established within the
National Security Agency back in 1947 was the 'Office of Public
Information'.  60 years ago satellite photography was non-existent and
even 60 years after inception the very existence & scope of NSA was
unknown to all but a few hundred thousand.  Still, with 60 years of
preparation the 'Discovery' of NSA by the World was anticipated &
prepared for.  The 'contingency plans' implemented by the 1st DIRNSA
have served the Agency better than the most expensive Super Computer
they ever purchased.
I am amazed at the outcry over 'eavesdropping' that is occurring now.
The capability has existed & been implemented ever since 1913 here in
the U.S.  Time was when /every/ telegram that traversed a Western Union
wire passed through the Nation's cryptography department.  If these
'invasions of privacy' have been so detrimental for 95 years then why

The Encryption genie is 'out-of-the-bottle' now and cannot be stuffed
back in.  Particularly here in the U.S. where eCommerce and Online
Banking rely upon PKI protocols.  More basic is the 'electronic

existed; the NSA, FCC & FTC _combined_ do not have the resources to
'outlaw' Encryption at this point in time.  :-D  Even the paranoid
Patriot Act makes no mention of or reference to Encryption.

In GPGshell; highlight the Key then Rt. click and choose 'Edit' >> 'All

delsig You will then need to answer y/N Questions through the list of existing
Sigs until You arrive at the Signature You wish to delete.  Then You
answer 'y' instead of the 'N' You've been responding with.  If the Key
hasn't been Uploaded to a Keyserver then the Signature ceases to exist.
 If the deleted Signature /has/ been placed on Keyservers *prior* to
deleting from Your Keyring then it is 'off' the Key only on Your Keyring
until You refresh it.
You can delete other signatures from the Key existing on Your Keyring
but it won't affect the Key on the Servers or "in the wild".  Many folks
do this to keep their Keyrings as small as possible.  The same thing can
be done by running the --minimize command on any Key and stripping it of
everything *except* Self-Sigs.  Very small Keyrings are helpful when
using them on a thumb drive where space may be limited.

This ongoing thread is ample evidence that this is an area of common
confusion to a fairly substantial sub-set of GnuPG Users; Education
should _always_ take precedence over Elimination as a solution.  "Stick
with the Defaults until You RTFM" may appear harsh on the surface but is
far preferable, IMO, than saying "You'll *never* be able to grasp this
so We'll remove it for Your Own good."

is really out of context for GnuPG-Users since the vast majority do not

Camellia, in all permutations, is /Bleeding Edge/ and unless One is

until My Key _with_ advertised Preferences is Imported/Incorporated into

In My Experience Nobody 'refreshes' Keys often enough.  If it's in the
Keyring and 'works' then it ain't Broke and there is no reason to fix
it.  So, FWIW, it means _nothing_ to change the preferences on Your Key

This is due to the sharing/gossip nature of most Keyservers.  There are

Global Directory.  Of these 2 _only_ BL prevents anyone but the
Key/Account Owner from 'changing' the listed Key.
Listing Your Key at  will allow You to display Your Key
exactly as You desire it to appear and folks may be directed to retrieve
it from there via a Comment line or a signature tagline.  I am not aware
of the ability to specify the Big Lumber listing in a 'Preferred

IMO, the benefits of having One's Key available via auto-retrieval
outweighs the hassle of undesired Signatures and the 'baggage' of

This is Correct!  Upload a Key with signatures removed and as soon as

other Keyservers it is linked to the removed signatures are restored.
End of story!
Err....  How?  The only time Your passphrase is required is when You are
a revoking a Signature You, yourself, made.  Your Secret Key isn't, or
shouldn't be, on the Keyservers.  Anybody can Sign Your Key and upload
it to the Keyservers whenever they desire.  Your Public Key is in the
public domain.  This is why some folks maintain a listing of their
clean, desired Key on Big Lumber or the PGP GD.  With Big Lumber only
You may access Your listed Key to make 'changes' and with PGP GD any
uploaded Key requires verification of each UID email address via a
Ping/Pong challenge before it is listed for dissemination.

GPG supports PGP/MIME without any trouble; but not all MUA's can handle
PGP/MIME.  Most notably, all of the MUA's distributed by M$.  :-\
However, when used with a Frontend such as GPGrelay PGP/MIME is easily
accomplished using even Outlook, Outlook Express or Windows Mail.

This is much debated.  I belong to the camp that believes having the

situations impossible. [Key selection by Address, Creating a Big Lumber

Create the UID You want on the Key and then set it as Primary.  Go to

published to any Keyserver then You can simply delete the revoked UID.
If it has then re-publish the Key with revoked UID to the Servers.

@_subject: Need help understanding the difference between assigning owner 
Hash: SHA512
First; You cannot Sign Your Key with a Key belonging to someone else.
In order to Sign a Key Ya gotta have the Secret/Private half + the
Passphrase.  You Sign the OP's Key with Your Key.  This may done using a
'Local' signature that exists _only_ within Your Keyring or You may Sign
the Key with an 'Exportable' signature which is then visible to Others
when the OP's Key is exported & shared.
No, the above paragraph is not correct.  For others to 'see' that You
trust the OP they would have to Import their Key with Your exportable
signature displayed on it.  Refreshing Your Key on the Servers is only
necessary when/if the OP Signs Your Key with theirs using an Exportable
Sig and You wish to display to the Universe that They trust You.
This might be a good time to 'refresh' the proper netiquette regarding
signature sharing.  The proper method is to Sign a Key with an
Exportable signature and then _return_ the signed Key directly to the
Key Owner.  The decision as to whether or not to 'share' Your trust in
them should be theirs to make.
This is a personal decision.  As a General Rule I only refresh a Key
manually when I am specifically interested in that specific Key's
signatures and/or UID status or whenever I notice that it is showing
'Expired' and I wish to determine if the Key is still useful.
Refreshing, discarding & cleaning Key falls under the rubric of Keyring
Maintenance.  Like all maintenance; the frequency & intensity is
determined by the individual Keyring Owner.

Robert's answer was accurate but I'm not sure it was the answer to the
question You were asking.  Between versions 2.0.9 & 2.0.12 the Default
for Key Generation was changed.  This change is viewed as minor by many
which apparently includes the Ubuntu developers.  :)
The reason the Default was changed was to make better use of available
Hash functions.  DSA Signing Keys are limited to 160bit Hashes unless
DSA2 is invoked,  RSA Signing Keys can utilize all the Hash functions
without any 'games' being played.  To eliminate any confusion in the
future and based upon the number of folks who eventually migrated away
from DSA Keys to RSA Keys due to personal perceptions the Default was
changed to RSA.
Additionally, in the very beginning RSA was encumbered by patents which
have now expired.  You can easily work around this in Ubuntu at present
by selecting option 5 and then generating an RSA Encryption sub-Key.

Is there any particular reason why BZIP2 is missing from the Windows

Thanks David.  Rather than resetting the preferences on My Key and then
asking every correspondent to update the copy on their Keyring I suppose
I shall remain using 1.4.10svn5068 to avoid receiving messages that I
cannot decrypt if they were sent using BZIP2.  JOHN ;)

Since Werner and the literature state that it is Ok to install both
side-by-side is it really necessary to uninstall the 1.4.x version?  =-O

My usual 'solution' for this is to 'Disable' the non-preferred or unused
Key until such time as it is Revoked or I have been otherwise informed
it is deprecated beyond any further use.

Like GPG it utilizes the 1st encountered Key that matches the Send To:
address & is valid.

I was referring to the validity of the Key; _not_ the UID.  If the Key
isn't expired/revoked or disabled; GPG will use it when it comes upon it
in the 1st order encountered.  So does Command Line PGP.

Hash: SHA512
No, in this instance the File, Email, etc. is encrypted to each of the
Keys listed in the Group Line.
No.  There is _no_ Group Key.  An individual can only decrypt those
Files encrypted to their Public Key so it must be present in the Group
Line at the time of Encryption.
See Above.  Again, there is NO Group Key.  Files are encrypted to every
Key specified at the time of Encryption in the gpg.conf 'Group Line'.
Just add their Key ID to the end of the existing Line.  Alternatively,
if/when they leave the Group simply remove their Key ID from the 'Group
See previous answer.
Yes.  If You do not have their Key in Your Keyring there is no Key to
encrypt to.
Additionally, unless You also have the --trust-model always flag set
then You will need to lsign each Key in the Group Line to prevent GPG
from asking You if You really want to encrypt to each 'untrusted Key'
Additions & Subtractions from the Group Encryption will need to be
managed by _every_ individual Encrypting to the Group.
A 'Group Key' is generally recognized as a single Keypair that every
Member of the Group has both the Public & Private part.  With a 'Group
Key' everyone Encrypts to and Decrypts with the Group Keypair.

Hash: SHA512
If You actually 'lose' Your Private Key [i.e. Secret/Private half of the
Keypair] or lose and/or Forget Your Passphrase You are FUBAR.  This is
why the Enigmail Manual & Quick Start Guide both _strongly_ encourage
the generation of a Revocation Certificate [actually just a Special
Signature File] which You should then store somewhere away from Your
Keyrings.  Enigmail has a 'Wizard' for this.  :)
Under 'OpenPGP' on the toolbar at the top of Thunderbird You will find
an item in the Menu labeled 'Key Management' which will graphically
display Your Keyring(s).  [Hint: the default setting displays nothing
until a Key ID or Email Address is entered into the Search Box /unless/
You have checked the box 'Display All Keys'.
Where are the actual Keyring(s) in Win 7?  The crypto-geek answer is
"under %AppData% ? Roaming Directory/Folder _or_ C:\Program Files\GnuPG
assuming You accepted the Defaults when installing GnuPG.  :-\  You can
also use WinSearch and enter: secring.gpg or pubring.gpg.  This is the
Secret Keyring and Public Keyring respectively.  If You choose to burn
either of these [or both] to a Disk or store them on removable media
then I also suggest You include the File trustdb.gpg since this File
contains Your Assigned & Calculated Key Trust values.  It is located in
the same Directory/Folder as the other 2 Files.
At the risk of being called a heretic by My fellow Members of the
Enigmail Development Team I am also going to recommend a companion GPG
Frontend to You for use on Windows:  GPGshell
[ is an excellent tool for Key
Management [manipulation] that offers many 'clickable' options not
available within the Enigmail Key Manager as well as greatly simplifying
Command Line usage.  [Another Hint:  in order to fully enjoy & exploit
all of GnuPG's many features some Command Line familiarity is gonna be
Going way out on a limb I am going to assume that You are as yet unaware
of the gpg.conf File and it's usefulness.  Please do not hesitate to Ask
more Questions within this Forum/List as well as accept Google as Your
Friend.  As Questions specific to Enigmail begin to develop I heartily
suggest You also Join the Enigmail Mailing List as well.

UAV & Missile Operators don't need to know what the message said; just
where You are at the time it is Sent.  Radio transmissions are targeted
using "Huff-Duff" & GPS; Email is 'targeted' from the kludges.  True
enemies in 'hot combat' don't care what You're saying; only that You
never 'speak' again.  ?

Why not try adding to gpg.conf

This will suppress the prompt/warning as well.
Of course, since the Keys still have their Signatures Cathy could always
rebuild the Trustdb.
