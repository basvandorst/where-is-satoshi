@_subject: Different uids with different trusts? 
I'm using GnuPG 1.2.3 (from Debian unstable) and have
the following problem:
Person A has two uids (let's say foo and bar in
his key, from which person B signed one (e.g. before
person A added the second uid, let's say person B's
signature is on uid foo If person B now wants to
encrypt to foo using
gpg -e -r foo
everything wents smooth, but as soon as person B tries
to encrypt to bar using
gpg -e -r bar
he gets "There is no indication that this key really
belongs to the owner". Why is this so? Person A has self-signatures on his
uids and the key of A is signed by B, so why is the
second uid not trusted? The situation doesn't change, if person B sets the
owner-trust level of A's key to "full".

Ok, but let's say B sets the owner-trust of A to
"full". This means B trusts A to sign only uids which
are correct. But then, B automatically has to accept
bar as valid, because this uid is (self-)signed by
A. (?!)
With full owner-trust in Trent, they are indeed both
valid for Baker. (Or, if Baker trust Trent more than
Alice, the key of Trent is even more valid.) And I
would consider this the right behaviour with such a
owner-trust setting -- but gpg doesn't.
