@_subject: preferred alorithms list 
I want to change the list of preferred algorithms. So I have edited
the function keygen_add_std_prefs in g10/keygen.c and now I have:
    buf[0] = CIPHER_ALGO_RIJNDAEL;
    buf[1] = CIPHER_ALGO_TWOFISH;
    buf[2] = CIPHER_ALGO_3DES;
    buf[3] = CIPHER_ALGO_CAST5;
    build_sig_subpkt( sig, SIGSUBPKT_PREF_SYM, buf, 4 );
    buf[0] = DIGEST_ALGO_SHA1;
    buf[1] = DIGEST_ALGO_RMD160;
    build_sig_subpkt( sig, SIGSUBPKT_PREF_HASH, buf, 2 );
since I wuold like to use in order:
RIJNDAEL, TWOFISH, 3DES and CAST5 for the simmetric algorhitm and:
SHA1 and RMD160 for the hash algorhitm.
So, can you confirm if the corretions in g10/keygen.c are right to match this order?

@_subject: email on keyservers 
Maybe a  stupid question..  I have  two email  addresses, one  for general
purpose messages (mailing lists, etc.) and  the other for my friends. Now,
can I safetly upload a key with my "private" email address on a keyserver?
Or can  this information be  used by someone  that wants to  send spamming

@_subject: signed messages & mutt 
Sometimes I  get messages  that can't automatically  be verified  by mutt.
Really it  doesn't recognize them  as signed at all  (I can't see  the "s"
flag). This is a typical message body:
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
If I taka a look at the attachment list I can see something like:
I     1 msg.pgp                [text/plain, 7bit, us-ascii, 1,0K]
The "good signed" messages instead are composed by two attachments:
I     1        [text/plain, 7bit, us-ascii, 0,7K]
I     2        [applica/pgp-signat, 7bit, 0,2K]
Is this a problem with my MUA configuration or is this behaviour normal?

@_subject: signed messages & mutt 
thanks a lot for all these informations!
there is a mutt config variable I don't understand yet:
set pgp_sign_micalg=
   # message integrity check algorithm, where
   #  is something from the next: What is this MIC algorithm? Is it something different from the digest used
to sign  the message?  (the default  in my gpg  is using  SHA1 to  get the
message digest)

@_subject: multiple user ID 
What is the advantage of using several user ID for the same key?

@_subject: signing keys 
Many pgp/gpg users  put their key fingerprint in the  email header or body
and usually they also give an URL address to download the key from. How is
secure to check a key gotten from a keyserver following these steps?
1) check the fingerprint specified in the email
2) download the key  from the specified URL in the email and  see if it is
the same key
If I want to tamper a public key, I may write down a message, sign it with
my  tampered public  key,  upload that  key to  a  keyserver, specify  the
fingerprint of that  tampered key in the email header  and finally give an
URL which people can get the same  tampered key from. In this case the key
downloaded from  both the keyserver and  the URL are the  same. Obviously,
the fingerprint seems alright too!
So are  all these  information usefull  at all? if  I send  an email  to a
person I don't  know, how can he be more  confident about the authenticity
of my public key?

You know, I'm just new to openPGP. If  I want a friend of mine to securely
sign my  public key I  think she should  call me over  the phone as  it is
explained in the original Zimmermann's manual. She cannot completely trust
the information gained  from my 'X-PGP' headers, since in  this case there
is no 'history' at all.

yes, but this  is true also if  no information at all is  specified, it is
only time the point, not the fingerprint or URL in email headers.
yes, I think so

@_subject: decrypting multipart/mixed messages 
Sorry if this is OT, however I don't know where to ask this. How can I decrypt a message directly in mutt, if its Content-Type header
is multipart/mixed?
I tried to comment the line:
* !^Content-Type: multipart/ in my  .procmailrc file,  but now both  original message  and attachment
(which is not encrypted) are put together in the same decrypted message.
Do you know the cleverest way to try?

@_subject: gpg in cygwin environement 
I've installed  gpg on a  cygwin environement running on  windows2000 (I
want to use mutt and lots of other unix-like programs). Could you please
tell me what  security issues I need to consider  (secret key managment,
passphrase kept temporary in RAM.. I don't know..)
