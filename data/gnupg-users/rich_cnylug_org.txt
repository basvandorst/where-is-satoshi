The voices in my head told me that "Marcus"  said:
  Yes, and I'm an idiot.   :-)  I figured out the problem today.
  To save enviroment space (so my path doesn't get way out of hand) I
put a directory in my path that contains batch files that I use to call
many of the programs and utils that I frequently use.
  I was calling GPG from a batch file, and that was why it wasn't
working.  I simply added gnupg to my path directly (no longer using a
batch file) and piping works fine now.
  MY FAULT.   :-)

    Is there any way of writing some code that could actually be

 It would seem to make sense to write the code, and keep it in the
tree permanently, instead of constantly having to download the latest
version, and then hack in the IDEA code, compile, and release a
separate version.
  Plus I think most users would feel more secure and might feel
better if it was coming from the "official" GnupG home, instead if
grabbing the fragmenting versions of GnuPG (which there now seem to
be 2).

Well, now that Werner has added the code that allows the Win32
version to access modules like the IDEA module, why is the version
with it statically compiled even needed?  Once Werner releases 1.05
it's a done deal.  Users will be able to use IDEA seamlessly without
even a HINT of violating the GPL.  So for that guy (whose name
escapes me at the moment) to even keep his version around seems a
little suspect.
  And on another note, I  would like to thank Werner for all of his
tireless (and usually thankless) programming efforts and wish him and
everyone else here Happy Holidays!

Hello all, and happy holidays.
 While I agree that this person should not be distributing a GnuPG
version that is in violation of the GPL,  While I'm not certain that
this is necessarily the best forum for argue the point, I am certain
that this isn't the time of year to do it!   :-)
  If Werner isn't constantly being asked for a GnuPG library he's
having to see this kind of thing in his forums.   :-)
 I think the best solution to this problem is to let that guy (whose
name once again escapes me) do his thing, and let Werner do his thing
and let the chips fall where they may.  We really don't have the power
to make that guy STOP compiling his version of GnuPG with IDEA
compiled in, so why argue about it?  If in the future the IDEA patent
holders wish to go after him or the FSF, they will.  There are plenty
of witnesses that will testify that the official version does not
contain IDEA so I think Werner is safe from a legal perspective.
  I hope everyone gets that Quad CPU box with 1-gig of RAM that
they've been wanting!   :-)

Hi, this is a little off topic, so please don't use any expletives
after you read this!   :-)
   Some of you are aware that Timo has been working tirelessly on a
Windows frontend for the Win32 version on GnuPG, and his efforts have
yielded WinPT.  WinPT basically looks and feels like PGP-Tray does.  It
sits in your windows system tray until you right-click on it and all
sorts of wonderful things happen.  He's still working on it and it's
coming along nicely.
   However, he needs an ICON for the program.  He originally used a
padlock, and apparently the NAI people (who now own PGP) yelled at him!
   As a temporary fix he changed the padlock to one of the icons from
the GPA page, and when I mentioned to him that I thought WinPT needed
its OWN icon, apparently he had been thinking the same thing and came up
with the idea of a contest.  My main complaint when using the (very nice,
I might add) GPA icon was that when it got reduced to fit into the
system tray (Windoze system-tray icons are smaller than regular icons),
the key was no longer visible against the envelope.
  So now on Timo's site he has a page listing the rules of the WinPT
Icon Creation Contest.  The page can be found here:
  If I were an artist, I'd go for it, but my artistic talents are fairly
worthless.   :-)  having said that, my one suggestion would be to make
it so that it is recognizable as both a full-sized icon, and when it's

I've looked through the docs and haven't found any

in GPG's output when specifying the ARMOR option.
 PGP used to allow you to limit the size of the output
files so that you could send things through email
systems that had buffer size limitations.  It would
create a set of files calles *.as1, *.as2, etc....
 I found this feature very useful at times.

 And the GCC 2.96 is not quite kosher either.
 They recommend using the KGCC compiler for your kernel,

@_subject: Questions about Win32 version 
A few questions about the Win32 version.
  OK, is there a way to specify paths to your keys other than
with the command line switches --keyring and --secret-keyring?
 The command line version(s) of pgp (at leat 2.6x) had a
config.txt file where you could specify paths.  Does GPG
have this option?   The reason I ask is because I have my keyrings in a secure
Scramdisk volume, and I do not keep them in the same directory as the GPG executable.
 Also, does Win32 have a problem with the overall length of
the arguments that you can use when calling gpg?  I wrote
a batch file so that I didn't have to constantly type the
really long  --keyring and --secret-keyring switches, and
when I combine that with other arguments, GPG seems to
get confused, I thought that might be related to the sheer
number of characters on the command line at that point.
Perhaps I'm specifying things in the wrong order.  If you
were going to write a batch file for Windows to do what I
described, what would it look like?
 And lastly, I can get GPG to work with that batch file
when I do not specify any recipients.  GPG then asks
me for a recipient and then says something like 'you
may use "-r", which I assumed meant that by using the
-r option, you could then specify multiple recipients, but
if you use the -r switch there, it says, "no such user ID."
 Am I crazy?

@_subject: keyfile problem(s) 
Timo built a Win32 version of GnuPG 1.05g for use with WinPT and I
noticed something strange in its behavior.
 With this new version of GPG apparently the keyring file formats are
a little different so Timo recommended exporting both keyrings,
deleting your keyrings, and then importing them from the files we
exported.  Then delete the trustdb, and rebuild that.
 My keyrings are kept in an encrypted partition using Scramdisk.  I
have that drive mounted as drive-letter S: and the full path to the
keyrings is S:\pgp_keyrings\pubring.gpg   (although I think the the options file you use regular forward
slashes to tell GPG where the files are located.
 You get the picture.
  In any case when I tried to import my public keyring (bearing in
mind that the real keyrings are deleted at this point) it imported
them into the C:\gnupg directory instead of my encrypted S: drive. Then when I imported the secret keyring it gave me this error:
gpg: keyblock resource `S:/PGP_Keyrings/secring.gpg': file open error
gpg: keyblock resource `S:/PGP_Keyrings/pubring.gpg': file open error
 which is the error I always get if I forget to mount my scramdisk
partition and use GPG.  Except this time the scramdisk partition was
mounted.  And just like with the public keyring, GPG did import the
keyfile, but it created it in the C:\gnupg directory.
  Everything worked fine after I moved the new keyring files in the
scramdisk partition, but I just thought it was odd that it didn't
created the new files in the area where the options file told them
to.  I suspect it was because the actual destination files were

@_subject: New GnuPG command line option. 
Timo compiled a Win32 version of GnuPG with his dyn-load code
in it for me and I was fooling around with the IDEA module and was
testing compatibility between GnuPG and PGP 2.63i and a few of the
times I encrypted (conventionally) things to decrypt with PGP
2.63i I forgot to change the compression algo that GPG used, and
2.63i wasn't able to decrypt the file.  So I had the idea that perhaps you could add the command line
 --pgp26-compat
  And it will be like adding all of the command line options
necessary for complete backwards encryption compatibility with PGP
2.6x.  So if you type "--pgp26-compat" it would be like typing:
gpg --cipher-algo IDEA --digest-algo MD5 --compress-algo 1
--rfc1991 --s2k-algo MD5  --s2k-mode 0
  Etc... you get the idea.
 Am I crazy, or just nuts?  I mentioned this option to Timo and he
said to me, "Du bist verruckt" and I didn't know what it meant.  I
assume it was a compliment in German.   ;-)

When I met PRZ a few years ago he talked about his homebrew

American late-night, live, humour show that is still on the air. I'm sure someone here will be happy to explain the name in more
detail if asked).
  After Phil released 1.0 he went to a crypto conference and met
many famous crypto people, including the R, the S, and the A in
RSA.  He asked one of them (I forget which one) to look at his
Bass-O-Matic algorithm, and they found several weaknesses in it
within a few minutes.
 Suffice it to say, Phil scrapped his algo and gained a lot more
respect for the people who write the really good ones.

clear.   That you do not like it is not relevant.
   GnuPG is a Gnu program, and sponsors this forum, so you should
not complain if there are a few things which can not be discussed
here.    It's a simple rule and if you were in my home and could not
respect my wishes and behave the way I would like you to, then I
would ask you to behave, or to leave.  You would then have the
option of leaving, or modifying your behaviour.
  The original argument was clearly a flame, and a bad one at
 Graham (a very nice guy by the way)  would have us believe that
it's not OK to talk about a Gnu GPL'd software release because it
is for a non-free OS. In case any of you haven't been paying
attention for the last few years, the W32 version of GnuPG is
GPL'd, runs on a non-free OS, and is routinely discussed in here,
so clearly software releases that fit within those limits are OK.
Timo's WinPT and OE plugin fit within those limits so they are also
 GnuPG-Shell does not, so it's not OK.  You are free to start a
mailing list to discuss all crypto front ends if you wish.  There
are many places on the net which will let you do this for free. Perhaps I'll even subscribe to it.
  This set of rules is so simple and shockingly obvious I'm
surprised that anyone would dispute it.  I'm also disappointed
that someone would unsubscribe from this list because of it.
 When in someone else's home behave appropriately.

  I agree completely.  This delay has caused many users to move
away from the official release to some others.  Maybe not a bad
thing, but I would still rather see a W32 release around the same
time as a *nix release.

  Of course the OFFICIAL GnuPG 1.07 release from gnupg.org for
Win32 hasn't happened yet.  This will probably happen sometime on
Thursday (guessing).

@_subject: Win32 version of 1.07 
Isn't compiling a Win32 version simply a command line switch?
 Why does it take so long to get the official gnupg.org version of
GnuPG out?  I would think releasing it the same day as the linux
version would be no difficulty at all.
 Especially considering the problems that PGP is experiencing, and
that frankly, there are more (potential) Win32 users out there
than any other OS.
 GnuPG is one of the success stories that would do well to show
people on "the other side" the advantage of free software.

  Sure.  I'm capable of that.  But this IS the Win32 version we're
talking about, and many of the other W32 users might not be
capable of this.
 I know that the Win32 version is considered the "black sheep"
version, but nonetheless, I see no reason for it.
  Yes.    :-)
