@_subject: No Public Key Problem 
Getting errors as follows, I can't sign by myself with gpgsm of
gnupg2.0.1 on Fedora Core 5 Linux. Could you give some hint ?
   gpgsm: can't sign using `': No public key
   [GNUPG:] INV_RECP 1 command line are as follows.
   % ./gpgsm --detach-sign --include-certs 3 --status-fd 2 --local-user '' --output smime.p7s mew5430s-F
I tried 2 other user specifying way, such as, m-iizuka at ... and
''. Those results gave almost same error. Only
m-iizuka.cp.jp.nec.com gave me valid sign.
My certification is as follows(~/.gnupg/keyring.kbx).
   % gpgsm -kv

According to keydb.c at around 1035 line, I don't think there is
a method to specify myself with my e-mail address on the above my
certicication. How can I specify myself with gpgsm2.0.1 ?
Thanks in advance
