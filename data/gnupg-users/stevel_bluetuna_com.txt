@_subject: Encrypt from memory to disc? 
I have an application where I have data in memory that needs to be encrypted without ever being written to disc, even temporarily.
Using PGP I can run "pgp -feat" and then pipe the data to the pgp process. That works very well.
I have to do the same thing for GPG, but I can't figure out how to send data to GPG directly from memory.
Any suggestions greatly appreciated.
