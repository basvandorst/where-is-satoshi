@_subject: Publickey Algorithm IDs for --command-fd 
I was trying to automate the generation of subkeys, using the --command-fd option like this:
gpg --homedir /tmp/gnupgtest --status-fd 2 --no-tty --command-fd 0 --with-colons --edit-key E458A481 addkey
But i could not find the public key algorithm ids for ?GET_LINE keygen.algo? anywhere in the documentation.
It looks like the integers from the commandline interface without --command-fd, but is there any documentation on that?
