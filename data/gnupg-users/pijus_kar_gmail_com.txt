@_subject: Can't import public key 
We are using GnuPG 1.2.1 on AIX. We are trying to import a public key
received from others which is generated on GnuPG v2.
Will there be any problem importing the public key. While importing we are
getting below error -
gpg: key 1D75115C: invalid self-signature on user id xxx xxx xxx
gpg: key 1D75115C: invalid subkey binding
gpg: key 1D75115C: no valid user IDs
gpg: this may be caused by a missing self-signature
Is it something for the version incompatibility or in the key?
