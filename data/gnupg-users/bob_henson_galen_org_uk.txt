You don't have to pay for X.509 certificates, not for personal use any way.
Thawtes issue free personal certificates, and so do CAcert.
The latter publish their Root Authority PGP key on their website, which you
can import to your keyring and use as a partial "bridge" across the two
types of verification. For example, with their PGP key on my keyring, if I
sign (locally, I cannot credit it with sufficient trust to sign with an
exportable signature, since I cannot meet with them and fully verify it)
their key it assigns a degree of trust to John W Moore III's key, since his
key has been signed by their key already. One of my keys has been signed by
Thawtes (they don't do this any more - I guess for commercial reasons) so
there is a partial bridge there to another system. However, the only key on
my keyring which is fully trusted is Neil's, since we have met up and
correctly verified our keys.
I haven't used gpgsm, but I have fully functional X.509 key pairs on my key
ring and can sign OpenPGP keys with them. If you have a running copy of PGP
on your system you can import X.509 certificates to PGP and then export them
as armoured ASCII  files, which you can then import straight into OpenPGP.
BTW, do you live anywhere near Pula? If so, and you can wait for another
year till I make my annual visit to my friends there, we might be able to
solve part of your problem with not being able to meet people to countersign
any keys. The downside is, I haven't got many signatures on mine either, so
it's no big deal :-(

@_subject: Delete key from keyserver 
That's not the only reason though. The PGP Global Keyserver is dangerous, as
well as a nuisance, for a number of reasons. As it only shows one key on a
search for a users name, it might cause people to miss a revoked key and
continue using it. Similarly, because it doesn't synchronise with other
servers, such a key could be missed. My key was on there because I tried PGP
9.x and it puts it there without asking - most undesirable in itself - but
at least by ignoring the requests to repeat the e-mail verification it
should have been removed by now. The "verification" is dangerous in itself,
since people may rely on the server signature for trust - which is not a
good idea for obvious reasons - anyone could upload a key from a particular
address, and e-mail verification *alone* is of little value. If anyone
*does* use it, whatever you do *don't* sign the PGP verification key, as it
will impart an unwarranted trust to other keys signed with the same key. My
advice (shared by many more knowledgeable than I) would be to steer clear of
it at all costs.

Put it the other way round - what useful purpose do they serve? I haven't
seen one yet, ergo they are junk. I don't even like the added signatures
when a key is edited, unless it is that particular signature that is edited
I would prefer to see the original signature date. Cleaning the key removes
the older ones, instead of the junk ones.
It may do with the nightly builds, but it doesn't yet work on the release
version of GPG.
Sadly, I doubt PGP corporation would take any notice of a petition - they
don't even listen to and reply their paid subscribers comments, never mind
those that don't use PGP.

A P.S. to the last message. I added the above lines and tried again, and
neither refreshing a key from the keyserver, uploading a key, nor
downloading a new key cause the "clean" to run.
I must be doing something silly in the set-up. I created a new file in the
same directory as gpg.exe (OK?) called gpg.conf (OK?) and added to it
*exactly* your lines above (not line wrapped in the case of the third line.
I exited Thunderbird, restarted, and tried the keyserver procedures above.
No joy. Does that sound correct?
Maybe it doesn't work via Enigmail? I'm using GPG 1.4.2 via Enigmail
0.92.0.0. I checked the doc file I got with GPG 1.4.2 and whilst it lists
the import/export-options "clean" command there is no equivalent
key-server-option "clean" command listed - this may just be an oversight in
the doc file, of course.
I'll away and try exporting my keyring to see what happens.

Hmm, I did mean 1.4.2 - so I'd better try again then, Doug. I tried adding

I finally got that sorted and got it to work, so thanks for the replies and
the help. Sadly, when I ran a complete keyring refresh, it screwed up the
key-ring altogether (error messages discussed in here before - can't
remember precise details from last night, but it concerned something being
shorter then the buffer length) and I had to re-install it from an old
backup. Just for the moment, I think I'd better stop meddling with things I
don't understand, and just use the system when it's working OK. Having said
that, I'm off to find out how to change my passphrase from the old back-up
keyring to my current passphrase - so I'll probably make a complete hash of
that too (pun intended :-) )

Thanks, that's what I was trying to find out. I was confused by all the
formats (and their extensions) for sharing information - .pfx .p7b .cer etc.
I was trying to use data from Windows and import to GPG. As you remark, the
extension is irrelevant, so long as the file is DER encoded binary (
possibly base 64 as well? - I haven't tried that). I have managed (don't ask
me how) to get what appears to be a working x.509 certificate from Thawtes
onto my GPG keyring, and have self signed it. I thought I'd have a go at
getting another onto the keyring, but didn't know what format to export it
from Windows. It would appear that I can only export the *public* keys from
the X.509 certs as binary files - the key pairs will only export in .pfx
format, which GPG won't import, so I guess it's some sort of Windows
proprietary format.
This is more or less for academic interest only, and I am only able to work
on an empirical basis, not understanding the technicalities involved - but
when, as I am, you're crocked and stuck indoors and have nothing else to do
it seemed like a good idea :-)

That's exactly what had happened. GnuPG was looking for the keyring in its

specific directory where the keyring lives normally. I'm not used to using
it from the command line, but I saw that in the gpg directory there were 0
byte keyrings so I deleted them, then ran the --list-keys command and it
recreated them. Assuming, therefore, that it had "lost" the directory, I
read back in the install notes and found the appropriate registry key and
reset it to point GnuPG back at my keyrings and voila! - all was well.
Anyway, thanks to everyone for the help. Now the only problem is to get rid
of the bits of GPGOL left in Outlook - every time I run it I get an error
message telling me it can't find the GPGOL .dll file - hardly surprising
because I deleted it. It looks as though there are a few registry entries I
haven't found and deleted yet. Still, now everything is working again that's

After I posted the message, and before reading yours, I deleted

it may be that a grunged message was causing the problem and I've now

Apologies if I wasted anyone's time - I found the problem. The installer

the new files to show up. A note for the developers though, it would be
a good idea to add the option for an automatic reboot - most programs do
that if it is necessary. I didn't see that mentioned in the instructions
either - but, of course, I may have missed it somewhere. Anyway, I think
I've got it all running OK now.
 I did hit a problem with Outlook after installing and setting up GPGol
- but it may not have been connected, perhaps just a co-incidence
(unless anyone knows better?). I tried to change Outlook's "send and
receive" preferences, but clicking the menu item had no effect at all. I
had to re-boot the computer again to restore its normal functionality.

Rather than the files being missing (which I think I've explained above)
there were no menu entries or configuration tab etc in Outlook, so I

I'm not that technical - but I can tell you that basic signing and
encryption with GnuPG (what else would anyone want it for?) isn't hard
to use at all, even for an ancient old geezer like me. The thing to do
is to forget all about command lines and run it from Enigmail within
Thunderbird (easiest and best) or the appropriate extension/s within
Claws Mail. Most other Linux e-mail clients will do it too - but most
other Linux e-mail clients are very poor, in my experience.
If, as you imply above, you are looking for a more universal system of
encryption, then PGP/OpenPGP certainly isn't the one to use - it is
intended to be a "person to person" system used between people known to
one another and whose keys can be countersigned with absolute certainty.
There is already a system, albeit far from perfect, which lends itself
to large scale use and that is the X.509 certificate system - already
widely used.

I'm not sure whether I should be asking in here or in the Enigmail
group, so I'm trying here first - please refer me to the other group if
it is more appropriate.
I've just changed over to GnuPG 2.1.x and have been trying out an ECC
key too. By and large, it all seems to work well (signatures verify, and
encryption/unencryption works fine too) , but whilst sending test
messages back and forth to myself using new and old keys for signing and
encryption I noticed a couple of odd things, and it would be useful to
know if they are related to GnuPG 2.1.x, or Enigmail (or even the ECC
key - although that isn't likely). I'm using PGP/MIME for all messages.
The first problem is trivial - if I send an HTML message, the signature
verifies correctly, but the body of the message vanishes without trace -
nothing at all shows up when trying to read the received message.
There's an easy answer, I know - don't use HTML. I'm quite happy to do
that, but I'm old and I forget :-(
The second is a bit of a problem and will look odd if it happens when I
send mail to others. Signing a message with either my old key or the new
ECC key, and sending it to myself encrypted to both keys results in no
problems with the signature or decryption, and the message appears OK.

Whilst that is partially useful, surely it only vouches for the fact
that the postings came from the same person and not who that person is -
and as such is of very limited use. I have a "newsgroup" key for that
purpose - but it is a tad pointless. I think I know the person who calls
himself Robert J. Hansen and you have certainly corresponded with
someone called Robert H. Henson, but we have no idea who those people
are unless we meet. Keys should only ever be signed in person and if the
person is not well known to you by sight, with some form of irrefutable
photo evidence being presented along with the key signature - a
passport, or something carrying equal weight.
There might be a possible exception where there is no individual person
to meet - the verification signature with software, say. When you have
downloaded the software from the same, known website for some time it
might be reasonable to sign the verification key - if a tad pointless if
it is only really a checksum. Perhaps the same applies to a Certificate
Authority key, say. But a signature of any person's key that you have
not met and positively verified is worse than useless as it degrades the
whole trust process. Someone who I had never previously even heard of
once signed my old, now revoked key - were that person someone "known"
to be nasty, it would have degraded my key's value. The best it could
have been is totally meaningless.

If the program has been altered the signature will fail, will it not?
Agreed. But a new user who has yet to be educated would baulk at
trusting a key signed by Genghis Khan or Atilla the Hun - however they
perceived it, they might well refuse to acknowledge the signature as
valid and would certainly not sign it or assign it user trust - that's
human nature. Human beings are essentially illogical. :-)
