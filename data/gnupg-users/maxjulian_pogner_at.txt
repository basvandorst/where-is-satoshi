@_subject: Expire a single UID 
Hello there!
I have quite a problem with properly bisecting a UID from my key. Maybe
someone can help me?
Here's the situation:
This is currently my GnuPG-Key, and will remain my primar key:
However, my contract with OpenResearch changes from freelancer to
hired-employee. As a consequence, i will stop using my own
Infrastructure but using their pc. Therefore, i will also read and write
emails from the new work-pc.
But i do not want to copy my secret key 0x2D40BDB44401A8AA to the new
work-pc (which is very much their property and not under my full
administrative control but under their company-it administrative control).
Therefore, my current plan is to simply generate a completely new secret
key with UID max-julian.pogner at openresearch.com. This also will not be a
problem with the customers where gnupg is actually in use (less than 5
persons to be honest).
Now there is a problem: Then there will be two keys published for
max-julian.pogner at openresearch.com! This surely will cause confusion.
*) should i revoke the uid on the old key? => However, as far as i know,
the secret key is not / was never compromised.
*) the UIDs were certified by me and by other persons without expiration
dates. => I can change the expiration date of the primary key and
subkeys using "gpg2 --edit-key" and "expire", but the UID remains valid
*) Also, other persons have signed the UID
max-julian.pogner at openresearch.com at key 0x2D40BDB44401A8AA without
expiration date. What should they do?
Thanks for any hints!

Then i'll revoke the uid.
That would be actually a very good solution. However, due to lacking my
experience and lacking general acceptance, I have to postpone this until
some other day.
Thanks for the help!
