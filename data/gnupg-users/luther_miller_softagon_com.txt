@_subject: Specify --homedir with GNUPGHOME? 
I am able to specify the location of the gpg files including the trust
database and keyring successfully by using the --homedir option under
Windows 2000, but I would like to be able to set an environment variable
instead. I have tried HOME and GNUPGHOME to no avail. What should I be
setting? I am using Win32 GnuPG 1.2.1.
Thanks in advance...

@_subject: file extension, gnupgp on Win 
I just recently started using gpg on Windows 2000. If I encrypt a file
called "test.csv" and I do not include an output filename, then
"test.gpg" is created (not "test.csv.gpg"). I have not tried yet, but I
am also curious what the file will be called upon decryption.

AFAIK, this is not the default behavior. If you don't specify an output=20
filename on the command line prior to encryption, you will end up with=20
test.zip.gpg, which will then decrypt to test.zip.
The command I use on linux is:
gpg --encrypt --recipient xxx test.zip
...that creates an encrypted file test.zip.gpg
