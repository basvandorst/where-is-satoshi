@_subject: gpg dyn-linking error __register_frame_info 
I'm running Slakware 4.0, with gcc-2.95.
Trying out gpg-0.9.10.
Just a basic build:
$ tar xvzf gnupg-0.9.10.tar.gx
$ cd gnupg-0.9.10
$ ./configure --with-included-gettext
$ make
gpg actually compiles, but when the `make'
gets to check gpg, gpg failed with an unresolved symbol...
make[2]: Entering directory
../g10/gpg --yes --dearmor -o ./pubring.gpg ./pubring.asc
../g10/gpg: can't resolve symbol '__register_frame_info'
just running ../g10/gpg gets this error too...
by the way:
$ ldd g10/gpg
        libz.so.1 => /usr/lib/libz.so.1 (0x4000b000)
        libdl.so.1 => /lib/libdl.so.1 (0x4001a000)
        libgdbm.so.1 => /opt/kde/lib/libgdbm.so.1 (0x4001d000)
        libc.so.5 => /lib/libc.so.5 (0x40023000)
What's going on?  What's __register_frame_info all about?
Please help, I want to start using this puppy!!

Actually, I'm not using that.  I don't even know what that is...
by the way,  I'm getting:
$./gpg --vv
./gpg: can't resolve symbol '__register_frame_info'
Is this a compiler/linker problem? I'm using gcc 2.95 with binutils 2.9.1.

@_subject: New UK crypto law and an idea on how to defeat it 
There are many levels of people who are interesting to the police.
It isn't a matter of black and white, pedophile or avg-person.
This would certainly been used against Gandhi, M.L. King, Phil Zimmerman,
Tories, Sinn Fein, Communists, GreenPeace, the Pope, movie stars, and a
host of other completely responsible intellectuals and influential
(or potentially influential) public figures.
To bury your head in the sand like that is unacceptable..  I wonder
what would bring such a naive person to the GnuPG mailing list.
Unless you're a covert (or even overt) gov't. propagandist.

Nyahh... the source to the tool?
If you can tell that from knowing about the cipher, then the tool isn't
a cryptographic tool at all, it's just a fancy multiplexer.
It's certainly possible to make the ciphertext indistinguishable from
a single encrypted message.
PS: I really hope you're being sarcastic about the Pedophile and Organized Crime thing.

@_subject: Palmtop crypto 
I would love to get PGP or GnuPG working on
a palmtop (I've got a PalmIII).
I keep fantasizing about using my palmtop as a sort
of a smart-card, plugging it into all the computers I use..
I also dream about using it to do secure email where ever
I am.  I could keep my keys on the unit, and even do
the decryption on the unit.  Key exchange/signing with
a Palm could be done at cocktail parties using the IR port
in seconds.
The palm needs some serious data protection.
I'd like to keep encrypted memos on it.
I have a feeling that the password protection
on powerup is a backdoor-party and a joke.
Its Just a dream...  I wonder how feasible it is?
I know a lot of Free Software junkies (like me)
are also big Palm-heads.
