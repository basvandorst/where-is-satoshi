@_subject: Errors compiling 1.2.4 on OpenBSD 3.4 
i have problems compiling gnupg-1.2.4 on OpenBSD 3.4. It's a fresh
install. The error appears with make and gmake:
_mpih-mul1.s: Assembler messages:
_mpih-mul1.s:114: Error: Alignment not a power of 2
_mpih-mul1.s:132: Error: Alignment not a power of 2
gmake[2]: *** [mpih-mul1.o] Error 1
gmake[2]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/gnupg-1.2.4/mpi'
gmake[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
gmake[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/gnupg-1.2.4'
gmake: *** [all] Error 2
I also attached the output of ./configure as a .txt file
Any ideas?

@_subject: outdated documentation 
my problem (
in installing gnupg has been solved, thanks to Mike.
But now i'm facing more difficulties. It seems that the documentation
to gnupg is very outdated. For example the GnuPG-Mini-Howto is from
1999 (the english translation is from 2002, but that's just the
translation from 1999 german original). GPH also is from 1999.
Right now I started with the mini-howto. But I soon got confused. Many
commands just don't work or aren't described good enough. The "UID" is
often needed, but it is never explained what the UID is and where to
find it. (I created my key and wanted to create the revoke certificate
as stated in GPH and mini-howto, well, I failed because I don't know
my UID or so). The gpg manpage also tells me to look at the GPH and Howtos.
My main problem seems to be, that I don't really know what the UID or
Key-ID is and how to find it out. Am I blind, or do I misunderstand
something important?
My destination is to use gpg together along with mutt to automatically
sign, encrypt and decrypt messages. But before I go for that I want to
understand how it works and how to use it manually.
Is more up to date documenation in the works?
I hope to be able to use encryption soon :-)

Hi David,
Mike already pointed me to
but only solution  (--disable-asm) was working for me. Solution gives the same error.
I am not a developer, how exactly I have to do this?
thanks for help,

Hi David,
this worked flawlessly! What did you change?

I tried it on my gateway which still runs OpenBSD 3.3. Well, it didn't
work out. A lot of undefined symbols ...
So it seems that OpenBSD changed its assembler handling with 3.4

patch the already patched version or a freshly unzipped one?

worked for 3.4, failed for 3.3 ... still the undefined symbols

Thank you very much! That helped a lot. I wonder why this isn't
mentioned anywhere in the documentation.
Good to know, but at the moment i don't yet know the meaning of subkeys
and signing stuff, but i'm actually into it.

i use gnupg with mutt. Mutt automatically downloads pubkeys from a
keyserver to verify a signature if the pubkey isn't yet in my keyring.
But everytime a sig is checked i get following output:
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!               gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the \
what does that mean? Many of the keys of which this happens are signed
by many people.
When verifying my own mails this message doesn't appear.

@_subject: header modification from this list list manager software 
could it be, that the list managing software for this mailinglist
modifies the headerinformation?
normally my Content-Type of signed messages is:
        protocol="application/pgp-signature";
a signed mail from this list has:
multipart/mixed; boundary="===============XXXXXXXXXXXXXX=="
this leads my mutt to not detecting signed mails as signed and reports
that the Signature could not be verified (Well, the gpg output is
why this?

Yes, there is a reason why i haven't put my key onto a keyserver yet. I
played around with gnupg many times before and uploaded my key to the
keyservers. Well, this was bad because i didn't know what i did at that
time. Now i have three unused keys on the keyservers. But now i'm "grown
up" and did the pgp-thing seriously. I just wanted to make sure that i
can really use it before uploading my key. I'll upload it soon!
Okay, i think i get it. The bigger my web of trust gets, the higher
the chances that one person signed my, and some of keys from the ppl of
this list.

No, i have all the public keys, they are retrieved automatically. The
gpg output is saying that the signature is good, but mutt don't mark the
mails with an "s" for signed, and tells me that the signature could not
be verified (which is not true, due to the good gpg output). So it seems
that my mutt configuration has problems only with mails from this list.
Yes, but don't worry, your sigs are okay. Try to send me a PM. I think
everything is okay then ...
I'm just going to ask the mutt guys :-)

But AFAIK you can use the pipe in cmd.exe (command.com). It should be
possible with a batchfile or something like that.
