@_subject: problems decrypting ASCII-armored file 
I encrypted a file (on Mac OSX) some time ago using:
And then uploaded the outputted file to Google Docs.
Some time later I downloaded the file, and I can't even get gpg to sink its
teeth in:
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: processing message failed: eof
I'm using the following version to decrypt:
gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.16

Here's the file's header as viewed with "less" (the starting non-printing
character is suspicious):
Any suggestions?
