@_subject: bad signature on encrypted and signed block? 
Can a GPG encrypted AND signed block (as in $gpg -a -e -s -r email
msg.txt) end up showing a "BAD signature" warning? Or is it impossible
because changes to the block would make it invalid, giving a CRC error
before the signature could be checked?
Thanks for any info or pointers on this.

Hi Geoff,
Citando Geoff:
AFAIK you can just compile and install GNU Pth, no need to update
Slackware's glibc.
Actually, I have created SlackBuilds for GnuPG 2.x and all it's
dependencies, including libpth. I only tested these scripts under
Slackware 11.0, but you could give them a try under Slackware 9.1.
You can find them at:
Create and install the packages following the order above and you
shouldn't have any problems regarding dependencies. Also, these scripts
should take care of downloading the sources (and its signatures), if
Let me know if/how it works out.
