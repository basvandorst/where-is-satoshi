Hash: SHA1
It hurts me to ask for help on something which should be simple..but I do
need help.
I have downloaded the RSA and IDEA plugins and tried compilation.I have
tried every combination and permutation to no avail
Would someone please guide me. I put this down to my inexperience with
Linux, so perhaps this should be off list. All help willbe appreciated

@_subject: Installation of RSA/DSA plugins 
Hash: SHA1
I have been trying to install the RSA/IDEA plugins for some time now.
When I type in the compile command (as per the instructions) I get the
following response.
gcc: fPIC: No such file or directory
idea.c: 127 warning redefinition of 'ulong
previously declared here
idea.c: 128: warning: redefinition of 'ushort'
previously declared here.
I also receive the same for the RSA file.
I have never tried a c compilation before ..any comments as to what is
wrong or lacking (apart from basic knowledge)

@_subject: Error with signing and encryption using RSA extension 
Hash: SHA1
I have eventually managed to install the RSA/IDEA extensions...however I am
still having problems.
When I encrypt and sign and I sheck the message on my Linux box, the
message shows no signature.
If I e-mail the message to myself and download it on to my Windoze system,
I receive an error message:
and the process fails completely.
If I just wish to sign the message with the RSA key everything appears to
be OK.

@_subject: Compatibility with PGP 
Hash: SHA1
I have been trying to gain backward compatibility with some older
versions of PGP and I installed the rsa and idea extensions over the
week end, so that I could (hopefully) communicate with users of PGP
I have come across a few problems.
I have a Linux system, and I use Kmail and Geheimnis. Kmail has a PGP
link so  I use PGP5.0i to automatically verify and decrypt messages
when they are opened. PGP is buggy and less flexible than GnuPG, so I
use GnuPG to sign and encrypt all of my outgoing messages.
I also have a Windoze system with Eudora and PGP 6.0.2ckt.
This set up has worked very well, and I have had no problem with DH/DSS
However things do no work so well when using RSA.
I will list the combinations and permutations.
1) RSA Sign.....Signature good on PGP 5.0, 6.0.2, and 2.6.3
2)RSA Encrypt ....Decryption by PGP 5.0, and 6.0.2 but not by 2.6.3
3)RSA Sign and Encrypt...... PGP5.0 decrypts, but can find no signature.
                                                      decrypt.
Needless to say...all functions are OK when GnuPG is used for
signing/encryption/verification/decryption.But then not everyone uses
Does anyone have any comments or suggestions as to how I can get round
this problem?
