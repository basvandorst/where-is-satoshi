@_subject: Key Type & Size / Multiple Email Accounts / Key Server Questions 
I'm new to GnuPG.  You might say that I'm in learn and test mode before using full time and publish keys to key servers.  I have several questions.  They are as follows:
1) What type of key do you suggest?  I ask this question because I'll use GnuPG primarily for signing but in limited instances for encryption.  I've read the manual and know DSA is limited to a size of 1024 bits, and is used only for signing.  ElGamal can be used for both signing and encryption with no limit on size.  My first inclination is to use the default of DSA & ElGamal.  See question  when answering.
2) With the advancement of computing power what key size do you recommend?  Presently I'm using an old P166 PC that will update in the near future.  For getting off the ground with GnuPG I have tested with type 1 (DSA & Elgamal) with both having a size of 1024 bits.  After generating the keys this size hasn't really pushed this old PC.  It hasn't really been exposed to much either.
3)  If you have multiple email accounts on one key and put on a key server, would these multiple email accounts then be analogous to being published in a telephone book?

I plan on using GnuPG.  Unless I missed something RSA was NOT an option.
Using GnuPG reading these threads and your reference I would say a primary key type of DSA to sign at maximum size of 1024, and a key type of ElGamal to encrypt with a size of 4096.  It sounds like I may run into some problems with the ElGamal which I understand is a derivative of DH. Thanks for the info!

Hello Joel,
JKP> Any idea when someone will post a pre-compiled 1.0.7 win32 binary on
JKP> the website?
If you are referring to official GnuPG's website, to my knowledge probably
never on 1.0.7. The reason is a newer version has already been compiled for
version 1.1.90 at
ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/alpha/gnupg/gnupg-1.1.90.tar.gz (2.4M)
and a diff against 1.0.7:
I don't believe this is disclosed on the official website at GnuPG because
from what I here they are working on version 1.2. This could have changed,
since I last looked which is some time ago. As I understand odd version
numbers are development with even being more stable versions. I am using the
pre-compiled version of 1.1.90 without problems with GPGShell 2.45 on Win98.
If that is the route you want to go thought you might be interested in that
There are different flavors of 1.0.7 available at Anyway thanks for the info.  Hopefully when I get some priorities in line
someday I will be able to compile my own.  Thanks again.

Hello GnuPG,
What configuration is necessary to create detached signature files for
multiple files when they all have the same file extension?
In the GPG FAQ.txt file I believe this is somewhat covered in section
4.14, "How can I use GnuPG in an automated environment?"
So I created a separate option file in GPGShell with another set of key
rings.  I have the option set in GPGShell pointing to both the new
public & secret key rings. I removed the password on the only key on
this special key ring just for auto signing.
Now when I run the command "gpg --batch -sb *.doc" from a Win98 DOS box,
gpg doesn't ask for the password, but it only signs 1 of 4 files that
meet the *.doc syntax.
Is GPG capable of signing multiple files with 1 command from a DOS box
in Win98?
If yes, what configuration is necessary?

When I export both public & secret key to another public & secret key

This would be nice because I wouldn't have to remove passphrase & create

using a pipe doesn't the program have to ask for passphrase once. I am
on Win98, so is this command compatible with Win98? If no and on Win2k
wouldn't I still have to provide passphrase at least once?

No problem but I need to get working on command line first. According to
gpg.man file:
       --passphrase-fd n
                 Read  the  passphrase from file descriptor n. If
                 you use 0 for n, the  passphrase  will  be  read
                 from  stdin.     This  can  only be used if only
                 one passphrase  is  supplied.   Don't  use  this
                 option if you can avoid it.
I am no programmer but do enjoy learning, so my question is what is
stdin? Is this some temporary file on Win2k or NT machine where the
passphrase is stored?

I checked the DOS 5.0 manual and the FOR command is in it. I would
imagine the FOR command works in Win98. It has to because the 1st
command line you gave worked. It has to do with this part:
echo passphrase|gpg --passphrase-fd 0 --detach-sign %f
When I type the full command in the output in Win98 DOS box is the
D:\Email02>echo PASSPHRASE
It appears gpg is NOT running. It is simply echoing the word
"PASSPHRASE" in the command. I think it has to do with how we are trying
to capture the password with the "echo" command.
So I tried the following command:
FOR %f IN (*.doc) DO gpg --passphrase-fd 0 --detach-sign %f
Now the passphrase is not asked for but gpg is looking for it in the
file descriptor 0.  See output below:
D:\Email02>gpg --passphrase-fd 0 --detach-sign MON106.DOC
gpg: NOTE: THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT VERSION!
gpg: It is only intended for test purposes and should NOT be
gpg: used in a production environment or with production keys!
Reading passphrase from file descriptor 0 ...
It is doing this for every *.doc file in the directory. So what command
has to be included so that gpg asks and stores the password in file
descriptor 0 for the subsequent files.

I like to do things in steps. Obviously there is a problem, but what.
When attempting to figure out I think about section 4.14, "How can I use
GnuPG in an automated environment" in the GPG FAQ.txt file. I already
have multiple signing with your 1st command looking at separate key
rings with no password on the key. So this all maybe a mute point.

E> I was able to make it work with the following commandline:
E> FOR %%f IN (*.txt) DO gpg --passphrase-fd 0 < pasphrase.txt
E> --detach-sign %%f (passphrase is read from 'passphrase.txt')
Thanks it works.  I should mention 3 issues for others who are
1) Save passphrase in a file name less than or equal to 8 characters
   because on Win98 in DOS box the tilde (~) will be used to truncate
   the name of the file to 8 characters. In other words if I saved my
   passphrase to "pasphrase.txt" which is 9 characters long, then in a
   DOS box it must be entered as "PASPHR~1.TXT".
2) When creating detached signature files with GnuPG from the command
   line the syntax of the file name for the detached signature file is
   different than when created with GPGtools of GPGshell. For example
   the original file name to create a detached signature is "test.doc"
   with GPGtools the detached signature file's name is "test.doc.sig"
   whereas from the command line it is "test.sig"
3) Do a secure wipe of the file which your passphrase was stored. I use
   Eraser which has Gutmann or US DOD wipe options available. Obviously
   this is of concern where your PC is not secure. Others on the list
   I'm sure have other thoughts about security on a Windows machine, but
   that is a discussion I don't want to even get into.

According to the MinGW FAQ at  the

"MSYS or Minimal SYStem is a POSIX and Bourne shell environment use with
MinGW. It provides a hand picked set of tools to allow a typical
configuration script with Bourne syntax to execute. This allows most of
the GNU packages to create a Makefile just from executing the typical
configure script which can then be used to build the package using the
native MinGW version of GCC.
The POSIX layer used by MSYS is a fork of the 1.3.3 version of Cygwin.
Cygwin is a full POSIX layer and UNIX-like environment for Win32
providing both server and client utilites."
I would imagine the MSYS will provide the POSIX environment from the
statement above. I just haven't determined whether it is included the
MinGW-2.0.0-3.exe file that is 12,825,271 bytes available at
 Is the MSYS

@_subject: Creation Date GnuPG 1.1.90 on secret key? 
Hash: SHA1
Hello All,
Why does GnuPg version display a creation date of 7-22-02 on the
secret key when in fact it was 7-21-02?
The date on the public key is correct.  When I list the key I receive
the following information:
pub  1024D/EF2178E3  created: 2002-07-21 expires: never      trust: u/u
sub  4096g/2624CFE7  created: 2002-07-22 expires: never
(1). Greg Strong (Gold Wing Rider) Is this possibly due to not setting the time zone variable in my
autoexec.bat file or is this a bug in 1.1.90? I did restore my OS
partition which probably wiped the one that did exist of
"SET TZ=CST6CDT,04,1,0,7200,10,-1,0,7200,3600".
Please note I've copied the GPG output from GPGshell below when the
test message was "encrypted-to" Melissa Reese's public key 0E3EDC07
using my new secret key 2624CFE7 . I have the setting in GPGshell to
also "encrypted-to" my public key id 0xEF2178E3.
gpg: NOTE: THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT VERSION!
gpg: It is only intended for test purposes and should NOT be
gpg: used in a production environment or with production keys!
gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit RSA key, ID 0E3EDC07, created 2001-06-23

@_subject: Importing Keys causes multiple sets of Key Rings 
Hash: SHA1
Hello gnupg-users,
When I import keys GnuPG & GPGshell create multiple sets of key rings.
Is this a problem with GnuPG, GPGshell, or my options file?
I'm using GnuPG version 1.1.90. The duplicate key rings are stored in
different directories. The designated path to the key rings is
"a:\ring\xxxring.gpg with the second set of rings ending up in the
default path for GnuPG of D:\Program Files\GnuPG\xxxring.gpg after the
import. I have Win98 registry and Autoexec.bat file settings below,
however I don't believe these settings cause the problem.
You should also know I use multiple sets of options files due to using
keys for different purposes. I have my options set to store my key
rings on my floppy drive. Each of the option files is stored in the
GPGshell child directory below the GnuPG directory. An example of one
of my option files is indicated below.
I did use this setup with the prior version of GnuPG 1.0.6. I don't
recall this problem of multiple sets of king rings in key imports with
the prior version of GnuPG and GPGshell when using my floppy drive for
the key rings.
Any ideals?  TIA!

@_subject: Install GnuPG on Win98?  Use GPA? 
I've downloaded GnuPG 1.0.6 and GPA.  I'm assuming GPA is the standard Win32 GUI to use with GnuPG after reading a few messages.  The files are gnupg-w32-1.0.6-2.zip and gpa-0.4.3.tar.gz, respectively.  It looks like most of the documentation on the web site pertains to the "standard" installation onto Linux and running GnuPG from the prompt.  The site does state GnuPG can be used on Win32 OS's.  I would rather use GnuPG with a more user friendly frontend, but have experience working from the prompt on DOS before Windows took over.  I would like to use GnuPG with my email client either encrypting email or using with signatures for authentication.  Presently I'm using Virtual Access 5.51 for an email client, but this may change to Agent in the future.
My questions are as follows:
1) Any special installation instructions for Win98?
2) If GPA is the standard GUI, can I use this with any email program?  3) If  is yes, is there any threads in the archives which would provide some help.  I'm never used PGP.  I've read the Howtos and parts of the manual, so I have some background.  Actually using the application would be the best experience, and would like to get a good start.  TIA!

@_subject: Install GnuPG on Win98?  Use GPA? 
If the package you are referring to is at  then I don't believe GPA is bundled.  From reading the documentation only WinPT & GnuPG.  The site now has documentation in English, so no translation Since I have NOT used GnuPG, the integration into email is a little vague to me at this time.  I will have to install and use.  I would imagine the frontend plugins basically make the integration into the email client One of the reasons I want to try WinPT is the fact that it is not email client dependent.  I haven't yet decided what email program I will using long term, so this is a big plus.  From the GnuPG reading I've done so far, you can use it to encrypt a message or sign a message.  As I understand it the signing of the message authenticates the message being sent by you.  Since most of the people I communicate online with do not use PGP, this would be my primary purpose.  However, if needed the encryption option is always a big plus.
After receiving the WinPT recommendation from you and other sources, I have decided to give it a try.  Thanks for the information.

Are there any restrictions on using GnuPG for commercial use?  GnuPG says at  that "GnuPG is a complete and free replacement for PGP. Because it does not use the patented IDEA algorithm, it can be used without any restrictions."  While the installation instructions for GPGshell at  states that If you want to use GPG in a non-commercial environment I recommend to use the following GPG-version. Please keep in mind that this file contains a version with implemented IDEA-algorithm which is free only for non-commercial use!"
On  the author states that "GPGshell is a graphical interface for GnuPG (GNU Privacy Guard). GnuPG is a free RFC2440 (OpenPGP) compliant replacement for PGP. Because it does not use the patented IDEA algorithm, it can be used without any I've scanned the GNU General Public License (GPL) in plain text format at   I believe this license governs the distribution of GnuPG.  I don't recall seeing any restrictions on use meaning commercial versus non-commercial.
The only thing I can see different is the fact that GPGshell installation instructions reference a different file, gnupg-w32-1.0.6.zip, than GnuPG, gnupg-w32-1.0.6-2.zip.

Hello Steve,
SK> None provided. If you want to wipe the swap file properly on

For Win98 the Eraser instructions state you have to boot to DOS to run
eraserd.exe. I've written batch file to run eraserd.exe on a
multi-boot PC, to wipe swap files for both bootable partitions.
If I could do this when booting into Win98 that would be good to know.
Unless my thinking is wrong if you suspect or are paranoid about
someone having physical access to your PC and stealing your keys, your
best bet is to use eraserd.exe after shutting Win98 down to DOS, then
power down.

Hello rob_sands_02,
r> Did you ever look into those files?
No.  They can not be found on the partitions that boot with this
bootable partitions.  In short I can not look at them because I can't
find them.  See my discussion below.
The reason I ask is I have GPG & GPGshell installed on a dual boot
system in the extended partition. I use extended partition for
communication software so that I only need 1 DB for whatever program I
need. In this bootable partition there is no ~pubkeys.dat &
~seckeys.dat files either in GnuPG or GPGshell directories. When I
boot other partition and try to load GPGkeys I receive an error
message that these files can't be found. Go figure why one doesn't
have them and works, the other doesn't have them and don't work.
I'm new to GPG so I've been reading threads here and in other mail
lists with similar topics. The gist of GPG is security, otherwise why
use it. Not being an advance user with GPG or a programmer, I think
from a conceptual perspective and ask a lot of questions. This is one
way I learn, the other being of coarse reading material.
I just did a quick look through the "File Type" tab registered file
types without any luck on the DAT file extension. Since the DAT file
type is not registered in the "Folder Option" I would imagine they are
some type of binary file associated with data. If I did have
~pubkeys.dat & ~seckeys.dat files what would I use to look at them?
