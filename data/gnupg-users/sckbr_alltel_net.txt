Hash: SHA1
Having little exposure to linux, and no knowledge of the extensions, I
wonder which file to download 1.4.0a.zip or 1.4.0a.zip.sig. TIA

@_subject: Very Confusing was Re: Get version of PGP 
Sunday, Nov. 28, 2004
Ladies and Gentlemen,
where to begin. I use Mozilla's Thunderbird and
suppose that Enigimail is what I need? A version is installed which has done nothing but subtract from my available disk
space (some sort of complaint about my lack of certificate and would I like to learn how(?) now, which does not do a thing after I
select yes). This shouldn't be difficult, however all the discussion concerning PGP, Gnupg, enigimail, along with the technical
aspects of PGP have left me in the dust.  I suppose I should mention that my computer is a windows XP (Pro).
Someones guidance and patience would be most appreciated.

How do I locate the gnupg archives?
    I also need help with Thunderbird and it's "error" message informing
me that I need to set up one or more personnel Public key for certificates, and would I like to do that now. When clicking "yes"
nothing happens?
    Why is there a double Public key block?
Thank you.
