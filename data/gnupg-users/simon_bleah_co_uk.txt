Perfect secrecy doesn?t really mean unbreakable in practice.  Sure, a
one?time pad itself is considered ?unbreakable?, but you still need to
solve key exchange and hope your pseudo?random numbers are
cryptographically secure.

Now that you mention it, this does happen for me too, both for inline
PGP and PGP/MIME, also for S/MIME.

After a little investigation I believe signed mails that have had
signatures from mailing lists attached are not decoded until you view
the message.  I?m guessing that Mutt only checks for Content-Type
multipart/signed, but these messages are multipart/mixed.

I suppose I should have been more clear, especially given we are talking
about cryptographic signatures.  When I said ?signatures from mailing
lists?, I meant the plain text footers that get appended to single
With PGP/MIME signed messages sent to (at least GNU Mailman) lists that
add footers, the mail is wrapped in another MIME message of type
multipart/mixed, and another part containing the signature is added.
I?m not on debian-devel, but none of the Debian lists I am on appear to
attach these footers.  Indeed, looking at the debian-devel archives,
that list doesn?t either.
The information isn?t lost in the above case, just contained in a MIME
Yes, I think this is what is happening.

Mutt isn?t verifying these either. The message Content-Type appears to
be multipart/alternative, not multipart/signed. The attached signature
looks to me like an OpenPGP signature with the following comment:
  Version: GnuPG v1.4.10 (GNU/Linux)
  Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - I suspect it?s Daniel?s signature being forwarded, but can?t verify.

@_subject: signing non default key 
Use the -u option to specify a key other than the default. This is in
the gpg(1) man page[1]:
    --edit-key name
        Present a menu which enables you to do all key related tasks:
        sign
            Make a signature on key of user name If the key is not yet
            signed by the default user (or the users given with -u), the
            program displays the information of the key again, together
            with its fingerprint and asks whether it should be signed.
            This question is repeated for all users specified with -u.
    ?
    -u, --local-user name
        Use name as the user ID to sign. This option is silently ignored
        for the list commands, so that it can be used in an options
        file.

There is an option in Enigmail?s expert settings to always confirm.

This one[1]?  It doesn?t mention AES though? The topic was discussed on

If Enigmail is completely broken, or you?ve disabled the add?on, your
emails will not be signed or encrypted and the confirmation request will
not appear.
In a non?broken state with the confirmation option, the confirmation
dialog appears every time you hit send, regardless of whether the mail
is signed or encrypted, and informs you of the signing and encryption
You might be able to verify yourself by choosing not to send the email
immediately (send later), then inspecting the mail in the Outbox.  I
cannot remember if messages saved in the Outbox are encrypted.

@_subject: Pros and cons of PGP/MIME for outgoing e-mail? 
I currently use Thunderbird and Mutt, both of which can open "emails within emails" as MIME parts, but I'm fairly certain Outlook from Office 2002 coped with them too. Granted, it's still an extra step with those MUAs, but all they need to do is handle MIME, which is a container just as much as Zip is. Why introduce Zip as yet another container, and yet another thing for diverse MUAs to handle instead of using one that many MTAs already support?
