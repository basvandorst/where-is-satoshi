@_subject: Install of GnuPG beside a production version 
I already have a working GnuPG which is under the subtree /usr/local.
I would like to build and test the last one (2.0.27) starting on an
independant subtree:
I have started by downloading libgpg-error-1.19
then downloaded libgcrypt-1.6.3
and I get an error message:
                See ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgpg-error/ .
when the correct library was correctly installed:
and when configure correctly definedl ibdir:
does produce the same error.
Did I forget a step?
Should I read another documentation?
Should I modify configure to correctly use the libray installed during the
1st step?
Thank you for your help.
