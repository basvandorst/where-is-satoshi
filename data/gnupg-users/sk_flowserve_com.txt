@_subject: How to Encrypt & Sign a file? 
Hi all,
Am to trying to encrypt & sign a file without using the terminal from SAP using the following command.
--no-tty --recipient  --encrypt --sign --default-key /SAP /input/PPID.TXT
The above command resulted with the following error
gpg: no default secret key: No secret key
gpg: [stdin]: sign+encrypt failed: No secret key
External program terminated with exit code 2
Requesting you to guide me where to set the default secret key.
I would appreciate if you could guide me with the step by step procedure.
Many thanks in advance.
Kind regards,
K. Saravanakumar
