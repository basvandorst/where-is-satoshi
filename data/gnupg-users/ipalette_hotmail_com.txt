I am really new to GNUPG and I had a encryption email form working correctly on Windows 2K server. I put it on the windows 2003 server and now nothing seems to work. I have looked all over for help on this with no luck, has anyone successfully gotten GNUPG working on windows 2003 or maybe someone saw a help file somewhere. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks Pete,
the server, but I can not be sure. Basically this is what happens:
1. Someone fills out a form on the website and it is emailed to someone I created a key for.
2. The recipient gets an email with an encrypted message in the body.
3. Once the the email is received, she goes to a seperate webpage on the server to decrypt it.
4. She copies the encrypted body of the message into a text box on the page and types the pass phrase into a sperate field.
5. The form data is formatted and dispalyed for her to use.
Does that makes sense?
When I try to use a sample to try and decode a message I get this error:
PHP Warning: exec(): Unable to fork [echo Life is Motivational|C:\GnuPG\gpg --passphrase-fd 0 -d C:\GnuPG\temp.gpg] in C:\Domains\domain.org\wwwroot\cgi-bin\decode.php on line 59
Now if I copy the file "cmd.exe" into the php folder I get this error (I read somewhere this might help):
CGI Error
The specified CGI application misbehaved by not returning a complete set of HTTP headers.

It's sent over https://
When the body of the email is built the message is encrypted then emailed, nothing is displayed in the browser. The page that decodes the message is secured and only known by one person.

Is it possible to run gnupg on windows 2003 server. I currently have it running on win 2k and it works great, but I am moving to  a new server.
