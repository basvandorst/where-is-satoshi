@_subject: GPG decryption error 
I'd really appreciate if someone can provide feedback with a
decryption-related error we're getting. For an encrypted file of size approx. 2 - 4 gigs, encrypted by a user
using the same key that is being used for decrypting it, there are
errors, as listed below - however there are no errors on decrypting a
smaller file of size less than 1 gig -

Not sure if there are restrictions on size of a file that can be
encrypted or decrypted, or if there are separate options that need to be
used for large files.
The file encrypted by us with the key of a user, is sent by remote ftp
to that user, who after decrypting it, and a few necessary modifications
to the data in the file, encrypts it using our key, which then is
received by us by remote ftp - this process, with the same keys, works
without any issues for smaller files less than a gig. We are using the latest version of GPG on a UNIX Solaris server.  Your help on this will be appreciated. Sudip
