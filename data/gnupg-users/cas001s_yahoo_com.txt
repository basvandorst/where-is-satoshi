@_subject: API for GnuPG for Windows, vesion 1.1.4 
I am using GnuPG for Windows, version 1.1.4 to encrypt text files.It is a GUI based tool.Can I get the application programming interface (API) for
 the same? If I can get the API, Then it is possible for me to do the encryption pro grammatically instead of doing encryption manually using GUI based tool.
Thanks in advance.
