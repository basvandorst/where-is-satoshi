@_subject: keyserver and --recv-keys 
Hi all,
I'm trying to import about 100 keys using the command:
gpg2 --recv-keys A1234567 B2345678 C3456789 ...etc
Is there a better/faster way or custom script for importing keys than
the above?
Is there a list of keyservers I can ping/test to find the fastest one
for my location. I'm remote, with a very slow (56.6k) internet
connection, that's if I'm lucky.
