I need to generate a 2048-bit PGP version 6.5.3 or later and of the type DH/DSS public key. I have read in the FAQ how to edit the key to be compatible with PGP, but I cannot find how to generate a DH type key. The gnupg on Fedora 15 has the following options when I run gpg2 --gen-key:
Please select what kind of key you want:
    (1) RSA and RSA (default)
    (2) DSA and Elgamal
    (3) DSA (sign only)
    (4) RSA (sign only)
Your selection?
I compiled the latest 2.0 version myself and it has the same options. I was hoping the configure output would tell me I was missing a DH crypt library, but it didn't. How do I compile DH support into gpg? I cannot find anything on google.

Thanks for the reply. I don't know if a lot of people face this issue, but if so, I would recommend putting it in the FAQ. It would supplement the question about PGP that is already in there. This is exactly what I needed to know.
