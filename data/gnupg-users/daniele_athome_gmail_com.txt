@_subject: Reusing signed user ID or attribute 
Hello list,
I'm manipulating PGP keys with Bouncy Castle, especially signatures of
user IDs and user attributes. But my question is not about
development, it's about signatures.
My question is the following: suppose I create a user ID or attribute.
I sign it with my key and that's ok.
One day I revoke that user ID or attribute and sign it again with a
certification revocation.
A few years later, I want to restore that user ID or attribute
because, e.g. I restored an old e-mail address. Is it enough to sign
the revoked user attribute once again with a valid signature (then
timestamps will do the rest) or do I have to create a new user ID with
the same data?

Ok, so I have to conclude it's implementation specific?
I'm using a custom user attribute to store something that can change
quite often (privacy lists for a chat user). What do you suggest?

Thank you Daniel,
it actually sounds very right. Now that I think about it, storing this
kind of data in the public key block isn't so good afterall. I will
investigate over this and ask to the right ML next time.
Thank you everyone for your help.
