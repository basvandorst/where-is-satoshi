@_subject: GnuPG Windows - pubring.gpg stays locked after failed commands 
Hello Everyone,
I have inherited gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.7 on Windows Server 2003 box.
I only use it from the command line and have it embedded in a bunch of batch
scripts that support some EDI transfer automation.
It seems that any time a gpg encryption or decryption command fails for any
reason, the read lock on pubring.gpg is not released.  Every subsequent call
fails when the application tries to its underlying rename commands on this
file.  The errors indicate "file rename error", "permission denied", "error
reading file".
I can navigate down in the GnuPG Application Data directory and try to hand
edit the file and get the typical "File is in use by another process" errors
from Windows.
Has anyone seen this before?  Is it a known bug or anything?
