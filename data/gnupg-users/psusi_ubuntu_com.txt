@_subject: Importing new subkeys 
Hash: SHA1
So my old subkeys are about to expire so I created some new ones at
home and exported them with --export-secret-subkeys.  When I try to
import them at work, gpg just says I already have that key and stops.
Why isn't it merging the new subkeys?  I ended up having to delete
the master key from the keyring in order to import the new subkeys.

Because I already extended them for a second year once, so I figured
it's about time for a new one on the off chance that someone might be
trying to crack them using the plethora of public email I have signed
using them.

@_subject: Different signing & encryption keys 
Hash: SHA512
We used to use different keys for signing and encrypting ( DSA & El
Gammel ), but these days just seem to use a single RSA key by default.
 Is it still possible and/or beneficial to use two separate subkeys
for signing and encrypting?

How do you tell which one is which?  It used to be that the 'D' prefix
meant DSA, which was signing only, and 'g' or 'G' was for el gammel
signing or encryption, but now they all just show 'R'.

@_subject: Different passwords for subkeys 
Hash: SHA512
I keep a subkey pair for daily use that I keep a copy of on my work
machine, and reissue each yea and the master key only at home.  I
would like to protect the master key with a password that is different
from that used on the daily use subkey, but when I use --edit-key and
specify the master key id, and use the passwd command to change the
password, it applies it to all subkeys.  How can I set a different
password only for the master key?

@_subject: Encrypting File with passphrase 
Hash: SHA1
The passphrase is only used to encrypt the private key so that even if
someone gets ahold of your private keyring, they still can't use it.
You can skip the password if you want, and that makes as much sense as
writing the password down in a script that will be automatically using
the private key to decrypt.  Encryption only uses the public key,
hence there is no password.

@_subject: Why does import refuse to merge a new subkey? 
Whenever my subkeys expire and I have to generate a new one, I try to
import the keys on my less secure machines and gpg stupidly refuses to
update the already existing key with the new subkey.  I have to delete
the key, then import to get the new subkey into the keyring.  Why is this?

@_subject: Why does import refuse to merge a new subkey? 
Looks like I've still got 1.4.20 on one machine ( when I usually forget
to run gpg2 instead of just gpg ) but 2.0.28 on another also did it I'm
pretty sure.  I guess I'll try again and make sure to use a recent gpg2.

@_subject: "right to be forgotten" nonsense 
There isn't merit.  It became public, not private, the moment you
published it.  I have the right to free speech, the EU be damned.  Are
these numbnuts going to demand that libraries black out newspaper
articles on microfilm because they mention someone that doesn't like the
coverage of themselves?  Sure, I molested children 5 years ago, but I
have the "right to be forgotten" so when anyone searches for my name on
the Internet they won't find out.  Give me a break.

If data can't be deleted, and it isn't even verified by the server when
it is added, then can't someone DOS my key, or possibly the entire
network, by appending infinite garbage to it?

@_subject: Won't recognize my secret key 
gpg keeps telling me that I have no secret key.  Even after I deleted
the .gnupg directory and copied the pubring and secring from another
computer where it works, this system keeps saying I have no secret keys.
 Why does it keep throwing out my secret keys?
Working system:
C:\Users\psusi\AppData\Roaming\gnupg>gpg --version
gpg (GnuPG) 2.0.28 (Gpg4win 2.2.5)

@_subject: git repo won't build for lack of source files? 
I cloned the git repo and checked out gnupg-2.2.4, ran ./autogen.sh,
./configure, then when I try to make, it is apparently missing some files:
make[2]: Entering directory '/home/psusi/gnupg/common'
make[2]: *** No rule to make target 'audit-events.h', needed by 'all'.
What gives?

Apparently you have to configure with --enable-maintainer-mode to avoid

I have built gnupg-2.0.31 from source and found it to work.  gnupg-2.2.4
refuses to import my private keys ( but will import a newly created test
key ).  So something broke somewhere between 2.0 and 2.2, but apparently
2.1 was a development branch, and it likes to yell at you that you
shouldn't be using production keys and refuses to import any private
keys, so I can't test to see where it lost the ability to import *my*
private key.
Is there a way to turn off this damn protection so I can continue to bisect?

Ok, so if I checkout and build 2.0.31, remove ~/.gnupg, and import my
keyring, all of my private keys show up.  If I check out and build 2.1.1
and run /usr/local/bin/gpg -K, it upgrades to the new key format and
throws out my private keys:
gpg: starting migration from earlier GnuPG versions
gpg: porting secret keys from '/home/psusi/.gnupg/secring.gpg' to gpg-agent
gpg: key A70FB705: secret key imported
gpg: migration succeeded

I just noticed that I do have a bunch of key files in
~/.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d, even though gpg -K does not show them.
Ahah, gpg -K -v shows them... it seems to think they are all expired.
It lists the expiration date on my current key as 2018-1-6.  I believe
that was the *original* expiration date, but then I extended it.  gpg
2.1 seems to be failing to recognize the extension.

Makes sense.
The first thing I did was delete ~/.gnupg.old and re-import just like
that ( which of course, did not work ).  I re-imported only the public
key today with --recv-keys and that got the updated selfsig.

I believe you can enable EFS on the windows server and it will handle
decrypting the file before sending it over SMB.  Then you don't need any
special software or configuration on the clients.

I don't think it is on the client.  The private key is stored on the
server and is decrypted when you log in.  At least I think that's how it
works.  I've never actually tried using EFS on a server.

Since it is automatically decrypted when opened, the uploaded file would
be decrypted.
