@_subject: Can you unlock sent messages ?? Somehow ?? 
If someone in an organization used GPG and then left the company, and you
 had to give a copy of all emails that that individual had ever sent , how
 can you unlock all of the encrypted messages?? specially if your email is
 actual record that you have to keep... is there somewhere you can send a
 file to be unencrypted??
