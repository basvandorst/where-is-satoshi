@_subject: Gnupg code 
Currently, I'm looking for some encryption algorithms for the community
as password in the SNMP requests, and want an appropriate one.  Is there
anyone who knows that from the supported EIGamal, DSA, 3DES, etc?
The source code will have to compile and run successfully on HP-UX 10.x,
Solaris 2.5+, NT and VxWorks (an embedded OS by WindRiver, Inc).
Is there anyone who has successfully compiled and run the gnupg code
on VxWorks?
Thank you very much in advance.
