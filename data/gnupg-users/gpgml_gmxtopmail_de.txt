That is currently maybe the best way, but it creates another problem: What if I
have/want to still be available under my old address?
One solution would be not to split between private/work, but between secure/unsecure.
When I leave employer1, I will remove the UID for this address from the unsecure and
add it to my secure key. That way, I will still be able to receive new mail on my
home machine.
Will it harm to have the same email-part of an UID for two keys? e.g.
- Klaus (secure) klaus at employer1.de
- Klaus (unsecure) klaus at employer1.de

@_subject: multiple keys with different UIDs and common WoT? 
I am currently planning how I set up my keys and I ran into the problem, that I have to read work-related mail on an theoretically unsecure machine at my workplace. This means I don't want to use or even install my keys on this machine. This led me to the idea of having two keys: one for work and one for private stuff i.e. more paranoid.
I first thought about using one master key for this with multiple subkeys (which I'd also use without this particular problem), of which I install the private one only at home and the other one both at home and at work. However, apparently it is not possible to assign UIDs to subkeys, but only to the master key, with no possibility to indicate which subkey to use for which email.
The only possibility I see currently, is having two master keys, which requires me to build a WoT for both keys and even rebuilding it from scratch when I get a job somewhere else.
While this is the preferred way for completely disjunct identities (e.g. job and political activities), it is an unnecessary bulk of additional work in my case.
Another way would be to have one ultra-master-key (TM) with only my name, which I use to sign the master keys for different emails. But as far as I read about gpg, this is somehow bad because I will be the only one signing the keys that are actually used as master-keys.
So my question is: Is there some mechanism that allows me to have the features mentioned above, or do I really have to build multiple separate WoTs?

============================== START ==============================
Ok, this will fix the WoT from my perspective. What about other users importing my
work key? Especially when they don't fully trust my personal key, they will never
trust the work-key, because there are no other links that may generate trust by
having multiple marginally trusted links. They might decide to manually change that
when they see the two keys are actually from the same person, but I guess this
will never be handeled automatically.
That shouldn't be a problem, as long as I don't ask people to sign my work key
and don't sign with my work key.
