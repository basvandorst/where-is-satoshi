@_subject: md5 checksum does not match 
I downloaded the GnuPG version 1.0.5 from yout site
after downloading I typed
'# md5sum gnupg-1.0.5.tar.gz'
in the command line of an xterm. The output was
'07368945301a2247c2c212ffc5b45d97  gnupg-1.0.5.tar.gz'
On your site  was another checksum
Now I do not know if it is secure to install the downloaded program.
