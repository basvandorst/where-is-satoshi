hi guys
i never posted to this list but i figured an utility i made and just released might be of interest to you. i wrote a wrapper script to xxdiff, a graphical file comparison tool that i wrote, that can take two encrypted files as input, decrypts them to temporary files (for a short time), and launches xxdiff on them to compare their plaintext contents.  all temporary files are deleted.
additionally, it can also separate a CVS conflict in an armored encrypted file and launch xxdiff on the two parts, and then you can save the selections (xxdiff allows you to produce a merged file) and it will encrypt the result automatically back to the conflictual file.    i have been using this for quite a while now because i maintain a set of small encrypted files with CVS, because i edit them at various sites.  sometimes i forget to either commit or update between the sites (e.g. work and home) and i end up with a CVS merge conflict (naturally, all the armored encrypted text chunk differs).  i needed a script to be able to resolve the conflicts without having to do all the work by hand.  this does it. i just cleaned up the script, extended it a bit and released it as part of xxdiff-3.0.   you can find the doc for the script here:
and the script itself:
