Please point me to a detailed explanation for the output of list-packets.
I have googled and read manuals, etc. but just can't seem to locate the

Thank you all for your answers.  I've been reading 2440, 4880, and trying
to read the source to several old and current versions of gnupg 1.x series
for some time.  My question was an attempt to verify my understanding of
how the specific output was structured.  There was sample pgpdump output
posted online that confirmed my assumptions and understanding about the
output from list-packets.
I am feeding the output of a list-packets for my keying into an awk script
to build a report on the keys and the preferences for each key.
With-colons doesn't provide enough detail for this report.  I vaguely
remember reading several years back that the output from list packets was
subject to change between revisions.  I'll have to include that risk in any
future maintenance of the report.
Of course, if there is a better way to extract all the preferences data,
using just the gpg program, please let me know.
Thank you,
John Gill

I'm assuming the the signatures indicate, roughly the set of options that
my recipients will not receive an error about ignored preferences.  For
instance, symmetric algo 9 has been around for the last 10 years at least.
but if I force it on someone who doesn't have it as a preference, the
recipient will get a message about my ignoring preferences. For systems
that are automated, this message may have repercussions, depending on how
they were coded.
I'm identifying any recipients in my keyring that have preferences that
conflict with my disabling of specific algorithms and functions.
Thank you.

I know that gpg chooses common algos between the sender and recipient.
(I've not tested what will happen with recipients who have no preferences
in common with my enabled algos, but that's a problem for a new day.)  I'm
not trying to out-think the intelligence codified in the application.  I am
analyzing my keyring contents to identify how using "disable-cipher-algo"
and similar options, may impact exchanges with my recipients.
My original question was to clarify my understanding of the output from
"list-packets", so I could finish writing out the report.
Thank you,

Could you help me understand what you are referring to?
Thank you.

The keyring in question is closely held. All keys have been directly
verified, out-of-channel, with the key owner prior to inclusion in the
keyring. Using the data obtained by listing the keyring packets seems

Why not set up a fixed size start/run record identifier.  No need for a
magic and unique sequence.
Like this:
Field             description                 start     length    datatype
1                   GPG stream start       1           2             Alpha
2                   stream length             3          15           Numb
3                   stream                         18         ??
GPG stream
Record just keeps repeating over and over until there is nothing else.
