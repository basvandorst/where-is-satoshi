That would mean he would have to input a passphrase everytime he does a
backups, or make a script that does it for him, which could be a
potential security risk. By using a public key, the backups can be done
unatended with no risk of passphrase being compromised if the script(s)
are. (it would be a good idea nontheless to keep the secret key on
another system though)
