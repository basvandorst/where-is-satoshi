When I see this change to the program, I wonder how a new user will react:
"How do I, Joe Newbie, switching from pgp to gpg use my current keypair?  Does this mean I have to generate a new keypair?  But I thought the two
were compatible!"
Is this *really* the best plan for overcoming the danger?  Something that
could cause a lot of confusion?
Unless I misunderstand the issue, which is entirely possible.

Ah, okay.  For some reason I was thinking that was a compile-time option,
not a run-time option.
Still, I forsee a FAQ on this.  Also, I'm not clear on how using this option prevents the attack.  So,
instead of doing it in one step, I do it in two...  RJ    :)

Okay, that makes sense, and it's relatively easy to see why you want to do
it that way instead of the old way.  (Your explanation would make a good
response for the FAQ, by the way.)
I'm curious:  does PGP have similar features?
Thanks for the clarification, all.  RJ    :)

Kisimoto (sorry I'm not replying to the original message, because I
thought someone else would ask this question), why do you want to replace
the public key?

Not really.  NAI produced the source code so that others may review it;
some people have used it to produce their own versions.  NAI doesn't
endorse any of these unofficial compilations.  In fact, I don't think they
like them at all (and who knows--it may be part of why they discussed not
releasing source code any longer), but they've never tried to stop anyone
who is producing them.
Johan: Thanks for the plug for my page.  :)  You're right, it probably is
incomplete (sad, given all the time I put into it), but I'm pretty
confident the page has very few missing.

@_subject: signing web pages (simple way?) 
Hash: SHA1
I wrote a program a few years back for Windows that used PGP 2.6.x
versions.  It took your webpage as input, added --> and  to the beginning and end of the file.
Voila.  Signed page, invisible to viewer.  I think I even wrote a bash
script to do it with gpg under Linux, but the solution is trivial, and
could be reproduced by anyone familiar with copy and cat commands.
(Solution below.)
And, it worked fine.  For Netscape users (under Windows), you'd view the
source, hit Control-A then Control-C (Select all, copy), then use PGP Tray
to verify the clipboard.
I should start signing pages again.  It was a nice touch (though I doubt
anyone ever actually verified the signatures).
The DOS program that worked under Windows is still available on my
website, but I don't have a link to it anywhere on the pages, so you'll
have to use this direct link:   I
don't think the source is included, because the program was more of a
quick and dirty solution.
One gripe people had that I didn't overcome is that you had to enter your
passphrase for each page you signed.  I didn't want to get into the
security implications required when you start remembering passphrases, so
I felt it was better to just let PGP handle it.
Since it's short, here's the script.  (FYI, it was a LOT harder to write
in Pascal under DOS than it was in bash, but the Pascal version would
automatically clear an old signature before re-signing it, so I guess
it's not quite the same.)

@_subject: OpenPGP without GnuPG? 
My main point:  He also asked to be shown if he's wrong.
Side note:  To (mis)quote the Romulan ambassador:  "Frankly, Chancellor, I
don't know *what* to believe."  My understanding is that the GPL isn't
intend to be "viral" in the sense he meant it, but since many people are
confused by that, and companies like Microsoft can twist the wording into
showing it's "wrong" and "un-american", maybe the wording in the GPL
should be revised somehow to make the true intention clear.  Obviously
this won't stop determined FUD spreading, but it should make it simpler
for anyone who takes a moment to actually read it.
