@_subject: GnuPG 1.2.2 and permission denied on trustdb.gpg 
I just installed GnuPG 1.2.2 on a Solaris 2.7 system and have one minor problem.  It won't work unless we make the trustdb.gpg world writable.  The script that calls gpg is a non-root setuid program whose user also owns the trustdb.gpg.  That user is the only user that works unless we change the trustdb.gpg to world writable (which we do not want to do).
   I tried the workaround posted on the user forum which states that you can use the options --no-auto-check-trustdb and --lock-never to get by the permission denied issue but
we are still failing on permissions (see error messages below).
           Any suggestions?
               Thanks so much,
                     Kim
