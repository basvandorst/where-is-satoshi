Thanks for making this HOWTO.  I have a few suggestions for it:
I suggest including a URL for RSAREF 2.0:
    ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/crypt/cryptography/asymmetric/rsa/rsaref2.tar.gz
RSAREF 1 can be found at     ftp://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US/dists/stable/non-US/source/rsaref_19930105.orig.tar.gz
Note that the modules don't need to be there because you can also load
extensions from other directories by using complete pathnames with
I found that to be untrue on HPUX; shared modules need to be executable there.
GnuPG 0.9.8 no longer removes execute permissions when it installs its
default extensions because of that.  I suggest dropping the above statement.
This is not entirely true either: if you use "--clearsign" then pgp 2.6 can
verify the signature.  This is very significant in my opinion.  As far as I
can tell, pgp 2.6 only has trouble verifying gpg signatures if you use "--sign".
