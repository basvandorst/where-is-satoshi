This is with [root v]# gpg --version
gpg (GnuPG) 1.2.1
I put 12 files into a .tar:
tar cvzf b.tar bp*
I encrypted them with a symmetric key:
gpg -c b.tar
The result was fairly large (this is running on an opteron running
redhat RHEL):
ls -alh b.tar.gpg
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root         4.1G Feb  1 23:25 b.tar.gpg
Now to decode it:
gpg --output b.tar --decrypt b.tar.gpg
gpg: CAST5 encrypted data
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=75)
gpg: uncompressing failed: unknown compress algorithm
The resulting file is partially there:
$ ls -alh b.tar
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root         103M Feb 10 14:16 b.tar
Tar seems to think it's valid:
tar tvf bg-s01-s12.tar
drwxrwxr-x root/root        0 2005-01-28 17:51:28 bpdata/
-rw-r--r-- root/root 36955832 2005-01-16 17:47:40 bpdata/bd.001
Any ideas?

Because as a user I didn't have enough space to keep multiple copies
of a 4GB file around for debugging.  Fixed.
Agreed, I'm reconstructing this from my command history, the original
files are gone, er well encrypted.  I had tried z, but after realizing I
was getting a significant slow down and zero compression I reran the
command without the z and ended up with just a .tar file.
Sorry, I pasted the wrong command from my history, the .tar is not I encrypted a tar file using gpg -c, and now when I try to decrypt
I get:
[bill v]$ /opt/pkg/gnupg-1.4.0/bin/gpg --output b.tar b.tar.gpg
gpg: WARNING: using insecure memory!
gpg: please see  for more information
gpg: CAST5 encrypted data
gpg: encrypted with 1 passphrase
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=75)
gpg: uncompressing failed: unknown compress algorithm

[bill v]$ ls -alh
total 4.2G
drwxr-xr-x    2 bill     root         4.0K Feb 10 16:44 .
drwxr-xr-x    5 bill     root         4.0K Feb  8 01:38 ..

b.tar seems intact for the first 103MB, and b.tar.gpg seems populated
with random looking binary stuff all the way out to 4.1GB.  I.e. it's not
zero filled over the (possible) 2GB limit.

@_subject: ADMIN: Some mail addresses are now rewritten 
IMO reply should go to the send and reply-list/group reply should go to the
list.  Sure people make mistakes, but it's still the most reasonable behavior.
I've been dealing with this.  After watching these kinds of problems in multiple
environments I think what should happen with mailman, dkim, SPF, etc is:
A) If mailman is going to leave DKIM headers intact then the email should be
   forwarded without modifications to the body/signature.  So readers of the
   mailing list should be able to DKIM verify the centor
B) if mailman is going to modify the email then it should:
   1) resign with it's DKIM key (for gnupg.org in this case)
   2) allow mailing list users to set a flag saying "Do not accept email
      from me unless properly signed with DKIM"
   3) Upon finding properly signed DKIM messages that will be stripped/resigned
      mailman should add a new header.  DKIM-verified-by-mailman or similar.
I realize this isn't the best place to discuss such things, but welcome any
input.  I'm watching the mailman list, on a  IRC channel, or similar.  But
finding a place that discusses standards that impact so many different pieces is
Not sure I follow, I hit group reply in Thunderbird and at the top of this
message is:
Which is exactly what I expected.
