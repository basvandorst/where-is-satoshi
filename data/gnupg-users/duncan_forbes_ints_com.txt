@_subject: Windows GPG 1.0.4-1 vs. Linux 1.0.1 
I just spent a frustrating morning tracking down a problem that I need some
assistance on.
I recently upgraded my Windows systems to GnuPG 1.0.4-1. I am able to
encrypt files on the Windows systems and decrypt them on the Windows
However, if I try to decrypt files made w/Windows GnuPG 1.0.4-1 on my Linux
systems which only are running GnuPG 1.0.1, gpg acts like it is decrypting
properly (i.e. no errors) but no decrypted output file is generated.
Is 1.0.4-1 not backwards compatable?
I am a bit over my head and need help, please.
