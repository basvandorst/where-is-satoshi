@_subject: pinentry doesn't work with gpg-agent 
I started using GnuPG 2.0.0.  That works great except one thing.
echo test.|gpg2 --clearsign|gpg2 --verify
This test passes if I don't run gpg-agent or I unset GPG_AGENT_INFO
as follows:
GPG_AGENT_INFO='' echo test.|gpg2 --clearsign|gpg2 --verify
At that time pinentry prompts me for a passphrase, and echoes an
asterisk in the window every time I enter a letter.  However, if
I run gpg-agent, pinentry appears but I cannot enter a passphrase.
It echoes no asterisk in the window whatever I type a letter, and
then signing fails.  Does anyone know what I overlooked?
I installed the following packages by performing ``./configure;
make; make install'' in the Fedora Core 6 Linux system, which
runs the metacity window manager.
pinentry is a symlink to pinentry-gtk-2.
The way to run gpg-agent is to put the following snipet in the
~/.Xclients file.
--8<---------------cut here---------------start------------->8---
if test -z `ps x | grep gpg-agent|grep -v grep`; then
  gpg-agent --daemon --write-env-file
. $HOME/.gpg-agent-info; export GPG_AGENT_INFO
--8<---------------cut here---------------end--------------->8---
Thanks in advance.
