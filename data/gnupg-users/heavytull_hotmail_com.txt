It seems the usual way to supress the output of a command in linux is not
working for gpg2:
    $gpg2 -d my_file.gpg 2>/dev/null
still outputs some data through stderr. So could someone try to find out a
way to get rid of everything gpg2 is outputting but the decrypted output of
the gpg file?

of course i can redirect STDERR to /dev/null. i retried with "find /root" as
a normal user and it worked. I use it daily to run irssi through proxyserve.

below is a copy of some tests. Running normally, then with STDERR redirected
to the null device, and then with -q option. Only redirecting STDOUT to the
null device works normally, i.e. the decrypted output is not displayed.

both options worked. So you mean it's a bug in gpg2?
