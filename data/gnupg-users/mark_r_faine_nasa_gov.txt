@_subject: Automatically encrypt and sign outgoing mail 
I've configured system account mail (root, postmaster, etc) to be sent
to a user account and then that user account is using a .forward file to
send the mail to my workstation where I can review it.  I would like to
do the same but include an encrypt/sign step into the process.  I have created my key on the workstation (Windows using Outlook 2003 and
the Outlook MUA plugin.
I've created a key for the user who will send the system's mail.
I've imported the key into the keyring of this user, signed it and set
the trust.
I've searched all day for a procmail recipe that would encrypt/sign the
message upon arrival in the user mailbox but I've not found anything.
I'd like to set it up so that the mail is encrypted and signed to my
workstation gnupg key and then the mail is forwarded to my workstation
email account.  This way all the mail I receive from the system will
always be encrypted.
Any help would be appreciated.

This looks good but it is a windows program.  I'm trying to achieve the
same goal as GPGrelay provides but on Linux.  Basically I'm trying to
ensure that all the mail sent out from the Linux box (admin mail) that
is sent over an insecure mail server is sent to me encrypted.
I had thought to use procmail and gpg together somehow but I haven't had
any luck finding any information on how to configure either.
