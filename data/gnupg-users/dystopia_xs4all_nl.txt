@_subject: GnuPG instead of CryptoAPI 
Hello gnupg-users,
i'm stuck on a theory. I know GnuPG can be used to sign a file. Fine. I
also know one can mount an image containing multiple files as loopback
device. This image can be encrypted using CryptoAPI
Is it possible to use GnuPG instead of CryptoAPI *and* encrypting the
files on the fly? If so, this is a opensource alternative for PGPdisk.
I've searched on both Google, CryptoAPI mailinglist and this mailinglist,
but couldn't find an answer to my question.
Kind regards / met vriendelijke groet,
