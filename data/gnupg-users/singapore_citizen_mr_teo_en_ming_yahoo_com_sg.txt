For Immediate Release
SINGAPORE, SINGAPORE - Singapore Citizen Mr. Teo En Ming (Zhang Enming) would like to report first hand account of mind intrusion and mind reading. I have been hearing voices for quite some time now but I have not been able to identify the persons physically. A number of un-identified persons have intruded into my mind and they are able to read my thoughts. I could not explain the mechanism by which these un-identified persons have been reading my mind at the moment but there is definitely a scientific explanation for it. I know very clearly that I am not suffering from schizophrenia at all.
I am fully aware that no common man would believe me except the select few scientific researchers working in top secret government projects and the human guinea pigs who are being experimented on. One of the possibilities is that I have a microchip implanted into my brain, possibly when I was an infant. It may take a few years, a few decades, or even a few centuries before mind reading is finally brought to light before the general public.
I would like to invite neuroscientists, engineers and physicists to speak on the scientific explanation behind mind intrusion and mind reading.
Please remember what Singapore Citizen Mr. Teo En Ming (Zhang Enming) have said. Mark my words. You will know the truth in future. It is no longer a conspiracy theory. I can affirm that it (mind intrusion and mind reading) is indeed happening to me.
Yours truly,
Singapore Citizen Mr. Teo En Ming (Zhang Enming) Dip(Mechatronics)(Singapore Polytechnic) BEng(Hons)(Mechanical Engineering)(National University of Singapore)
