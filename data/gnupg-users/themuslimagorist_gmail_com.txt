@_subject: Compiling GnuPG problem 
Thanks for you help. I discovered a list of libraries that needed to be
installed prior to GnuPG. I got that figured out, but now I'm getting a new
error message:
compress.c:34:18: fatal error: zlib.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.
Any ideas? Thanks again for your help and patience.

GnuPG crew,
Thank you in advance for your patience. I am new to Linux, new to Ubuntu,
and new the GnuPG and this is the first time I am trying to do any of this.
I successfully downloaded a package named gnupg-2.0.18.tar.bz2 from
gnupg.org. Following the instructions, I successfully configured the
package using the "./configure" command, but when I attempted to compile he
package using the "make" command I received the error message, "make: ***
No targets specified and no makefile found. Stop." yet I can see two
makefiles in the folder: Makefile.am and Makefile.in. Am I doing something
wrong? Did apply the commands in the wrong directory? What do you recommend?
