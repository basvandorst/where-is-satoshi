I have a GnuPG key with three different user IDs. I wanted to delete two of
them, so I deleted the self-signing and eventually the ID and submitted that
to the keyserver (pgp.mit.edu).
When creating a new GnuPG keyring on another computer and fetching my key, I
see the correct uid. However, using the web interface of pgp.mit.edu all
three uids are still shown? How can that happen?

Hi Brian,
thanks a lot! Could you please do me a favor and check what your GnuPG tells
you when you query for 'floeff (the old address)? I guess I revsig'd
it, and I want to check that from another PC.
