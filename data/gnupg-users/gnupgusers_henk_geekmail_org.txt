@_subject: gpgme and keys on smartcards 
I am trying to replace my "old" keypair with one stored on a smartcard.
I have a SCM SPR-332 (reader with pinpad), which seems to work fine
with gpg. I can list the cards? contents, create signatures and I?m
asked to enter the pin on the pinpad:
% gpg -u '3352C710!' -b -a gpgsign.c.old

Hello Niels
On Fri, 08 Feb 2013 10:10:56 +0100
On the card?s page it says:
Schl?ssell?nge jetzt bis zu 3072 Bits
What makes you think it works with 4096-bit keys?
I bought this reader as well after I could not get the pinpad of
"Gemalto PC Pinpad USB
Reader" (
to work with GnuPG.
It works just fine and (almost) out of the box, at least on Debian
Best regards

A comment worth reading in case one does not see it oneself IMHO:
