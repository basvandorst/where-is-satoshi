@_subject: General Crypto Question 
Not directly related to gpg, but I think some of you may enjoy answering this.  I'm reading thru _Applied Cryptography_, and I want to make sure I understand it:
Suppose two people, A and B, know a shared secret S; for simplicity,
pretend it is a long string of bits.
Suppose A wants to send a message M (another long string of bits) to B, and A wants to sign it.
Would it be sufficient and secure to construct a signature like this:
In other words, one creates a new string of bits which is the concatenation of the shared secret and the message, and then hashes that new string (assume perfect hash function) to yield the signature.  A then sends both M and the signature to B.
B could then verify the signature by generating the signature from the M and S in the same manner as above, and then comparing that signature to the one sent by A.
As the one-way hash function is "perfect", nobody could determine S if he has a (message, signature) pair.
Am I thinking this out right, or am I missing something critical?

@_subject: Storing keys under a different user... 
Hash: SHA1
This post is meant as an informal feature request; I want to hear people's feedback before I make it a formal request.
It seems to me that a big weakness in GnuPG or any PGP implementation is
that the user who owns a private key can read the key in circumstances
other than encrypting/decrypting/signing/&c. Because of this, it is
possible for write trojan horses which search for and steal private keys
(this has already happened, I believe).
But, since some OSes (unices specifically, maybe others) can give files
different ownership, I think I see one possible solution.
This assumes that someone with proper priveledges (root) is willing to set
this up, and assumes you are using a unix-like machine.  Under some circumstances, root may not even be needed to set this up, except to give the gpg program setuid() priveledges.
For each user who wishes to use GnuPG, the system administrator creates
another user (with a different userid) who owns the keys, but is otherwise
not allowed to login.  For example, if my username is nick and uid(nick)=501, then a user
nick_key would be created such that     uid(nick_key) = f( uid(nick) ) != uid(nick) where the function f(u) is some one-to-one function mapping a userid to
the userid of his key's owner.
This user nick_key would not be able to login. The public/private keypair
for user nick would be stored in the ~nick_key/.gnupg/ directory, with
permissions such that only user nick_key can read or write to it.
Then, when user nick wants to do any gnupg operation, he would
setuid(f(uid(nick))), read the key, restore user id, and procede.  I would generally cringe on adding an setuid() call, but under certain
configurations gpg will *already* do this in order to lock memory pages.  This feature would, of course, also be an optional feature.
This way, the key is secure, because no trojan running as a user would be
able to read the key, unless it somehow had (A) compromized root, which is
problem in itself, or (B) successfully logged in as nick_key, which is
(theoretically) not going to happen either.
I would write this, but as I am in the USA, you probably wouldn't want my code in GnuPG.
What does everyone think?

goof                                                                            Rename it YAPPP: Yet Another Pine-PGP Pipe.
Things like this already exist (for example, I use pgp4pine, and there are even two with that name).  The big question is: can this version handle pgp/mime, or does it do pgp/inline ?  A version that handles pgp/mime would be a huge improvement, though it may require some flexibility on the pine side.

@_subject: GPG article at UVa 
Hash: SHA1
It my attempts to GPG-ify my campus, I am writing an article about GPG and internet security for my college leftist magazine.  I would like feedback from whomever is willing.
My article is at:
If you would like to help me out by doing a read through, please reply to
me (nickjohnson at virginia dot edu) and not to the gnupg-users list (not
everyone should have to hear about it).  If you make changes, I'd prefer a diff of the latex source;  otherwise
comments are just as good.
Don't worry about spelling and grammar, as this will go through at least one cycle of copy editing before publication.  I would like feedback mostly about:
 * Is there anything I should include that I haven't?
 * Is this article accessible to the non-technical reader?
 * Is anything just plain wrong?
 * As it will be published in a leftist magazine, to what degree would it convince a leftist reader?
 * Though it will be published in a leftist magazine, to what degree would this convince a non-leftist reader? Once I've made my final revision, this article can be freely distributed to the extend that it's legal :) Thanks everyone,

@_subject: Importance of time in pgp algorithms 
Hash: SHA1
I've two questions.
1.) I have a laptop that does not keep good time.  Will the clock skew affect GPG adversely while encrypting or decrypting emails?
2.) I also use a desktop.  Is it secure for me to simply duplicate my ~/.gnupg directories on each machine (assuming that I copy the files in a secure way), or should I create a different key-pair for the desktop
