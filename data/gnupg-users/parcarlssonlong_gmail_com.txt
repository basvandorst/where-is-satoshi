@_subject: Simple encryption/decryption 
I have a very simple thing I want to do and I have not found out how.
I want to send/receive receive files to a FTP-server. The files has to be
encrypted when it's sent to FTP. Vice versa I will receive files which I
have to decrypt.
In the best of worlds I thougth this was very simple using gnupg. Something
like this perhaps but not....
gnupg --encrypt myFile.txt --myPrivateKey --output myEncryptedFile
gnupg --decrypt anEncryptedFile --theirPublicKey --output
