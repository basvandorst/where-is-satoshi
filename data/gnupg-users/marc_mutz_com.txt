This is BS. At the _very_ least, you should sync the written blocks to
disc after each iteration. Then there are all the other problems people

Then you better turn off the write-cache on your hard disk. Otherwise,
your disk might out-smart you if you iterate too fast, effectively
writing only the last iteration onto the medium.
That is correct, although personally, I don't find it obvious at all. In
fact, it is quite the opposite. Common sense tells us that if we
overwrite the data on the media, the data is lost. Yet data-recovering
companies can bring your deleted data back even when the blocks in
question were written to dozens of times. Some claim that nothing that
was on a harddisk will ever be lost. Except if you shred your hard disk,
heat the pieces within a strong magnetic field above the Curie
temperature and pour acid over the remains. This is exactly what you
should do with your hard disk if you _really_ need to delete. Everything
else can probably be overcome.

Stop it! STOP IT!
On every ml concerned with crypto stuff this pr is announced by someone
8or even multiple individuals).
It is only 14 days (read _two_ weeks) until the patent expires so this
is an absolute joke. It's just there to let RSA Security stand out as a
generous company, which it may be or not.
Stop that celebration.

Hash: SHA1
The red sponge has a surface protein that has a molecular weight of more=20
than 1'000'000 u. So you just keep adding CH_2 groups to the molecule?
Don't think Moore's law only holds for silicon chips. Expect the=20
register size of QC's to equally grow exponentially. But since QC's=20
operate on all possible values of the register at once, you only need=20
to push the regster size to 4k bits. If you reached that, 128kbits will=20
be doable, too. Imagine how long a silicon computer needs to even=20
create auch a key...

Hash: SHA1
Can't be done. Public and secret key are two sides of the same coin (or=20
whatever the idiom is in English). The one depends on the other. Else,=20
who'd you expect a message encrypted with the public key to be=20
decryptable with the secret key?

Hi Malte!
Does disabling keys help? You can disable sign-only keys. They're not available for encryption anymore, but for sig-checking.
Might make a difference.

@_subject: HOWTO on interfacing with gnupg/pgp? 
Hi out there!
Is there a howto somewhere that describes how one should go about interfacing (MUA's) with gnupg and pgp? Esp. secure passphase handling and calling conventions. I'm currently re-working KMail's interface to handle the passphrase more preciously, but I'm not sure how to hand it over to the external gnupg/pgp process.
