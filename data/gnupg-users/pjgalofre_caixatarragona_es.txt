@_subject: How to run GnuPG with different users? 
I've a little trouble:
We in our company need to install WinPT on each PC, but it seems not to
work when logging on with different user credentials than the one's which
the installation process was done. The error is: 'GPG is not installed
correctly, please check registry settings'
I've tried to add and modify registry keys and so on, but there's no way to
make it work correctly
It's important for us to fix this issue, cause all the Pcs in our
organisation can be used by different users.
Thanks in advance for your support,
