@_subject: Controlling number of passphrase attempts 
Is it possible to control the number of times GPG asks for a passphrase?
I'm writing a library using GPG with the --status-fd and --command-fd
arguments. When a bad passphrase is provided, GPG tried three times to
get the correct passphrase. I'd like it to try once and then fail.
I would use --passphrase-fd except it does not support entering more
than one passphrase in the case that something is decrypted or signed
using multiple keys.
PS: Please CC me as I'm not on the list.

@_subject: Web-based pinentry 
I'm the maintainer of a PHP package that integrates with GnuPG The package is used on a website to allow decrypting stored messages. This is accomplished using the --status-fd and --command-fd options of GnuPG, allowing the passing of passphrases.
As of GnuPGv2, the --command-fd method of passing passphrases no longer seems to work. Is there an alternative I can use so that the pin entry interface is still a webpage?
I would continue to use GnuPGv1, but distributions have stopped including it by default and no longer provide packages.
Please let me know what I can use to handle pin-entry in a web-based system.

Where can I find documentation that recommends not using a passphrase? My understanding is a passphrase is important to protect private keys in the event they are acquired: If I don't use a passphrase, how should I protect my key (other than making it difficult to physically access)?
