@_subject: GPGME library build issue on Solaris 
Hash: SHA1
I wonder if anybody had any problems building gpgme libraries on Solaris =
2.7 and 2.8 . Particularily it's bombing out on vasprintf and asprintf =
functions during linkage. I believe these functions are not implemented =
on Solaris.
Any comments or workarounds are appreciated,
Here is the error:

Did you try with gnu make? Solaris make may have troubles handling these =
makefiles. Remember, when you install gnu make and put it in your PATH, =
rerun ./configure script for gnupg.
