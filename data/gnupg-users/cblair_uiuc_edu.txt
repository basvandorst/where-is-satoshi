@_subject: unable to verify gpg 1.4.3 tar file 
I have been trying to verify the source for gpg 1.4.3
using a previously installed gpg 1.4.1.  Thanks for any help!
   When I type gpg --verify gnupg-1.4.3.tar.gz.sig I get:
   I tried gpg --import samplekeys.asc
and then gpg --list-keys "Koch" gives:

@_subject: tar file for version 1.4.3--- bad signature? 
I am unable to verify the gpg 1.4.3 tar file.  Can
somebody tell me what I am doing wrong?
   I have downloaded the files:
-rw-r--r--   4354218 Apr 26 17:54 gnupg-1.4.3.tar.gz
-rw-r--r--       158 May  1 19:13 gnupg-1.4.3.tar.gz.sig
   When I tried gpg --verify gnupg-1.4.3.tar.gz.sig
using version 1.4.1, I got:
gpg: Signature made Mon 03 Apr 2006 05:42:26 AM CDT
using RSA key ID 1CE0C630
gpg: BAD signature from
"Werner Koch (dist sig) "
  The key was downloaded from the MIT keyserver:
