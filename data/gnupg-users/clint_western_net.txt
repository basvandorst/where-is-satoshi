@_subject: LinuxPPC make check fails 
I'm rebuilding the RPM for LinuxPPC based on the latest 1.0.5 source.
The build is failing during the "make check" phase. The offending line in
the Makefile:
$(GPG_IMPORT) $(srcdir)/pubdemo.asc
expands to...
../g10/gpg --homedir . --quiet --yes --import ./pubdemo.asc
fails with...
make[2]: *** [prepared.stamp] Illegal instruction
I ran the import again with the -vv switch and got the following:
gpg: armor: BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK
gpg: armor header: Version: GnuPG v0.9.3 (GNU/Linux)
gpg: armor header: Comment: For info see :public key packet:
:user ID packet: "Alpha Test (demo key) "
:signature packet: algo 17, keyid 2D727CC768697734
:user ID packet: "Alice (demo key)"
:signature packet: algo 17, keyid 2D727CC768697734
:user ID packet: "Alfa Test (demo key) "
:signature packet: algo 17, keyid 2D727CC768697734
:public sub key packet:
:signature packet: algo 17, keyid 2D727CC768697734
:public key packet:
gpg: loaded digest 2
Illegal instruction
Any suggestions?

I haven't received any responses, so I thought I'd post this again. If
anyone has any clues, that'd be great!
I'm trying to build 1.0.5 on Linux 2.4.3 for the Power PC (1.0.4 compiled
just fine).
The build with 1.0.5 is failing during the "make check" phase. The
offending line in the Makefile:
$(GPG_IMPORT) $(srcdir)/pubdemo.asc
expands to...
../g10/gpg --homedir . --quiet --yes --import ./pubdemo.asc
fails with...
make[2]: *** [prepared.stamp] Illegal instruction
I ran the import again manually with the -vv switch and got the following:
