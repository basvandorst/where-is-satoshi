I've spent a *lot* of time tuning the PKCS  code in cryptlib ( for a large number
of (often quite buggy) PKCS  drivers.  It's available under a GPL-
compatible licence, so you could always just use that, it'll work with pretty
much any PKCS  device except one or two extremely broken ones.

That would rule out about 99% of all PKCS  implementations in existence.
The problem is twofold, firstly the spec is very flexible (since it covers a
large number of crypto devices ranging from little tinkertoy smart cards up to
high-end crypto coprocessors) so there's a lot of room for interpretation,
secondly since the major driving force for PKCS  for many years was
Netscape, many vendors implemented whatever Netscape needed, which includes
Netscape bugs.  So you can't create an implementation "for the specification"
both because there are many ways to interpret it and because historically
drivers have done things other than the way the spec said they should.

I'd already offered the use of my PKCS  interface code from cryptlib for
GPG use some time ago.  This should do everything you need and has had years
of tuning to work with all the bugs in various PKCS  drivers, it's vastly
easier than going through the entire learning curve yourself.

Users of crypto tokens tend to fall into two classes, hobbyists/enthusiasts
(who don't mind hacking their own glue code, so PKCS  isn't too important),
and commercial/business users (who really need PKCS  but who probably
wouldn't use GPG).  The result is, as you've found, something of a lack of a
market for PKCS  combined with GPG.

Well OK, so there's always exceptions, but I don't think there's enough to
drive significant demand for this - all the commercial users I've seen who
want smart cards/PKCS  want to use it with standard commercial
software and, you know, that stuff with the 'X' and some digits in it :-).

I think the problem is more a generalisation of that, it's "under Linux, I
couldn't find a smart-card + PKCS combination that works correctly".  I've
heard of (from memory) four PKCS  projects by commercial vendors
that either ended up as pre-alpha quality releases/abandonware or were shelved
beause the vendor couldn't find a business model for them (this was a few
years ago, it may be better now).  The one PKCS  driver that I
know of that was completed, the nCipher one, works fine with cryptlib.
Everything else is Windows only... actually Eracom have Solaris and some other
OS support (PHUX?), and there's some OEM'd Cryptoswift supported under
(Which other Linux PKCS  drivers are there?).

Oh, that's the old Aladdin stuff.  Well, they've certainly come a *long* way
since I last looked at them - in the 1999-2000 time frame they had the worst
PKCS  driver I've ever seen, and their "support" consisted of telling you
to buy more copies of their $700 SDK to see whether they'd fixed any of the
bugs in the version you already had.  I still have some of their hardware
lying around as a paperweight somewhere.
(Disclaimer: I have no idea what it's like now (it certainly sounds a lot
 better than it used to be), I'm just saying that at one point it was really
 bad).

Argh, sorry, wrong driver, it's the ActivCard drivers (and support) that were
that bad, not Aladdin.  Aladdin (and by extension ASECard and Athena Cards,
and eTokens as well) work just fine.  Just to repeat that: Nothing wrong with
Aladdin's PKCS

Although they're less expensive on ebay :-).  Keep an eye on that long enough
and you'll find almost anything turning up, for example there's almost always
some Spyrus Lynks cards on sale by someone.  Some of the stuff even has
previous CA's keys still in the HW.
Yup, and that's an important point.  If you want big-iron style crypto HW
support, your choice is either PKCS  CryptoAPI, or a per-hardware-device
custom API.  I know which one I'd want...

PKCS  is a device driver without which it's impossible to use critical (to
the application) hardware.  If you take this interpretation then GPG already
violates it because it ends up using all manner of components (RAID drivers,
ATI/nVidia video drivers, PC/SC drivers, etc) that aren't distributed as part
of the OS.  In fact if you wanted to go reductio ad absurdum even kernel32.dll
is excluded because the hotfixes that are constantly applied to it aren't
"normally distributed with the system components" - they're a special
On the other hand using a particular interpretation of the GPL in order to
make it impossible for GPG to be able to support widespread smart cards and
crypto hardware is a great example of cutting off your nose to spite your
face.  I guess you can always tell people who want to use crypto devices with
PGP to go with the commercial PGP instead.  Or cryptlib :-).

SPENGLER (emphatic): Don't cross PGP and X.509. VENKMAN: Why not? SPENGLER: Trust me. It will be bad. VENKMAN: What do you mean "bad?" SPENGLER: It's hard to explain, but try to imagine Werner appearing suddenly
and beating you to death with a large copy of the GNU manifesto.
VENKMAN (with military authority): That's it! No X.509. You guys are

Are any more details on what the problem is available?  This predates my
Usenix Security paper that looked at various PRNGs, and the Kelsey, Schneier,
Wagner and Hall PRNG paper didn't look at GPG either.  Others looked mostly at
one specific generator, often /dev/random, but also the Windows and OpenSSL
(OK, I'm downloading an older source archive now, let's see if I can find the
flaw before Werner posts a reply :-).

[Redirected to gnupg-devel rather than gnupg-users because it seems more
 appropriate there]
So I think I've managed to reverse-engineer what the code is doing (there are
no code comments explaining it).  It's not at all what I described in my PRNG
paper, but I can't tell if that's an accident or by design because, well,
there are no code comments.  What the GnuPG code does is mix the next 64 bytes
and then overwrite the preceding 20 bytes with the mixed output, however this
doesn't propagate any entropy along through the buffer.  Quoting the original
  Assuming the use of MD5, which has a 64-byte input and 16-byte output, we
  would hash the 16+64 bytes at locations n-16... n+63 and then write the
  resulting 16-byte hash to locations n ... n+15 (the chaining which is
  performed explicitly by PGP is performed implicitly here by including the
  previously processed 16 bytes in the input to the hash function). We then
  move forward 16 bytes and repeat the process, wrapping the input around to
  the start of the buffer when the end of the buffer is reached. The
  overlapping of the data input to each hash means that each 16-byte block
  which is processed is influenced by all the surrounding bytes
The GnuPG code however only hashes the next 64 bytes, and then uses the output
to overwrite the current 20 bytes (it uses RMD160, not MD5, since it's a bit
newer than the original paper).  No state is carried along.

Ah, I was looking at cipher/random.c, for which the sole comment is Yeah, the last time the raw hash was used was in the 2002 release, since then
the code has used the high-level interface because calling into a low-level
internal function isn't very portable, and it makes the result harder to
analyse.  So now I explicitly hash $hashsize + 64 bytes, $hashsize bytes
before the current position for chaining and 64 bytes after.
