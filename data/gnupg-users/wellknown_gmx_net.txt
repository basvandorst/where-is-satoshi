@_subject: export a public subkey isolated 
Hi List,
there was no success in googling this question:
Is it possible to export the public part of a subkey isolated? There should be nothing of the masterkey or other subkeys in the exported keyblock.
 database is not supporting signing with subkeys. They only accept a single key in certificate block.
I have an openpgp card containing my secret subkeys for signing/encryption/authenticating and am only able to export the subkeys with the corresponding masterkey in one block.
Many thanks for your answers!
