@_subject: trust problem 
im a Gnupg beginner, in Gnupg user guide i know how to
use trust to validate keys.
It has two conditions 1 and 2, i understand the first
but i don't understand the second,
following is the second condition:
2. the path of signed keys leading from K back to your
own key is five steps or shorter.
above figure shows that peter signed blake and blake
signed elena then on and on,
if peter just fully trusts simon, i think K's key is
valid, however K is beyond the range of five steps,
can anyone tell me why and i want more clearly
about the second condition, thanks.
