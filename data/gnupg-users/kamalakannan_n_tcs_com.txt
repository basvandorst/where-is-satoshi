Hi Hauke ,
Application is run by the same user and  secret key is protected by a We are trying to decrypt the same file from both Command prompt and Datastage Application.
Actually we are  using the batch file to decrypt the file and we calling the batch file through Datastage Application . Batch file command is : gpg --batch --passphrase-file E:\Data\qfbi\Navtech\Working\passphrase.txt --output E:\Data\qfbi\Navtech\Working\NJS170203YBBNA.xml --decrypt E:\Data\qfbi\Navtech\Input\NJS170203YBBNA.gpg * Passphrase key available in the specified path
1)Is there any command is to check access for the application to decrypt. Regards ,

You have to ensure that both your command prompt call and the call by the application use the same file.
1) The application could run as a different user.
2) The application could run chrooted.
3) The application could be restricted in its access rights by some LSM (Apparmor, SELinux or similar).
Thus do this:
a) Compare the output of
gpg --list-options show-keyring --list-secret-keys
from both the command prompt and the application
b) Is the secret key protected by a passphrase?

Hi Hauke ,
Kindly help me out by providing --multifile --decrypt batch file command ,
Currently we are using batch command as below to decrypt single files.
gpg --batch --passphrase-file E:\Data\qfbi\Navtech\Working\passphrase.txt --output E:\Data\qfbi\Navtech\Working\NJS170203YBBNA.xml --decrypt E:\Data\qfbi\Navtech\Input\NJS170203YBBNA.gpg  Kindly let me know how to decrypt multifile  by using single command
