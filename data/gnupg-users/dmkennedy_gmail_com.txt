@_subject: appending to gpg file? 
I am trying to append new data to a gpg log file id like to keep running.
Lets say i run
echo "line1" | gpg -z 0 -r test at test.com -e > testfile
is there a way to append to testfile and reparse/unencrypt later?
Concatenating to the file doesnt help:
echo "line2" | gpg -z 0 -r test at test.com -e >> testfile
Is there a clean way to go about this from the command line?  Another
packaging option (hopefully something with minimal overhead)?

Is there a safe ascii delimiter i could use between messages in one file,
then? Maybe insert a delimited 'line break' of sorts, parse out individual
gpg messsages, and decrypt each piece?
Thanks for the brainstorm..

Thanks for the help!
I'm using an app to pipe events (text strings) through an instance of gpg to
a file.  This works great for me now, in an ideal environment.
Two issues:
1)The problem occurs if/when the app breaks, breaking the pipe and killing
my stream.  GPG terminates, and the resulting file is unreadable (i get an
error decrypting it after entering in the passphrase).  so, the whole log is
no good.
2)Then, what if i'd like to start the app again, and stream back to the same
My thought is to individually encrypt each "line" in the output file as its
own gpg encrypted package.  No dependencies on other individual "lines" not
being corrupt, as long as some sort of delimiter is in place.
