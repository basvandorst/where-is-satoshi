Dear All
Please, please, please don't anyone reply to this it's a load of rubbish
and smacks of social engineering. These things are amongst a long list
of old hacker/cracker tricks to gain access to your machine.
If this is not the case I will apologise but I have seen so many people
duped by these in the past, and besides this is a technical mailing list
and is not the place for advertisements.

@_subject: Importing gnupg secret keys into pgp 
I know this is the wrong way round to do this, but I've recently
acquired a windows machine at work and am using outlook. The simplest
way to get messages signed is to use pgp. But I can't seem to import my
secret keys into it. Any ideas (or places to look), pgp to gnupg is
pretty well covered...

Thanks everyone, I am going to experiment with various combinations but
right now I've opted for the g-data plugin.
