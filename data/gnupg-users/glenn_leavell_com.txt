I'm using GnuPG 1.03 with external IDEA support, and I've been able to
successfully use IDEA to send encrypted documents to PGP users with an
RSA key.  To accomplish this, I'm using the "--cipher-algo idea" option.
According to gpg(1) :
       --cipher-algo name
                 Use name as cipher algorithm. Running the pro­
                 gram with the command --version yields a list of
                 supported  algorithms.  If  this is not used the
                 cipher algorithm is selected  from  the  prefer­
                 ences stored with the key.
This makes it sound like I can associate a default cipher algorithm
preference for each key in my keyring.  Unfortunately, I haven't been
able to determine how to set this preference from reading the man pages
or the GnuPG Handbook.  I'd love to be able to automatically use IDEA
when encrypting to PGP users and something like 3DES or BLOWFISH when
encrypting to GnuPG users.  Can anyone offer any assistance?

I sent the following note to the list a week ago and haven't received
any replies, so I thought I'd give it one more shot.  Can anyone help
me associate a default cipher-algo preference to be associated with
each key in my keyring?  Thanks --Glenn

# # It does?  Doesn't sound like that to me.  What it means is that you
# specify not a default cipher for the key, but a cipher to use for that
# session.  That is, you use --cipher-algo in conjunction with --encrypt or
# similar command.
Thanks for the response.  I didn't mean that the man page description for
the --cipher-algo option was to be used to specify a general preference.  I
was referring to the sentence that says "If this [the --cipher-algo option]
is not used the cipher algorithm is selected from the preferences stored
with the key."  And my question is:  How do I specify that stored Thanks again,

# By creating a Key ;-) Seriously, the algorithm preferences are stored # in the self-signature of a user ID (You can review them by running
# gpg --list-packets on a public key file or using the pref command in
# the --edit-key function). I don´t know, whether algrithm preferences
# are possible at all with RSA keys/v3 sigs.
# # Currently the preferences 10/4/3 (Twofish, Blowfish, Cast5) are # hard-wired into the GnuPG key creation process. # You´d have to go source-diving to change them (g10/keygen.c, IIRC).
Thanks -- this clears up a lot for me.  From reading everyone's responses
and testing things with various keys, I've figured out what I've
really been trying to ask:
If I want to use gpg to encrypt something to someone's old RSA/IDEA key, I
can do so by including "--cipher-algo idea", and it works fine.  However,
if I leave off this option, the person trying to decrypt the message
(using PGP) "Unsupported packet format - you need a newer version of PGP
for this file."  But if I look at their public key with --list-packets,
I see that their RSA key *does* have a preference for algorithm 1, which
is IDEA.  So, why do I need to be explicit about wanting to use IDEA
with the --cipher-algo option?  Why doesn't gpg pick up on this preference
based on the public key itself?
