@_subject: [gnupg-users] Decrypting file encrypted for multiple recipients using 
I've some files encrypted to multiple recipients  and I want to use gpg in
batch mode like this:
$ gpg --passphrase-fd 0 --batch --d file.gpg
If I type a password gpg will try it with all the posible recipients but
this is not the behaviour that I want, is there any way to force a user?
Thanks for your help.

@_subject: [gnupg-users] Change key password in batch mode 
I want to edit the password in batch mode, I try this: (where 12345 is the
old password)
$ gpg --batch --passphrase-fd 0 --status-fd 2 --command-fd 0 --edit-key user
[GNUPG:] GET_LINE keyedit.prompt
[GNUPG:] GOT_IT
[GNUPG:] USERID_HINT 4565CE******* User1 [GNUPG:] NEED_PASSPHRASE 4565CE******* 4565CE****** 17 0
[GNUPG:] GOOD_PASSPHRASE
[GNUPG:] GOOD_PASSPHRASE
Enter the new passphrase for this secret key
[GNUPG:] NEED_PASSPHRASE_SYM 3 3 2
[GNUPG:] GET_LINE keyedit.prompt
But gpg never gives me the chance to write the new password. I saw other
similar post
but I can get it working. In fact I don't see any GET_HIDDEN, is it an old

2012/10/19 Werner Koch But then I have to use pinentry, and I don't want to. I tried
     gpg --passwd USER --batch --passphrase-fd 0
but I can only write the old-password, the command finished without leave
me type the new password. I think that passphrase-fd only read one password
at a time.
 I had used these options together to change the expiration date, is it
Thanks for your help

is there any way to dump the options included in gpg.conf like the homedir?

@_subject: GET_HIDDEN deprecated in gpgv2 
I've been testing gpg in batch mode and I realized that I can change the
password using this line in gpgv1:
$ gpg --status-fd 1 --command-fd 0 --edit-key KEYID
And the output show something like this:
[GNUPG:] GET_HIDDEN passphrase.enter
[GNUPG:] GOT_IT
But this doesn't work in gpgv2. Is there any reason? Thanks you in advance!

Thanks for the quick answer!
I don't understand, I thought that GPA used GPGME not command line, so I
dont know how I should use command-fd. I want to avoid the use of pinentry
or any other external graphical tool.
