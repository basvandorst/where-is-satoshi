Hi folks,
Well, I have got to encrypt/decrypt the files using Open PGP. Now I have got
PGP key block and Pgp KEY from other party. I have also installed GPG on my
local machine.
but i really dont have any idea what to do next. Please let me know what to
do with PGP key (0xAJ7A9B41) and PGP key block (this is very strange text).
something like this
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: PGP 7.0
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
please help.
kind regards,
