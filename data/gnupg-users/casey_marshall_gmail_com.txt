I?d like to share Hockeypuck, an OpenPGP Keyserver I?ve developed in

Not yet, but soon. PKS syncing is an easier stop-gap measure while I
study set reconciliation.
All excellent suggestions, opened in Launchpad. Thanks for the feedback!

@_subject: GnuPG future timestamp checks and security 
I'm considering ignoring the time checks (--ignore-time-conflict,
--ignore-valid-from) due to clock drift being a common problem in my
What was the motivation for adding the timestamp checks? Specifically,
are there security implications to disabling them I should be
concerned about?

I've released Hockeypuck 2.1.0
 [0], which
contains several new features that may be useful to mitigate
spamming/flooding/DoS [1] attacks on GnuPG and keyservers. See the release
link for details, but here's the highlights:
   - Configurable key length and packet size limits, with sensible defaults
   to limit keyserver resource consumption (1MB and 8K respectively).
   - Configurable blacklist of primary key fingerprints.
   - Authenticated key management. This adds a couple of extra endpoints
   which allow a key owner to replace and delete their key, authenticated by
   signing the armored key in the request. This allows a key owner to still
   update their own key once it has been inflated beyond the key length limit.
Blacklists and auth key management may also be of interest to keyserver
operators subject to GDPR-related requests.

This might be a controversial opinion, but I would allow it to happen.
Even if reconciliation cannot provide perfect consistency in such a world,
it is still useful as a gossip protocol to distribute new keys and
My prediction (given keyserver operator buy-in) is, some cohorts of
like-minded keyserver operators will coordinate on their settings. Peers in
these cohorts will keep relatively more closely in sync and propagate key
material faster amongst themselves, than with those that have different
policies that cause them to diverge more widely. Peers across these more
divergent cohorts may still peer at a lower frequency, so key material
accepted by both may still propagate.

Hockeypuck has several issues still open on Github:
The fix to this issue was to have Hockeypuck remove all packets lacking a
currently-valid self-signature from responses. This removes fake packets
(like the uat example) as well as expired identities. The self-signature on
the UID packet in your example expired 2008-12-31, so it (and all of its
third-party signatures) are pruned from the response. Only the public key
packet remains.
