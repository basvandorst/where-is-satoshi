@_subject: problem with german umlauts 
I have installed GnuPG 1.4.11 from the GnuPT-site and GnuPG 2.0.16 (gpg4win
2.1.0?) under winxp. codepage is 437. The verify-result is OK in both
versions, but only the umlauts are making trouble:
In Gpg v1.4 it looks like (demolitioned umlauts), but in Gpg v2.0.16 :
 (umlauts OK)
Whats to do, to make version 1 showing correctwritten results?

Fine 4you, but no help 4me.
Sure, but the question is, why GnuPG version 2 has no probs but version 1.4.11 has. Both versions are running under CP437
shows it

Charset iso-8859-1 in gpg.conf for  v1.4.11 SOLVED the prob :-))
 jetzt ist wirklich alles in Butter auch v1 im neuen script. Evtl.solltest Du einen entsprechenden Hinweis im script anbringen.
Auszug aus einer Muster-gpg.conf:
# If you do not use the Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) charset, you should tell
# GnuPG which is the native character set.  Please check the man page
# for supported character sets.  This character set is only used for
# metadata and not for the actual message which does not undergo any
# translation.  Note that future version of GnuPG will change to UTF-8
# as default character set.  In most cases this option is not required # GnuPG is able to figure out the correct charset and use that.
Charset utf-8 bringst nicht aber
Charset iso-8859-1 :-)))  und Reinhard ist happy :-)...... und Du sicher auch?

Yes, I know. I see it in my installation of GnuPG 2.0.16 where no probs with german umlauts are existing (as you see in jpg-link I sent in op.
I have 2 gpg.confs, one 4 v1.4.11 and another 4 v2.0.16. In second no charset is defined in it. Standard-utf-8 works fine in my client 40tude-dialog, but not in Thunderbird where umlauts are shown as questionmarks. Now I will test ist out setting charset iso-8859-1 in gpg.conf for version2.

Hi Ben,
Here are the results:
Using GnuPG v.1.4.11 with 40tude-dialog as client charset must be iso-8859-1
or -15 to shows correct umlauts
Using GnuPG v.1.4.11 with Thunderbird as client charset must be utf-8 to
show correct umlauts
Using GnuPG v.2.0.16 using all possible charsets, 40tude shows correct
umlauts, but Thunderbird always shows questionmarks instead of german

Hi Robert,

For GnuPG
In bodypane of TB different charsets are configurable, but in headerpane?
TB is configured for utf-8 like GnuPG v.1.4.11 and shows umlauts well.
Using GnuPG v.2.0.16 (standard-utf-8) TB shows umlauts wrong :-(

View iso-8859-1: umlauts in body are OK, utf-8-characters in body are destroyed (o?o) =  (o??o), umlauts in headerpane are OK

I'm not so familiar with TB because my favourite client is 40tude-dialog, where everything works fine. I only tested the probs with TB to see,if there are differences in showing the characters. I had set the options in TB for incoming/outgoing msgs. to iso-8859-1; now I changed to utf-8 and now I will see, if problems getting solved with this. When I have results I'll tell you.

Now I checked it out: setting all TB-prefs to utf-8 and post new mail/news with TB, all characters are good.
Replying to that msgs with TB, all characters (in header- and bodypane) are good.
Posting news with a different client or replying with this different client on TB-sent news AND prefs in diff. client are set to iso-8859-1 or -15, TB shows all characters well. If different client is set to utf-8, TB shows the chars BAD in headerpane and good in bodypane. If I change view to iso-8859-1/15 chars in headerpane getting well but in bodypane bad.
Translation chinese/... via Google...... good idea :-)
Btw: this mail is header-signed. Did you get GOOD SIG on verifying?

I tested it only on nntp. I know from a developer for enigmail, that headersigning/verifying is not implemented yet, but he told me, that it could be a feature in future if  a RFC is available for that. The maintainer of the headersigning/verifying script I use is in contact with him. If you are further interested, look    and especially  Reinhard --- [on OUTLOOK2007 with QF-Macros] ---

I have installed both versions in different directories (v.1.4.11 and

and both are working without problems. Yes that's true, but isn't there a position to customize the installation

@_subject: setting gpg.conf strictly 
Hi list,
I have installed GnuPG v.2.0.16 (from Gpgwin  2.1.0b) and GnuPG v.1.4.11
(from GnuPT) on same PC -winxp SP3. Both working well, but I recognized that
both versions are using the files in directory c:\docs and
apps\\apps\gnupt version 1.4\.
Whats to do, to make 2.0.16 using its userfile in ..\apps\gnupg version 2
and 1.4.11 using its above?

Hello Werner,
Installing gnupg-w32cli-1.4.18.exe on winXP works, but starting wpt.exe after installation, the monitor shows "Schl?sselcache internal error". Then rightclick on wptbutton/?ber(about) in the quickstartlist shows the right versionnumbers of wpt an gnupg. But clicking "Schl?sselverwaltung" a bugmessage arrives like this. Look here: I restarted the system but no solution. So I went back to 1.4.17 :-(
