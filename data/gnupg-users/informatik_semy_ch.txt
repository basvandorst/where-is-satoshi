@_subject: No v3 keys allowed 
Hello all
When uploading a key to keyserver.pgp.com I get the message that no V3 keys are allowed.
How that?
I took gpg2 with expert option and 22519 algorithm.
How can I create a v4 key?
Kind regards

Hello all
How secure is it to use Thundebrird with Autocrypt? I use Sylpheed at the moment, but it is not that comfortable to use as Thunderbird.
Also, when I send an email, the signature will be shown instead like with thunderbid just an info that the mail is signed
Do you have some inputs?

Hello Werner
I would like to use claws-mail, but it looked quite old-school when I last used it.
There was no auto-configure of mail setup (find mail-server by itself).
But I will install it again and check it out.
Thank you

I don't know if this is the right place here, but as we are discussing about sylpheed and claws-mail as well:
I have the following issue with Sylpheed:
I searched in Sylpheed for an email of April 20, 2020 for an insurance. I could easily find it in Thunderbird, but Sylpheed couldn't find it. I didn't see the mail in the inbox list of Sylpheed. Could it be Sylpheed doesn't catch all mail? How can I force it to sync everything it finds on the server?
I know it's not pgp related, but you guys know these two MUA, so therefore I ask.

Probably HTML within an organization should be allowed but not when leaving such one?
