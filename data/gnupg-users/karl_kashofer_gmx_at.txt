@_subject: problem with key import 
Hi !
Would anyone know why this key can not be imported into GnuPG ?
Keyserver: 0x133CC3FD
It looks OK to me, imports fine in PGP and the self signature was made
one second after the key creation date. No hints in PGPdump either.
GnuPG seems to skip the primary UserID and then complains about no valid
User ID. The key was created with CryptoEx.
Any insight would be higly valued,

Thanks everyone who took the time to answer my question !
It was more an academic question, as the key has been decommissioned
anyway. We just wondered what the problem was.

@_subject: German "umlauts" in passphrase 
Hi all !
This should be a simple question, but I have failed to find an answer to it.
Is it possible to use german umlauts in the gnupg passphrase?
The reason I ask is that I imported a keypair from my windows keyring when I switched my laptop to linux, and now I cant use it as it has umlauts in the passphrase. I cant even change the passphrase as I can not enter it....
Do I really have to export my key to windows and remove the umlaut, or is there another solution ?
Ubuntu 6.06, gnupg 1.4.2.2

Hi !
Yes, thats what I guessed.
I will most probably change my passphrase, but as this problem has cropped up in other apps as well I would really like to find out how to solve it.
So, how would I examine the charset talbles ? The UserID and other information printed by GnuPG is correctly displayed with all the umlauts. How do I find out what character I have to type to get the umlaut in my passphrase?
I presume i could find out by comparing the german windows charset to the german linux charset ? Any leads ?
Thanks for your help,
