@_subject: newbie curious about subkey usage 
hi, I'm kinda new to GNUPG and was if anyone can help (or point me in right direction) on the following:
is it possible to specify specific subkey to sign and encrypt data?
Does --import merge both public and private key attributes (I can't seem to do this without deleting the older secret key)
any way to export only specific subkeys(public) from the keyring?
thanks in advance for any help.

which version of Manpage,  there doesn't seem much on subkey usage there.  can you give a simple example?
this doesn't seem to be a recognised command, is this the latest version of GNUPG?  thanks again for the reply.
