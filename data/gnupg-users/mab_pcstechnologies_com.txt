@_subject: gpg: decryption failed: bad key 
I am a newbie with gpg. I have created a key pair and sent the public key to
my trading partner. I used all the defaults. My trading partner sent me
their public key. They can decrypt the stuff I send to them, but when I try
to decrypt the stuff they send to me, I get:
[root outbound]# gpg --decrypt -o x o.lveo.20040721140521.pgp
gpg: NOTE: secret key 6116A9F8 is NOT protected.
gpg: decryption failed: bad key
[root outbound]#
The "6116A9F8" is shown with my key "PcsTech1" in the gpg -list-keys.
They are using PGP this is the top of their public key:
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: McAfee E-Business Server v7.1.1 - Full License
They are using this to encrypt the files:
pgp --encrypt $PREPGPDIR/$FILE_NAME --user "PcsTech1" --output $POSTPGPD
IR/$FILE_NAME  > $MAIL_FILE 2>&1
Does anyone have an idea of what the "bad key" message means and how I can
correct this ?
Thanks in advance !
