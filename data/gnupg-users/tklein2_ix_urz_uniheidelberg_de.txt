Hi everybody,
is it possible to use the Gnupg1.0.1-keys (sec & public) in PGP6.5.1i ?
Well I tried to import the Gnupg-keys into the Win-version of PGP6.5.1i, it
seems that the public-key succeeded but the sec-key wouldn't work. Every
time I want to encrypt a message with the sec-key under PGP6.5.1i it won't
accept the MANTRA/Passphrase ...
any hints on this? Btw, when will the Win-version of Gnupg be ready :) it
seems that this would be the best solution to exchange the keys probably.

Hi again,
now I tried to import the PGP keys in Gnupg.
# gpg --import secring.skr
# gpg --import pubring.pkr
Wow, and it seemed to work: I encrypted and signed a message under
win-pgp6.5.1i and send it to my linux-box. I fired up pine with
pgp4pine-support and I could encrypt the message under linux-gnupg!
But now, when I try to encrypt&sign a message under linux-gnupg it fails:
----->8 snip 8<------
You know all recipient keys. You may:
a)Sign and encrypt the message
Make your choice [a]:
gpg: übersprungen '039F0E4EC992085F7': Geheimer Schlüssel nicht vorhanden
gpg: /tmp/sf000475: sign+encrypt failed: Geheimer Schlüssel nicht vorhanden
----->8 snip 8<------
humpf... any hints on this ? or is it impossible to use pgp keys with gnupg?
best regards,
