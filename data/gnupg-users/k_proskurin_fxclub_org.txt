Hello all!
First of all - sorry for my english. :-)
Im try to solve one problem.
What we have:
FreeBSD 6.2
PGP Desktop 9.6 (windows)
include         /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/pgp-keyserver.schema
include         /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/pgp-recon.schema
include         /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/pgp-remte-prefs.schema
allow bind_anon_cred
allow update_anon
access to filter=(objectClass=pgpKeyInfo)
       by * write
access to dn="ou=PGP Keys,dc=company,dc=org"
       by * write
We have a "ou=PGP Keys,dc=company,dc=org" full of a PGP keys what work`s.
PGP Desktop easy search at our Ldap keyserver and inports key`s from were.
What we need:
We need to add keys to a keyserver.
When im try "sent to" any key to our keyserver via PGP Desktop it returns a error:
"Strong authentication required"
We use ldaps... More strong? :-\
Then im try to add it by a gnupg via console.
% gpg --keyserver ldaps://pgp.company.org  --send-keys KEYID
gpgkeys: this keyserver type only supports key retrieval
What is interesting, some one before me who make all this system is easy add key`s via PGP Desktop 8.x.
But were is no way to ask him "how?".
Im search all google. :-) And after few day`s im start to think what no one is use a Ldap keyservers....
Maybe im search bad...
What in do wrong? Or what else im need to post for more information?
Can someone help me?  "man this" also good. :-)

Im use FreebBSD 6.2 now.
Then im run a
% portupgrade -N gnupg
Im put a cross on "ldap support"...
It must be really compile with ldap support.
