i have been using gpg for several months with mutt (my mail client) and
no problems, I love it. but recently, I had to reinstall my RedHat 7.3
server and although I saved all my home directories, the install
overwrote my keyrings with empty files.
I didn't think this was much of a problem because I have backups of my
secret keys. However, when I copied over the backups, or try to do
_anything_ with my secret key, I get errors like this:
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=25)
gpg: read_keyblock: read error: invalid packet
gpg: enum_keyblocks failed: invalid keyring
this is bad as use my secret key regularly. what can I don, I have tried
uninstalling and reinstalling gpg, but no change

program itself at all

ok, i will try upgrading but since i have tried it on three different
machines... well, i'll give anything a go once.
