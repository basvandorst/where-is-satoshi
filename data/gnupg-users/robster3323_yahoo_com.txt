@_subject: GPG decrypt error ctb=4c 
When I decypt a file I am getting the following errors when I decrypt a file.  I can't for the life of me figure out why.
I am running GPG 1.4.9.
The file is encrypted with a standard asymetric encryption, and not ascii armored.
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=4c)

@_subject: End of Line characters disappear after decryption 
When I decrypt a file using GPG 1.4.9, the file decrypts just fine, but all the formatting is lost.  Key thing that is missing is the End of Line characters. Any suggestions?
I have a 100 100 byte records that are stored in a file, it gets encrypted and shipped over the wire and decrypted, I can decrypt the file, but all the records run together and look like one contiguous line.

Here is the command line we are using, and the return codes we are seeing.  Again we are using GPG 1.4.9.
$gpg -r Lynn --output decr2.tst -d testfile.gpg
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=6f)
The file is readable in VI, it successfully decrypts the message, but all of the formatting is lost.
