@_subject: Starting with gnupg 
The confusion is between SSL (Secure Socket Layers), which provides  the security in https protocol and can provide security in  FTP over  SSL, and SSH (Secure SHell), which provides the security for scp, sftp  (ftp over SSH or SSH file transfer protocol).
SSL depends on a hierarchical certificate trust system (X-509) where  the certificates are certified by a "root" Certificate Authority (CA)  such as Verisign or Deutsche Telekom or Staat De Nederlanden.
This provides a lucrative business for selling trust.
SSH, on the other hand, is closer to the PGP/GPG web of trust. It uses  keys generated by the SSH server and your client to verify each other  after you have been authenticated to the server in another manner  (most often passwords, but even can be GPG or X509). SSH allows  tunnelling of other network protocols over the basic SSH connection.  One of those tunnelled protocols is FTP and SSH has the ability to  facilitate this.
But all of these protocols encrypt the transmission, not the actual  data files being transmitted. This is where gnupg comes in.

@_subject: [GnuPG-users] identical files -> non-identical encrypted files 
Why is not having identical encrypted copies a problem?
The key will decrypt each copy to the same plain text plus the salt,  which you can ignore.
So everyone will look at the same message after decryption.
You can use GPG to send the key over an encrypted channel as long as  you have their public key (and they have GPG installed and a key pair).

@_subject: public key newer than the signature 
Phil Zimmerman is the developer of PGP so his key was the very first  one issued. I wonder if there is a rollover problem with one of the  fields in the key?

Your message was signed but your key does not seem to e in any public  key server. You need to send it to a keyserver so others can use your  public key.
use gnupg2 --keyserver hkp://subkeys.pgp.net --send-keys [key IDs]
Similar to--export but sends the keys to a keyserver. Fingerprints may  be used instead of key
IDs. Option--keyserver must be used to give the name of this  keyserver. Don?t send your complete
keyring to a keyserver --- select only those keys which are new or  changed by you.

@_subject: playing with cryptography... 
Yes, you are correct. The WoT model was developed by Phil Zimmerman  for PGP but OpenPGP has expanded on it.
That is one reason that OpenPGP is better than  X.509, which forces  you to a single trust model, and to trust unknown certifiers.
Are you sure that you trust the Government of Taiwan to certify web  sites for SSL as Firefox does by default?

@_subject: how long should a password be? 
Unfortunately that is not true. Since most systems use a single byte  for each character in a passphrase There are only 2^(8*n) bits in an n  character passphrase.
So there are only 64 bits in an 8 character password, which can be  cracked quite quickly using rainbow tables for any password.
The real problem is allowing multiple attempts to crack the passphrase  and this only occurs if your secret keyring is available to the cracker.
Basically, any password you can remember is easy to crack, so don't  let the keyring ever be in a position for someone to try.

@_subject: Linux crypto killer apllication 
You don't seem to understand the difference between public key an  secret key encryption.
RSA is not used to encrypt the document. RSA is used to encrypt the  key that is used to encrypt the document. The key is a shared private  key that is transmitted using a PK system like RSA.
IF you want to save encrypted data for a long time, you encrypt it  with a sufficiently long private key (generated at random), such as as  AES 512. You then encrypt that key with the public keys of everybody  that needs to know the key to decrypt the document. Since the private  key is fairly short in bytes and random, it has a full entropy, so  would be hard to decrypt by random guessing.
If you are worried by key size, it is the key size of the AES cypher  that you need to worry about, not RSA.

@_subject: Someone has harvested my address 
If you have added that address to a public PGP key server, that will  be the reason. spammers have been harvesting key servers within the  pgp.net domain for several years.
As well, anything sent to a public list like this may be archived on  web pages, inviting harvest for spam.

@_subject: Made of awesome 
I don't see the system having any of my private keys.
It seems to work by having the email system keep track of the public  keys of list subscribers, while also having its own key pair for the  When I send a message to the list, I encrypt it with the list's public  key and sign it with my private signing key.
The list handler then checks (using my public key) that a list member  (me) sent it, decrypts it with its private key, and resends the  message to each list member, encrypting with each member's public keys  and signs it with list private signing key.
It is not really any different than sending messages to a group of  people which are on your public keyring, except that the membership of  the group is known only to this list manager and each member of list  does not have to keep a public key for each member, just list itself.
Itdoes have the problem that one needs to trust that the list  management software is not compromised, as it has access to the plain  text messages and is essentially acting as a man-in-the-middle agent  to accomplish all this.

@_subject: Changing preferences 
Basically DES uses a very strong algorithm that can be readily put  into hardware. But it uses a key of 56 bits (8 7-bit ASCII characters  for example). THis was really hard to brute force in the 1970's, when  DES was invented, but not difficult now, with large memories and fast  processors (especially purpose- built crackers).
The compromise (since there are a lot of DES hardware encryption tools  available) was to use 3 separate 56 bit keys and apply them to the  message (encrypt using key1](decrypt using key2) (encrypt using key  3). This is slow because it is applying the DES algorithm (or its  reverse) three times, but it has an effective key length of 112 bits  (even though there are 168 key bits) because of a meet in the middle  attack against changed algorithms.
  So 3DES is used because it is as secure or securer then any other  algorithm of 112 bits and has been efficiently implemented in hardware  for industrial use. It is slower than algorithms designed for the  longer key length like AES (which was also designed so that it can be  implemented in hardware fairly readily).
It is probably better to use as few algorithms as possible and to  extensively apply cryptanalysis to those few to ensure their  reliability. Some algorithms seem to have been mandated by some  governments because they may be flawed but 3DES and AES256 etc. are  mandated for U.S. government official use, the the NSA must think  there are secure from cryptanalysis by foreign governments.  YOu are  far more likely  to have your secret message cracked by flaws in the  operating system at either end than by breaking of the actual cypher  text. Cypher weaknesses are about the bottom of ant weakness in

Agreed. A common version of 3DES uses only two keys (E1->D2-E1), with  the same effective key length (112)
But meet in the middle problems explain why there is no 2DES, since  ability to have Rainbow tables for 56 bits allow relatively easy  cracking of  second  part of chain.
