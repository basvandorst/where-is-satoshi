large corporations in the US and a significant portion of small to
medium size companies (most large European companies have EDI
initiatives too). XML is making a little headway but EDI is still by far
the most prevalent form of document exchange both in terms of number of
transactions exchanged and sheer byte size.

You'd be too small, but you can bet that nearly everything you buy in a
store from a large retailer was ordered, delivered and invoiced via EDI.
If the manufacturer wants the sale data from the cash register they can
get it - via EDI. The new moves in EDI (certainly in the US) are now
toward using the internet as the delivery mechanism for such
transactions - previously private networks were used - using S/MIME for
the security services. PGP/MIME is permitted by the EDI-INT spec but
S/MIME appears to be the preferred option.
