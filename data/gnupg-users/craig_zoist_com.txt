How do I change the default install dir for GnuPG?
Thank You.

I am having my site hosted on pair.com.
I have a Webmaster account which gives me access to Telnet & to
install stuff.
Is there any sort of way to install it ONLY in my home directory?
They don't have GNUPG installed on their system.
Is there any precompiled files for the FreeBSD/Unix platform?
Please guide me through it. I am pulling my hair out!
Thanks a lot.
