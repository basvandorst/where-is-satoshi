Which version of GPA are you using? Old versions (before 0.6.0) can't
sign keys with recent GnuPG versions.
Yes, that's what happens with 0.4.x, IIRC.

That version won't work with any gpg version after 1.0.6. You should
upgrade to at least 0.6.1, and probably 0.7.0.
If you don't want to compile from source, Google shows several 0.6.1
rpms available. Maybe one of those will work?

Good idea. I haven't tried to compile GPA under cygwin.
Which GTK+ version are you trying to install? A unix one will probably
fail without the X libs. Maybe the one from (for mingw) will compile under cygwin.
So far no GPA after 0.5 has been compiled for Windows that I know of.
The most critical element is GPGME, which just doesn't compile on
Windows. Maybe it will on cygwin, although a quick attempt to do it
failed with lots of undefined references (to gpgme's own functions!).
Maybe someone with more cygwin experience will get around that.
If you can get GTK and GPGME running on the same environment, GPA
should compile and run fine. Just let me know if it doesn't.

The complete dependencies for GPA 0.7.0, as far as I'm aware, are:
GTK+ 2.2.0 Gpgme 0.4.3, which in turn depends on:
libgpg-error 0.5
gnupg 1.2.2 (1.2.3 is highly recommended due to speed reasons).
Actually, the dependency on GTK+ 2.2 instead of 2.0 is accidental, and
due to my inadvertedly using two functions new to it (These are part
of the tree interface: gtk_tree_selection_count_selected_rows and
gtk_tree_selection_get_selected_rows). Patches to get rid of those
calls would be welcome.
The others are available from gnupg.org. During the last year, GPA and
GPGME development have gone very closely, with quite a few bugs in
GPGME unearthed by testing in GPA. So as a rule, you can expect that
each release of GPA will depend on the latest GPGME, at least until
one of them reaches 1.0.
I'm pretty sure GPA 0.7.0 compiles on all the latest GNU/Linux
distributions (if you compile the GnuPG related packages along with
it). If I find the time to remove the GTK+ 2.2 requirement, it should
work on any reasonably decent one.

Very good.
This has been planned for a long time. I'll see what can be done about
it for the next release.
