@_subject: How to have 2 seperate keyrings on a server 
Hash: SHA1
just a question...
maybe i'm overlooking something
what is the point of having 2 keyrings if both are readable by the same
and if you have different users running the two processes, then just
edit the corresponging ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf files to point to the
corresponding keyrings
(of course i could be overlooking somethin...)

@_subject: problems signing keys 
i have a problem signing keys...
while i have no problems signing and en-/decrypting files i have a
problem when signing keys, gnupg complains about not finding the private
gpg: secret key parts are not available
gpg: signing failed: general error
any hints what's going wrong?

@_subject: gpg smartcard troubles 
currently i had to switch from my notebook to my workstation and i now
have a problem:
while my openpgp smartcard works with gpg-agent (ssh auth works), i'm
unable to decrypt files encrypted for the encryption subkey or signing
with the sign subkey, though they are listed when i do a "gpg
--edit-key" as beeing subkeys...
any ideas what's going wrong or how i can tell gpg where to find the
secret subkeys?

@_subject: OpenPGP card stopped working 
i don't know if it is changed..but last time i looked it did set the
permission through a shell script instead of doing it directly in the
rules file, that gave me trouble (e.g. timing issues) on some machines.
i rewrote the rules file to do it directly and it know works flawlessly
on instant on all machines i tried it on.
you can find my modified gnupg-ccid.rules at:
(you won't need the shellscript anymore when using it)
