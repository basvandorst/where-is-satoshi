@_subject: using java frontend running gpg on w2k 
hi all,
im currently working on a little frontend on w2k for gpg, and i found a
problem when i was using the gen-key command, im using a java app that calls
gpg using the runtime process, and the dos window pops up and asks the
questions for gen-key, like name and passwords...etc...but when it goes to
make the keys, it hangs there,
any ideas? it works fine if i go from cmd and do it, but when i run it
though the java app then run it, it hangs

@_subject: file extension, gnupgp on Win 
hi, im new to this and right now, im still messing around with the basic
signing, encryption and decryption of the program, i was wondering if it is
designed that the file extension is lost after the decryption, because the
thing i have tried is this,
encrypt file test.zip--->test.gpg then i decrypt it, test.gpg --->test
it doesnt have an extension anymore, plz advise, thanks

============================== START ==============================
sorry to bother everyone, i have found a solution to this prob and it hought
this would be the best way to get this out to the few like me that didnt
know it
i'd like to thank 'Alexandros Papadopoulos' and Michael Gold for their help
the solution is when encrypting the file, using the -o option, add the
extension .gpg manually
so if my file is file.xyz then i would go
gpg -e -r name -o file.xyz.gpg file.xyz
then we will get file.xyz.gpg then decrypt will cut off the .gpg and be left
with original file
i understand that this is alrdy done in linux, i guess unix as well, but i
think the default for windows is not, thats why i had this problem...so i
guess this would really be more of a windows issue
