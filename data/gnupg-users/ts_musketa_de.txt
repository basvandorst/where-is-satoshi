@_subject: decrypting large files failes 
I get the following error while trying to decrypt a file (using gnupg 1.4.0 on Win2k):
     gpg: packet(6) with unknown version 207
     gpg: Warnung: Verschl\x81sselte Botschaft ist manipuliert worden!
     gpg: packet(1) with unknown version 22
The file size is 4.5 GB. The first part (with some gpg files only 500 MB, with others 2 GB) is decrypted correctly.
Decrypting smaller files works fine.
Is there a size limit for creating gpg files?
