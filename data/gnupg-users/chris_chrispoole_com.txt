@_subject: How secure asymmetric encryption to yourself? 
I am using GnuPG to encrypt a plain text file of my passwords.
How secure is it to use my own public key as the encryption method  (rather than symmetric), given that the password file is stored on the  same drive as my public and private keys?

Yes, this is correct, and what I thought would be the answer.
I was just concerned that an attacker (say, a thief that steals my  laptop), would have both my secret key and something encrypted with  that secret key.
I wasn't sure if this would somehow reduce the effectiveness of the  encryption (even though I use a good passphrase).

Thanks for the reply.
I now feel a little safer doing what I'm doing :)
Yes, I wrote some quick scripts to move the encrypted file to a tmpfs  are (i.e., stored in RAM), then unencrypted. So the actual passwords  should be in RAM only, not on disk. I then remove with secure rm, just  I have looked for free software password managers (that are ideally  cross platform as I use Mac OS X as well as Linux), but can't find one  that is used enough for me to think it safe. Some of them just get in  my way too; I store my passwords as a CSV file, so it's easy to import  to a new password manager too if I want to try something new.

Yes I have used this before; I may give it another go.

@_subject: SHA1 issues, generic advice for average user? 
I don't use GPG all that much, but am a little concerned with the recent
SHA1 collision news.
I wonder if someone could clarify some things for me, please:
1) Is this just an issue with signatures, or does it impact the encryption
2) I don't want to lose my current keys, as I have many files that I have
encrypted. Will changing the default hash with the setpref command in the
edit menu (to something like SHA512) help, at all?
Essentially, should an average user of GPG be doing anything? If, after
people have thought about this issue and better hashes are recommended, will
that require current keys to be discarded?
(My key is 1024D with 4096g subkey, if that makes any difference.)
