@_subject: Problem with gpg under windows 
Hi all!
I've a problem with following key. I tried to use this one with gpg
under windows, but it causes a crash when trying to encrypt to it
(other keys work quite good). This there any problem because of the
two sub-keys? I've tried under GNU/Linux and every thing works fine.

Ah, I'm using GnuPG 1.2.4 :-)
Thanks if anyone can help or tell me if this is a known problem.
