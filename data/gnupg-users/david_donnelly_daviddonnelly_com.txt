@_subject: GPG Encryption on Raspberry Pi 4 using custom e-mail address failure 
Good Day,
  This very novice would appreciate some help.
  My situation:
I have several Raspberry Pi 4 computers running the Raspberry Operating
System (Raspbian GNU/Linux [buster], Version ID=10) at my home.  I need each
of them to send me an email notification when certain functions are
I have gpg version 2.2.12-1+rpi1+deb10u1 installed.
To this end, I have configured the mail system called msmtp on each
Raspberry Pi 4 computer.  I can send email to my myself via my Gmail and
david.donnelly.com (IONOS.COM) accounts manually and interactively using
msmtp on each of the Raspberry Pi 4 computers.
However, following good internet security policies, I tried to encrypt my
email account passwords using GPG (Gnu PG:   These
encrypted passwords are to be stored in a file on each Raspberry Pi4
Now, first off, this encryption process worked fine for my Gmail Account.  I
was able to run the following command: gpg --encrypt -o .msmtp-gmail.gpg -r donnellydw at gmail.com
  -
The password provided was encrypted with no problems and the associated file
was created.
However,  when I try to run the same command using my david.donnelly.com
(IONOS.COM) email account:
gpg --encrypt -o .msmtp-ionos.gpg -r david.donnelly at daviddonnelly.com
  -
gpg --encrypt -o .msmtp-ionos.gpg -r 2d at daviddonnelly.com
  -
I get the following three errors:
gpg: error retrieving 'david.donnelly at daviddonnelly.com' via WKD: Network
gpg: david.donnelly at daviddonnelly.com
 : skipped: Network error
gpg: [stdin]: encryption failed: Network error
If I substitute and use my 2d at daviddonnelly.com
  email address, I get the same three errors:
gpg: error retrieving '2d at daviddonnelly.com' via WKD: Network error
gpg: 2d at daviddonnelly.com  : skipped: Network
gpg: [stdin]: encryption failed: Network error
I then reran the encryption command using my Gmail address:
gpg --encrypt -o .msmtp-gmail.gpg -r donnellydw at gmail.com
  -
and encryption and file creation was successful.
At face value, I have internet access, my network is working, so I have
concluded something is causing a problem in the gpg program with
resolving/determining/? how to translate my IONOS.COM custom e-mail address:
david.donnelly at daviddonnelly.com or 2d at daviddonnelly.com   vice the GPG program
fully understanding how to handle the "gmail.com" address.
Your help in this matter is greatly appreciated,
