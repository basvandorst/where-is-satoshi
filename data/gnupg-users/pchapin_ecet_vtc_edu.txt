@_subject: Can't create output file on Win2k? 
I just downloaded the GPG v1.2.1 Windows binary and installed it on my
Win2k system. The key related commands seem to work. However, when I try
to encrypt a file it seems to be unable to create the output file. In
particular, if I do:
I'm asked for a passphrase twice and then the program hangs. CPU
utilization is zero percent and there is no disk activity. It appears to
hang forever. No output file is made. I eventually have to ^C to terminate
the process. I get the same effect when I do:
I did not observe this effect with GPG v1.0.6. Also the commands I'm using
appear to work fine on a Unix system so it must be related to my Windows
environment. I have searched through the archive but found no other
reference to this problem. Any ideas?
P.S. I am using the "-1" version of the distribution.

I believe you want the --cipher-algo option. It requires a cipher name.
Use "gpg --version" to see the list of supported names. I'm not sure if
the list is case sensitive or not but, for example, you might do
I believe this option can also be used to define the symmetric cipher used
in conjunction with public key operations.
The public key algorithm used depends on the type of key used and you can
select that when the key is generated. I haven't played with that much so
I'm not so sure how to get, for example, RSA.

Yesterday I had a problem with gpg on Windows not creating an output file
and just hanging instead (see copy of my posting below). I have since
rebooted the machine for other, unrelated reasons. I notice that gpg now
appears to work. I love Windows.
