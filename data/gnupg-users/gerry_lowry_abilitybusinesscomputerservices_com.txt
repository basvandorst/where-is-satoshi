AFAIK you can publish your key to it will be synchronized AFAIK;  you will need to confirm every so often
that your key is valid so PGP do not drop it.
You can publish to other keyservers and your public key
will not find its way to the PGP Global Directory
 ( AFAIK.
I've been advised to avoid MIT's keyserver because apparently
it's not well maintained.  (I think it was MIT, could be some other server).
Other members of this mailing list can give you much better advice.
Also check Google for sources like
 remember that anybody can contribute to wikipedia articles.
Your question about finding keys:
  GnuPG has a find option ... point it at a keyserver to retrieve.
You can use ID, e-mail address, and possibly other
data to retrieve the key(s) you require.  Again, other
 members of this mailing list can give you much better advice.

even if the rumours are true that "the government" may have such an ability, we'd never know.
If you still know your passphrase, and have not done so, create a revocation certificate.
Keep both the revocation certificate and your passphrase in a secure and secret (to you)
place (but remember where you put them).
Anyone who has your passphrase and your private key can decrypt
things encrypted for you.  Anyone who has your revocation certificate
can revoke your key.

I'm just guessing but I doubt you can do that;
I think you need to generate new keys and
revoke your old keys.  Keys are cast to be
impregnable which is why I suspect that the keys
are not updateable.  You can AFAIK add
and change information; e.g., add a picture
but I would be surprised if you can actually
tamper with the actual generated keys.

It sounds like gpg.exe is not in your path.
you can get around this by adding the directory where gpg.exe exists
or by using a fully qualified path.  I prefer the latter.
Example:      assume I've installed GnuPG to c:\topsecret\spytools  (btw, I have not)
Open a Windows command prompt, a.k.a. a "DOS window".
[note:  before you get in too deep, you might want to read a book like
 "PGP & GPG", Michael W. Lucas.  It's not perfect but it got me restarted.
  No Starch Press, 2006.  Try your local library.]
[if your GnuPG folder is not in your path, then, in the following, type, for example,
      >c:\topsecret\spytools\gpg
instead of just
      >gpg
At your Command prompt, usually ">", type commands like these:
       >gpg --gen-key                    [creates a GnuPG keypair]
[the following is a one line command to generate a revocation certificate in case you ever need it]

@_subject: multiple e-mail addresses:  what are the solutions? 
in my first attempts at PGP, I had only one e-mail at time, occasionally
two or three.
Now I have many different e-mail addresses that I use on a regular basis
for various purposes, none of them illegal.  Some web sites force users
to have addresses like    me at theirdomain.com   for reasons such as
attempting to control spam.
I have a gmail account for communication with my IPP if my site is down.
If my IPP is also down, I'm out of luck.
I have an e-mail address from a customer who prefers that his
customers contact me via gerry at hiscompany.com.
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera
Please note:  I'm for all intents and purposes new to PGP/GPG.
It seems that for any e-mail address that I have, I need a key pair that
corresponds to each e-mail address.
Is there a better strategy?

@_author: gerry_lowry (alliston ontario canada 
@_subject: multiple e-mail addresses:  what are the solutions? 
Thank you John and David.
John Clizbe has suggested a "key with multiple email addresses (userIDs) per identity/personae"
as one strategy.  David Shaw has mentioned a strategy of separate keys for different purposes.
My question:  if I go with separate keys, as in
      e-mail_address_1          public_key_1        private_key_1
      e-mail_address_2          public_key_2        private_key_2
      e-mail_address_3          public_key_3        private_key_3
then, is it permissible to have
all of my public keys together on the same pubring.gpg file and
 all of my private keys together on the same secring.gpg file?
is it even architecturally possible to have
all of my public keys together on the same pubring.gpg file and
all of my private keys together on the same secring.gpg file?
Also, if it is possible, what are the advantages and the disadvantages?
Thank you.

@_subject: "Please select what kind of key you want" 
Michael W. Lucas on page 73 in Chapter 4 of "PGP & GPG:  Email for the Practical Paranoid",
No Starch Press, (c) 2006, shows the following choices for
 "Please select what kind of key you want":
   (1) DSA and Elgamal (default)
   (2) DSA (sign only)
   (5) RSA (sign only)
Michael recommends choosing "5" which turns out to be a disadvantage
that one might not discover until the first time that she/he attempts to
encrypt something.
AFAIK, other people can still encrypt for the user who has selected "5"
above.  And the user can decrypt whatever she/he receives.
I do not recall Michael discussing the solution to the problems
caused by selecting just "(5) RSA (sign only)", although, since his
book is written for a beginner audience, I do think he should
have addressed this problem.  Nevertheless, I found his book
still quite helpful.
Especially because of my experience mentioned above, I tend to pay attention
to the text that follows  "Please select what kind of key you want".
The Windows' version that I used matches Michael's text:
          >gpg --gen-key
           gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.9; Copyright (C) 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
           Please select what kind of key you want:
              (1) DSA and Elgamal (default)
              (2) DSA (sign only)
              (5) RSA (sign only)
              (2) DSA (sign only)
              (4) Elgamal (encrypt only)
              (5) RSA (sign only)
              (6) RSA (encrypt only)
     ----------------------------------  where's (3)
              (3) ??????????????
Why is there no "(3)" in the above two lists [gen-key list, addkey list]?
Why are choices "(4) Elgamal (encrypt only)" and "(6) RSA (encrypt only)"
 not present in the "gen-key" list?
Why is choices "(1) DSA and Elgamal (default)" not present in the "addkey" list?
============    ==============
shows different choices for "gpg --gen-key":
   (1) DSA and ElGamal (default)
   (2) DSA (sign only)
   (4) ElGamal (sign and encrypt)
   (5) RSA (sign only)
Exploring further "Please select what kind of key you want" via Google,
I get the impression that there's potentially a standard that might read something like:
     position (1) should always be __________;
     position (2) should always be __________;
     position (3) should always be __________; et cetera
and for any position, you can offer nothing, sign only, encrypt only, or sign and encrypt together.
Is that the case with regards to developer guidelines?
Also, I'm guessing that although a developer might opt out of creating a key of type X,
regardless, the developer must presumably support a complete set of encryption/decryption
choices for the purpose of processing public and private keys properly.  Is this the case?
Thank you.

How to use the Apple Product Security PGP Key

F.Y.I.:  I've not noticed anything similar from Microsoft and other software companies.
Most seem to be happy with MD5 and SHA1 for files and nothing else.
Also, Apple even provides links to PGP Corporation and GnuPG plus its key and key ID.        This is our PGP key which is valid until May 15, 2010
       Key ID: 0x8A648901 Key Type: RSA Expires: 5/15/10 Key Size: 2048/2048
       Fingerprint: 39EC C76A 3D62 7062 C321 10B2 7928 75E8 8A64 8901
       UserID: Apple Product Security This from Apple is like an endorsement of PGP/GPG technology.
So few people use PGP/GPG technology openly.
The Internet took off when Microsoft, for better or worse, included and promoted
Internet Explorer in Windows 95, thus beginning the so called browser wars.
I would be surprised and also happy to see Microsoft promote PGP/GPG technology.
I do not actually expect that to happen.  If it did, it would be good if Microsoft could
stimulate PGP/GPG technology with more user friendliness since at the moment
there's much to learn to understand and begin using PGP/GPG technology.

@_subject: How secure asymmetric encryption to yourself? 
a paranoid's answer to your question:
your passphrase is also required ... so my best guess is that you are more or less safe;
others on this list would know better than myself.
Here's the paranoid part:  if your system became compromised with a keylogger,
                                       you could be vunerable to having your passphrase stolen.
More paranoia:  when you're viewing your file as plain text which you must do
                         to read its contents (unless you're superhuman), your text
                         is at least temporarilly vunerable.
a paranoid's solution:  have a second computer, even a small pocket something
                                 or other that supports PGP/GPG technology and also
                                 is NEVER connected to the rest of the connected world;
                                 keep your secured information on the second computer only;
                                 external backups excluded (you can never have too much
                                 backup; some backup is better than none).

I'm curious what "more usable ways" there are that Sven and others
can recommend.
I'm also unsure what Sven apparently means by "more usable"?
(While they need to be decrypted, one would only occasionally
  need to decrypt them because for most of the time, until forgotten, those
  passwords that one uses frequently reside in one's biological memory.)
I guess one downside of the GnuPG file is that if one
loses her/his private key or forgets her/his passphrase,
then the passwords in the GnuPG file will be secure forever
or at least until she/he acquires her/his quantum computer in the future.

Robert, yes, literacy is important, too.  Your counter proposition also has validity.
I point out, however, that by the time one is looking at
   Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) DSA and Elgamal (default)
   (2) DSA (sign only)
   (5) RSA (sign only)
   (h) help on the above choices
she/he has likely already proceeded far enough along to have achieved
some degree of literacy.  Having reached that point, with regards
to understanding PGP/GPG technology, she/he may still be a novice.
Of course, had Michael W. Lucas been a bit clearer in his book,
the "(h) help on the above choices" might not have been of benefit to myself.
OTOH, it would nevertheless benefit many of those beginners who might not
 be aware of MWL's book and who might not have access to anything else written
for novices.  One problem is that many writers write for an audience
that has already achieved domain erudition.  Fortunately, for the
rest of us, there are authors of "______ for Dummies", et cetera.
(where ______ represents some subject of interest to the reader).
So, Robert, I restate my proposition as
         The easier it is for informed, literate beginners to understand
         the need for PGP/GPG technology, and the easier it is for
         them to become aware of the existence of PGP/GPG technology,
         the faster the adoption of PGP/GPG technology
         into broad general use by the public will likely occur.
P.S.:  I finished high school in 1965 and went straight into working.
         In 1967, I became a programmer.  Long before "user friendliness"
         was a broadly known and often abused concept, I was writing
         software that truly qualified as "user friendly".

                      (is it because --gen-key was used instead of --edit-key?)
Question # 4:  by offline, do you mean not on a keyserver?
                      (versus not on your local hard disk?)
Thank you.

Hi GnuPG-Users,
I have been testing the FSFE GnuPG smartcard in the past few days and I find it really cool! However, I have some more questions regarding the card.
I have encrypted all of my linux partitions with LUKS and it works really great. Next, I would like to integrate the GnuPG card into the boot process in order to encrypt or to provide the key file. I found a Howto in the ubuntu wiki:  However, in this HowTo, they use a MultiFlex Smartcard and load the key file on the card. In the startup process, the keyfile is read out and sent to LUKS. This step is really simple but how can this work with the gnupg smartcard? I think it is not a problem to decrypt the key file in the startup process, isn't it!? Is it possible to access the card reader (omnikey 4040) and the smartcard via gpg from the initrd ram disk? Has anyone ever tried it in a similar way or are there any alternatives? Finally, is there a HowTo?
I would be very happy for any kind of information.

I do hope I was not perceived as being rude.  I was not intending to be rude.

Yes, appalled but not surprised.  Given the stress level of most of us,
I'm not surprised that some people sometimes react in unkind ways.
Thank you, Robert, for reminding us to be patient and understanding.

This is not directed at any one individual;
also, other mailing lists have the same problem imho.
Ideally, (my ideal), the generic "one" would simply address e-mails to gnupg-users at gnupg.org as
(a)    To:  gnupg-users at gnupg.org
nothing more, nothing less.
Such an addressing scheme makes it easy to filter and order gnupg-users at gnupg.org e-mails.
Instead, there's substantial variation, examples:
(b)   To: gnupg-users at gnupg.org
      Cc: x at y.tld
(c)   To: x at y.tld
      Cc: gnupg-users at gnupg.org
(d)   To:       Cc: gnupg-users at gnupg.org
(e)   To: x at y.tld, gnupg-users at gnupg.org
(f)   To: gnupg-users at gnupg.org, x at y.tld
(b) and (f) are not such a problem for filtering and/or ordering
because they are similar to (a).
(c), (d), and (e) do not filter/order well.
(d) is the worst form imho because e-mails without a To: component
are the most likely to end up in one's spam folder; in some cases,
depending on one's isp, such e-mails might not even be delivered
to one's client pc, i.e., they might be rejected at some mail
server's gateway.
FWIW, e-mail does not really have a To:, Cc:, or Bcc: field;
all three are embellishments added by the e-mail client software.
Behind the scenes, To:, Cc:, and Bcc: are ALL simply RCPT-TO.
Please, and thank you.

Hello Remco and Jerome, FWIW, with Microsoft Outlook Express under WinXP, to view your responses, I must explicitly open (Remco's 666 byte/Jerome's 549
byte) attached body documents in an editor;
alternately, I can display the message properties:
   Alt+Enter    ==> display properties
   Ctrl+Tab     ==> move to the details page
   Alt+M        ==> show message source
   Alt+Space, x ==> maximize
   Page Down    ==> to begin viewing your actual reply.
With Microsoft Outlook 2010, you messages appear more easily BUT are also shown as attachments.
Thank you both for replying:
Remco  "Or filter on the List-Id header perhaps. That one is always set when you         receive mail from the mail list."
{GL} this would work, BUT I already have very many filters for other purposes, plus, if others would address messages as per my
suggestion, the filter would be unnecessary; likely many users have no idea as to how to set a filter.
Remco  "(Also, apply such a filter then before any spam blocking on empty To: lines etc.)"
{GL}  Remco, you've missed my point ... spam blocking also occurs for many individuals at or before your incoming e-mail ever gets
downloaded to their computer.
Jerome  "FWIW, (MIME) e-mail does really have a To: and a Cc: field. It also has
         an implied Bcc: field (not on To: or Cc:). Behind the scenes, To:, Cc:,
         and Bcc: are ALL simply FIELDS."
{GL}  is that not what, for all intents and purposes, i wrote?
      > FWIW, e-mail does not really have a To:, Cc:, or Bcc: field;
      > all three are embellishments added by the e-mail client software.
      > Behind the scenes, To:, Cc:, and Bcc: are ALL simply RCPT-TO.
      if the sender's e-mail client did not add the FIELDS, the recipient would see NOTHING for To:, Cc:, Bcc.
      if the sender is NOT using an e-mail client (i.e., sending manually),
      she/he would
         (a) type RCPT-TO xxxxx
      for each intended recipient.  E-mail client software also must insert RCPT-TO.
      She/he could add the FIELDS to the beginning of the message body;
      FIELDS do not in the raw data exist outside of the message body.

Hi Peter (Lebbing)
Depending on one's point of view, the e-mail client UI is either "behind the scenes"
or "the scene".
My PoV is that everything that is necessary to display the e-mail to my vision, is "behind the scenes".	
That includes all activity from start to end, including what the e-mail client does to extract
raw text (headers/body) and make it look pretty to my eyes.  The UI is "the scene" imho.
Peter, remember please, most end users are unlikely to have your in depth appreciation
of the RFC universe.
OTOH, most end users can click on the (date received/From/Subject/To/et cetera) columns
to easily, efficiently, and quickly rearrange their inbox in a new order.
Compare for example the current "Why hashed ..." thread ...
       From             To
       Doug Barton      Robert J. Hansen
       Jerome Baum      Doug Barton
       Doug Barton      Jerome Baum
FWIW, I'm a masochist ... my inbox has several thousand recent messages.
If the above messages were scattered through my inbox, but looked like this:
       From             To
       Doug Barton      gnupg-users at gnupg.org
       Jerome Baum      gnupg-users at gnupg.org
       Doug Barton      gnupg-users at gnupg.org
I could easily pull them, as well as other gnupg-users at gnupg.org, together
simply by clicking on the "To:" column header.
Gerry P.S.:  FWIW, gnupg-users at gnupg.org is a "list", not zig zag exchanges
       among individuals.

Dear Michael (Yetto),
M.A.Y.:  "It isn't for the greater good if the onus to please the few (or the one) is placed on the many."
Michael, if the few care more about being above "the many", than the needs of "the many",
         does that not lead to disparity?  "The many" are not all as knowledgeable
         as the Yettos of this world ... "the many" get excluded technologically;
         technologically disparity is akin to economic disparity ... if Warren Buffet
         can reach out to "the rich", then the techie~~astute can reach out to the
         techie~~challenged.
Henri David Thoreau, paraphrased:  "if one person is more right that her/his neighbours,
then that person constitutes a majority of one".

AFAIK, there is no such thing as a "standard" signature AFAIK.
if there were, on would expect to find it more consistently here gnupg-users at gnupg.org.
M.A.Y.: "standard sig delimiter (newline dash dash space newline)."
I'm assuming that by sig, you mean "signature" and not tagline.  The following are recent
examples of "non-standard" signatures:
