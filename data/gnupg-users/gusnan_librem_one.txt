@_subject: pinentry-gtk-2 dialog doesn't appear before getting input 
I have a problem on Debian unstable (running in Virtualbox), running the
Xfce desktop - I have my gpg key on a card (a Librem key, which basically is a
Nitrokey) when using pinentry to enter the card password, I first have
to press my mouse on the screen (or a key on my keyboard) to make the
password dialog appear.
For example: gpg --clearsign [somefile]
prints gpg: using [long key fingerprint] as default secret key for signing
and the librem key light starts flashing. After a short time it
stops flashing, and does nothing. What it actually does is waiting for
me to start typing, or pressing the mouse button - as soon as I do this
the dialog appears. Before this I can only guess if it is ready for my
to enter the passphrase, or still doing something non-visible. And if I
do nothing, it of course times out after a while.
This is when using pinentry-gtk-2.
Is there any way to make the dialog appear at once, when it is ready to
take my passphrase entry, or some workaround of any kind?
Is this a known bug?
I have found  , but that seems to be a bit

Thanks - that indeed runs just fine, and without the problems I
You are right - I have the settings xfwm4/raise_with_any_button (disabled)
xfwm4/raise_on_focus (disabled)
but xfwm4/raise_on_click enabled in xfce4-settings-editor - this to be
able to scroll windows without focusing them.
It would be very nice if pinentry could ignore these settings and
always focus the entry window to avoid the problem I have.

Changing to pinentry-gtk3 also removes the problem, and that is an
acceptable solution for me, so I have no hurry in getting fixes to the
gtk-2 version.

You are right of course, I mean gnome3 and not gtk3.
