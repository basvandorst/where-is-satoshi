@_subject: Generating Keys by Existing 
Hello together!
Is it possible to merge some public keys to one?
Or maybe one after another?
I would like to have one key for my friends, so i can post a message to
them without selecting everyones key.
I searched for it in the hole internet but didn't found anything.
Thanks for help
