Good job!!
I found same problem when I did some test of "search" function of my
key server, (See   My program never return
duplicate keyid because I'm afraid of the fraud key. I know that this
specificity has a potential of Denial of Service attack.
Please give me some idea what keyserver should behave about it.

1) The thing that comes to mind immediately for me is that you should
allow for a 64-bit key-ID search.
2) The public key servers should do little more than accept, store,
and report data that it contains. Preventing the display of keys with
duplicate IDs steps over that line a bit too much for me.
David Shaw:
3) If a duplicated keyid is requested from the current HKP and NAI
LDAP keyservers, *all* matching keys are returned.  This is the
correct behavior, as it lets the receiving program and the user decide
which (if any) of the returned keys is the right one.
1) 64-bit KeyID will be supported. It's easy and no problem in server. But I'm wondering how PGP/GPG user know their own 64-bit KeyID.
2) HKP protocol based HTTP/1.0 is not define the waring status for the
found duplicate key. We should define some specifications for
duplicate keys.  This specification is not only problem of public key
server(s) but also problem of OpenPGP client(s) a.k.a PGP and GPG.
3) I think "all matching keys are returned" solution is not a perfect
idea. But I can support it easly for my public key server.  I'd like
to know how about this solution for PGP or GPG.

I'd like to return only "Found duplicate keys" status to client. If
keyserver returns all of duplicate key contents to client, it can be
used another DoS attack.
Then, user can select two thing which are retrieve by 64-bit keyid or
via Web interface.
User may access an exact key via Web interface with database OID
number (this numbers are not appeared to user) to check key contents
and get it by their own risk.
Fyi:  prepare Kaz's "pgpdump" interface to see
internal of key contents.

Step 0: If you use 32bit keyid, move Step 1. If 64bit keyid, move  Step 1: If you try to get a key by 32bit keyid but found duplicate keys,
 Step 2: If you try to get a key by 64bit keyid but found duplicate
         keys, move Step 3 or Step 4 which you wish.
         If 32bit duplicate keyid was generated by accidentally,  Step 3: Use Web interface and check a list of keyids combined
         fingerprints. Select one key and database will return actual
         key (using database OID). Users must be patients. So, some
         people like me move to Step 4.
 Step 4: Ask an actual public key for the key owner or get an public
         key from owner's web page.
Yes, I know it. Please remember that the concept of "Web of Trust"
doesn't need any keyserver nor certificate authority. "No keyserver"
is default.

I tried to send my e-mail to dshaw from my two mail
addresses, hironobu and hironobu but all of my
e-mails were rejected.
Please let me know another your e-mail address which I can send one.
And I'm sorry for ML readers.
Best Regards,

Retrieving by 64bit key ID was done. It is available via Web interface
from  openpksd's database has 32bit<->64bit key mapping table.
It is easy to support 128 bit and 160 bit keyID. Long key reduces the
possibility of collision but I'm wondering that handing cost of
128/160 bit key ID is suitable cost for keyserver.

Some attacks are effective not only user client but also keyserver.
If keyserver found duplicate key then return "Found duplicate
key". It's OK. It's little cost.  If keyserver found duplicate key
then return all of key contents.  It is a possibility of DoS not only
user client but also keyserver. v3 is problem but we have to support.
