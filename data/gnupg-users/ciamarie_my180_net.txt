@_subject: decrypt-file updates trustdb? 
To make a long story short, check the time on your desktop
and your /etc/default/rcS file to see if an update changed the UTC= from no to
I'm not sure what distro you're running, and this may not be related to your
issue. However I saw a similar error when I was updating Debian squeeze in a
VM, on a Debian wheezy host. It turns out there was a recent update that made
some changes to the /etc/default/rcS file and made this change:
- UTC=no
+ UTC=yes
In other words, I had UTC=no and it changed it back to the default of yes,
After seeing it wanted to make that change in wheezy which I told it to allow,
since there were other changes to the file that may have been important, I
just went in afterward and changed UTC= back to no.
In my squeeze vm however, it didn't bother to tell me it was making the
change, but when I saw the error about time differences on the keyring, I
looked at the time on the desktop and saw it was off, checked
the /etc/default/rcS file and saw it had UTC set to yes, so I changed it
back to no and now the desktop time is correct and no keyring time errors when
I'm updating.
