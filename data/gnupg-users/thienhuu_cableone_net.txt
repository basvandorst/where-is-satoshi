@_subject: viewing encrypted message in pine 
Hash: SHA1
I've got pine & gnupg working to the point
where I can sign, encrypt or both, sending
messages, but when I get a message back
from someone on my keyring, or if I try
to view an encrypted message I sent which
did the encrypt to self routine, I can't
figure out how to view it. I've read the
man pages & checked the send & receive
settings & mine are exactly the same.
I've searched gnupg docs, did searches
on google, but so far no luck. Read the
examples & docs that install with the
programs too, but so far, no luck. Hope
someone understands what I'm trying to
ask. I also tried changing ISO-8859-1
to ascii settings, thinking maybe the
program didn't like the character set
of the fonts I was using. Thanks for
any & all help I can get on this. Not
trying to get a free ride, just a push
in the right direction, like maybe some
good links that have a variety of good

@_subject: viewing encrypted message in pine 
I have my .pinerc setup basically the same
way, except that where I read how to do it,
they use BEGINNING instead of LEADING.
Regardless, I've tried it both ways since
reading other examples & it still didn't work.
And no, I couldn't decrypt from the command
line. It says that the secret key couldn't be
found. This happens both when trying to read
a message I've written & has been encrypted
to me, & with messages from the one other
user whose public key I've imported. Also set
the trust on it to full. This problem is going
on on my FreeBSD 4.5 system. There were
no problems when I built the port, & it will
sign or sign/encrypt fine. I stayed up almost
all one night reading everything I could find
on the matter before coming to this mailing
list, so I just want everyone to know I'm not
looking for a "fix it for me". :-) Learned that
early on in the unix community. Thanks for
your answer & if you can figure out maybe
what I'm doing wrong. I really don't think
it's the system, probably just something I
have set wrong or am doing wrong.

Have you set up a display-filter ?
One of the lines in my .pinerc reads:
   display-filters=3D_LEADING("-----BEGIN PGP ")_ /usr/local/bin/gpg =
, and it processes everything quite nicely.
Can you decrypt on the command line ok in that OS?  It's not a problem
with having ported your secret key from Windows to a unix, is it?  (I
think that one's in the FAQs, but you need to set your passphrase to be
an empty string whilst you port it)

Hash: SHA1
Thanks to Owen who tried to help when
I couldn't get the decrypt to work in
pine, & thanks to R.Bradley Tilley who
had responded to someone else's question
about moving gpg files to new machine.
Had used the old users files to shorten
the setup time for new users, chown right
on the files but not chmod. That solved
the problem. Can decrypt both in pine
auto & manually on command line now.
No more errror messages. Thanks very

@_subject: secret key not definded 
Hash: SHA1
Wrote to the list & received help
on this system recently. Fixed
errors by chmoding the proper files
in the .gnupg dir. Now I've scp'd
all my files over to a laptop with
same setup, that is, gnupg & pine
& pgp4pine installed. Did chmod
once again on the same files/dirs
but, when trying to encrypt to the
only other user I've exchanged keys
with with just as before on desktop,
can only sign & not encrypt. Shows
error as:
Warning! It appears that you don't
have a secret key defined!
I've checked & rechecked everything
& it all appears to be identical on
both machines. Read the guides on
the web & local docs, & still don't
seem to be able to come up with a
fix. Can someone just point me in
the right direction (maybe away
from the puter for awhile )?

@_subject: pgp4pine/gpg problems 
Hash: SHA1
straight out of install, both users
on both the laptop & the desktop had
no problems with gpg or pgp4pine.
now, when either user tries to send
a message to the other, the message
says that there isn't a secret key
defined. i've read the man pages on
the subject repeatedly, tried putting
in the senders email address in the
profiles section of .pgp4pinerc, &
read everything i could find online.
previously on the desktop, i had to
use chmod on some of the files in
the .gnupg dir, but that's no longer
the problem. everything's identical
on both machines. funny thing is,
either user can decrypt & read the
messages from each other that were
sent last week. i've tried renaming
.pgp4pine.cache to see if that was
the problem & let it create a new
one, but didn't help. any & all
help will be greatly appreciated.

@_subject: cache keyrings 
Hash: SHA1
even after i updated to the latest
version, i still had the same problem
with pine, pgp4pine & gpg. everytime
i would try to sign/encrypt a message
to someone on my keyring, it'd say
that i hadn't designated a secret
keyring. i finally had to scp the
file .pgp4pine.cache from another
machine & then it worked. what i
don't understand is that .pgp4pinerc
says to cache keyrings only one day,
but the file i scp'd was about 10
days old. can someone maybe explain
to me what i'm doing wrong or where
to look for an answer? i've been on
this for about a week, trying to learn
it & reading everything i could find
on it. thanks.
