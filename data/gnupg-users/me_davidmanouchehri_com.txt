Just to add to what Grant said, if you decide to set a expiration date,
make sure it isn't too often.  Anywhere from six months to two years is
a good range if you ask me, but it's totally up to you; I've set my
subkeys to six months.
I personally try to update my keyring every few weeks.       David Manouchehri

Run "sudo apt-get install bzip2" and see if that helps.  Have you
changed your kernel at all?

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
Actually Anthony, you are correct.  It can't be defeated, or at least as
far as I know.  What I was suggesting was to move the vulnerable part
(bootloader and kernel) of the system off to a portable storage device,
so it would be easier to keep an eye on.  You can just bring it with you
wherever you go.  Obviously if somebody gets the storage device that
contains the unencrypted bootloader and kernel, they can modify it.
It's just much easier to bring a tiny flash drive with you compared to a
15.4" laptop.  Check out the USB flash drives made by Ironkey, you could
even take those in the shower with you! ;)
Hope that clears it up,

@_subject: Why revoke a key? 
That's really up to you, how much you value security or not.  It
depends on many factors, like what the key was used for; ie, if this
was the Ubuntu software PGP key, you should revoke it as others are
depending on it to be secure.  If you used it for just signing a few
files here and there, it's probably fine.
In general, once you've lost confidence in the security of the key,
you should revoke it.  I personally only take around subkeys that
expire every six months, so even if I lose that key, soon enough it
won't matter.

Hash: SHA1
Hi Roland,
What version of Windows are you running?  Could you start Kleopatra from
cmd and then paste the output for us?  Is Gpg4win running fine on its own?
Thank you,

email client such as Thunderbird.
Kleopatra does not work. I tried both from a desktop shortcut, and the
command prompt (terminal). Just no reaction at all.
a day later. Reinstall .... some success, and then failure again ...
