That tool is encryption, and it doesn't only enforce our
Actually they dont need to force you to install a backdoor, they trick you into installing a back door unknowingly. So you are unaware that all your encrypted email is being decrypted by them.
e.g. by having two MS code signing keys, one owned by MS the other by the NSA.
There are many such exploits available to governments (Flame, Duqu and more fun from the Olympic Games come to mind)

Hi All
I was demonstrating GPA for the first time to a class of students yesterday and a very strange thing happened. (Note that I am new to GPA, having used OpenPGP for the last 10 years, so I am not familiar with its "normal" behaviour). When I signed a message in the clipboard and was asked for my private key password, I typed it in, and to my horror saw that the password was displayed in the clear in another small window at the bottom left hand side of the screen, instead of showing as **** in the normal password window. The class thought this was very humorous. This small window then disappeared (without me doing anything). Later on in class I decided to change my password, and this time, when the new password screen appeared, and I typed in my new password, and it also appeared in a new small window, in the clear, at the bottom left hand side of the screen. Then it disappeared.
Has anyone every come across anything like this before?
I have tried to repeat this several times since the class, and am unable to. My PC was running very slowly at the time of the demo and I initially wondered if it was a timing issue.
Otherwise I can only think that a very clever student in the class had hacked into my PC (which was connected to the wireless Internet the whole time) during the lecture, and had placed the key pop-up window there on cue to capture my passwords as I typed. But this would seem to be a very difficult thing to do, and a very clever student

Hi Robert
yes you are right. It does indeed reveal your passphrase.
I also tried to repeat my problem again with GPA, and this time most of my passphrase appeared in a thunderbird window that had not popped up when I started to use GPA after immediately reading your email. Something (I did?) made this window popup in Thunderbird whilst I was working with GPA.
But I not sure I fully agree with your diagnostic. Say a PC is running slowly and another window appears just before you start to enter your passphrase, say due to a slow action that had not finished when you started GPA, then this new window will grab the keyboard focus without you realising it (and without pinentry being able to do anything about it). So your passphrase will go to the new window and should be visible there straight away.
So I think the problem you mention is slightly different, in that you are working in the command line mode, you type in your password to the command line window, but it is not echoed back to you for some reason. Then you switch to pinentry and it works just fine and exits, then when the focus returns to the command line, your passphrase is echoed back to it. My problem was somewhat different, in that a new window appeared in the GPA window and my password was entered and echoed to it, then the window disappeared again. What I do not know is what caused this new window to pop up. I suspect it was a hacker

Perhaps our anonymous user would like us to use his free software because it has nice backdoors in it that allow certain organisations to decrypt all our encrypted emails. And without access to the source code, we can never be sure that there aren't any. So I would not touch it with a barge pole

Its pretty much impossible to distinguish a nation-state's covert agency personnel who are masquerading as someone else from the real someone else. In the UK we have recently had examples of undercover agents infiltrating animal rights groups or similar as activists, forming deep emotional relationships with female members, moving in with them, having children with them, and then years later, after the group has been smashed, disappearing from the scene. One such lady victim saw the picture of a policeman years later (I think in a newspaper) and recognised him as the father of her child, which is when the scam was blown open. So in short, these agencies do not find it difficult to do anything that they need or want to do
