@_subject: Future inclusion of Threefish in Gnupg? 
Hello everyone,
Just out of curiousity, are there any plans for including Threefish into Or does it have to be incorprorated into the OpenPGP standard first and *then* perhaps baked into GnuPG?
In simple curiousity and because I have a soft spot for Twofish[1]

As I suspected. Time to join a lobbying group, then. ;)
Thank you.
