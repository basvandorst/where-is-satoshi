@_subject: Cannot configure GPG 
Hi All,
I have been trying to setup GPG. I created the both the keys and uploaded the pubring.gpg to the open athens too. Now when I try to add a user via an ASP site no error comes up but no user is added to the athens. Also it sends me an error saying "The submitted file does not appear to contain encrypted data." via Email.
Can anyone help. I have been trying to fix this for a couple of days.
Thanks in advance
