@_subject: Having a problem with encrypting and decrypting files. 
I was wondering if somebody could help shine some light to a problem I am I have a public key generated using version 1.0.7 (SunOS) , the counterparty I am exchanging keys with is using version 1.2.1 (MingW32). I have imported his key, as well as him importing mine, but when I try and decrypt a file which is signed and encrypted by the other party, I get the error gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available. Is there a compatibility issue with the versions we are using? Timothy (Ting) Nam
