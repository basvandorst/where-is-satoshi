@_subject: How does gnupng create keys? 
I'd like to know something about how gnupng create keys (for symmetric encryption).  I'm not looking for details, just an overview of how it's done.  Does anyone know of any documentation on this?  I haven't found any yet.

@_subject: Length for AES256 symmetric encryption passphrase? 
This a rather naive question, but I haven't found and answer to it. When doing symmetric encryption with AES256, is there any reason to have a passphrase that exceeds 32 characters (since that's the length of the AES key)?

@_subject: Length for AES256 symmetric encryption passphrase? 
How long a passphrase is recommended for generating a 32 byte (AES) key?    I'll probably generate the passkey programmatically, so typing an human memory are not issues.

@_subject: Length for AES256 symmetric encryption passphrase? 
To be clear, I want to use gnupgp to do symmetric encryption using AES256.  As I understand it, the 'gpg -symmetric ...' command converts a pass phrase into a key, a 32 byte key in the case of AES256.  I /assume/ that this conversion is 'deterministic'  since as far as I can tell, the 'gpg -symmetric ...' does not store the key it generates. Correct me if I'm wrong.
I am trying to decide how long a pass phrase to use.  I have not decided how to generate the pass phrase.  Assume that it is pseudo-randomly chosen from the an english language character set.

@_subject: Use own key with symmetric encryption? 
In symmetric encryption (AES256), is it possible for me to supply my own key, rather than entering a passphrase and having a key generated by pgp?
