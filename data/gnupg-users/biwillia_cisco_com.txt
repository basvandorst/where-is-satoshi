@_subject: How secure without /dev/random? 
I am trying to get a sense of how secure gpg is without
using egd.pl.  From reading between the lines, it seems
that a system without /dev/random will not have true RNG
capabilties, and therefore the encryption will be easier to
My impression is that without /dev/random, gpg is not
really "enterprise" class encryption. How about adding
egd? How much does that really help?
My concern is that if I roll out gpg as an accross the
board replacement for pgp, I'd better include access to
egd or SUNWski or whatever.
Please cc me as well as the list as I haven't subscribed

@_subject: Compiling On Dynix 4.4.x 
Has anyone accomplished this feat?
When I run the compile I get redefined errors
for blowfish.c (tried gcc and cc):
cc --> "blowfish.c", line 287: identifier redeclared: encrypt
gcc --> blowfish.c:287: conflicting types for `encrypt'
previous declaration of `encrypt'
