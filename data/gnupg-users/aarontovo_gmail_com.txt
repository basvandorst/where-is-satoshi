I downloaded gnupg-2.0.29.tar.bz2 and  libgpg-error-1.21.tar.bz2 and
their corresponding .sig files from I tried to verify them using the gnupg (version  1.4.16) that came with
my Ubuntu 14.04 distribution and got bad signature messages for both files:
$ gpg --verify gnupg-2.0.29.tar.bz2.sig gnupg-2.0.29.tar.bz2

What are some likely causes of this?
I also checked the sha1sum and md5sum and they didn't match either.
I didn't try the other gnupg packages.

Interesting. The file I downloaded is actually larger than what it
should be!

It's definitely not an ascii file (having taken a peek at its content).
I downloaded libgpg-error-1.21.tar.bz2 again today and it has a the
correct size (763186)
-rw-rw-r--  1 aaron aaron  763186 Jan 27 22:53 libgpg-error-1.21(1).tar.bz2
I re-downloaded sig file and it still fails the gpg --verify test.
$ gpg --verify libgpg-error-1.21.tar.bz2.sig gpg: Signature made Sat 12

gpg: BAD signature from "Werner Koch (dist sig)"
Could this be some kind of man-in-the-middle attack? I don't recall
having seen a signature fail like this before.

Thanks for the info.
Today I re-downloaded the .bz2 and .sig. And the verification worked
(see output below). I did file diffs between the new and the previous
downloads with 'diff' and they are identical. So I tried verify on the
previous download and it worked this time. Very confusing.
I've also downloaded the rest of the packages for building GnuPG 2.0.29
and verification succeeded on all of them.

Probably. Although I did get a failure when using both parameters, but
it was a different error message.
$ gpg --verify  libgpg-error-1.21.tar.bz2.sig libgpg-error-1.21\(1\).tar.bz2
gpg: can't open `libgpg-error-1.21.tar.bz2.sig'
gpg: verify signatures failed: file open error
But I was also renaming files and trying a lot of different things and I
may well have made a mistake in all of that.
Anyway thanks for your help people. I'm on my way. :)

'gpg2 -k' gives me the following error:
    $ gpg2 -k
    gpg: invalid item 'BZIP2' in preference string
    gpg: invalid default preferences
But 'gpg -k' works fine. However, I to use gpg2 in my
Thunderbird-with-Enigmail email client because I've read in a few places
that gpg2 is better for desktop purposes
. Also, Enigmail rejects gpg because
to REALLY want gpg2.
The error message makes it sound like the problem is in my gpg2
configuration. I don't see any zip settings in .gnupg2/gpg.conf nor do I
see a 'preferences string'.
I'm not sure when this started happening because I've been going without
Enigmail for a while on this computer.
How can I correct the preference string?

There are no references to anything about zip in my gpg.conf file. There also is no mention of preferences in gpg.conf. So it
I'll rebuild gpg2 with the proper bzip2 library this evening.

GnuPG build doesn't have it, the best course of action is to get a
properly-done build.
Removing BZIP2 from the preference list will hide the problem (no
support for BZIP2), not address it!
