The server/host I'm on already has a user/bin with the .gnupg I've never used it before so i dont know how to test it. The control panel only allows you to see the key pair that was generated,
nothing more. there's no access to control safe modes, etc . Is there a simple script to test this just to send a basic test email I've tried a few gpg scripts so far, but the mail they send is blank . it
goes through to my email, but no text , nothing. All of the websites I've researched only talk about the basics or the logic
and key pairs, generating keys, or setting up gnupg on your own machine. Is
there any comprehensive tutorial or scripts on how to make the gnupg
intercept the mail in the in/out pipe, as you say?
If i alreayd have gnupg on the server /host, would i need to even have
something like Anubis on my machine?

Hi,  I'm trying to send a php mail form and not able to get it to encrypt or do
much of anything.  The mail form works on its own ,but when trying to add the GNuPG it doesnt
work.  I have the private and public key pair generated. My host has the GnuPG
keys generated and the .gnupg bin etc.  I was a bit confused because i heard that PGP can intercept a mail form
through SMTP and encrypt it , but that GnuPG can not?  Do i have to first output my mail form into a temp folder as a .txt file,
and then encrypt the .txt file?  the overview of the mail form , is that its coded in PHP, and the
information in the mail will be populated by $_SESSION and $_POST
information.  It's an auto form that will automatically send the mail when user submits
the last form, and is transferred to that last page.  When reaching last page, the mail form is assembled and populated and sent.  Currently it all works when using regular non-encryption mail)
Is there an easy way to take the existing mail form thats already working,
and attach some code to have it encrypt with the private and public key
Thank You!
