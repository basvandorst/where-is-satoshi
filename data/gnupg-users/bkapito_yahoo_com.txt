@_subject: How to encrypt using public certificate\key 
Can you please cease and desist sending me emails. ?I did not sign up for this
   Hello,
I have a situation where I need to use GnuPG from command line and encrypt a file using a public certificate or PEM public key, please note that I will not have the private key at this point and encryption needs to be done only using public key.
Let me know if this is possible or not.
Best Regards,Shaarang_______________________________________________
