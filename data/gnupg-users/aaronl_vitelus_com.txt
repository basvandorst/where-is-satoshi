I want to generate a signature key that's longer than 1024 bits.
However, this isn't allowed by the DSA standard, and GPG tells me that
using ElGamal for signature keys is "deperecated". While GPG doesn't
say the same thing about RSA, it seems unusual to be generating RSA
OpenPGP keys in the 21st century.
What's the best way to go about generating a large signature key (and
why doesn't GPG provide a clear way to do so using a discrete-log
problem based algorithm)?

I just walked a friend through the process of creating an RSA key with
GPG (always use a guinea pig!) and it seems to work fine. However, the
keyservers think his key has an ID totally different from what GPG
says it is. Because of this they're also confused by his
self-signature and think it's a signature from an unknown key. This
also forces people who what to grab his key from the keyserver to
request keyid 46E8F0B5 instead of the last 8 hex digits of the
fingerprint (0B2F2D54). Aaarrgh. But this problem is kind of off-topic
and belongs on pgp-keyserver-folk....

Wow! This makes gpg --check-trustdb take a twentieth of the time here.
