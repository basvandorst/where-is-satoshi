I'm looking for ideas on how to either compile gnupg on HPUX
OR how to obtain a pre-compiled gnupg?

Can gpg take several cleartext input files and make a single encrypted
file that when decrypted creates the original multiple cleartext files?
The reason I ask is on an on-going basis. When I need to send files to
a remote user, there usually are several files to be sent. Currently
if there are five files to be sent, then five ".asc" files are created
and sent.  I'd like to  issue one encrypt command on multiple files
get a single encrypted output and e-maili that single file.
The remote user would decrypt this single file with the
"--use-embedded-filename" flag and magically obtain the mulitple orignal
Is this something GPG can do?

I have implemented the solution to his problem. The solution was sent
to me in private reply to my posting of:
  > The "configure" command succeeds however "make" command fails with:
  >    cc: "gettextP.h", line 67: error 1000: Unexpected symbol: "SWAP"
After following the following instructions, I have a GPG on HP-UX 11.11
that has subsequently proven to be 100% reliable and  working flawlessly.
By that I mean, I have PGP in production and wish to migrate to GNUPG.
I have successfully decrypted several production PGP encrypted
with GNUPG and then back again. Without issues.
Here's the solution:
step 1 - try a different compiler:
      edit  gnupg-1.0.7/configure
      as the first line after the initial comment section add this line...
      CC=/usr/bin/c89
Step 2 - run "configure"
Step 3 - GPUPG has a bug where by it put a syntax error in a makefile. The
     solution is to simply delete the offending line:
    edit  gnupg-1.0.7/doc/Makefile
    find line 180 which is the invalid syntax of : gpg.texi
    and delete the line ": gpg.texi"
Step 4) run two make commands...
    make install
    make
    (NOTE: the first make command might be return several "warnings",
         on compile, this is expected/acceptable. However the second
         doesn't have any issues.
Everything should now work 100%.

@_subject: Are there any frontends to both encrypt and sign a datafile in a single 
Are there any ms-windows frontends that can
both encrypt and sign a datafile in a single pass?
Every GUI frontend I've seen can do only one of these two
operations at time but not both. The two problems with
this is the user has to mouse click through multiple steps.
The other is even then the output isn't what's really wanted
since each iteration suffixes a ".asc" onto the base filename.
This means the recipient also has to go through multiple steps
to get to the cleartext file.
I know that GnuPG is capable of this task because I can
do make it from the command line. The user community wants
a GUI interface to accomplish this feat and not a command line interface.
Here's the command "JOE" would use to encrypt and sign a datafile
intended for "SUE" such that only "SUE" could read it and "SUE"
would know that the file had to come from JOE since Joe's
secrete key signed it.
I am looking for a ms-windows GUI that can do the same thing.
Ideas anyone???
To ENCRYPT&SIGN a datafile:
"C:\Program Files\WinPT\gpg.exe"
    --passphrase-fd 0
    --encrypt
    --armor
    --recipient SUE
    --local-user JOE
    --sign
    --output "%1.asc" "%1"
    < "C:\Program Files\WinPT\passphrase.txt"
TO decrypt the above output:
  gpg
     --passphrase-fd 0
     --no-tty
     --yes
     --verbose
     --no-secmem-warning
     --use-embedded-filename $FILEIN
     < ${HOME}/.pass_phrase.txt

I had same/similar issue and resolved by
creating the a ".bat" file with the single line of code

The following command encrypts with your public key and signs with my

This is a question or trouble report when using gnupg.
When using the following command:   this is for gnupg1.06
gpg -r mykey --yes --always-trust --encrypt myfile
when myfile is                this is the output file
abc.txt                       abc.gpg
abc                     abc.gpg
abc.stu.txt             abc.stu.txt.gpg
abc.xyz.exe.txt               abc.xyz.exe.txt.gpg
when abc.txt is used as the input file the expected file would had been
abc.txt.gpg but instead I get abc.gpg,  which is the same as the output for
encrypting abc
Is this a bug or is this the way this software was designed?    Assuming
this is wrong is there any fix for that or any detour?
When using regular pgp  trying to encrypt abc.txt  the output file is
abc.txt.pgp which is different from  the pair abc ----> abc.pgp
thank you.

@_subject: gpg (GnuPG) signatures on files not recognized by PGP as a valid signature 
What do I need to do with gpg (GnuPG) to sign a datafile such that
the licensed PGP product will recognize that its been correctly signed?
* I have gnupg (gpg), remote user has the actual PGP licensed product.
* each of us has imported ( and signed) the others public key.
* The intent is to transfer datafiles encrypting with other's
  public key and signing with our secret key.
This works save for the fact the PGP user always gets the following
error dialog on ALL of my signed file transmissions...
---> File is signed.  WARNING: Bad signature, doesn't match file contents!
the PGP user does infact get my clear text message but they are not assured
that the file is in fact from me and/or not altered.
What do I need to do on the gpg side so that when I sign a data file
PGP will recognized the signature as being valid.
I have gpg (GnuPG) 1.0.6-2
remote user has Pretty Good Privacy(tm) Version 6.5.8
