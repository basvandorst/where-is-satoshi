@_subject: Trouble installing Version 2.1 on Debian Jessie 
Hello All,
I'm trying to install version 2.1 the "Debian way".
According to dkg's web-log entry titled "GnuPG 2.1.0 in debian experimental"
I should use experimental.
so I added the experimental repository:
# Experimental repository - main, contrib and non-free branches
deb  experimental main non-free contrib
deb-src  experimental main non-free contrib
Created an apt preferences file
Package: *
Pin: release a=stable
Pin-Priority: 700
Package: *
Pin: release a=testing
Pin-Priority: 650
Package: *
Pin: release a=experimental
Pin-Priority: 625
Package: *
Pin: release a=unstable
Pin-Priority: 600
sudo apt-get update
checked priorities with:
rexk at debian-pc:~$ sudo apt-cache policy gnupg
  Installed: 1.4.18-7+deb8u3
  Candidate: 1.4.18-7+deb8u3
  Version table:
     2.1.20-3 0
        625  experimental/main amd64
     2.1.18-6 0
        650  testing/main amd64 Packages
        600  unstable/main amd64 Packages
 *** 1.4.18-7+deb8u3 0
        700  jessie/main amd64 Packages
        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status
     1.4.18-7+deb8u2 0
        700  jessie/updates/main amd64 Packages
and finally ran the commands:
cp -aT .gnupg .gnupg.bak
sudo apt install -t experimental gnupg2 gnupg-agent dirmngr gpgsm gpgv2 scdaemon
which produced the following results:

@_subject: Having trouble adding gpg key to apt keyring in Debian 9.0 (Stretch) 
Hey Guys,
So I recently did a fresh install of Debian 9.0 (Stretch).
Now I'm trying to reinstall all of my software.
I had Sublime Text installed in 8.6 (Jessie)
But when I try to install Sublime Text, I encounter the following error
when trying to add the PGP key to apt-key.
root at debian-rig:/home/rexk# wget -qO -
 | sudo apt-key add -
gpg: WARNING: nothing exported
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: Total number processed: 0
This process worked flawlessly in Debian Jessie
Is the Sublime Text gpg key formatted wrong since now version 2.1.18 is
built in to Debian?
root at debian-rig:/home/rexk# gpg --version
gpg (GnuPG) 2.1.18
libgcrypt 1.7.6-beta

By the way, I can download this key directly and import it in the GnuPG
Keyring without any problems.

Thank you Daniel. As it turns out my difficulties were mostly being caused
by the fact that I had some how "broken" my apt updates. I was playing
around with backports in Debian 9.0 Stretch in order to properly download
and install Tor-Browser-Launcher.
I suspect that because Debian 9.0 is so new, the back-ports are still a bit
flakey. Things are working now after a fresh re-install.
I appreciate your suggestion for setting up separate key repositories. I
will use this method moving forward.
