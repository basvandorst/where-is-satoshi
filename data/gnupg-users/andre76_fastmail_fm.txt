@_subject: Possibility of corrupted file? 
What is the possibility of gpg encrypted file becoming corrupted?
I use another file encryption program and have never had any problems
with any file that was encrypted.
So, I'm beginning to experiment with using symmetric encryption of files
to myself and I want to get an idea from experienced long term users of
the likelihood of a file getting ruined by gpg.
What do you think?
