@_subject: Unusable key 
I have imported public key and checked the finger print. The key import and fingerprint show no problems. Using edit-key I set the trust to u/u.
But when I try to encrypt file I get the following:
xtrace line 11: gpg --quiet --output /loyalty/GEMMA/out/test.csv.gpg --encrypt --recipient jlennan /loyalty/GEMMA/out/test.csv
gpg: WARNING: using insecure memory!
gpg: please see  for more information
gpg: jlennan skipped: unusable public key
gpg: /loyalty/GEMMA/out/test.csv: encryption failed: unusable public key
xtrace line 11: exit
I would appreciate any help in solving this problem.
