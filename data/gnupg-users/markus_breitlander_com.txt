@_subject: Filesystem Encrytion with GnuPG ?! 
Hash: SHA1
is it possible to use GnuPG for filesystem encryption?
I am thinking about having a directory tree o your hard disk that is
encrypted using GnuPG PKI - only accessible with once secret-key + mantra.
Are there solutions like that for Windows? I read about implementations
on Linux using 'cryptloop'.
