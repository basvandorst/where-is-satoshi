Hi everyone,
I'm new to GnuPG. I'm trying to install it for MacOSX, and I have a
beginner's question.
***Do I need to verify more information about the validity of GnuPG if:
1.) The SHA-256 checksum on my Mac's Terminal matches the one on

2.) The Mac installer (.dmg) and the Mac signature for the installer
(.dmg.sig) are both verified on my Mac's separate program "GPG Suite" (made
by "
***The files in question are "GnuPG-2.2.20.dmg", "GnuPG-2.2.20.dmg.sig",

Thank you very much for your time!
