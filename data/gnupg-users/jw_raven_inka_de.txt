I need a setup where the user running "gpg -e -r foobar" is not able to
modify keyring contents.  I tried:
  # chown -R root:user     ~user/.gnupg
  # chmod -R o=rwX,g=rX,o= ~user/.gnupg
Unfortunately, this don't work because gpg does some write operations
in its .gnupg directory:
 1. It locks the keyring.  --lock-never will avoid this.  Is it safe
    to use --lock-never as long as it is guaranteed that _only_ "gpg -e"     is ever run?  No key generation, no imports, no signung. Only
    "gpg -e".  Is this safe?
 2. There's the random_seed file.  It is modified at every run.  How can
    I handle this?  I bet it would be a security problem should someone
    be able to read this file.  Would it be possible to put it into a
    different directory?
 3. gpg writes temporary files into ~/.gnupg while encrypting.
Any ideas?

Thanks for your response, Robert!
I wondered why /dev/random is not used.
It seems that "gpg -e --no-random-seed-file --lock-never -r foobar" does
what I want.  With this, only a warning about trustdb not beeing writable
is issued.  Can I safely ignore this warning?  Does --no-random-seed-file
force /dev/random to be used?
I think my architecture should be OK.  But I'm open for suggestions.
Here's a (simplified, bacause it is OT on this list) description of
what I try to do:
The goal is to make backups over the network (similar to amanda).
For this I set up an account named "backupserver" on the server and a
"backupclient" on the client.  Backupserver's public key is copied to
backupclient  Backupserver initiates
a backup via
  $ ssh backupclient sudo /usr/local/bin/sendbackup >out
sendbackup runs gnutar as root and gpg as backupclient.  To make sure
that backupserver is not able to request unencrypted data, I need
to make sure that backupclient is not able to modify the keyring.
Please drop me a note if you see any flaws in such a setup.

Don't most unices have /dev/random nowadays?  I never planned to run this
thing on a windows box :)
Hmm, the only drawback I see is a slowdown.  The application will just
hang and wait for more entropy to arrive.  But I don't see how security
would be compromised by emptying /dev/random.  Or will gpg fall back
to something bad in such a situation?  Would it be better to have a
random_seed lying around there?  Isn't it better to be slow than
How many random data does gpg consume when encrypting?
Ough... I always thought /dev/random has the highest possible quality.
How can a RNG be more random than real entropy?
Sorry, forgot that.  It is supposed to run on linux.
The server has shell access via ssh to backupclient  He can
create its own keyring and replace the one on client's account.  The
requested backup is encrypted with backupserver's key now.  The attack
is similar to a MITM attack.  This is why I want the keyring be modifiable
only by root
Basically, I want the setup to be secure even if backupclient's account
should be compromised.  I think this strategy will not do any harm.

I know.  And this is good.  But I am asking as a gnupg user, not as a
developer.  That's why I asked on the gnupg-users list instead of the
developer list ;-)  While gnupg runs on many platforms, I know that my
application will run only on unix-like systems.  At least in the next
couple of years.  I don't think I need to bother about systems I never
used and probably will never use.  (I've never seen BeOS, I played a little
bit with VMS at high school about 20  years ago, I use Win only at work,
because that's company-policy)
Well, that's why I asked how many random data gnupg consumes when
AFAIK, having random_seed be accessible to unauthorized people is
not acceptable.  Thus I have no choice, I just _have_ to use the
--no-random-seed-file option.  Unfortunately, the man page don't
explain where the random data comes from when this option is used
and what are the consequences to randomness quality.  This is why I
asked how gnupg will behave with this option.  I still have no idea
For one, I still don't know whether --no-random-seed-file will cause
many data will be consumed.
I never had a radioisotope RNG and I will probably never have such a
beast.  On an average system /dev/random collects entropy from keystrokes,
mouse events, network traffic and such things.
On my system gnupg relies on /dev/random when keys are generated.
So it relies on /dev/random when generating keys but can't rely on it when
actually encrypting?  Doesn't sound very consequent to me.
I have no doubts about this.  But I still don't have any clue what
consequences --no-random-seed-file has.  Will encryption process block?
Will the random data be of bad quality?

Thanks, David!  That's exaclty the answer I was looking for.  It is no
problem for me should it be slower.  Backups run automated at night, so
there's no point in squeezing out the last millisecond.

Robert, please get a beer and calm down.
If you find yourself repeating the same answers, chances are that you
keep answering the wrong questions. (just kidding :)
To be precise, I asked "I wondered why /dev/random is not used" exactly
_once_ after your explanation why random_seed is important.  From context
it should be clear that this was meant as a _possible_ alternative to the
random_seed method.  I never said that it should be used for everything.
After that, I kept asking _whether_ it will be used.  Notice the semantic
Then you said that data from /dev/random has bad quality.  For me, this
was Bad News, because I always assumed that /dev/random is the highest
quality average people (those who can't afford radioisotope, like me)
can get.  From that, a second discussion, entirely unrelated to gnupg,
evolved.  Please don't confuse the two independent topics.
BTW: _You_ asked me to tell you what platform I use before you can answer
     the question.  You should not be very surprised that I start getting
     platform specific after that.
I don't force you to use my application, so what exactly is your problem
here?  I don't know whether windows have something like sudo, or how to
properly drop privileges, and many other things.  So why should I bother
to port it to a system I don't know?  Should anybody be interested to
run it on a system I don't use or know, then it's up to him to port it
on whatever system he likes.  This is a pretty common idiom in the
open-source world: if something don't fit your needs, you are free to
fix it yourself.
I don't ask you to port your applications to any of the wired systems
I use.  And I don't say you are suffering from any desease for your
decision on that.
BTW: Actually, I _do_ programming for non-unix (embedded systems mostly),
     so portability is usually a high priority for me.   I never questioned _that_...
Still no answer to what happens when random_seed is to be avoided.  From
the beginning of the thread I have made clear that I want to avoid the
random_seed file and you keep explaining me what the intent of this file
Oh, you already mentioned that.  And I responded that I'm open for
You keep talking in riddles.  What exaclty is wrong with my current
solution?  I will be happy to fix it if you can tell me what's wrong.
Hey, why have you removed the quotes?  From the context, it should
be clear that the topic of this part of the mail was the quality
of randomness sources and had nothing to do with gnupg.  Is it by
intent that you misunderstand me?
Ough... Two mails ago you stated that the quality of /dev/random is poor
(or at least not guaranteed) and now you turn 180 degrees and tell it's
highest-quality.  You keep confusing me..
Well, David gave me the answer.  Now you made me wondering what might
be wrong with his answer...  Would you please give a hint?

@_subject: WARNING: unsafe ownership on homedir `/m/a/etc/naclient/ppcbackup 
I am wondering what this error message
   WARNING: unsafe ownership on homedir `/usr/local/etc/backup'
is trying to tell me.
This directory is owned by root:myself and has mode 750.  So it is
writable only by root and readable only by myself and by root.
AFAICS, it is as safe as it can get.  Do I really have to remove
access for _root_?  How do I do that?
I can see the necessity of such a warning if the directory is writable
by some arbitrary user.  But isn't root somewhat special?
Just wondering...

None of them is modifiable by anyone else but myself:myself.  And the
homedir is readable only by myself:myself.  Why is this directory
considered to have unsafe permissions?  How do I get rid of this warning?
