@_subject: post-quantum computing in GnuPG 
Hi, is there any plan to include post-quantum cryptography ciphers such as
McEliece and NTRU in GnuPG?
I know that NTRU is patented until 2020, but I found some C
implementations. It says that modifying the code it is possibile to have it
patent-free in 2017.
This is there officiale implementation by Security Innovation.
In any case there is McEliece.

Just for the sake of curiosity, is it possible to store a 8192 bit RSA key
on the OpenPGP smart card? Two keys ? Three keys?
Thank you, please include me in CC for reply.

I just followed these instructions and generated a 8192 RSA key with gnupg.
It works perfectly...

@_subject: GnuPG encryption with key file 
is it possible to encrypt a file with a symmetric cipher (e.g., AES256)
using a key file (e.g., a binary file) instead of a password?
