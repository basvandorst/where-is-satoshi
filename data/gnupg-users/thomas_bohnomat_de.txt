it is possible to send email in the background when I use the internal
SMTP feature?

Maybe you did use gpg via sudo. It shouldn't be owned by root.

@_subject: Why do people send email with an attached public key? 
It is called PGP/MINE. I think the advantage is, that is more clear  how to recongize a signed or encrypted message without parsing the  body of the email.

I just noticed this thread, so I just send in another message. I will  also forward it to the GPGMail mailing list.

My last email had "format=flowed" too. So it must be something else.

@_subject: Just one gpg-agent 
I currently try to get the gpg-agent to start just one time and not to get one more gpg-agent session each time I log in, but it doesn't work.
Even the hint in the gpg-agent man page won't work, I still get more than one gpg-agent process and more than one gpg-agent directory.
