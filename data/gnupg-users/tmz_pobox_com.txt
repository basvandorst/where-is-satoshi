Hash: SHA1
I don't know about the win32 builds...  Building from source on linux
the man page is available and current.
I thought this would be what you wanted, but it's definitely not
    It's linked from the main documentation page.
FWIW, here are the sections on cross-certify from the 1.4.3 manual:
    --edit-key name
            Present a menu which enables you to do all key related tasks:
            [...]
            cross-certify
                    Add cross-certification signatures to signing
                    subkeys that may not  currently have them.
                    Cross-certification signatures protect against a
                    subtle attack against signing subkeys.  See
                    --require-cross-certification.
    [...]
    --require-cross-certification
    --no-require-certification
            When verifying a signature made from a subkey, ensure that
            the cross certification "back signature" on the subkey is
            present and valid.  This protects against a subtle attack
            against subkeys that can sign.   Currently  defaults  to
            --no-require- cross-certification,  but  will be changed
            to --require-cross-certification in the future.

@_subject: GPG and 1024-bit (or multiple) subkeys 
Hash: SHA1
I'd ask them to explain why they think this is required by GnuPG and
why they believe it needs to be a new key.  I can understand that they
might desire a stronger encryption subkey (2048 vs. 1024), but if
they're only requesting this because they misunderstand how the system
works, then they are just wasting your time. :)
There is.  Just append a ! to the keyid.  See the section "How to
specify a user ID" in the gpg man page.
If you had a key like this:
pub   1024D/1B324765 2006-05-21
uid       [ultimate] Testing sub   2048g/263C2EA4 2006-05-21
sub   4096g/9BDAA7FA 2006-08-15
You could tell gpg to encrypt to the 2048 subkey like so:
    $ gpg -e -r 263C2EA4! ...
(note that you may need to quote or otherwise protect the ! from being
interpreted by your shell.)
If the senders you are dealing with don't grok this, then export your
whole key, delete the 1024 subkey, export the pubkey containing only
the 2048 subkey for them and then import your full key again.

Hash: SHA1
This doesn't like an entirely unreasonable feature request to make of
Enigmail.  Perhaps you'd want to check in with the Enigmail folks to
see if the would consider adding such a feature?  It has some
potential to be useful but it might be icky to implement.
Obviously, if you send a message unencrypted but store it encrypted,
you won't really have an accurate record of your sent mail.  The
headers and MIME parts will be different.  Some people prefer that
what's in their sent mailbox be exactly equal to what was sent.
(Pedants. :)
I am curious though, what particular threats are you concerned about?
That might help shape what options would be best to take.
If you don't trust the IMAP server admins, then you should store your
mail somewhere you do trust.
If you are worried about someone cracking the server and getting at
your sent messages then encryption on the server may be sufficient,
but would involve either changes to you mail client or some other sort
of access to your mailbox on the server.

Nope.  As John pointed out this is simply not feasible to do from
within Enigmail based on the way it has to interact with Thunderbird.
I'll assume that means you trust you.  ;-)
True.  An encrypted FS that's always mounted isn't too secure.
Well, as I understand your original query, you're looking to get
security on the sent messages that are not encrypted to the recipient.
In that case, the message goes out via IMAP and SMTP on the server and
thus the admin could just grab a copy somewhere in that process.
That'd be a lot easier to do than trying to crack the gpg encrypted
message in your sent mailbox.
ISTM that the only good way for you to get the security you want in
this case is to send the mail encrypted in the first place.

I suppose that's one way to define the terms.  I was thinking that
unreasonable would be more aptly applied to a request that wasn't
grounded in any good reasoning.  Not feasible could be applied for
either lack of manpower or lack of an available set of hooks to
achieve the goal.
While I think that the Enigmail team has done a really great job of
integrating OpenPGP into Thunderbird[1], I'm a happy Mutt user and not
looking to switch back to any graphical MUA. ;-)
I sincerely appreciate the efforts of all those folks that create the
tools so many of us use, from the kernel hackers working on low level
drivers for obscure funtions I will likely never understand, to David,
Werner, Timo and all the GnuPG developers/contributors, to Ingo, John,
Patrick and others who spend hours integrating those pieces into easy
to use graphical interfaces that I can teach a friend to use pretty
[1] For Windows, Thunderbird with Enigmail is the only thing I'd
recommend to friends getting started.  For linux, it's either
Thunderbird/Enigmail or Kmail.  Both projects have done a lot to make
using PGP both seemless and secure.

@_subject: Info doc conflict between 1.4.6 and 2.0.1? 
I was updating my system to 1.4.6 today and noticed the following in
the make install output (I've got 2.0.1 installed already):
install-info: menu item `gpg' already exists, for file `gnupg'
I don't recall seeing this before, but I don't use the info docs much,
so maybe I've just missed it previously.  It seems that 1.4.6 changed
the texinfo file to use the dircategory "GNU Utilities" just as 2.0.1
does.  1.4.5 used GnuPG.  Without knowing much about how install-info
works, I'm guessing that it's balking because both programs try to
create a gpg entry in the same info section.
If I'm looking to install both 1.4.6 and 2.0.1 simultaneously,
shouldn't the info pages for both versions be able to coexist?
If I'm doing something wrong or am incorrect in expecting that the
info files should be parallel installable, let me know.  If not, would
a proper fix be to use gpg2 as the entry for 2.0.1?

Good grief man, your head must hurt from all those hats. :)
I've spent a good bit of time hanging around the mailman-users list
and managing a few smaller lists for others.  I would be glad to try
and help figure out what list settings could be tweaked to get the
archives into better shape.  It should be doable as I've seen and sent
pgp signed (mime and inline) message that included attachments and the
pipermail archiver handled them alright.  There was a bug fixed in
2.1.8 that would scrub some parts of pgp/mime messages with
attachments, but even that one left the main message body intact for
the archives.
I believe I found the culprit that has scrubbed your last few signed
patch mails in the archives.  It seems that since the mime parts lack
a content-type: text/plain header, Mailman's scrubber removes them.  I
think this is probably a bug in the scrubber module, as the MIME RFC
states that messages lacking such a header should be assumed
text/plain.  I've sent a query to mailman-users to see if others
agree[2].  If so, hopefully that can be fixed without too much hassle.
I setup a test list on my box and twiddled with your initial post in
this thread.  All that was required to get it to archive was the
attached diff.  Perhaps you can convince Gnus to include the
content-type headers as a work-around to the mailman archive problem?
Yeah, that's a very unfortunate limitation of the archiver.  Its
weaknesses were just discussed on mailman-users the other day with
main dev Barry Warsaw saying[1]:
    Have I mentioned recently how long I've been looking for a
    volunteer  to help make all this not suck?  ;}  Pipermail is just
    one of those  things that people either live with or ditch.
While it would be bad to have to rebuild and break external links into
the archives, I think it'd be worth it as some of the most valuable
messages in the archives are those that you or any other GnuPG
developer send announcing a problem and attaching a patch.
Another icky problem caused by older versions of the python email
module which Mailman uses.  Anything since Python 2.3 should include
an email module that defaults to escaping such From_ lines.  So once
the mbox is edited to correct the old, unescaped From_ lines it
shouldn't happen again.
Very nice.  Some cold and rainy day I may have to add something
similar to my mutt setup.

What I don't see in any of the links is more information about sending
an email challenge before signing a key.  (My apologies if I'm
overlooking it on your page or any of the others.)
It's been discussed here before but I've not found any scripts or good
details that I could point my fellow LUG members toward.  Isn't it a
good thing to send some random data to each UID on the key someone
wishes you to sign and require that they send back that data signed by
the key to prove they control both the key and the email address in
the UID?

Thanks Ingo.
Could you elaborate a little on the procedure you use to generate the
challenges?  I'd love to have some examples of how other folks do
things to present to my fellow LUG members.
That's unfortunate, since the signature is more important than the
decryption, AFAIAC.  I'll take a look and see if CA-bot can't be
useful as a starting point for some scripts of my own.
Of course, but they can't sign it with the key I've been asked to sign
and which I verified from the key fingerprint and other owner details,
unless they are the proper owner of that key.
Right.  But if we met in person and I showed you acceptable ID,
provided you with the key fingerprint and other key data, then
returned a challenge from you signed using the key matching the
fingerprint that you verified in our meeting, you know that I am in
control of the key and that I can get mail at tmz
Obviously, others can read mail there too and that's why I'm using GPG
to ensure that I'm the only one that will be able to decipher mail
sent to that address and generate verifiable email from that address.

Is it really necessary to encrypt the challenge?  If the key has
encryption capabilities, I would do so, but if it was a sign only key

there in sending the challenge in the clear?  I've seen David Shaw
point out that it didn't gain you much.  I'm just trying to work
through the possible scenarios so I have them clear in my mind before
trying to present this to a larger group, who may well end up with
questions on this that I'd like to have better answers for than I do

But if you do this, then even encrypting the challenge wouldn't help,
as I'd be encrypting it to the key you presented to me.  It seems that
this is a problem outside the scope of what the challenge will solve.
Or am I missing something?  (I've been busy all morning fixing some

Marcus and Ingo have very been helpful in providing pretty specific
procedures that they've used (and documented) for key signing.  I've
read with interest the comments that you've made over the years as the
topic of keysigning has come up and I'd be very appreciative if you
could share a basic outline of the procedure you take or recommend.
As I alluded to at the start of this thread, I've been volunteered to
give a talk on the process and reason behind key signing at an
upcoming meeting of my local LUG.  I've been trying to find as many
different peoples policies and procedures as I can prior to my
presentation to a) refresh my memory and b) prepare for potential
questions on why one might use a particular method.
I highly respect the methods you've outlined on this list and I think
the members of my local LUG could benefit greatly from being exposed
to the policy/procedure for handling keys the come across at a key
signing party.
Thanks much for your efforts on GnuPG.  Like OpenSSH, it's one of the

Hi Laurent,
You'll have to provide some proof that they are incorrect.  What
defines "correct" headers?  :)
This is the way Mailman sends mail.  Sender is set to use
$listname-bounces because there are broken MTA's that will
send bounces back to Sender, rather than to the address in the
Errors-To or Return-Path headers.
This may be changed in a future version of mailman, as the number of
broken MTA's is diminishing and the number of MUA's that display
things like "on behalf of" when the Sender header differs from the
- From header is increasing.
See this recent thread on the mailman-users list for more discussion
and links to relevant RFC's:
    See Mailman FAQ 3.48. 'What about setting a "Reply-To:" header for the
list?' for discussion of why many lists do not add a reply-to header
and why the Mailman default is to not set this to the list address.
    Your MUA should be able to handle this.  Mutt does quite well without
the reply-to header pointing to the list.  Submit a feature request to
the developers of your MUA if it's missing a list reply function.

@_subject: comment and version fields. [Long] 
Yes, you've found the true purpose of all RFCs.  Unfortunately they
aren't working as intended as numerous folks have managed to glean
just enough detail out of them to make working implementations based
on these documents. :)
Nor should it be.  As an end user of the software you shouldn't need
to know the details of implementation.  And unless you have buggy
software that mixes the comment field in with the signed data, there
isn't really any problem here.
Not that I take much glee in knowing there are things I can read on
linux that Windows users can't, but I thought that the man pages were
generally included with the windows builds and you could open them
with a text editor.  But it's been a long time since I even looked at
a windows box with gpg installed.
If you're not comfortable with the tool, then that's why there are
many convenient wrappers/plugins that handle this automatically.  I
think it seems reasonable to assume that if you're running things
through gpg manually, on the command-line, that you ought to have a
little more understanding of the tool.
Since enigmail doesn't even show you the comment field, why would
anything need to be added to its help file about it?  Ditto for most
of the other mail plugins that I've seen and used.

This is not a GnuPG problem, therefore by your logic it must be a
problem with the RFC.  In that case, please direct further mail to the
openpgp working group.
Perhaps the comment field should simply be renamed to "this is only a
comment, it's not part of the signed message so you shouldn't infer
that it is secured:".  Or, if you don't like the comment field, don't
set it in your gpg config.

As far as rpm goes, I'm pretty sure it will happily try to process a
spec file written in various encodings, but the results won't likely
be sane or consistent.  For Fedora, the ascii/utf8 requirement is a
sanity check for packagers so that if someone else edits a spec file
they can be assured that it is either ascii or utf8.

aarch64 work fine.
I've tested this on one of the Fedora package maintainer

doesn't narrow it down much, other than likely ruling out
something specific to the COPR build environment.
It could still be a bug in gnupg-2.0.22, in the RHEL-7
packages (gnupg2 or otherwise), or when used with mock on
aarch64. For those unfamiliar, mock is a Fedora/EPEL rpm
build tool.
