Hi everyone,
I am new  to all this and have been alot of reading.
One thing i cant get my head around is subkeys.  I have generated a sub
key with my master key and i undestand that.  All the commands and thing
i have been doing i have been using my master keys id... should i be
actively using my sub key? or does it just use it as i talk to people?

That does make more sense.  Still a very confusing topic.  From what i
gather the fact that my emails are being signed and everything seems to
be working i will not worry about it too much.  Hope this post helps
others that come looking later with the same question. Thanks Faramir,

Yes i made a bit of a mess when first setting up my account.  The two
revoked keys are ones i got confused with and wanted to start from
scratch.  The one that isnt revoked is my good key that i am using now.
9DA5B32F is my key that i will be using from now on.
Thanks for the reply guys,
Simon Dwyer
