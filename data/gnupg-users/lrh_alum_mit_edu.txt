@_subject: Multiple key problem with exmh? 
I am running GnuPG 1.0.1-2 under Red Hat 6.2 and trying to use it with exmh.  I successfully (well, it *looked* successful, anyway) imported the keys, public and private, from my previous PGP 5.0 keyrings.   I have three secret keys on the secret keyring.   I can successfully, it appears, sign and encrypt a message and send it to myself as a test with exmh.  Prior to sending it, I can choose which key is to be used to encrypt and sign the message.  I chose the newest (just created with gpg).  When the message arrives it is properly marked as encrypted, but when I try to decrypt it, it asks for the passphrase for the wrong key.  I must be missing something fundamental.   Anyone have any Thanks, in advance, for your time and assistance.

@_subject: I know this is heresy... 
But I have an old RSA key that's been kicking around for a long time and
I didn't have a die-date on it.   I still want to be able to get messages
to me with this key.   Is there a module that I can add to gnupg that will
me to do this?   Not everyone is switching to gpg and I still need to hear
them in private.
