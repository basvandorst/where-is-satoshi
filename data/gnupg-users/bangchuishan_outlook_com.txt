@_subject: How to change the protect cipher algorithm and the digest algorithm 
Excuse me,When using "gpg --list-packets [private secret key file]",it print "iter+salt S2K, algo: 7, SHA1 protection, hash: 2, salt: ****************", how to change "algo:7" and "hash:2"?
I searched on Google, it use the "gpg --gen-key" or "gpg --edit-key" command with "--s2k-cipher-algo AES256" and "--s2k-digest-algo SHA512" options could change them, but I tested,It could not change them. Tell me  the correct way please.Thank you very much.

Thank you for your reply to my question.
In " Werner responded: "It is an open question whether gpg should be allowed to change the s2k options because the keys are a property of the agent and not of gpg. For export it might hwoever make sense to be able to change that (think export for use on a slower box)."Excuse me, why not use "--s2k-digest-algo" and "--s2k-cipher-algo" and other options for gpg-agent.exe, so you can also write these options in "gpg- conf.conf". At present, the "--s2k-count" option can be used in both gpg.exe and gpg-agent.exe.Thank you.
