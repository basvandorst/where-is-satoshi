This is only true if one takes a view that the cipher in question
is 100% resistant to any kind of attack. This is a naive
assumption - history of cryptography abounds with sucessfull
attacks on ciphers that were, at the time, considered to be
attack-resistant by their users. It would also be reasonable to
postulate that if there are such attacks to any of the present
ciphers, known plaintext is likely to make a significant difference.
Protocols that provide an attacker with a known plain-text should
thus be avoided whwnever possible.

Which means that hybrid protocols should be acceptable only when no
adequate symmetric cipher solution exists.

Good question, better advice, but two warnings are in order:
Assuming that the other user can not boot the computer from a floppy
(CD, USB flash 'drive'...).
Assuming you have the necessary confidence that all those steps
are correct, timely and complete. This is very difficult, even for
an experienced sysadmin. Practically impossible for an avarage user.

In any case, isn't it unlikely that RSA implementation
would make any difference when PGP/GPG is used as a file
encryptor? I assume that in such case the passphrase is
hashed into the symetric cipher key (IDEA(?) for PGP 262,
AES(?) for GPG), and the file is encrypted without any
RSA function ever used. (Even if I was wrong, for a very
large file, the time required will depend almost entirely
on the speed of the symetric cipher used).

Is 2.6.3ia the same as 2.6.3i? If not, is ..ia source
available on the web? TIA,

Which shows, once again, why it is *wrong* for application
developers to follow Microsoft's directive to store application
environmental data in the system registry. It is somewhat
understandable when it's done by programmers who have seen
nothing but Windows and heard no voice but Microsoft's, but
its outright depressing when one sees something like that
done by the likes of GPG developers...!

As long as there is an alternative for the user that wants
his or her data on - for instance - a removable medium...

No, far from it. This is how it should be done... But first:
Principle  An application should be 'fused' to a given
computer as little as possible.
Principle  The user should be given as much flexibility
in selecting the location of his or her data (and as much ease
of changing the location of this data between the invocations
of the program) as possible.
  No application should ever write data to files
or locations that the user is not aware of.
(If you disagree with the above three principles - I call them
'principles of a well-behaved, user friendly application (as opposed to the 'operating system vendor ('Winoze Logo")
friendly' application :) - please feel free to ignore the rest
of this post; its purpose is *not* to convince anyone that they
are right, it is only to offer a modest suggestion (one among
many) to those that agree with them).
Ancillary files that make the operation of the program
possible, and do not contain *any* reference to, or are
changed by, a particular user ('resources', documentation...)
should be co-located with the 'executable'. If they are
numerous (for instance, illustration image files of a large
html manual, their 'collections' might be placed in a
common subdirectory co-located with the executable.
The program can thus locate and access such files without
any intervention from the user or any prior knowledge of its
whereabouts by the operating system; even if this location
has been changed between the invocations. (remember long and
repeated discussions about gpg on a removable memory 'key'
on this very list?)
The location of *all* user-specific files (this includes
the user identification and customization as well as the
operational data) may be assumed by the program to reside
in the 'standard' operating-system-convention specific places
(...\Application Data\someappname\..., '.someappname/' in
$HOME etc.) if - and only if - no indication is provided by
the user where the data is at the program invocation time.
There are many forms in which this information can be provided;
my favorite is simply the directory name given on the command
line that invokes the program. This can be easily 'stiched in'
the interface-encapsulating objects of a any GUI system.
(Foa a classic example of this approach I offer Eudora 3.x;
an old but still well-used mail client on low-end Widoze
boxes worldwide).
cheers, Roger

@_subject: newbie question about identities 
Perhaps it would be better to state the problem in a more
fundamental form: the first identity requires no anonymity,
the second does.
If you think of it, the purpose of Public Key Infrastructure
(PKI) is directly opposite to the notion of anonymity.
(If I can be flippant here, that which is *public* can not
be *anonymous*). Thus, no matter what the implementation
details and protocols are, PKI will be detrimental to
anonymity. Anything/anybody that requires anonymity should
stear clear of PKI. (please note I said 'PKI', and *not*
'public key cryptosystems').
It is, IMHO, quite disturbing that many novices do not
understand this, and that the problem of anonymity is
never addressed by the extensive GPG documentation.

>...for this thread the concern is...
If there are two 'abstract' identities (eg., id's in some
computer/communication system) and neither of them is
anonymous, they both (via some means, unimportant at the
moment) 'point to' the same physical pearson's idenity,
thus also to each other.

(Whereby we introduce the notion of 'granularity
of anonymity' :)
I said just 'PKI' where I should have said PKI/WOT.
(or perhaps just WOT - in context of gpg, PKI *is* WOT -
I know, gpg /can/ be used without WOT; but it gets to
be difficult to do so, since almost every component in
it assumes otherwise. But this *is* a different topic).
On the other hand, if I change your sentence above
to replace PKI with PKC ('public key cryptosystems' -
of which gpg *is* one), I agree completely.
Interesting reference, thanks.

What is the symetrical cipher used in those two cases?
(I'd guess old PGP would be 3DES, GPG would be AES...)

Strange... my results (on a 100MB random/binary file) are:
PGP 2.6.2:       74 seconds
GPG 1.0.6-2:     26 seconds
BTW, a dedicated file/crypt program (burp120, blowfish)
is considerably faster:  14 seconds

They are not. They are here to demonstrate that some folks
do not understand that mailing lists and news-group posting
*shuold not* have any attachments, unless it is explicitly
in the charter of the list or the newsgroup. Perhaps we could
all prevaill on the list owner to bounce such submissions.

Not necessarily, if you are writing to a correspondent
or correspondents where you have a reasonable expectation
that they are equipped and motivated to deal with some
special character set/encoding.
But on the flip side, one must be pretty dense or pretty
naive if one assumes all unknown members of some mailing
list fall into such category.
