@_subject: How to delete a secret gnuPG key using a php script ? 
I am able to delete gnupg key from ssh.
Now I am trying to do that from a php script.
I am trying this to delete a secret key
But I receive this error gpg: Warning: using insecure memory! usage: gpg [options] [filename]
The key dir is located here  /home/test/.gnupg
Any idea ? Thank you
