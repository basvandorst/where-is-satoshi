@_subject: GNUPGHOME for Linux? 
On Linux I would like to change the homedirectory from ~/.gnupg to
Defining GNUPGHOME has no effect on my Linux system while it worked on
Windows. Does this option not exist in GnuPG for Linux? How to define
something similar.
Because I want to use gnupg indirectly through other porgrams I can NOT
use a parameter such as "--homedir".
The only workaround I found was setting HOME to /something/else and use
Any ideas?

Thanks, this was my mistake.

As you know OpenPGP relies on a combination of symmetric (e.g. AES) and
asymmetric (e.g. RSA) encryption. GnuPG uses smart cards for
*asymmetric* encryption only. Also AFAIK gnupg-pkcs11 does the same but
uses a standardized interface (PKCS The general approach is fine,
protecting the secret keys in hardware and computing the intense
operations on the main computer. In case of large amount of data, the
*symmetric* encryption may be the bottle neck, instead of the
*asymmetric* encryption. Therefore an array of several smart cards may
not be the right approach.
To me your question would make sense if the main computer is not capable
to handle the symmetric encryption only. In current times of multi core
CPUs I doubt that this may really the case. Also you should consider
that you have to start separate GnuPG instances for each file/user. This
would scale very well on any multi core system nomatter whether a single
GnuPG process separates its workload to several threads or not (what I
don't know).

@_subject: fetch public key from card? 
When using "gpg --card-edit" and "fetch" gnupg tries to download the
public key from a key server. Instead, is it possible to fetch the
public key from an OpenPGP Card v2.0 directly? If so, how to do this?
Otherwise do I need to keep a backup of my public key always together
with my OpenPGP Card?
Best regards

Hi David,
thanks for your reply. In the OpenPGP Card spec I discovered the command
"Generate Public Keypair". So I assume the card would allow such feature
but GnuPG does not support it yet?

GPG4Win is a great package but unfortunately the included GnuPG 2.0.12
does not support the OpenPGP Card v2. Is there a schedule when a new

Unfortunately it does not work for me (Thus I thought it wouldn't work
in general). When generating new keys I get the following error:

@_subject: OpenPGP Card: modifying key length fails on Linux 
I use an OpenPGP Card v2 and GnuPG 1.4.10 on both Windows and Linux.
When generating keys on the card, GnuPG is asking at one point which key
length it should use. If I modify the default key length of 2048 to 1024
or 3072 the following error appears:
gpg: sending command `SCD SETATTR' to agent failed: ec=6.88
gpg: error changing size of key 1 to 2048 bits: Allgemeiner Fehler
Because of this, modification of the key length does not work for me on
Linux. But it works on Windows even with the same GnuPG version. After I
modified the default key size on Windows, key generation on the card
succeeds on Linux even with 3072 bit.
Any ideas?
After running into this problem I tried to modify the key length under
Linux with GnuPG v2 but it does not ask me which key length it should
use. Also I did not find any option to specify it explicitly. How to
specify the to be generated key length with GnuPG 2?
