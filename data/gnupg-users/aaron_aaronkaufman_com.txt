@_subject: keysigning parties 
This is my first post to this list so please excuse me if i violate any
etiquette. I am having a really hard time finding any *current* info on
key signing parties. I was wondering if someone could point me in the
right direction.

@_subject: secring and dropbox 
Hey all,
I'd like to just point this out. On June 20th Dropbox has a security snafu[1].
Why trust a 3rd party when you could do it yourself? When it comes to
security and privacy there isn't much transparency. Maybe postmortem but not
upfront. [1] [1]
