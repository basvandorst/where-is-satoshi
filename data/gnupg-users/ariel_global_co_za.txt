@_subject: GnuPG from WEBSITE 
cncclubI would like to know if it's possible to use GnuPG for encryption
without installing it.
I just need to encrypt one text file with a .pgp public key and generate the
encrypted text file for sending as a body of the message.
I don't know if this is a correct approach to pgp encryption, but that's how
I see it.
I have to do this with ASP on a remotely hosted site, that's why I can't
install anything and the only way I can e-mail is through JMail object.
Any help is really appreciated...
