Sorry to say I run Linux Mdk7.2 at home, but I'd want to give it a try....will you email me the ftp addr?
I want to set put a stable and free environment (i mean not Win... )
for a non profit org of which I'm a volunteer, so I need very light
solutions...the machine is old (Pentium 100Mhz) w/only 64MB (they gave it to me for free and I want to use it in this organization...)
so I've to pay attention to software...I'm trying Mutt but it takes me
a while for mastering the config. files...

Hi melissa,
Are u sure 'bout this? I just tried to do a detach sig (-sb option)
and the original file's unchanged...so there wouldn't be any probs...are there, about the web page ...which could also contain the link of the
sig before signing 'cause it's simply .sig and so you already
know it....
...let me know if I misunderstood...

Werner's right ,there're Mdk Rpms of gpg out there...

Hash: SHA1
Hi to all gpgers :o)
I've updated my Windows PGP version to 7.04...the question is I've been
using linux since 2 months and now I really love it, I'm slowly but definitely "migrating" to GNU/Linux, at least 60% of my job (master
graduating in electrical eng...) is now done on my new linux box...
so I'd want to import my PGP secret key to GPG so that i can do
anything from linux....I tried the opposite scenario, is this one Let me know, tnx in advance.

Hi to all,
I've just tried to import my secret key (Windows PGP7.04) into gpg, but
it doesn't work...I'm surely wrong for something....
- -I exported my key (including secret key) from Win PGP into an ascii file.
gpg --allow-secret-key-import myPGPkeywithPrivatekeyFromWindows.asc
- -I encrypted a file with
gpg --encrypt test
- - then I entered a proper ID for my PGP key...
- - it seems to encrypt it, it generates the gpg file, but when I try to
decrypt it with:
gpg  -  <+39trequattrosette7731827>
   <-- info per contattarmi via - ICQ/PGP -
 GNU/Linux?...senza dubbio! Da dove iniziare? -->

Hash: SHA1
Hi to all,
I just imported my PGP keys with the amazing --allow-secret-import --import :-) command and everything seems to work properly, I can encrypt w/out any
troubles...but why can't I make detached sigs?
Now I've got two secret keys, let's call them A and B.
A was the fst one I put (naturally born in linux), B is the WinPGP imported I've just written:
$ gpg -b -r B-ID test.txt
And it just goes:
You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: 1024-bit DSA key, ID , created 2001-05-25
Why  does it ignore my B account?...I don't understand...I browsed
the FAQ+pdf Manual but I didn't find any info...
If I go with gpg --edit-key B-ID I obtain...
Secret key is available.
pub  1024D/B-ID  created: 2001-05-22 expires: never      trust: f/u
sub  2048g/B-ID"  created: 2001-05-22 expires: never     (1). Daniele Russolillo May you help?

@_subject: [newbye] from 1.0.4 to 1.0.5 with Mdk72 
Hi to all,
i'm a linux newbye, but really enthusiast and security interested!!!
After so many how-tos i've just set up my linux box really nice, but
I found 1.0.4 on  it already installed by mandrake...what should I do
to replace with *.5?
Things to know:
- i don't know how to use diff files ( --> 1.0.5 patch...)
- is it ok just a "rpm -e" and then rpm -i the new version? What about
- should i put rpm -U to update? how does it work with gpg?
thanks for all....i'm really trying to use gpg instead of pgp!!!
