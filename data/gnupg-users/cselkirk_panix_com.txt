Content-Disposition: inline
* Anthony E. Greene [agreene [2002-07-10 13:55 -0400]:
The procmail content-type mangling is depreciated, it will sometimes
break the msg (it doesn't happen often but i can assure you it *does*
happen). The present (mutt-1.4 and also in the later 1.3.x tree) method
is ESC-P (that is cap "P") .. no need to pipe :)
Also, for further fuctionality with inline-signing, there is a patch for
mutt to sign inline, or switch ask={yes,no} when signing messages. A
search of the mutt-users list should find you a URL (sorry, can't seem
to find it here). With the patch you can then add the following to your
set pgp_create_traditional=ask-no # or =ask-yes or =yes
This can also be used from a send-hook etc
