Hello, how can I make gnupg look on internet for signature if I want to verify signature from users?
When I clic the check icon, a popup accur saying can't verify.  Is it possible to make it look on key websites?

NW> Put this in your .gnupg/gpg.conf
NW> keyserver  hkp://subkeys.pgp.net
NW> keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve
where is located this file withing xp?
I have looked in applications data\gnupg where is all the gpg files and its not there
NW> You meant keyservers.
NW> You also need to send your public key to a keyserver:
NW> $ gpg --keyserver subkeys.pgp.net --send-key 0xC566534E

there must be something bad with your browser or whatever ftp client you use because this gcrypt is really there
