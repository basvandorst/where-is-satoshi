@_subject: Deleting a smart card secret key stub from the secret keyring 
I recently bought an OpenPGP smart card, and am now evaluating before
deciding whether to move my secret key to the card. To that end, I've
generated (and destroyed, by way of "gpg2 --edit-card"'s factory-reset
command) a number of keys.
However, I noticed that the factory-reset doesn't delete the secret key
stub from my secret keyring; and now I get this:
wouter at gangtai:~$ LC_ALL=C gpg2 --delete-secret-key b36c8212

How do I tell GnuPG that this secret key is no longer in existence, and
that it should remove it from its list of secret keys? I've removed it
from the card, and I didn't create a backup copy (since this was only a
test key, after all).
I suppose I could just wipe out my entire secret keyring, but I'd rather
not do that, since it contains my production GPG keys...

Thanks, that worked.
Presumably, when I insert the card with the same key?

@_subject: Complexities on faking one signature 
No, but you can generate random numbers and verify whether they happen
to be a valid signature.
I believe the OP is asking whether it'd be easier to brute-force a
signature than it is to brute-force a private key.
With RSA, the signature is exactly the same length as the (public) key.
Therefore, naively, one could assume that the complexity would be
approximately the same too.
In practice, however, the work required to brute-force a signature is
probably worse than that to brute-force a private key, because the
public key must be the product of the private key's two prime numbers
(which limits their values to things that can reasonably be the public
key's divisors, and you can preselect for that), whereas a signature is
a modulus and can therefore be pretty much anything.

At a guess, you may need to clarify what type of signing you're talking
Signing a document can be done with any signing subkey; however, signing
another key can only be done by the certification key, which is usually
the master key. If that's what you're trying to do, then no, you can't
do that.

@_subject: Smart card 
Hi Will,
Smartcards are useful. They ensure that the private half of your key is
never on any hard disk or other general storage device, and therefore
that it cannot possibly be stolen (because there's only one possible
copy of it).
Smartcards are a pain in the ass. They ensure that the private half of
your key is never on any hard disk or other general storage device but
instead sits in your wallet, so whenever you need to access it, you need
to grab your wallet to be able to do so, which takes more effort than
just firing up GnuPG. If your laptop doesn't have a builtin cardreader,
you also need to fish the reader from your backpack or wherever, etc.
Additionally, unfortunately accessing smartcards from software isn't
always an entirely painless operation, and that may result in things
like My most recent key uses a smart card from kernelconcepts (who are very
much still alive -- at $WORK we recently bought two of their cards as
well), but I don't recommend it to everyone, and I certainly wouldn't
recommend it if you're just getting started with GnuPG.

No, that is *one of* the game-over conditions; it is not *the* game-over
condition. Without a smartcard, there are other game-over conditions;
e.g., if you've created a backup of your home directory, that backup
contains a copy of your private key, and the attacker somehow manages to
get hold of your passphrase, then that is *also* a game-over condition.
The same is not true for smartcard keys. This is also just one example;
there are others.
Also, the *level* of compromise need not be the same. With
non-smartcard keys, an attacker does not need to continuously compromise
the victim's computer; just getting access to the private key and the
corresponding passphrase *once* is enough. This can not be said for
non-smartcard keys.
Yes, it is correct to state that smartcard keys are not a panacea; there
are still various possible options which an attacker has, even with
smartcard keys, to be able to break the system and read all encrypted
data. However, it is incorrect to state that therefore the security of a
smartcard is the same as that of a key on a hard disk drive. There are a
few possible attacks that the use of a smartcard mitigates, and
therefore a smartcard key *is* more secure than a non-smartcard key, and
it *does* improve security. It just doesn't mitigate *every* possible

It is objectively more secure. Whether that extra security is relevant
to your threat profile is a different question; e.g., you may also have
threats that you are not aware of.
Like almost everything in security, this is a trade-off.

@_subject: Trouble installing Version 2.1 on Debian Jessie 
This is no longer the case; GnuPG 2.1 is in Debian unstable (and has
been for a while).
Just installing that from unstable, however, will have bad side effects
for other software on your system, so I recommend against it (see also
Instead, it's better to run a backport. First, remove the experimental
repositories, and add a deb-src line for testing to your sources.list.
Then, run:
apt-get build-dep gnupg
apt-get -b source gnupg
This will take a while. If all goes well, and there are no dependencies
needed from unstable (I haven't checked), you'll end up with gnupg
packages that you can install on your jessie machine.

@_subject: Managing the WoT with GPG 
This is only true the first time around. GnuPG will store the answers
you enter, and retain them for future use.
I did so on my keyring, and now it asks me to run update-trustdb once
every few months. When I do, I need to answer on only a handful of keys
--update-trustdb only asks about keys that are already trusted. It
starts with keys that you yourself signed, then checks which keys are
signed by those and therefore trusted, and asks about them. Etc, etc,
until you've got everything.
You can export the values you've input into --update-trustdb with
--export-ownertrust (and then import them into another machine with

Alternatively, AOL might be trying to send the mail from a different

then every time it sees a new IP address, sends it a 4xx status, and
waits for it to reappear. Only when it does reappear the IP address is
new, so it graylists again. Rince, repeat.
