@_subject: Partial/fragmented decryption keys 
I recall from the early days of PGP that there was a way to create a corporate key, fragmented into a certain number of potions, which would require some quorum to be able to perform decryption. I pored over the GnuPG documentation but could not find an equivalent. Perhaps I?m just getting the terminology wrong. Is this still possible in OpenPGP and therefore in GnuPG?
