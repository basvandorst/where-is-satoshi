Hi all,
I am new to the list, and also new to PGP/GPG, and relatively new to my job. sigh ... so much to learn.  I have a business requirement to get GPG up and running on our FTP server, which is an RS-6000 running AIX 4.3.3.  I dl'ed and untarballed v 1.0.6 and tried to install it - I get the following prompt messages and the log file is below - Obviously something it wants is missing - Can somone tell me what is going on here and how to fix it please??

@_subject: gnupg - now what? 
Thank you for the earlier replies; they were helpful.  I was able to determine (right or not) that there doesn't appear to be a compiler on my server - so, I went and dl'ed the gcc package, unzipped and untarred it.  Then, I tried to configure it - and got the following message :
# ./configure
Configuring for a powerpc-ibm-aix4.3.3.0 host.
*** This configuration is not supported in the following subdirectories:
     target-libffi target-boehm-gc target-zlib target-libjava
    (Any other directories should still work fine.)
Created "Makefile" in /home/ftp/pub/BankOne/gnupg/gcc-3.0.3 using "mt-frag"
./configure[1474]: cc:  not found.
*** The command 'cc -o conftest -g   conftest.c' failed.
*** You must set the environment variable CC to a working compiler.
OK, duh, I am installing it - of course it doesn't exist yet.  Good circular logic - any ideas about what I should do now (and please, no references to body orifices)....

I was able to get the 1.0.4 binaries downloaded and installed on my AIX 4.3.3 maching.  Tried creating a key this morning - got up to the user entry, and I got this error message :
You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.
We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

gpg: keyblock resource `//.gnupg': file open error
gpg: can add keyblock file `//.gnupg/pubring.gpg'
Key generation failed: file create error
gpg: can't create `//.gnupg/random_seed': A file or directory in the path name does not exist.
Anyone have any ideas???  I am stumped.

It's actually a known bug in 1.0.4 - I found a binary for 1.0.6 for AIX and installed it and it works fine.

This thread is taking a turn to the absurd, and I have been thinking about I fully support the ability to maintain your right to privacy, such as the government has granted you, to it's fullest.
However, if you're involved in a terrorist movement, and it appear the original poster is if the government is involved in one, even if it's under the guise of "animal rights" (as if they have any), then I support the ability of law enforcement to investigate, prosecute and convict the Good grief, if you need to be that paranoid, then maybe you should find a more legal cause to be involved in.

No, they can's do it by brute force. Look even at the power requirements
to do such a calculation: we're talking about an energy consumption that
is more that the entire sun will radiate during its entire lifetime.
I'm pretty sure that's beyond anything even the NSA can deploy.
If they are able to decrypt pgp/gpg, it will be because they either broke
an algorithm or implementation of it, or they have obtained the key by
other means (keylogger, hidden camera, tempest, virus, torture).

oops, didn't reply all...
And if you look at the cases reported, these are not system admins refusing to divulge data, or even regular people trying to protect their privacy - they are child molestors and wanna-be terrorists.

If you're in control of the computer the files reside on, and were in control of it when the files were created and last accessed, the chances that you *don't* know the key for the encryption is so slim as to be nonexistant.

Yes, conspiracy to commit terrorism, or assisting terrorist organizations are federal felony crimes in the US.
