@_subject: Questions about GPGME 
I am not sure if this is the right mailing list to ask questions about GPGME but
I could not find a better match. My questions are:
- Is it possible to change the keyrings used by GPGME and how does it work?
- How can I extract more information about importing keys and verifying
  signatures? I need to know whose key I'm importing and who signed the
  text. Using GPG itself I can get this information with the --status-fd option
  but how can I get it with GPGME?
Thanks in advance
