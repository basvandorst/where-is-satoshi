@_subject: IDEA.c and Win32 builds? 
Hi All,
  Couldn't see this on this or the DEV list as asked recently so throwing
it into the ring - Now that Idea is out of patent in most countries, is
there a build with it compiled in already for Win32, or failing that,
instructions to get 2.0.19 built and usable, on Win32, with Idea compiled
