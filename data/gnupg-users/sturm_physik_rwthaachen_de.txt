@_subject: no secret key 
When decrypting mails I get an output line saying
gpg: no secret key for decryption available
but the mail *is* decrypted. What does this mean?

Just a little one:
Someone might add a hint to use GNU make at least with OpenBSD. BSD
make won't clean anything and will exit with a complaint about not knowing
how to make target mpih-mul1.lo.

Hi all!
When trying to compile idea.c and rsa.c modules I get the following error
messages. Any ideas anyone?
ld: No reference to __DYNAMIC

Yes, and I tried some other settings but nothing worked (well, mostly
because I don't know very much about compilers :).
gcc 2.8.1 with OpenBSD 2.5

I used the same version. The problem is solved, however. I found an
inoffical port of the modules wich seems to work. Thanks anyone.

Well, I think it's ok to post this to the list.
I did not find an URL for it but Markus Friedl
 sent a port to the
OpenBSD-ports list.
have a nice day,
