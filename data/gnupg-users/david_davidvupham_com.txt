Hi, So what is the fix for this?  Is it to remove the inline keyword or remove the typedef? Does anyone have a working gnupg on hpux 11.11? Thanks  From dshaw Tue Feb 11 01:40:49 2003

autoconf people (cc'd).  They can then improve the "inline" testing
code to catch this case, and all autoconfed software can benefit. For the autoconf folks: GnuPG uses autoconf 2.54. David
