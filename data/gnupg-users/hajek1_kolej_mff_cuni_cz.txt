@_subject: passphrase in memory, how ? 
Hello all,
I am using mutt 1.0.pre3i and gpg 1.0.0.
could anyone please tell me, how to store passphrase in memory, so I do
not need to type it every time I send a signed email ?
I have disabled core files (ulimit -c 0) and in my .muttrc I have:
 set   pgp_timeout=43200
,but this doesn't work. Gpg still asks me to type passprase even if I
send an email and another one in one minute. I need to type passphrase
two times :(
Thank you for any tips
best regards
Michal Hajek

Hello, can anybody tell me what and why these fingerprints are ?
It should be something important or useful at least since nearly
everybody who uses gpg/pgp uses it. I have searched gpg help but did not
find out what i was looking for. Thanks in advance...
