@_subject: local key as smartcard *fallback* 
When using keytocard, the keyring is informed that the key is now
stored on a smartcard... only (unless removed explicitly).
If the smartcard is unavailable (lost or whatever), is there an *easy*
way to tell the agent to automatically use the local key, if present ?
*If* the smartcard is not present,
  *If* a local and password-protected version exists,
  *Then* use it as a fallback.
I do understand that smartcard security depends on *not* having the
local key present.
But such a (more flexible) key lookup policy would still be useful in
some situations like for a smoother transition to smartcard or smartcard
used optionally on several computers, ...
Thank you.
