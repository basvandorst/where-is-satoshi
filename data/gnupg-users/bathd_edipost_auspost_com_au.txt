@_subject: Why stpcpy : Build problem : Solaris 2.6 
Please cc me on my reply address because I am not
on the list?
Why does gnupg 1.1.1 use stpcpy rather than strcpy.
Even the linux manpages seem to indicate it is deprecated.
My Solaris 2.6 keeps barfing about it, even though it
should not have been found by configure.
ps Using a /usr/ccs/bin linkloader on top of gcc 2.8.x
