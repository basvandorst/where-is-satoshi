Hash: SHA1
After my first attempts with public key encryption (PGP back then), my machine was stolen with the two keys I had submitted to the MIT keyserver on it (don't laugh, learned something about having backups the hard way!).
Now I'm back in the business with Gnupg 1.0.6. What am I going to do about those keys on the server? I already added a comment to my active key, that the keys with the IDs X and Y are no longer valid.
Any hint helps, Joh

Hash: SHA1
I created (largely following the default) a 1024D signing
key with a 2048g encryption subkey. I wonder whether I have to
submit both resulting public keys to a keyserver (should be
necessary so that people can verify signature AND send me
encrypted communication?)?
Can I only generate a revokation certificate for the
complete set or is it possible to generate one for the
subkey (command?)?

Janusz A. Urbanowicz  schrieb am Ok, so I tryed to export the 2048g encryption subkey specifically by saying:
gpg --output pubkey2.asc --armor --export But the resulting ascii file is identical to the one that I get saying gpg --output pubkey2.asc --armor --export and represents the 1024D signature key.
What am I doing wrong?
Thanks for any hint, Joh

@_subject: Kontact Singature Validation Issue 
Hi all,
I have an issue with mail signatures in my mail setup and want to ask
whether anybody has experienced something similar and/or where to look for
a solution.
I standardly MIME-sign my mail using kontact, the kde PIM. Everything works
fine and the sent mails in the "sent mail" folder validate just fine.
However, mail I send to myself - no matter through which of a number of
smtp servers at my disposal - fail the signature test after arrival.
Might be one element of my overly-elaborate mail collection scheme is to
blame? It looks like so:
1. A number of mail accounts all forewarding to a gmail account
2. fetchmail imap-pulling the messages from the gmail account and inserting
it into a local kolab installation
3. kontact imap-retrieves the mail from kolab.
Any insight into this is highly appreciated!
Cheers, Joh

Thanks for your time. I have since gotten a nudge from others (see below)
and compared the sent and received mail. This led me to the discovery that
kolab is changing my headers (google-archived copy of the mail is alright,
only after piping it through kolab does the header get screwed up). I
therefore disagree that this is a kde-pim issue and have taken it to the
kolab mailing list instead ... where nobody reacted to it yet ...
Thanks, Joh
Thanks. Went and diffed the complete messages as exported to disk ... and
sure enough, here we go:
# diff Message_Sent Message_Received < Content-Type: text/plain;
< ? charset="us-ascii"
< Content-Type: application/pgp-signature; name=signature.asc Since this is happening through multiple smtp servers, it's most likely that it is happening in kolab. I already shifted this over to their newsgroup ...
Thanks for your nudge,

@_subject: Timestamping Service: Existing Services or Software Project? 
Hi all,
I've done some superficial googleing, but didn't get far ... so I'm asking
Is anybody aware of a software project implementing a time stamping service
via gnupg: you submit your signature of a file and it comes back signed by
a time stamping authority, which goes to some length to make sure there
machine time is semi-correct, thereby saying that you signed this file
before time X?
Thanks for any hints, Joh

Dear all,
Is there any of the common smart phone platforms (Symbian, Windows CE, OSX, Android, ...) that enables painless integration of gnupg? For android I'm not even sure yet whether a mail client for anything but gmail exists, but in general: google is suspicously quiet on the smarphone/gnupg topic ...
Thanks for any insights,

This depends entirely of what type of communication you use your phone for. Someone who does a lot of email communication from his phone will want gnupg on it ... I agree that "phone" also principally calls for the encryption of actual phone conversations, but that goes beyond what I asked ...
