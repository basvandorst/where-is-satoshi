This is the second time people have gotten stuck on this in the past few
days.  Perhaps the warning message about a vaild trust path should
remind the user that the trust path is built on key /signatures/?  I admit that this one caught me when I first started using gnupg as
well, even after being moderately well-read in the pgp trust mechanism.
I was used to having two trust parameters -- "do you trust this key
belongs to the name on it?" and "do you trust this key to sign others?"
When I started using gpg's 'edit-key' interface, I was confused as to
why there was only a single "trust" option, and further confused when
setting this "trust" option did not result in the key being trusted.
Bring on the verbosity,
