@_subject: ASP Shell and GnuPG 
I saw your question about using gnupg with asp shell at this address :  Did you find the solutions? I am having problem to make it work in asp. If i use the dos comand line it works fine. Here's my code:
Set WshShell = Server.CreateObject("Wscript.Shell")
command = PGP_PATH&"\gnupg\gpg.exe --sign --passphrase thisisatest response.write "Exit Code: " & WshShell.run(command, 1, true) & ""
set wshshell = nothing
Hope you can help
