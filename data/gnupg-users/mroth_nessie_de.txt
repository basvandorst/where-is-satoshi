The reason why writing memory pages to disk is dangerous is because it
sometimes enables an attacker later to retrieve your secret key,
passphrase, clear text message and so on if he breaks into your system or
if he steal your computer.
The sollution is to tell the operating system that it should under no
circumstance write a memory page (used by gpg) to a disk. However, on most

Because not all users should be root, you can make the gpg binary setuid
root. Gpg will then allocate a memory pool large enough for its purpose
(some kilo bytes), tells the operating system to prevent paging for these
memory pages and then drops root privileges to ensure safe operation.
To make the binary setuid root execute the following two steps on your
linux machine as user root:

@_subject: RSA & IDEA Howto  (Was Re: Signing (with) old pgp 2 keys) 
this is a small howto for frequently asked questions about RSA & IDEA in
To encrypt in an PGP2.6x compatible format or to check signatures from
RSA keys and sign other keys with a RSA key or decrypt PGP 2.6 created
messaged you need the IDEA and RSA modules. You should check if you need a
license for these patented algorithms first.
Compiling RSA:
* If you're inside the US or Canada you should use the RSAREF glue code
  for GnuPG. Get it from ftp://ftp.guug.de/pub/gcrypt/contrib/rsaref.c
  Of course you need the RSAREF library compiled and installed already.
  Take a look in the documentation of the RSAREF library for the way to
  do this.
  Compile the GnuPG RSAREF glue module with:
  Please note: This line is a little bit different from the one noted in
  the RSAREF code for GnuPG but this is intended.   The path `/usr/lib/rsaref.a' is the location of the installed RSAREF
  library. If you installed the RSAREF library in a different place, you
  must change this path of course. To speak clearly: This is not the path
  of a GnuPG directory nor depends this path on GnuPG. This path depends
  on the place where you installed the RSAREF library.
* If you're outside the US or Canada please use the normal native RSA
  implementation for GnuPG: ftp://ftp.guug.de/pub/gcrypt/contrib/rsa.c
  Compile the native RSA implementation with:
  You don't need any additional libraries nor packages for the native RSA
  module.
Compiling IDEA:
* Get the idea source code from ftp://ftp.guug.de/pub/gcrypt/contrib/idea.c
  Compile this module with:
Installing the compiled modules:
After you compiled these two modules you get two files `rsa' and `idea'
which are the modules you must install in the GnuPG module directory.
The default GnuPG module directoy is `/usr/local/lib/gnupg'. If you
compiled GnuPG with a different install prefix using "--prefix PREFIX"
when you configured your GnuPG source, then the module directoy is equal
to "PREFIX/lib/gnupg".
Copy the two files `rsa' and `idea' into the module directory described
above. Make sure everyone could read these files. You don't have to make
these files executale. These files aren't programms but shared modules.
Using the modules:
When you would like to use the installed modules you must tell GnuPG that.
GnuPG will never load modules automatically!
Their is an option "--load-extension MODULE" to tell GnuPG which
additional modules to load. Simply add these options to every call to
GnuPG when you would like to use RSA and/or IDEA:
Of course you could also add these options to the GnuPG config file found
from the homedir in ".gnupg/options". Add the following lines:
You could check proper compilation and installation of these modules with
the "--version" command of GnuPG. If you added the above lines to
your config file use "gpg --version". If you didn't changed your config
file, use:  "gpg --load-extension rsa load-extension idea --version"
No matter which way you choose, RSA and IDEA should appear in the cipher
and pubkey listings:
PGP 2.6 issues:
To encrypt in PGP 2.6 readable format, use these options to your normal
gpg commands additionally:
   --rfc1991 --cipher-algo idea --digest-algo md5 --compress-algo 1
Please note, PGP 2.6 could read the resulting message only if all keys you
used to encrypt or sign were RSA keys. If you used only one none RSA key,
PGP 2.6.x will fail. Further more, you must use files when encrypting.
PGP 2.6 is unable to process messages you encrypted using stdin/stdout
with GnuPG.
If you use shells like KMail, Geheimnis or GnomePGP it may be possible
that these programms use stdin/stdout to feed data to and from GnuPG. So
creating PGP 2.6 compatible messages with these tools might be not
Currently it is not possible to create PGP 2.6 compliant signatures with
GnuPG. However, you could decrypt and verify messages signed with PGP 2.6
using GnuPG without problems. The reason is that GnuPG doesn't use
tempfiles which were necessary to create PGP 2.6 compliant signatures. To
check such signatures it isn't necessary to use tempfiles. However, their
is work on a frontend to GnuPG in progress which will create PGP 2.6
compliants signatures. Please note: This tool is not yet finished.
You could not create convetionally encrypted messages readable for PGP 2.6
nor could you decrypt such messages created from PGP 2.6 with GnuPG.

@_subject: Warning messages. 
I feel free to quote the man page of GnuPG:
       On many systems this program should be installed as
       setuid(root). This is necessary to lock memory pages.
       Locking memory pages prevents the operating system from
       writing memory pages to disk. If you get no warning
       message about insecure memory your operating system
       supports locking without being root. The program drops
       root privileges as soon as locked memory is allocated.
However, the whole thread of pros and contras on protecting memory pages
to prevent paging them to disk is discussed very controversly. When you think about you will note that everone who is able to get access
with privileges to read out the paging area of the disk is also able to
manipulate the system in all possible ways including substituting the gpg
binary with a manipulated one.
In my view (and many others) their is absolutly no security improvement by
protecting memory pages from writing them to disk. As noted by someone
else you can switch off the warning message with --no-secmem-warning.

The options "--with-included-zlib" requests the usage of the zlib included

these programms use stdin/stdout to feed data to and from GnuPG. So
creating PGP 2.6 compatible messages with these tools is not possible.

@_subject: Warning messages. 
I feel free to quote the man page of GnuPG:
       On many systems this program should be installed as
       setuid(root). This is necessary to lock memory pages.
       Locking memory pages prevents the operating system from
       writing memory pages to disk. If you get no warning
       message about insecure memory your operating system
       supports locking without being root. The program drops
       root privileges as soon as locked memory is allocated.
However, the whole thread of pros and contras on protecting memory pages
to prevent paging them to disk is discussed very controversly. When you think about you will note that everone who is able to get access
with privileges to read out the paging area of the disk is also able to
manipulate the system in all possible ways including substituting the gpg
binary with a manipulated one.
In my view (and many others) their is absolutly no security improvement by
protecting memory pages from writing them to disk. As noted by someone
else you can switch off the warning message with --no-secmem-warning.

You can use gpg as any other unix filter programm. Just use a pipe:
   prog_wich_creates_data | gpg ENCRYPTION_OPTS | mail MAIL_OPTS
If you don't have a single programm which creates the data, you can group
different programms:
    {
        echo "something"
        echo "foobar"
        some_example_programm
        echo "this is the last line
    } | gpg ENCRYPTION_OPTS | mail MAIL_OPTS

@_subject: Installer probs. 
Don't try to edit Makefiles generated by configure. You will fail if you
haven't experience in using autoconf/automake.
Use these options to build GnuPG if you have problems:
    ./configure --with-included-zlib --with-included-gettext
    make
    make check
    make install
The options "--with-included-zlib" requests the usage of the zlib included
in the GnuPG distribution. Zlib is a library used for compressing and
decompressing data. "--with-included-gettext" requests the usage of the
included library for internationalization.
I suggest to use the included versions of gettext and zlib. Their are some
versions of these libraries widly used which have some minor problems
especially contained in older distributions.

With these modules you can decrypt and verify PGP 2.6 encrypted and signed

I think this is a question of time. I didn't switched from PGP 2.6 to PGP 5.x too. The reason was the different license and other politicaly
But when I found GnuPG I was sure this is the future: It is absolute free
in all aspects. The result was that I droped PGP 2.6 usage.
Of course, there will be many users who are more conservative and they
will switch to GnuPG more slowly than others. But IMHO as time passes on
many users will switch to GnuPG because it has so many advantage over PGP 2.6. Currently many people even don't know about the existence of
GnuPG. They only know PGP. But this will change constantly. Because more
and more people will know GnuPG, more and more people will switch. And
then comes the trick: As more and more people will use GnuPG, more and
more people will hear about GnuPG! As you can see: The loop is closed.
GnuPG is about privacy. This is a very sensitive matter. You couldn't
establish a tool which touches privacy in a few months. You must
calculate with some years. The community needs this time to gain trust
into GnuPG.

@_subject: decryption failed: weak key 
A "weak key" is a special DES property. In DES there are 64 known weak
keys. I think Blowfish has weak keys too.
No. If you take a look in g10/des.c you will find a table containing all
64 known weak keys (search for "weak_key"). If gnupg creates a session
key, it omits weak keys (take a look in g10/seskey.c, make_session_key).
So I guess the message was not encrypted using gnupg? Would be nice to
know which programm created the weak session key.
Please also note: 3DES keys consist effectivly of 3 different DES keys,
but GnuPG complains about weak keys if at least one of these three parts
is a weak key.
