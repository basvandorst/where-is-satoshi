@_subject: Remove public key from secret key 
Hello Guys,
Is there a way to export the secret key without the public key or remove the
public key from exported secret key? I'm trying the following scenario:
1. Encrypt data with particular public key on one machine.
2. Decrypt data with related secret key on another machine.
Basically I don't want someone to be able to generate data, which can be
decrypted with the related secret key.
Thank you for your time.

Thank you for the verbose answer Peter. What I actually ended up doing is
simply signing the required data with a private key and verifying the signed
data with the public key on the exposed machine. I realized I don't need
encryption, but a way to guarantee the data is generated by me.
Thank you again for your time.
