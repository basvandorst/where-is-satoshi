You'll need to import the other person?s public key as that is what you are encrypting to.
If the other person has uploaded their key to a key server you should be able to find it there:
gpg --search-key recipient at example.com
If you already know, preferably the long form, key ID you can just use:
gpg --recv-keys 6C70228BDC779E9A
If their key is not the key server network there are other options (LDAP, DNS etc.) or they could email you their public key. If it?s in a file:
gpg --import filename.asc
Ok, you?ve got the key imported and then it?s just:
gpg -e filename
or directly:
gpg -r 6C70228BDC779E9A -e filename
Nope. That might for example help others find your key and encrypt to that.
PS. Remember to replace the ID from those examples.

Yeah, OS X. I?m sorry, I?m sure this is drowning to all the discussion on this thread, I didn?t think too much about the subject. I was replying to Nicholas? reported issues with building on OS X. My aim was to expand on Nicholas? report with the info that it?s failing with that error yes, but before that it?s failing linking to version 0.13 of libgpg_error whereas I have 0.16 and 0.17 available. As I see it this feels like a ./configure fail on the dependency.

That?s somehow just the result of running ./configure. Running a fresh (fresh untarred source, no speedo runs) configure reported this for me:
configure: checking for libraries
checking for gpg-error-config... /usr/local/bin/gpg-error-config
checking for GPG Error - version >= 1.15... yes (1.17)
checking for libgcrypt-config...
That?s a homebrew installed /usr/local/Cellar/libgpg-error/1.17.
I don?t have CFLAGS set to anything. Mac OS X 10.9 and using homebrew for most things. The only thing I do is run ./configure && make in the untarred gnupg-2.1.0. I wouldn?t be surprised if there?s something special in the system but I?m not consciously doing anything other that the usual make routine.
I also just did a fresh run of speedo.mk and in that case got the same error as Nicholas originally reported (?_default_errsource?).

No worries on my part.
Exactly, under /usr/local? and without messing with the system installed binaries or libraries. Some things, like openssl libraries, it will not link automatically to avoid some issues with system provided libraries, but most things are then symlinked to the usual places to provide the brew installed binaries, etc.
It actually tracks dependencies very well? for anything installed and built with Homebrew. It?s a bit like speedo.mk for everything, or the missing apt-get for Mac, some things are ?bottled? binaries, some things it?ll build for you, in any case pulling any dependencies as needed.
In this case when trying to build a tarred source brew is not in the picture at all and all dependency handling is manual / left for the source configure scripts. And things don?t quite work although the configure script gives an OK on the pre-make checklist.
I really have no rush with this. Just debugging for others and happily using the stable branch.
I can dig into this myself at some point. It?s also possible whoever is maintaining the homebrew repo for gnupg might solve the issue and push an update there.

@_subject: Please remove MacGPG from gnupg.org due to serious security 
I?ve had some concerns about GPGTools for months now. For some time I've disliked the way the project is being run, the communication of what they are planning and the way they have been doing their development for example. Months went by when their Yosemite betas were not available in source at all and development was happening in a separate repository closed from the public [1].
GPGTools makes an installer, GPG Suite, which provides the following:
- GPGMail (plugin for Apple Mail)
- GPG Keychain (GUI tool for generating and managing keys)
- GPGServices (OS X Services menu tools for OpenPGP actions)
- GPGPreferences (OS X preferences GUI for some options (gpg.conf)
- MacGPG2 (Fork of GnuPG 2.0.26)
I happen to use Mail so for a long time I?ve been using the GPGMail plugin with a brewed[2] upstream GnuPG. I.e. *just one of the things in the GPG Suite*. I?ve talked about this setup before in the thread [3]. If one doesn?t use Apple Mail there is no reason to use GPGTools at all.
I?ve been planning on writing a request to  for downsizing / pivoting the project. I just haven?t gotten around to it yet.
MacGPG: Years back there was no easy way of getting upstream GnuPG working on a Mac. As I recall there were a couple of ports making a working Mac version and MacGPG was / evolved from one of them. Today the situation is very much different. Anyone can easily install either 1.x or 2.0.x via brew or another preferred method of installing their command line tools. *I think there is no more reason to develop MacGPG*, i.e. a port, anymore. Let the port die.
Instead they should use upstream and contribute the minimal amount of wrappers or fixes upstream. Case in point: Has the fix for gpg-agent / scdaemon hang been discussed upstream at all [4], [5]? In MacGPG there is still ../libexec/gnupg-pcsc-wrapper which has been modified in commit f4c3e1bb to fix the issues of scdaemon hanging in Yosemite [6]. GnuPG proper has removed it in bc6b45 [7]. How would one go about fixing this issue for upstream? Has GPGTools contributed anything regarding this other than the initial discussion[8] about the issue? Upstream still does have the issue which now seems to have been fixed in the fork but in a binary removed from upstream?
Many times when a new version of OS X comes out GPGTools has been a little late in getting a compatible version out. GPGTools are planning to move to a paid release of GPG Suite [9]. Whether it?s paid or not, my suggestion for GPGTools is to drop MacGPG and start using an upstream version in the Suite.
There are a lot of users out there that will not fiddle with command lines, brew or otherwise. And for them there needs to be a GUI package. Quoting from GPGTools support regarding paid support [10], "non-power-users that were partially even surprised, that email does not imply webmail?. "I hope you are aware of the social responsibility that comes with running the official website for gpg on OS X.?.
So, *"official website for gpg on OS X"* according to this user critical of making discontinuation of a free version.
There is a real problem here in that whatever GPGTools does, affects a large population of Mac users as the "official GPG on Mac?.
There is a history of problems regarding GPGTools and MacGPG. This is not the first time that project or decisions of its developers has been questioned [11]. Here?s one:
1. Modify source code to allow non-sensical 8192 bit keys [12].
2. Have users wonder, at gnupg-users, years later why things don?t quite seem right [13].
Another: GPGTools support site has a certificate mismatch [14]. WTF is a *.tenderapp.com cert doing here?
GnuPG provides a GUI for Windows in addition to the set of command line tools. On *NIX official builds are command line only. I think the GUI tooling of not only Mac but other *NIX systems to be quite an important factor in getting wider use for encryption. Such tools must be from a respectable source and properly implemented just as much as the underlying engine. I would argue GnuPG should take the responsibility of such tooling where there isn?t a good option. Other *NIX systems are doing fairly well already so I suppose a Mac GUI would really be the urgent one.
And I?m willing to put my time and effort where my mouth is. I would be happy to participate such a project.

Yeah, Apple has once again moved things around and even seemingly reimplemented some things for no apparent reason. Hard to know why because Apple doesn?t talk much about their plans with the outside world. Ludovic has been doing a great job of finding and reporting issues to Apple.
You?re letting your hate shine bright. Haters gonna hate.
GPGTools is very much responsible for where their site is hosted and the proper use of such things as certificates. In the scheme of things the actual hosting issue is probably quite small but one could say that *GPGTools has not planned for the use of HTTPS on their support site at all*.
That makes no sense.
Nothing requires GPGTools to contribute their code changes back upstream but licensing does require the source to be available. There was a period when this licence requirement was not adhered to. Fortunately, as I said, it was momentary and at the moment as far as I know they have merged back to the public repository.

If MacGPG were not a fork that would be the situation. Alas, it *is a fork and not just a front-end* for GPG.
There are binary level differences from upstream which the average user does not know, nor should they need to.
I agree. I wouldn?t like anything better than to have all users using an open source client but I don?t have any illusions of getting there any time soon. Thus, plugins for the system default are necessary.

I haven't tried Patrick's installer but it should be a fine option as
the core. The Mail plug-in should work just fine with 2.1 like it works
with upstream 2.0.* builds. I'm not aware of any specific need for
MacGPG in that regard. Same goes for the other little helpers.
The things that would require a little changing are the launchd
templates that are used to start gpg-agent et al. I've been using my own
templates already before and with 2.1 it's even simpler as per the
changes to related gpg-agent. This sort of a script is not even
necessary unless one needs SSH support which I do. I've attached my new
template here.
I know, that's a lot of /shoulds/ :). There is an existing ticket [1]
for MacGPG upgrade to 2.1 and it links to a couple of their support
request [2] [3], one of them mentions the need to /"first have to adapt
our library which is responsible for communicating with the gnupg
binary"/. Lukas, maybe you could comment on the other tools'
dependencies with MacGPG, if any.

Yep, unfortunately it would appear the same or identical issue does
occur with a speedo build of 2.1.2. The issue is essentially that
smartcard works for the first time but once some-indeterminate-time has
passed, gpg just hangs. No pinentry, nothing just happens. /Will need to
troubleshoot this further on 2.1.2 to try to find out more./
I think we might want to move some of this discussion to gnupg-devel
side at some point.

Previously I was running brewed 2.0.26. And now I've experienced the
similar issue with a speedo build of 2.1.2. There's still definately
something going awry but I'll need to do some more testing to find out more.
I'm using the FSFE card and the issue is a hang when it should be asking
for PIN.
I kinda had that in mind :). QT 4 is going out of support very soon,

From usage point of view: Well sure you do, with 2.0.* branch? At leasts the templates are being
installed by the suite installer. The on-demand change is with 2.1.
What is the need for Libmacgpg and its dependencies to MacGPG? I.e. why
don't the tools just directly communicate with gpg-agent et al.? (Not
including basic abstraction of functionality.)
Hmm, why would pinentry cache anything? I might be quite wrong but
shouldn't gpg-agent be responsible for this?

Yes that's right. You can also use the 2.1 installer linked to from gnupg.org downloads.
gpg-agent and pinentry-mac can also be installed via brew.
For 2.0.27 you can use the write up on this list I linked to. You might need to adapt it a little bit.
For 2.1 you shouldn't need the launchd stuff* unless you use SSH.
Btw. I noticed there's now a brewed 2.1. Wasn't 2.1.2 yesterday but didn't look at it any more closely yet.
* it was mentioned that 2.0.24 already made the agent on-demand changes which make launchd unnecessary (when not using SSH). The scripts don't hurt anyway.

Pretty much.
No. There is a standard called OpenPGP already and this service is not
relevant in any way.
See the how it works page[1]. They can't and don't change how email,
i.e. SMTP works. They just send the receiver a link to their web service
and both their client and recipient use a browser to do their
"emailing". The world is full of services like that.

Separation of concerns. Separating different, sufficiently unrelated,
functionality into their own layer / process / service can be just as
beneficial as on a normal *NIX using multiple processes to achieve a
given task. I.e. the so called "UNIX philosophy" [1].
Implementing something in one monolithic binary instead of two or more
separate binaries does not necessarily mean much more code. We can
always screw up wherever the functionality is.
I'm not taking sides one way or the other right now on this one?
With separate layers they can be updated separately. There is no need
for every single GPG user to update the binary if a change in some
layered feature needs to be updated.
If features live in a separate layer, certainly there needs to be some
coordination and care that a change does not break some dependant layer.
But that's not really anything new and one needs to always be careful
with such things whether with monolithic and modular binaries alike.
So it has.

@_subject: Suggestions for a Practical Scheme to Manage Multiple Identities? 
On top of all the other problems of a general purpose storage device.
I'd say just go with a smartcard or purpose built token device [1][2].
As for the multiple identities, different smartcards as needed. That
makes the reader the only device to carry and the cards you can cut
(some precut) to SIM-card size to make carrying easy. And there are
small readers available.

That's quite a personal issue to count as a failing of smart cards. That
whole rant about the reader being MIA is, /for me personally/, a
complete non-issue. I keep it attached to the smart card.
Oh, you mean like being able to use a more humane PIN / passphrase?
Are you serious? I wouldn't know but I'm guessing the computer you use
to decrypt those messages won't take too well to water either.
Sure you need a reader and sure, you shouldn't throw the reader into
water but come on. You go out of your way to make them sound like
something completely unusable. I think they add security and depending
on the user and use case they either add inconvenience minutely or the
complete opposite, they add usability.

I read both of your messages quite closely. Had you merely pointed out
the downsides of having to carry a card, a reader etc. I would probably
have just agreed with you and likely just read and said nothing. My
point was that you wrote multiple paragraphs worth of stories on two
emails from which I really got the impression that people should just
not bother.
It would appear so did Stephan.
Isn't "it depends" exactly what I said :)? I think you went a bit
overboard with the stories and wanted to point that out, that's all.
Smart cards are not some scary thing only "necessary" in "high-security
environments". Whatever that might mean.

@_subject: Enigmail speed geeking 
Absolutely. I agree. I think the difference of opinion here stems from
how I read the reply you sent. After the first couple sentences it's not
much about answering the question anymore :).
The questions was: Are smart cards a must? No they are not.
All things being equal, they do practically add security, period :).
Well, you're quite right that it's impossible to say that they would add
security in all situations. Maybe they could also weaken it in some. But
you can use the same passphrase with or without the card. You can have
your subkeys on the card or on the computer. Maybe you can fill in the
rest. I.e. all things being equal:
The card can and on defaults probably will limit the amount of
passphrase attempts. And then it locks. Is it absolutely secure against
hacking? No. But it should be quite difficult to hack. And an important
point if to only have subkeys in there that you can revoke.
I said "depending on the user and use case". It is an it depends answer.
I'm not making such a claim. The world is not black and white. Yes or no
only. I'm not talking about some theoretical, mathematically proven
statement that smart cards are more secure in every possible way. They
are not.
I don't know how you count the 30-45 second number from before but for
me it adds 1-10 seconds, maybe. Hard to estimate but it doesn't really
add any inconvenience to my use. And obviously, that's quite subjective.
I'm not even trying to make a point that they would be more secure all
the time. But, practically, they can be a cheap and convenient way to
add security. Everyone has to evaluate their use case though.
Here's an example. Is it better to store secret keys on each computer or
a smart card? I use multiple different computers and think that it's
more secure to have the keys on my smart card. So, more security by not
having to distribute the secret keys to all those computers. I'd say
that's convenient security as the secret keys come with me to whichever
computer I happen to be using.

@_subject: bugs.gnupg.org TLS certificate 
The CA cartel has specified clear and binding rules for the
participating CAs as to what level of validation is required. This is
overly simplified but they are essentially:
Domain validation (Class 1)
Organization validation (Class 2)
Extended Validation (Class 3)
Any automatically validated, i.e. some file on a URL or DNS check etc.
is a Class 1 cert. The rest require filing paper work and usually take
from hours to days to complete. And there is no reason for anyone to try
guessing which level a cert belongs to, they tell you the validation
Many CAs will be happy to sell a Class 1 certificate for 100-200$ or
more. Paying money for a cert doesn't necessarily make it any more
"certified". The CA business is a badly monopolized cartel where the old
farts have dug in years ago and are just counting the money :).
Am Organization cert is the same regardless of where it comes from (in
the cartel). They have their own auditing and other requirements that
make sure of it. And for the end user of a site it (should be) of no
concern which CA is behind the cert. Just what level of validation is
the cert. And how many users actually care? Not many (except for the
branded "green bar").

Essentially, that's it :).
There are however clearly defined hard requirements to the Extended
Validation, aka "green bar" level. That is, more involved validation of
the organization and the person requesting the certificate. But those EV
certs can be had for cheaper than hundreds of dollars per year.

@_subject: Email-only UIDs and verification 
Yeah? I don't really see much of a problem as proposed by Bob. Any
verification emails for any purpose should always be related to an
action the user did very recently. I.e. they visited a site or used an
application, whatever the route and method but they should already /be
expecting an email verification/.
Any verification should certainly be worded better, yes :).
Good ideas.

I think that fail, a signature.asc attachment, is still a "cleaner fail"
than a non-PGP receiver getting a breakdown from inline PGP. And that is
for every single email.
I have not received a single question from anyone regarding my PGP/MIME
signed emails. Not one. And I'm talking about the ones that don't use
PGP / have no clue what PGP is.
In this one I can see your email with the attachment, but also marked
with a "good signature".

It seems to me that emails sent and signed by Thunderbird + Enigmail are
displayed just fine by it. No signature.asc quirks. But emails sent by
others are displaying the attachment in addition to the normal Enigmail
added UI signature information. Ingo, Doug, Samir and Bob; I see the
attached file for each of you but not my own PGP/MIME mails routed back
to me from the list :).

There are about 7,3 billion people out there that don't have a clue what
OpenPGP is.
Why should it? At least for non-Gmail users as well as Gmail users not
using *webmail*.
Yeah? so? Not all email users are GMail users. Not all GMail users use
the /webmail/ interface. There are a lot of GMail and other /webmail/
users out there but *we really need to stop letting that drag us down*.
Those /webmail/ operators need to get their shit together and start
playing by the rules. It's not our job to do theirs for them.
And until OpenPGP breaks out even of the single digits coverage I really
don't think we should worry about every single use case. Those who care
for OpenPGP can very easily just use something other than webmail.
I just did a test across accounts sending from Thunderbird + Enigmail.
Sure, GMail /webmail/ shows the attachment. In Thunderbird over IMAP the
emails are just fine; "Good signature" and no attachments. Now Google
just needs to go and get their platform up to speed on PGP/MIME.

I sent a signed message to Daniele off list. Signature recognized fine
and no attachment. So a bug, i.e. the extra attachment, in Enigmail's
reading of mails that have gone through Mailman even though Mailman
produced MIME should be valid?

That's a "mental breakdown" of the user :). Sorry about the ambiguity.
I suppose I must've missed that we had established that?
I consider both inline and PGP/MIME equally to be something of a MUST
support for any client / plugin that claims to support PGP. Whether
support is done by the client itself or a plugin is not that important
to me as long as someone is maintaining support.
