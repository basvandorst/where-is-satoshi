@_subject: problem with ownertrust value 
Hello, i have the this doubt:
I have tried this:
gpg --local-user UID1 --edit-key UID3
and later:
gpg --local-user UID2 --edit-key UID3
But if i later execute this again:
gpg --local-user UID1 --edit-key UID3
i see "trust: dont know", and it supose that that value was for UID2, not for UID1.
So i think im setting the ownertrust value for all users.
How can i set the ownertrust value user by user for a given UID?
