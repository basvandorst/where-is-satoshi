@_subject: Keyservers and the future 
Trust information is locally and privately established and managed, and
thus does not belong on the keyservers. That process of managing trust
is not the object of my question.
The scaleability of trust management is a problem for MTA (mail
transport agents) vendors to solve.
The object of trust, however, is a key. Without a key there isn't much
to be trusted. The question is ... is the PGP architecture suited to a
load of hundreds of millions of keys, or even billions?
Are CA's and X509 certificates better equipped to handle the load?
There are several working groups that are working on email
authentication, and they are considering trust. Concepts such as trust,
reputation and accreditation are used in various combinations. Some are
bogus, some are quite solid :)
