@_subject: How to delete bad UID??? 
I have to delete a UID from my key on keyservers because the email
address is no good. I deleted the UID from my key and uploaded it
again but this didn't do anything so I figured I have to invalidate
the UID and upload the key again. But I already deleted the UID from
my key what I am supposed to do now? Is there some way to delete this
email address from my key or people will send mail to a bad address.
