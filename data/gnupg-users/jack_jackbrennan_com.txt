@_subject: Confirmation of cipher? 
When one signs a message GnuGPG will add "Hash:SHA1" or your preferred hash at the start of the message.
However a similar line of text isn't available with an encrypted text block. Is the reason for this to hide as much
information as possible from a possible attacker?
Is there any way to confidently identify the encryption algorithm used with a GPG encrypted text block?
Many thanks
Jack Brennan.
