Hi !
Has anyone managed to get gnupg-1.0.2 to work on AIX 4.3.2 (RS6000) ?
I have managed to compile gnupg only if --with-static...=unix and w/out
dynamic modules... (compiles with aix cc and gcc-2.95.2 (with -mcpu=powerpc)).
(randlinux / randegd modules won't compile).
But the gpg binary doesn't seem to work correctly. Importing a public key
works but trying to generate keys / encrypting hangs gpg (nothing happens)
and if I use ps ax I get strange awk process...
Any help appreciated !
