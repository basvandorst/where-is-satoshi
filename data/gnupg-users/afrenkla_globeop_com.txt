@_subject: encrypt with GPG 1.0.4 decrypt with ViaCrypt 4.0 problem 
A client is attempting to decrypt a message with ViaCrypt 4.0 that we
with GPG 1.0.4 using the key they sent us..
they get the following message:
Unsupported packet format - you need a newer version of PGP for this file. Problem with pgp-fmt data from armored file.
Cannot process input from:  datadump.pgp
Error code =  8
could this have to do with the single/double function key problem described
by ViaCrypt on
alt.security.pgp newsgroup:
are  there any other issues that you are aware of?

thanks for your suggestions,
It looks like Viacrypt 4.0 might be using a hybrid cipher of
RSA/IDEA and we'd have to modify our gnupg with the idea.c fix, which violates the US patent, as I understand.
Not sure whether it's the V3 RSA key problem .. have to look into

Viacrypt 4.0 is basically PGP 2.x.
See: Note that there are currently problems doing encrypt+sign functions with
GnuPG using a v3 RSA key. (I don't believe this has been fixed ever.)

@_subject: restoring a key 
our signature key has expired..
is there any way to restore this key, extend its expiration date,
without generating a new one?

@_subject: restoring a key 
thanks for your suggestions,
what i originally intended WAS to extend the life of the key.
It is a signature key, and i tried switching to it with
key "subkey number" and then do --expire..
gpg allowed me to do this, and didn't throw any errors, but
strangely enough the key was still listed as expired, with the orignal
expiration date (even tho i extended it to infinity).
at this point, being pressed for time i generated a new key pair and re-distributed public key to clients..

Neither of us know the situation and the threat model for the original
poster.  Again, he said he wanted to extend the life of the original
key *rather than* creating a new one.
It is possible, the RFC does allow it, and gpg handles it just fine.
I use this feature frequently.
Assuming he is using the keyservers.  In my work, I use signing
subkeys for embedded software authentication.  Those keys never hit
the keyservers either.  In any event, so what?  GnuPG handles multiple
binding signatures quite well.
