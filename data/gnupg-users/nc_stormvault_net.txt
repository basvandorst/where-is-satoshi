@_subject: Restoring ~/.gnupg 
I've recently made a clean installation of my personnal computer. I
backed up my .gnupg directory but not GPG doesn't seems to recognize it.
I am not sure what version I was using I think it was 1.0.6 but it could
have been the current testing/unstable debian package which is 1.2.1. I
am now using 1.0.6. Any help would be apreciated.

@_subject: ^M characters are embedded at the end of every record. 
This is not a GnuPG issue. All files created on notepad or some
microsoft editor are full of ^M. Microsoft it says. The best you could
do it not use windows but if you're addicted to this thing you could
always use an other editor.

I tried your solution with half success:
remote gpg --list-key
pub  1024D/4C7461CF 2002-10-22 Nicolas Couture sub  1024g/87018F83 2002-10-22 [expires: 2006-06-20]
sub  2048g/9FDDA627 2002-10-22 [expires: 2006-06-20]
remote gpg --edit-key nc
Secret key is available.

(1). Nicolas Couture I can not use delkey specifying the keyid 87018F83
Command> delkey 87018F83
You must select at least one key.
I even tried delkey nc and it gave me the same error
Thanks in advance!

You should consider using something dedicated to what you're trying to
do (cryptographic fs). There are alot of utils out there that are made
for this purpose. Take cfs or loopaes.
