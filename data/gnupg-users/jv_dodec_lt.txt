@_subject: Limit of maximum password length 
I'm not sure why, but there is a password length limit on 1.x version (even in the latest release), not sure why ?
An example situation:
<..set everything.. including any length password..>
For testing I got password which is longer than 1024 chars. Now when trying to encrypt something I have to enter my password from secret key, so I put it into curses dialog window and afterwards I get this:
pinentry-curses: Assuan processing failed: write error
gpg-agent[25237]: command get_passphrase failed: Too much data for IPC layer
gpg: problem with the agent: Too much data for IPC layer
Can't edit this key: General error
why ? So such long key is useless and impossible to change password, because current password is too long.
Any solutions/workarounds?

Hey Robert,
thanks for quick reply!
Well, I knew that there is a limit somewhere, but you know, having a passphrase longer than 1024 and not longer lets say than 2048 chars should not be a limit on 2012, don't you think so ? :)
To answer to your question about why I need so long psw is simple, the paranoia :)
By the way, you mentioned "105 characters and at least 158 bits of entropy", how do you control entropy when generating password ? And is it safe to use external entropy generator, say like rng tools ?

I thought that during new key generation event I have to utilize system, keyboard etc all the time, I see that I was wrong. Thanks for all answers, they are really helpful.

Thanks Robert. One more thing, I want to revoke one my keys which has very long password, but the thing is that I cannot do that as ncurses does not accept long passwords. Is it somehow possible to bypass ncurses dialog window? If not, maybe you remember from which version gpg started to use curses windows as I remember several years ago it was not used.

Ok thanks, just found that compiling gpg without agent can be workaround as well.
