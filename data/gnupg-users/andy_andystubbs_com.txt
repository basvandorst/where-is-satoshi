@_subject: Prefer a currently available signing subkey? 
Yes, this affects me too - sorry for the "me too" email!
It has actually prevented me from registering my key on keybase.io (if
that's a "thing") --- I suppose I could go through the rigmarole of
building the Faraday cage, getting the offline key out and revoking the
offending signing keys, as if it wasn't fiddly and generally inconvenient
enough already... but I really would like to have different signing and
authentication keys on each smart card I use, even if the encryption key is
the same. And of course the latest key I created is actually my "weakest"
key (for an experiment with a Yubikey NEO). Sigh.
I wish it would make a decision more along the lines of "of the keys I have
available, I'll pick the newest or 'strongest'", rather than "I don't care
what keys I have available, I just want the newest". Sadly I don't think I
have even the skills to find where this decision is made in the code, let
alone change it. I really hope it gets some attention soon though! Thankyou
for bumping the priority.
Apart from that bugbear, love the software.
