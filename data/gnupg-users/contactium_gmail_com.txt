@_subject: Problem with KMail 
I have a problem with GPG.
When I receive an email encrypted in my inbox and that I want to see it I
have the message:
Encrypted message (decryption not possible)
Reason: Crypto plug-in "openpgp" could not decrypt the data.
Error: Bad passphrase
The problem it's that it does not ask me the password for decrypt the
I installed pinentry, but that doesn't change. ?
Here lines in gpg.conf:
# Passphrase agent
# We support the old experimental passphrase agent protocol as well as
# the new Assuan based one (currently available in the "newpg" package
# at ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/alpha/aegypten/). ?To make use of the agent,
# you have to run an agent as daemon and use the option
# use-agent
# # which tries to use the agent but will fallback to the regular mode
# if there is a problem connecting to the agent. ?The normal way to
# locate the agent is by looking at the environment variable
# GPG_AGENT_INFO which should have been set during gpg-agent startup.
# In certain situations the use of this variable is not possible, thus
# the option
# # --gpg-agent-info=::1
# may be used to override it.
default-key  A13270E3
I have create gpg-agent.conf in /.gnupg/ with :
pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry-qt
default-cache-ttl 1800
Do I have to change something? ?
And what? ?
Thank you

I use GnuPG 1.4.3 with Ubuntu 6.10, Seahorse 0.9.5 and
Evolution 2.8.1 and I have this error message :
Because "can't connect to
`/home/marc/.gnome2/seahorse-akXvEN/S.gpg-agent': Aucun fichier ou
r?pertoire de ce type
gpg: impossible de se connecter ?
`/home/marc/.gnome2/seahorse-akXvEN/S.gpg-agent': connect failed
gpg: ?criture de `-'
gpg: DSA/SHA1 signature de: ? 0F70F90E Marc  ?
", you may need to select different mail options.
I don't have the file S.gpg-agent.
How to include it in seahorse-akXvEN ?
