I interpret that word, public, differently. To me just because a key
_can_ be made public doesn't mean it automatically _should_.
They may have reason--by looking at signatures on a public keyserver,
anyone can figure out which people you communicate with securely. How
would you like the idea of governments worldwide starting to keep tabs
on you if one of the people who've signed your key turns out to be a
criminal, a terror suspect, or a child porn collector?
Uploading a signed public key to the 'net is a sure way of taking away
people's freedom to keep their associations private. They may choose to
give that up for themselves, but you shouldn't slam them for keeping
their options open.
