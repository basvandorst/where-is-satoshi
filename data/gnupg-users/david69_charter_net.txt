@_subject: OpenPGP Smartcard Advantages 
I am new to smartcards and I have a couple of questions about the
OpenPGP smartcard from 1. What are the advantages of this smartcard for storing my keys over
other external media (especially if connected to an unsafe computer)?
2. Is the signing / encrypting done inside the card or the computer?
(If connected to a compromised computer access to my private key can
compromise the key itself.)
Thank you for your help.

It means that the malicious host doesn't have access to my private key
located on the smartcard while signing or decrypting a message on this
host, and therefore, my private key is safe.

@_subject: RSA subkeys 
I'm using gpg 1.2.1 on RH9. I consider generating RSA key as described:
master 2048 RSA key sign only, used for signing sub-keys, doesn't expire
- 2048 RSA sign sub-key, for signing docs, expires
- 4096 RSA encryption sub-key, expires
1. I plan to generate a new sub-key shortly before the previous one
   expires. Will my recipients consider the new sub-key as valid since
   it is signed by the master key?
2. Are there any compatibility issues I should consider?

I will upgrade to 1.4.
It may be a good practice if GPG/PGP can automatically consider them as valid
since they are signed with the master key. Can PGP 5+ handle this kind of key (master RSA + 2 RSA sub-keys)?
Thanks for your help,

Thank you atom, Werner and Johan. I will create a RSA 2048 (sign only)
key with RSA 4096 (encrypt) subkey. I understand that most recent PGP
and all recent GPG can handle it.

Hi List,
What is the difference between "gpg --armor --store" and "gpg --enarmor"?

@_subject: cant sent a sig with inline openpgp 
I have the same problem with Mutt 1.5.9i & Gnupg 1.4.1 on Debian 3.1. I
try to apply inline sig but the email is sent with mime sig.
