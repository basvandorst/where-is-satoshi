Yes, I'd put the list online somewhere, and ask for a link to it at  .

Yes. You should read the text at or some other introduction to PGP, to fully understand concepts like
the "web of trust" en "trust path". The paragraph at
 is relevant for your question.

That is not entirely correct. A missing trust path is not the same as
missing your signature on the key.
Correct. More precisely, if you are 100% sure. :-)
Not entirely correct. You don't have to sign the key. A trust path is
I would not recommend the use of that option in this context, and not to
beginning gpg users.

Maybe this solves your problem...
$ mkdir someweirddir
$ gpg --homedir someweirddir --no-default-keyring --secret-keyring foo.sec --keyring foo.pub --list-keys
gpg: someweirddir/foo.sec: keyring created
gpg: someweirddir/foo.pub: keyring created
$ gpg --homedir someweirddir --no-default-keyring --secret-keyring foo.sec --keyring foo.pub --list-keys

You may want to try something like this:
 open FILE, "|gpg --batch --no-tty --passphrase-fd 0 --armor --symmetric 2>> $stderr > $stdout" or die "Cannot gpg";
 print FILE "passphrase\n";
 print FILE "text to be encrypted\n";
 close FILE;

@_subject: Keyservers problem (win32) 
Other keyservers work fine, like wwwkeys.pgp.net .
I have a similar problem here, also with search.keyserver.net, but not allways.
bart gpg --keyserver search.keyserver.net --recv-key FBA6ECF1
gpg: requesting key FBA6ECF1 from search.keyserver.net ...
gpg: [fd 5]: read error: Connection reset by peer
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: read_block: read error: invalid keyring
gpg: Total number processed: 0
bart gpg --keyserver search.keyserver.net --recv-key FBA6ECF1
gpg: requesting key FBA6ECF1 from search.keyserver.net ...
gpg: key FBA6ECF1: not changed
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:              unchanged: 1
bart As you can see, the first time it failed, the second time it succeeds. I'm
going to trace this, when I have some spare time. For now I use wwwkeys.pgp.net
as the default keyserver (in ~/.gnupg/options).

@_subject: What's the proper way to make a key truested? 
Local-signing a key is similar to signing a key. The only difference is that
a local signature is not exported to key servers.
You should (local-)sign a key when you know the identity of the key owner.
Assigning a trust value is something else. The trust level reflects the
level of your trust in the key's owner signing behavior.
An excellent intro to PGP is on

@_subject: What's the proper way to make a key truested? 
Sign the key when you know the identity of the key owner. Set the trust
value corresponding to the level of your trust in the key's owner
key signing behavior. Signing a key and setting the trust value on a
key are two completely different things.
