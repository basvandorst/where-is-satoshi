@_subject: Problem with imported key (from PGP8) 
I've imported my public and private key that i created with=
 PGPi8.0.2.
I succesfully imported it, but when i try to sign and/or decrypt=
something with it - i always get the message that the passphrase
is invalid, and yes - i'm absolutely sure that the passphrase is=
 ok.
Could this be due to some very special characters (not directly
accessible via the keyboard) that i used in it?
And if so - what could i do to correct that problem?

I enter it via commandline, and entering it directly on the commandline, it comes out properly (but it doesn't work
either with WinPT as front-end).
So, basically i have to change my passphrase with PGP8
export it and import it to GnuPG again?
