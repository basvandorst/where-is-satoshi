@_subject: what is the option for "Use this key anyway? (y/N) y" 
I was trying to encrypt the file and it asking me this question to use this
key anyway and after giving y then it is able to create to .aasdfsdf(ASIIC)
*gpg -ea -r xxx -u xxx -o .aasdfsdf *
But I want to pass this "y" key in the above command can you please help me
which option is exactly used to pass this "y" value in single command
rather it asking after running the above original command.

Hi Werner,
Thanks for reply and I want this option to be in the command line and I am
using this command to run in different tool and when I am running it is
waiting for  yes option.
Can you please give me the exact command which should not prompt me to
enter the "y".
*gpg -ea -r abacd -u abcd -o D:\TEST.enc D:\TEST.txt*
I have tried using the --batch--yes and could not be to get the exact
syntax and getting either errors or again asking for "y".
