@_subject: Secure algorithm extension of RSA and DSA 
Hi all.
Does GnuPG support OAEP for RSA (PKCS v2 and RFC 2437), RSA-PSS (RFC 4056?), or deterministic usage of (EC)DSA (RFC 6979)?
And if GnuPG does support RFC 6979, would it also work with (EC)DSA private keys stored on OpenPGP cards which support (EC)DSA algorithms?
Best Regards,
