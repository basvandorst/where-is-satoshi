@_subject: Problem verifying GPG signatures with PGP 
Did you ever find a solution to this? I believe I'm having the same problem.
GPG=1.0.2 on FreeBSD
PGP=6.5.8 on FreeBSD (Linux emulation)
PGP=6.5.8 on Win2K
If I encrypt with PGP, I can decrypt with GPG.
If I encrypt with GPG, I can decrypt with PGP.
If I sign with PGP, it verifies OK on GPG
HOWEVER: If I sign with GPG, it DOES NOT VERIFY with PGP:
File is signed.  WARNING: Bad signature, doesn't match file contents!
Both are signing with the same DSA key ID.
Pretty strange stuff!

Problem solved with "force-v3-sigs" in ~/.gnupg/options.
