@_subject: PGP algorithms versus gnupg algs. 
Dear gnupg users,
I'm trying to focalize the different algorithms used by PGP and gnupg.
patented algorithms such IDEA or RSA but, basicaly, what it use ?
I found that it's widely pathable in order to support ElGamal, DSA, RSA,
etc... but without any patch what it use ?
If I have to teach how PGP work I could write a diagram like that:
it takes the message and use the hashing alg. MD5 in order to
it uses the ZIP compression algorithm.....
it generates 128 random bits
it uses IDEA
it uses RSA in order to encode the session key
it uses Armor Radix-64........
What are the not patented algorithms used by gnupg ? And how they work ?
Gnupg forces also the User ID to be in a standard format.... PGP doesn't

I was wondering if gnupg uses both encryption ciphers encrypting
3DES encrypts the message using a random generated session key then
ElGamal encrypts the session key ? Then DSA creates the signature for
the message ?
If the --simmetric option is used just the 3DES is involved in the
encryption phase ?
