@_subject: how long should a password be? 
Interesting article, thanks for the link. :-)
Don't you think that 8 characters is enough, especially in reference of the
article mentioned above?
I think one really important factor is that one haven't only one password.
The ideal would be for every account a different password. For that to
archive, IMHO, you need a system, which would give you the ability to
remember those passwords.

I would say a password should be between 8 - 12 characters long. But
that isn't that important. Eight characters is long enough if you apply
a) All characters alowed -  a-z , A-Z, 0-9, all special characters
b) Have a system :  For example: Take a sentence as basis for your
    Sentence (Clue): This is my 1st sentence as basis for very long
    The resulting passphrase could be:
                                                Tim1ssabfvlp!
                       OR
                                                hsysesaoeoa!
                      OR
                                                !Tpilmv1fsba
                     and so on
You get it?
There are infinite possibilities. That's the trick. Not the length of a
password is
decisive but the quality. The quality of your password decides how much
effort is necessary to hack it.
Hope that helps.

That's right, but I think there is a misunderstanding. The quote on which
you refers, refers not to the bit depiction but to the possibilities to
create _and_
remember passwords and if one wants a 50 character long password - with
the method, which I as example described, it's possible. If you can good
fairy tales, for example, than I would suggest that you use this ability.
What I try to say is, that every user have to develop his/her own
That's absolutely true and I assumed that the secret keyring is _not_
available to the cracker.
If a cracker has the opportunity  to conduct multiple, perhaps
unlimited, attempts - than nothing is secure.
Hopefully I could clarify this.
