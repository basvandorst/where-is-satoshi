    gpg --export-secret-keys > file
at work, and import the key at home.  You will then have to sign with
-u and the key id.

[Benjamin Esham , Wed, 26 Jan 2005 16:19:00 -0500]:
Look closely: those are revoked user IDs (UID), not revoked subkeys
(SUB).  Look at --edit-key and the ADDUID and REVUID commands.

Read the man page; there is some --...-fd option you can use.

Not an expert, but I don't think you can put custom text into the
"Version:" field, but you can omit it and put custom text into a
"Comment:" field:
    $ echo | gpg --armor --encrypt --recip z --trust-model always
                 --comment 'hi there' --no-emit-version

["B. Kuestner" , Sat, 22 Oct 2005 18:26:51 +0200]:
The web of trust.  (And the documentation, apparently.)
Either you personally verify the key with your recipient (in which
case you know which key is the right one), or (slightly simplifying)
you choose the people you trust with knowing what they are doing when
they sign a key; and when you find a key they have signed, you believe
their assurance that it is the correct one.
P.S.:  A slightly less inflammatory tone would not have harmed either.

@_subject: Two servers...one KeyPair 
Generate the key on one server, export both private and public key
(gpg --export, gpg --export-private-key), transfer to the other
server, import private and public key.

As you see the correct output, the problem cannot be with gpg.
Instead, it must be tar that complains.  Could it be that the tar
archive has absolute paths in it?
