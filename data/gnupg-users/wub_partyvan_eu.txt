Hi gnupg-users.
I noticed the FTP Mirrors page [1] is outdated. Many mirrors are dead,
some have not existed for perhaps years. The fair amount of confusion
that came from that page made me initially delay with the decision to
host a new mirror - I wasn't sure where to start.
Sunet announced to decommission last year, although it still seems to be
available and syncing. ftp.jyu.fi may have been merged with
ftp.funet.fi, although I couldn't find GnuPG to be hosted on Funet's FTP
This led me to believe there is no active GnuPG mirror available in
Sweden/Finland, so I have setup one for GnuPG on our mirror server in
Stockholm, Sweden. This mirror server is connected to a 1 Gbps
connection at AS42708 Portlane AB.
- - ftp: n/a
- - http: - - https: - - onion: - - rsync: rsync://mirror.se.partyvan.eu/pub/ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/
I've setup syncing to happen from ftp.gnupg.org over rsync daily at
12:00.[2] This happened to be the closest available rsync server right
now, excluding ftp.sunet.se which's future seems uncertain.
If interested, I can setup syncing to happen more frequently too, e.g.
twice or four times a day.

It's been a few weeks since my previous post to this list.
Is this the appropriate list to suggest adding a mirror, or should I try
in gnupg-devel instead? I don't even know where the source code for the
GnuPG website is to submit patches for, or if anyone is paying attention
to the dead mirrors.

Hi list.
I'm the operator of a GnuPG mirror at Partyvan. We've had a listed
GnuPG mirror for ~1.5 years now. [1]
Partyvan is shutting down next week or next month. There's some hardware
issues at remote colocation which aren't easy, timely or cheap to fix.
All of the following mirrors are affected:
- - - - - - - - rsync://mirror.se.partyvan.eu/pub/ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/
I don't know yet if or when we could return to providing this mirror
server to the public and GnuPG. For the time being, you may want to
delist the mirror from the web pages. [2] The mirror will be online
until the contract with our colocation host is terminated soon.
Sorry for this unexpected issue. Hoping to be back in the future!
