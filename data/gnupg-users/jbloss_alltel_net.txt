I  haven't reinstalled GPG after a recent hardware failure and
rebuild, but I'd be surprised to find that GPG doesn't allow ASCII
armoring of "binary" data like PGP does, and thus an "attached"
signature. I've done this with PGP and MS Word documents about a
billion times....

Just curious, but I've scanned this list for a while now, and haven't seen much mention of GPGShell. I realize it's not open source, but I feel that it's more "powerful" and PGP-like.
Am I missing something?
