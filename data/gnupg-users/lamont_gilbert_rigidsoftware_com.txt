I just removed all of my subkeys from this key.  Its still showing the
same expiration date in PGP.  Where could it be getting the date from?
Can the top key expire?
PGP shows it as DH/DSS, size 1024, created 9/14/02, expiring 9/14/03
Where else could the date be stored here?  this is a key pair right? but
without a sub key!?
Just trying to dig deeper.

I am using pgp8 on windows for whatever reason.  Its odd but it does not
seem to provide information on your secret keys.  I deleted myencryption
sub keys, then reimported them from the keyserver.  When I try to
decrypt something it asks me for my password for the key, but the
password fails.  Of course it fails because I no longer 'have' the
secret keys.  Bizarre.  You would think the program would say, can not
decrypt because you dont have the secret keys.  But it just asks for the
password as if it does.
Anyone have any idea why this is?  I am amazed that PGP8 seems to have
more than its fair share of bad behaviors.  Its such a simple program is
it not!?

Funny.  I just added the 10 year expiration as a test.  at first it

Hash: SHA1
Its beginning to look like a keyserver issue.  I dont think some servers
are liking the 'never' option for key expiration.
So either gpg is not sending the date to the servers correctly, or the
servers are not liking the 'never' option.
I exported as .asc file.  the public key export imports perfectly.  The
private key is a different story.
First the private key import has the first 2 ids as revoked.  Second, it
has the first encryption subkey expiring as never(which is wrong.)
Note, those first 2 ids were created long ago when I was still using
pgp.  but i since 'updated' my preferences so that they are the same as
the las 2 IDs.  So I do not konw what is still so special about them
they they are listed as revoked.
is their a way gpg can tell whats in the asc file without importing it?

That couldnt be the problem because the photo is only in the PGP8
keyring.  I could never get it onto a server, and infact I just lost it
since I dumped the PGP8 keyring.  all my exports to the server have been
from gpg, and I never had a picture in gpg.
so if its a key server problem, its not from the picture.
note that I updated pgp.mit.edu to 10 years, but keyserver.kjsl.com
either wont take it, or just takes longer to update its db once it
receives a new key.  Either way, neither will accept a date of 'never.'

@_subject: how to use the gnupg for authenticated logins 
if its random, then you don't need to trust it by definition.  That key
is sent so that the server can auth the client only.  no information can
be gained by a false server sending a key because the client would never
be able to decrypt it.
see above.  their is no trust in that key, servers benefit only.
The decryption is as it is today, passphrase optional.  Your first false
assumption is now mushrooming.  You do NOT care about the random key. if someone sends you a key, you fully expect them to be able to decrypt
a message encrypted to it.
this passphrase is just an old issue.  if you cant trust the computer
with your keys, you certainly wont be decrypting anything on it.
If the server is not secure, your done.  If the client is not secure,
your done.  If you can find a way around that, patent it.
I'll leave these complications to the GnuPG writers.
I said secret message, you said trusted key.  same thing.
Then you need to tell me how the server is first authenticating this
client that it KNOWS and TRUSTS, before it sends this encrypted random
Ahh, so this is the KNOWN and TRUSTED part.  I agree. The buck stops
can't this fall to a record and playback attack?
yes, not full automation.  but like ms passport is using, or like
browsers that use recorded passwords.  My objective is to trade in a
password for a PGP key.  So every time I go to a new web board or new
web store, I can trade the password they give me, for my PGP key.
This is my feelings.  I am actually telling about a true system that I
have worked on that is used in cars.  just to show how its done there. But not really recommending it because computers already have so many
encryption systems.  ssh is a dually authenticated and encrypted
channel.  Its basically what we want to mimic here.

Outlook is not a BAD program.  It does not matter what MS does, they
will always have problems because their programmers are no better than
Linux programmers, but their are a lot more people attacking windows
software to find bugs.
Its not their fault, but it is their problem.
Redhat Update, is as good or better than windows update.  It always
checks to see if you need an update and only flashes an icon.  Windows
update I have to run.  plus if i runn it in the background I cant trust
MS to not be doing something *extra.*  Plus when it finds an update it

answer is simply for MS to be faster at fixing their issues and more
proactive.  Not using outlook would be a temporary solution.
When you said education was the answer thats why I mentioned the car

What they are responsible for is making sure the scripts can do no harm.

able to do is list your own files to you and act like they can see them
too when they can not.
still disagree.  that has nothing to do with outlook, and Linux even has
a fileroler or something that can start programs based on extensions.
Again, if you start the program yourself, all bets are off.  they do not
start automatically.  Thats why .bat,.exe,.pif are dangerous files and
should always be refused.  That why the tricksters are sending .pif

while gpg seems to think the main key no longer expires, the PGP still
shows the original expire date when I import the key from various
servers.  I know the servers have updated because they include a new
encrypting key since the old encrypting key was expiring with the main key.
didi I miss something?  Why is my main key still showing as expiring
soon as opposed to 'never?'

I agree with that too.  In general the less things that are hard, the
less you have to worry about being broken.  Who cares if the date has an
error now, its not that big of a deal.  but make the date hard, and
someone may decide to base some convoluted security model on it.  And
since its supposed to be hard, who can really argue with them?
My favorite part about public key encryption is the 'public' part.  The
less that has to be secure the better I think.

I am going to list my thoughts and please let me know when I go astray.
My top level key is 0x80D20A2D, it is a DH/DSS key pair.  It expires
9/14/03.  Which part of this key is the secret part, and which is the
public part? or is it not broken down like that?
I seem to have a sub key.  I assume that is the one that is for
encryptioni.  While the top key is for signatures.  I hear someone
mention that is so I can expire the encryption key while I keep the main
top level key?  is this right?  The sub key has a different ID
0x751c3bf9.  also expires on 9/14/03.
This is all published stuff so you all can probably see it.
I have 2 IDs on the key.
(1). Carl L. Gilbert (2)  CLG I have read the FAQs and even went through about 4 months of this
newsgroup, didnt google though...What is the point of the sub IDs?  Does
my main top key have to have an ID attached to it?
When I send an email like this one, I am signing with my top level key?
~ Is it somehow associated with a particular sub ID?
I sign others IDs with my top level key? is that associated with a
particular sub level ID?
should I not have my top level key expire, but only the sub keys somehow?
So no matter which ID you see in the sig, its signed with the same key?
Thanks for your pointers, I know my questions probably sound weird.

Got it.
This confuses me.  I thought when someone wanted to send me an encrypted
email, they needed by public key.  But it seems as if they actually need
my encryption subkey?  What is the difference here?  Is their one?
So we are assuming that I would not sign a key, unless i owned the key?
This may be too deep of a question but, what makes it a self-sign?  Does
the ID share something specific that already attaches it to the signing
key, so when its signed it becomes obvious that the key is self-signed.
~ Can I identify this quality manually?
I ask because I am moving into Linux world, and am on command line now.
~ so I need to know the nitty gritty since I don't have a PGP GUI helping
me out, and I can not get a GUI on RH8 unless i compile...
Got it.
So this email is signed with my 'signing' key, of which their is only
one?  I can have many encryption keys, but only 1 signing key!?  I
understand I can revoke an ID? but what does this really mean since
nothing is really anything but the signing key.  Everything is validated
through the signing key, so you learn that my CLG ID is revoked, so now
what does that mean?  Its the same key, and if any other IDs are not
revoked then effectively nothing has changed except a sort of 'ornament.'

On windows, if you use IE5 with OutlookExpress5, you can just install
PGP from pgp.mit.edu or something like that.  PGP is easy to use on
windows, and it will do a very simimar job to gpg.  They can recognize
each others signatures in general.  PGP is as easy as you would expect
from a windows program.  gpg on the other hand is quite certainly not.
but if you learn PGP on windows first, then you will know what gpg on
Linux is doing, and it will all make perfect sense.
I am not sure of a place to get 1-2-3 instructions.  but as I said, use
PGP on IE5 and you are set.  I think M$ broke pgp on IE6 (you know how
they do).
make sure you are cutting from the plain text, and not rendered view of
html or something.  cut the whole parts in between the gpg header and
the signature.  Its not going to come out as a signed mail though
because its been modified, but if you paste it into a text file, you
should still be able to verify its authenticity as long as you have not
changed anything like added returns or changed windows retunrs into
linux ones, or vice versa.

Not sure, maybe someone else can help with answering that.  But the
method of extension of sub keys is simply to add another self-signature
to them, with what I assume is an expiration date on the signature.  I

This would explain why if your top key expires, all the sub keys expire

The CA needs to produce for you the material they used to authenticate
the user in question.  If they do not, then you have no way to identify
the person.  What you need is a personal meeting.
For me, if you will only ever communicate on the computer, then a
computer authentication should be all you ever need.  if you intend to
make a personal meeting, then you need to authenticate the human person
to the computer user.  If you plan to have phone communication then you
need to authenticate the phone number to the computer user.  This is all
easy by simply receiving a signed email from the computer user with a
picture and a phone number in it.
Note PGP does not help you trust the person you are dealing with, it
only helps you to authenticate them to a standard you must
initially set.

No, the signature is not 'humanly readable.'  It only serves as an
indicator of wether the mail has been modified or not since it was
signed.  And only to those that hold a copy of the signing public key.
Your private key should be in your private key ring, if you have created
it.  type 'gpg --list-keys' you should see your key.  type 'gpg

Hash: SHA1
Their is no need for the server to check the signatures because the gpg
or pgp program will.  If the server checked the signatures, it would
require more processing power.  Of course the server certainly *could*
do it, but perhaps they are trying to reduce costs.
a key server needs to be add only.  if it removed sub keys, then when it
synched with other servers it would just get those same old sub keys
right back.  You need all servers to remove the sub keys at the same
time.  Not gonna happen.  besides, suppose a user has downloaded a key
that you later revoke.  since its revoked the server deletes it.  now
everybody that has already downloaded that key will never know it has
been revoked..

It seems to me the only meaningful option is 3.  Any other option is

I dont agree with that because we are talking about a computer not a
person.  Either that computer is completely secure, or its completely
insecure.  Their is no such thing as a 1/2 secure computer.  1 flaw or
100 flaws, its all the same.
We are not talking about keeping the secret, only about the computer or
the gpg system, not being the one to give it up.
I fail to see why anyone would trust a signature that says I did not
completely verify this person.
Its the same issue I get at work often.  Crime is intentional.  If your
security methods are casual, you are not meeting the challenge.  Casual
security does not provide anything.  Maybe it saves you from mistaken
identity, but not intentional malicious identity fraud.
yall are saying I am not right here, but I would need an example of how
that is possible.

Encrypt to self does not seem self-explanatory enough.  I thought it
meant when I send myself an email, which I do from time to time, that it
should encrypt it.
What is my certification that the email actually was sent encrypted?  My
sent mail box does not contain the actual mail sent, but a different
email.  Somehow that just does not seem correct.  I suppose unchecking
"encrypt to self" will solve my issue.

The remote machine has all his key files today if i understand him.
