@_subject: uninstall problems 
Good afternoon,
I was attempting to uninstall gnupg-w32cli-1.4.11 from my machine. I was successful, but upon attempting to reinstall it and checking the version I am seeing that version 1.4.9 is installed. So I basically have 2 problems.
1)      I can't remove the application
2)      I can't reinstall it and get to version 1.4.11 anymore.
After the application says that it has been successfully removed I can still run gpg commands. I am running a Win7 OS (64 and 32 bit).
Any help you could provide will be great.
