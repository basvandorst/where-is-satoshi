I apparently don't have a clue and am proving it with my following request.
I am trying to script an automated procedure on Solaris 5.8 to unencrypt a
gnupg file. I am getting hung up on the --passphrase-fd (n) command; the
documentation for this command is somewhat lacking, I have found some
external references on what (n) is used for; none of which work correctly.
I have verbose logging on; these are the scrapes from the outputs.  $ ./gpg --homedir /XXXX/bin/keys_lib/ --debug-all --passphrase-fd 3
gpg: reading options from `/XXXX/bin/keys_lib//options'
gpg: DBG: fd_cache_open (/XXXX/bin/keys_lib//secring.gpg) miss

Reading passphrase from file descriptor 0 ... At this point the PID just
stays in this state; Hung.        Any suggestions would be much appreciated.
I can get the process to work if I create a key with no Passphrase, but
dosent that negate the PGP process or is the Passphrase only part of the PGP

@_subject: NAI PGP 7.0 & gnuPG 1.2.1 
I have a client using NAI PGP 7.0 sending an encrypted file. When I try to
decrypt using gnupg 1.0.6 or 1.2.1 (Platform Solaris 2.8). I am getting this
error ( gpg: decryption failed : bad key ). Note: The key I am using is
successfully run in multiple other instances on a daily basis.
I have found some information concerning the --pgp6 switch, when I use this
I get the same error.  Any suggestions?
Thank you in advance.
