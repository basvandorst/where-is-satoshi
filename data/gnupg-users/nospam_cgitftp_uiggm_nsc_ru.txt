If you use bash (and probably, most of other shells) it is secure,
because echo is shell built-in, and is not run as separate process, so
you can't see the password in process arguments.
And you can tune shells to discard saving such commands in history.

Can I manipulate PGP packets after encryption and create such message,
that if one recipient decrypts it, he sees "Happy birthday", and if
second recipient decrypts it, he sees "Private message"?  So, user

It is space character ' ' in quoted-printable MIME encoding.  Usually
mail agents perform decoding automatically.
Encoding is necessary because some old MTA remove spaces at end of
lines, and signature verification is not possible later.
Use qp-decode util or just replace =20 with ' '.

@_subject: Why GPG doesn't use filename inside encrypted file? 
I encrypted some-file.  some-file.gpg was produced.
$ gpg -e some-file
When I list packets I see:
:literal data packet:
        mode b, created 1082433628, name="some-file",
        raw data: 9371 bytes
I renamed some-file.gpg to data.gpg.  Now when I decrypt data.gpg with
--decrypt-file or without options output file goes to ./data.  (I do
not use --decrypt because output goes to stdout if I do not specify
output file explicitely).
How can I decrypt file so that original name of file is restored

As you copied ~/.gnupg from CD, which is read-only, your file are
read-only too.  Just change permissions.
I'd saved archived ~/.gnupg.  For example, tar restores permissions
when data is unpacked.
chmod 700 ~/.gnupg

@_subject: filenames of encrypted attachments visible ? How hard would it 
Have you ever recieved spam with fake From and To headers?  There are
headers and there is envelope in message, and latter is not visible to
user.  So, you can user fake address in headers (or do not use headers
at all) and real addresses in envelope (and envelope is visible only
to transport agents, not delivery agents).

May be, with Cygwin.  You have to install sendmail/postfix/exim or

mail subsystem of Windows.

Agree.  I asked just to be sure :)
All user IDs will be valid if key is valid and trusted (i.e. I have
called 'trust' in --edit-key).  I have some keys that are valid but
are not trusted.  Werner's key is both valid and trusted...
OK, I am satisfied with your answer, thank you.
Another question: is default of --min-cert-level is 1 as man-page
states?  I have different results with
$ gpg --min-cert-level 1 --update-trustdb
$ gpg --update-trustdb
I use gpg (GnuPG) 1.3.6.  The option is not changed in any
configuration file.

@_subject: GnuPG Clearsign vs. PGP/MIME Signing 
Clearsigning can be processed by recipient even if his mail client
dosn't know anything about GPG/PGP.  PGP/MIME needs mail client
However, clearsigning has problem with attachments and charsets.  You
can't reconstruct charset of original message -- was it UTF-8, KOI8-R
or windows-1251.  PGP/MIME handles it gracefully.
Clearsinged messages can be corrupted by transitional mail servers;
PGP/MIME cannot.
I prefer PGP/MIME.
