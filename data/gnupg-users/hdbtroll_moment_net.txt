@_subject: Unable to recieve public key 
Hash: SHA1
Lately I have had some signed messages that lock the system for 2-3 minutes with my firewall on. If I shutdown the firewall this does not happen but all of the messages still take a bit before enigmail shows Unverified signature, click pen icon. When I click icon it of course opens another window to import public key. I say OK the it comes back with yet another box stating
Unable to receive public key
gpg: requesting key 0x49E...... from wwwkeys.uk.pgp.net
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found
gpg: Total number processed: 0
Anyone advise on this.

Thanks Niel, Changes the config as suggested and the times for checking seem to have diminished but several of the messages still return unverified signature and when I tell it to retrieve key it comes back with no OpenPGP data found, is this because these peoples keys are not
