No. Taking part in social networks and other media is a choice. One can
a) choose not to take part at all, or b) choose how one takes part and
what information one shares.
In short, privacy of information is still real, still relevant, and
still (largely) within the control of the individual. Tools such as
encryption help retain the reality of privacy of information.
The question of privacy of information is of critical importance to
liberty. By choosing to believe that privacy (or specifically privacy of
information) is a concept that has "fade"ed you are playing into the
hands of those who would wish to forcefully strip us all of privacy,
whether we like or or not. That would be a mistake, I think.

I think you are conflating separate things with questions like these.
See Mark H Wood's comment above:
What "big bad social network"? First define what you mean by "social
network" in this context.
My earlier comment was, as I stated, primarily context of "social
networks and other media". You seem to mean something something
different by "the big bad social network".
I choose where I go and what I do, both online (which was the main
context of my earlier comment) and in the physical world. Whilst, as
Mark Wood says above, some involvement in society inevitably involves
sharing some information about oneself (and always has done), one can
nevertheless to a massive extent choose how much one shares, what one
says, and what one does. One does not need to blab everything to everyone.
To a very considerable extent, yes. It is a self-evident reality
(although what I choose to share versus what I need to share varies on
the specific context). I have not given way all control over my mind,
body and actions.
What data on FB? Whilst, as Jason Anthony pointed out, other people can
post information about me to social networks such as FB, data leakage by
third parties is not a new risk (as MFPA observed). Apart from such data
leakage, FB or other social networks only know about me what I choose to
tell them. As I say, I do not need to blab to the world about
everything. I *am* in practice in control of what I say and do and where
I say and do it.
Perhaps it is more sensible to control what one shares in the first place.

This is true and it's a good point but, as MFPA points out, it's not a
new threat in principle.
I think the key point still remains that what one shares with the world
is very much under one's practical control, if one only remembers it.
Social interaction inevitably involves some extent of information
sharing, and always has, but that doesn't mean that privacy (and all the
nuanced concepts that are contained within that word) has somehow
evaporated the first time you communicate with someone, or travel
somewhere, etc.

I agree that information sharing, especially statutorily-imposed
information collection and sharing, is a great threat to liberty.
Fighting it is very difficult without fundamental reform of state
But this still does not mean that we need to share more than we want or
need to where we have a choice, and we still do have lots of choices in
this matter (especially in the context of my earlier message).

This is a key point. The words "privacy" and "liberty" are too vague to
be useful for this purpose. The big problem is that what we are losing
is not easily amenable to rational explanation. It exists, it is real,
it matters, and yet it is difficult to explain in intellectually precise
terms. This lack of precision plays into the hands of those who desire
to remove such liberties.
Can anyone describe in clear, intellectually persuasive terms, why
liberty (and privacy is a subsection of liberty) matters? No one should
have to explain such things and yet that is what is now required.
Well observed.
Surely the metadata versus data argument is something of a red herring.
Whilst there are clear technical differences between metadata and
data/content, the fact is that when the powers that be read my
communications metadata without warrant and at will (something that I
never gave them permission to look at), it is no less an invasion of my
privacy than if they read the data/contents. The nature of
communications metadata is that it can tell people who look at it a
great deal about a person, information that may well be private in
nature. Warrantless snooping in metadata is too much.
I am also aware that there are longstanding legal definitions that treat
metadata differently to content. Well, legal niceties be damned.
Technical (and legal) differences between metadata and data/content
notwithstanding, the reality is that when my communications metadata is
snooped on without warrant and without my permission then it is an
invasion of privacy, one that is indistinguishable in seriousness (both
morally and practically, in terms of what can be inferred from metadata)
from snooping on data/content itself.
(For those who are about to point out that we willingly share
communications metadata with service providers to allow for routing our
communications to the right place, this is done intentionally and for
the purposes of routing only. It does not follow that such metadata
should be available to anyone and everything; it is still private
information that we should have every right to expect is shared only for
the purposes of communications routing).
It seems to me that a great many people believe that there is nothing
that can be done. They truly seem to think that the only thing to do is
to give in and throw away all aspects of personal
information/travel/communications privacy (whatever precise meanings
"privacy" has in this context). It's a defeatist attitude and I think
it's playing into the enemy's hands.
I know what you mean. I have faith in the longer run but I'm not going
to like the process that we end up going through to get there because
people are not taking the threat seriously now, whilst there is still
time to prevent the worst.

The strange turn of events surrounding the TrueCrypt website do *not*

seriously the claims that TrueCrypt is insecure; they seem to me to be
invalidated by the odd, non-sensical comments on the new website and
overall bizarre nature of the whole episode.
Happily it seems likely that there will now (at last) be actively
developed forks of TrueCrypt so there is a future for TC users on
Windows and other platforms.
Note that there is also DiskCryptor for open source full disk encryption
on Windows. See  I've not tested it but it does
seem to work, although it suffers from the same drawbacks that TC does

Whoops, I apologise. It should have been Last time I looked FreeOTFE had not been updated since 2010, so it's
even older than the latest working version of TrueCrypt. Unlike
TrueCrypt, its device driver is not signed so it won't run on Windows
Vista x64 or later without the OS being put in test signing mode.
All that said, Free OTFE might be a good basis on which to continue
development if the licence terms of TrueCrypt 7.1a turn out to be too
restrictive to allow a successful fork.
As far as anyone can tell at the moment, TrueCrypt 7.1a is safe and
The messages on the TrueCrypt Sourceforge website simply should not be
taken seriously in my opinion. They are so bizarre as to be of no sense,

Good points.
It should also be noted that the 'TrueCrypt License Version 3.0' (under
which TC 7.1a is licensed) includes three sublicences from included
software written by identifiable entities[1] but on a brief reading none
of them seem to prevent TC from being forked.
All the same, merging the capabilities of FreeOTFE would be a
nice-to-have for a TrueCrypt fork.

If you're uncompressing them into %appdata%\gnupg then they should
inherit permissions from the parent directory which, as far as I can
tell, should be entirely correct.
On my Windows 10, the current permissions are Full Control for SYSTEM,
the Administrators group, and the current user. (I think the

Isn't that expected and correct behaviour? You post to the list and the
list server forwards your messages (as well as the messages of all other
posters) to list members. The From address of your forwarded emails is
quite correctly shown as the From address of the emails as you sent them.
This is exactly how mail lists have worked for decades and is entirely
normal and correct.
However, due to problems with domains that advertise p=reject DMARC
policies, more and more mail lists are now choosing to munge From
addresses to show messages as being sent from the list address (e.g.
"From: gnupg-users at gnupg.org (Juergen BRUCKNER via GnuPG Users)" instead
of the correct "From: juergen at bruckner.tk (Juergen BRUCKNER)") but this
list does not do this. If this was done, it would prevent your
list-forwarded emails showing up in your DMARC report.
I note that your bruckner.tk domain appears to have a p=none policy so,
if I understand all this correctly, it should not matter to you.
In short, there is nothing to worry about (as far as I can see).
Everything is working as it should.

I must agree with this. Absolutely losing a decryption ability that many
people clearly do still require is not a sensible path, but putting
'legacy decryption' ability behind a brand new option that requires some
kind of active change by users who do need it is a reasonable and
sensible compromise imo.
In short, it is not necessary to entirely remove the ability to decrypt

This seems reasonable to me. It means that legacy decryption is still
available in current and future code even if it requires users to take
some kind of action.
I presume that one day the 1.x.y code will reach end of life. If and
when that happens, I strongly suspect that there will still be users who
will need to decrypt legacy-encrypted data and I think it is important
that they can still do this with a maintained (2.x.y) code base. (And I
realise that this is easy for me to say since I'm not contributing to
maintaining the code.)

I rather suspect they do have a life supporting scenarios that they
cannot change that require legacy-decryption capability.
If legacy-decryption was removed entirely from current versions of GnuPG
then they would simply have to continue using old, unsupported, and
potentially vulnerable versions. I do not think it is reasonable to just
cut them off entirely.
As Philipp Klaus Krause [1] and Dirk Gottschalk [2] pointed out above,
breaking backward compatibility does not have to be (and should not be
in my opinion) absolute. The ability to decrypt old, legacy-encrypted
data is, like it or not, still present in the real world and it is
therefore surely proper for GnuPG to retain the ability to decrypt such
data in maintained code (albeit whilst requiring users to take action to
make changes to their configuration to be able to continue decrypting
such data using GnuPG).
I agree with those who say that there is no need for mail clients to be
able to decrypt legacy-encrypted data.

To my mind it is at the outset counter-productive to refer to "haters".
To use the term "haters" implies that anyone who does not share one's
own view is somehow wrong and/or that their arguments can potentially be
dismissed on the grounds or emotionalism rather than rationality.
In practice, those like myself who recognise that the ability to decrypt
legacy-encrypted data is a basic requirement for many users with
archival needs do not "hate" anything. We just recognise that decryption
of legacy-encrypted data is a real world requirement right now and will
continue to be for many years, and so I think it is right and proper for
this project to continue to support this activity with maintained
software (albeit with a requirement for users to make some changes to
support such activity).
If the aim is to keep end-users' costs down then do not completely
remove legacy features that are still needed in the real world.
Decryption of legacy-encrypted data is one of those features, like it or
Go back in time and change history! What is now archived is archived and
cannot be changed. Like it or not, it will need to be decrypted for a
very long time to come. Ideally this should be achievable with
maintained, current-version software. By all means, if that software
needs to be a special-use, decrypt-only, program that is hardly ever
updated except to patch code vulnerabilities then so be it.
But do not throw your long-time users or their data under the bus for
the sake of eliminating backwards compatibility. Stability and
compatibility really do matter to many classes of users.

I agree. But remember that retaining the ability to decrypt
legacy-encrypted data (i.e. continuing to support long-time users) does
not require the GnuPG's evolution be frozen.
Your point is not helped by using patronising and condescending language
like "pearl-clutcher". What you are attempting to belittle and dismiss
here is surely a perfectly valid use case: That is accessing archived data.
Sure, I can see that it is not a use case that you like or that matters
to you but that doesn't make it any less of a valid use case right now,
today, and in the future in the real world. This is not a "legacy
use-case" as you chose to name it. The fact that the data is encrypted
using legacy encryption doesn't make it a "legacy use-case".
There is no "creeping insecurity" whatsoever in continuing to access
archival data but there would be something of an eventual creeping
insecurity if users in this position were required to use unmaintained
software versions.
So, no, it is not fair to throw these long-time users under the bus, as
you propose. No, it is utterly unreasonable to propose that they
maintain their own "legacy fork". Such users have not "imposed upon the
larger community": They are _part_ of the larger community.
As I have said in other messages, it is entirely reasonable to expect
them to make some changes (although remember that re-encrypting the data
is not an option) in terms of using new versions of maintained software
to be able to continue decrypting the archived data but to just cut them
off such that they have to use unmaintained software is not what one
should have to expect. It would be reckless.
And, as I say, continuing to support present day archival use cases does
not mean that the main body of GnuPG cannot move on. It most certainly
can continue to evolve and should do so. But those people who have to
handle legacy-encrypted data are not legacy users.

benefits but it's not (yet?) a replacement for encrypted email, whereas

not, should be deprecated in favour of Signal. This is not sensible or
good advice without considering individual use cases (regardless of Efail).

Get real. These people are long-time GnuPG users and now you want to

way. No, that's not a fair, it's not reasonable, it's not ethical, or
it's even professional.
Err... the specialised solution surely is GnuPG 1.4.
So you are saying that long-time users should be deprived of an open
source ongoing-maintained solution to their entirely valid present day
use case to benefit a private company.
Isn't that effectively equivalent to commercial sponsors taking
previously open source code base private? It's hardly a popular move
when it happens.
Yes, I know that the scenario you are proposing is not /exactly/ the
same but people will, quite understandably, treat it as such.
Surely if you can recognise that people will start screaming then you
must also understand that it is entirely the wrong thing to do.
If you drop maintenance of code that can handle the data that some
people need to cope with then they will naturally have to stay with old,
unmaintained code anyway. So dropping maintenance of 1.x will only cause
a problem in this respect, not cure on.
If you are (understandably) concerned about people still use 1.4 for
encryption of new data then the sensible choice is surely to do what
people have suggested in this thread: That is to produce a
decryption-only maintained version that still allows users who need to
access archived legacy-encrypted data to do so.
Clearly you are concerned with preventing people using legacy encryption
for new data and I agree with this concern. But there is no need to
throw present day, long-time users who must handle legacy-encrypted data
under the bus to do so.

It's not that simple. There are more use cases to take into account.
Whilst what you say is true for people still encrypting new data with
1.4 (and I agree that they should be prevented from doing so), there are
other people (perhaps even more people) who have a legitimate need to
access historical/archival encrypted data.
Preventing users from encrypting new data using legacy encryption does
NOT need to mean that other users have to be prevented from (quite
legitimately) accessing archived data using legacy encryption with
maintained software.

Not all archived and encrypted data is emails. There can be all sorts of
things. It doesn't really matter what and it's not up to us to tell
people what their system architecture should be. As long as they have
access to maintained software to access (i.e. decrypt only) this old
data (and this project is definitely the best source of such maintained
software) then that is enough to satisfy what I perceive as critical
requirements for many types of user in this category.

of users who need to access old encrypted data (e.g. archival access
purposes), which is the particular use case I have been pointing out.
However, I don't think this would satisfy those who want to ensure that
users cannot encrypt /new/ data with legacy standards. In order to
prevent users from doing this (which, to be clear, is something I agree
with) there needs to be some way to make it difficult or impossible to
encrypt new data with legacy standards /whilst allowing decryption of
legacy-encrypted data so as not to cut off long-time users with a
legitimate present day use case/.
If it is ultimately considered to be absolutely necessary to prevent new
data being encrypted with old standards then personally I'd like to see
a decryption-only program that would allow use cases involving access to
legacy-encrypted data to continue unmolested with maintained software
whilst allowing new data to be encrypted only with software versions
that have dropped backward compatibility.
In large part it seems to me that there is the usual (in discussions
like this) lack of recognition of the many and varied use cases that
software like GnuPG can be and is put to. Calls for *all* backwards
compatibility to be end-of-lifed do not take into account the fact that
backward compatibility in terms of decryption capability are still valid
use cases in the present day and should rightly and properly be
supported with maintained software.
I agree that preventing new data encryption with legacy standards is
desirable. Just don't throw other users (who need to decrypt old
standards and old data with currently maintained software) under the bus
to get to that state.

I think not.
You yourself say that the SKS system has had known problems for well
over a decade and yet nothing has been done about it. In other words,
inertia has overruled both prudence and strategic avoidance of
predictable problems[1].
Well, someone has now brought widespread attention to the issue. By
poisoning the certificate of (at least) two very high-profile members of
this community, they have brought absolutely unavoidable attention to
the fact that something needs to be done *now*. As things stand, it's
still not too late for something to be done to protect the vast majority
of users and use cases.
Good can come of this attack on you and DKG.
Yes, as you say in your Gist, the attackers could have come to you and
worked together. But I can also understand why they didn't: This
approach has made waves, and sometimes waves are necessary to wake up a
community that really knows it should be taking action but hasn't done so.
Both you and DKG are clearly furious that you were targetted (and
rightly so!) but if 'lesser' members of the community had been attacked
in this way it's entirely possible that either no one would have noticed
or that it would not have had the radical shake up effect that this is
now having.
I'm not condoning an attack like this. In the UK (where I am located) it
is likely to be illegal, and it is probably illegal in other
jurisdictions. But I just don't see a "child [...] clapping with glee".
Instead it seems to me that the net result is that long overdue action
is now taking place.
Thank you for all your input into OpenPGP. Yes, it's made you a target.
But, despite the seemingly personal nature of this, it does seem that
good can come of it.
(And for the avoidance of doubt: I do not know who was behind this and
it was not me.)
1: You referred to this inertia as "powerful technical and social
factors" which is true but they still represent a bug, not a feature.
These factors are in effect societal excuses, not legitimate reasons for
lack of action. As I write this, I fully appreciate the fact that very
few people receive remuneration for writing code or maintaining key
servers (or much of anything else connected with OpenPGP). But again,
perhaps this is also a bug of sorts. Perhaps there does need to be a way
for critical non-hierarchical Internet infrastructure like this to be
financed. Isn't Eric S. Raymond working on something like this right now?

I can see that you are (rightly and understandably) very, very angry
that this has been done and that you have been personally targetted but
it nevertheless seems to me that it is not a childish act. Its very
carefully targetted nature strongly suggests to me that is was done to
produce specific results (which should actually be beneficial for the
community as a whole).
This does not mean that I condone the act. I do not! It was a bad thing
to do in this form.
And yet, despite this, SKS is still in use and not currently fully
replaceable, as I understand it.
Is that not a problem of inertia? It certainly seems like it to me. No
natter what the issue of lack of manpower or lack of funding, if these
have not been overcome in 10+ years despite there being widely
recognised problems then that's inertia. (No, this is not
"victim-blaming". Read on for why not).
However, all is not so dark as it might seem. You go to say...
But this is good. It means that, in large part, inertia has in fact been
overcome from new directions. People have contributed to improving
things through innovation and new approaches.
It just needs to go that little bit further, it seems.
Don't be silly. I was merely pointing out how change is sometimes needed
to overcome roadblocks. In corporate circles they (annoyingly enough)
call it "thinking out of the box".
Furthermore, I am not "victim-blaming" as you claim. Lack of manpower
and funding is not what I regard as victimhood. Lack of manpower and/or
finding is just normal life for many, many projects or human endeavours
and is a natural and normal issue that needs to be overcome somehow for
any project or endeavour of almost any type to initially succeed and
then to be maintained.
In my own case, I am involved in a project that I would dearly like to
do better and it is in fact held back by lack of both manpower and
funding. However, when people tell me that I need to overcome these
issues, no matter how difficult they are to overcome, I do not claim
victimhood or say that my critic is "victim-blaming" me. Instead I agree
and ask my critic for possible sources of manpower or funding, or for
other ways to address the issues that the project is intended to solve.
And you will note in the footnote I did in fact mention an initiative
that Eric S. Raymond is working on that might, at least in part, address
issues of funding. So I have not made the mistake of criticising without
at least offering some possible solution to the obvious problem.
Time will tell. Do you think that something substantive will now be done
that could not be done before because of previous lack of manpower or
Sometimes, the obvious and undeniable existence and public highlighting
of an egregious flaw prompts the new availability of manpower and/or
funding that was not available before because the flaw was too easy to
ignore. It does look to me as if this is what might now happen.
You (and others) should not have been the victims to make this happen,
of course. That was unfair, wrong, and criminal.
I think that this is something of an extreme comparison, and extreme
comparisons always stretch reason. Nevertheless, I'll go along with it
for now: In truth, some good did come of 911. But, yes, the world would
certainly have been better off if 911 had never happened.
However, the issue at hand here is a little different. There has been no
widespread attack. It's been targetted. I say again that the attack
being targetted does not excuse it but it does mean that the dynamics of
the situation are very different. In this case, unlike 911, a very
specific and very longstanding (you did say that it has been very
longstanding) flaw has been publicly and undeniably highlighted. This
could provide, and most certainly *should* provide, the catalyst for
something new to be done; a new incentive, new motivation, new urgency.
I did not "credit" the horror. In fact I said that it was probably
criminal! It was a bad thing to do to you!
And yet, no matter how bad it was, it does seem that the attacker's
motivation is blindingly obvious and that good things definitely can and
*should* come of this shock to the system. The inertia to which I
referred was and is real.
And, let's face it, it's not as bad as either 911 or a suicide. This is
bad, but it's not a disaster. And a disaster *can* still be avoided in
this context. At risk of sounding like a politician, this is a wakeup call.

Don't know about a list of countries but this is certainly possible in
the UK (for now, at least, until the government freaks out about it).
SIMs are widely available for purchase with no identity requirements and
can very often be topped up anonymously for cash via newsagents. As for
phones, it's been a while since I bought a new phone (although I suspect
that it is still possible to buy them new for cash) but of course second
hand ones are also widely available.

I thought that too but it's easy enough to remove the code before going
to the site.
Assuming it is an affiliate tracking link then, to be fair, if you
haven't seen the site before and it's useful to you then it's only
reasonable to help reward the person who introduced you to it. (Although
it would have been nicer for it to be declared openly as an affiliate link).

Check your local laws first. I am pretty sure that doing that
(specifically the no logs bit) in the UK would now be a criminal
offence. ;-) This is the same as many other EU countries due to one of
the EU's data retention regulations whose name I've now forgotten.

It would not be a problem for GDPR. GDPR certainly doesn't prohibit all
data retention or usage. If data/metadata/log retention is legally
mandated then this will be allowed for in GDPR.

(a) It's not a crime to run a proxy in the UK or EU[1]. It's just that
there are metadata logging and log-retention requirements if you do so.
(Once again, I apologise because I've lost my notes on all the EU and UK
legislation that may require this. It's findable on DuckDuckGo or the
search engine of your choice of course).
(b) ProtonMail isn't going to hunt down anyone (unless, maybe, they are
forced to by their local law enforcement). They aren't the police and
they're not even based in the EU, so they don't care.
(c) I do not know how the relevant legislation would work if you are a
UK or EU resident but set up your proxy service on hardware based in the
USA or another jurisdiction that does not enforce logging. A careful
reading of the legislation that is relevant to your local jurisdiction
might inform you.
1: Although I fear that the UK is heading in this direction. That it,
not to outright criminalise proxies or VPNs but to 'regulate', control
and license their use. The cassus belli for this will, I suspect, be
probably very widespread evasion of the forthcoming 'porn block' using
proxies and VPNs.

The same thing is happening on the mozilla.general mail list at the
moment although with a company called 'TheFork'. It has also happened in
the past on mozilla.general with a wholesale cut flowers supplier called
Avas Flowers.
What happens is that the genuine email helpdesks of these genuine
companies somehow get subscribed the respective mail list. It isn't
clear how this subscription happens although it looks like prank-like
foul play (or a low level DoS) by third parties to me.
Back when this first happened on mozilla.general, I attempted to engage
with the Avas Flowers helpdesk staff but they seemed utterly confused. I
am pretty sure that they had not knowingly subscribed to
mozilla.general. In general, the helpdesk staff of these companies seem
confused as to what to do and don't seem to be able to unsubscribe
themselves. And, at least in the case of Avas Flowers on
mozilla.general, when they were finally unsubscribed they seem to be
unwillingly re-subscribed soon after.
(N.B. Mozilla.general isn't just accessible as a newsgroup; it's also
accessible as a mail list).

For what it's worth, I note that both Informa D&B here on this list and
TheFork (on mozilla.general) are using Salesforce-hosted helpdesks.
(Avas Flowers on mozilla.general (last year) were not on Salesforce, as
I recall. I think they hosted their own CRM/helpdesk software).
