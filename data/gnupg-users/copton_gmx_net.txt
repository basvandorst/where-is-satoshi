@_subject: gpgme: local-user disturbs 
If a keyring includes several private keys and a program using the gpgme API wants to sign some data with a certain key, may be it can't
if there is a local-user set up in the gpg options file. As a result local-user's signature is alway added. I see no way to
avoid that. Can anyone image a solution?
