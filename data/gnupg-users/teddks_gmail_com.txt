An interrogator as described in this thread is a movie plot threat. In
reality, nobody is going to torture you for your key, because there are
much easier ways of obtaining your cleartext or figuring out if you have
a hidden volume.

Nobody in any country is going to torture you for your key, because
keyloggers are much less expensive than torturers + torturing equipment.
It's much easier to just place a keylogger somehow and get the key in
plaintext with no fuss in a week. There are dozens of other ways to do
something like this.
Torture is a great movie plot threat; people can easily imagine it
happening, so they overestimate its likelihood. In reality, it is
exceedingly rare for people to be tortured for their encryption keys.
