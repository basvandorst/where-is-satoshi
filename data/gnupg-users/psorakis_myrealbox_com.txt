I use 2 different mail clients, Enigmail and Kmail and both of them do not accept my passphrase when I want to decrypt a message. When I send a message the encryption procedure is without problems and the recipient reads my message normally.But I can not read the messages sent to me.the message is "invalid passphrase"
when I decrypt the messages manually (from command line) I have no problems, the passhrase is accepted.

@_subject: passphrase still denied :( 
enigmail (and Kmail) prompts me for passphrase and when I  enter it, it is not accepted.
i repeat that in command line all things go normally.
is there something to configure on gpg itself to cooperate with other clien=
