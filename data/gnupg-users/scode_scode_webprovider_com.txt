@_subject: What are fingerprints? 
I've always wondered: how on earth can they be unique? Yes, a hashing
algorithm can make the hashes *almost* unique, but how can it be guaranteed
that no two keys have the same finger print? It must be impossible, since
there is no communication with a central server during key generation. Yet,
invarious documents on PGP, it is always stated that they finger prints are
indeed unique.
