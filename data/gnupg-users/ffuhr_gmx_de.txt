@_subject: algorythm 11 mistake mac 
Hello to all.
I have a Problem:
When i try to send a signed mail message i get a window with the  following text:
internal failure: the hash algorithmus 11 is not allowed with rfc3156
the message couldn?t signed with gpg
mac os x 10,5,6
gpgmail 1.2.0
gpgpreferences 1.2.2
macgpg 2-2.0.12
i made 2 new keys for 2 different email-adresses.
i forgot the passphrase without having a revocation possibility
i deleted both keys
 i made a new one with one of the addresses
from this point on the mentioned above mistake happened.
as long as i remembered my passphrase everything worked fine.
what ca i do to solve the problem?
may i uninstall everything?
thank you very much for your patience
and your help
