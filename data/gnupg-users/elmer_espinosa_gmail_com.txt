@_subject: error on ecrypting file 
Hi to all,
I generate key using a command  gpg --gen-key.  Then after that I want to
encrypt a file I used a command gpg -e file
I got a message " Enter the user id.  End with the empty line:"  when I
enter the user id that I put during key generation it ask me again to "Enter
the user id.  End with the empty line"
And the file is not encrypted.
Is there missing in my command.
