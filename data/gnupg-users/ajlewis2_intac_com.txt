@_subject: invalid armor header 
I installed GnuPG on my debian woody system a few months ago, made my key,
exported it and imported a couple.  It works fine with Mutt and I was happy. I
don't know what version I had at the time.  I now have 1.0.6-3.
This morning I got an encrypted message and went to get the key for this
person.  I first tried:
gpg --recv-key --keyserver keyserver.net That didn't work; so I went to keyserver.net and got the text file for this
person and ran:
gpg --import I got and error - invalid armor header.  I can't figure out what to do to get
this thing imported.
I read the manual again (instead of the little notes I had) and it said that
'recv-key' required the KEY ID instead of the email address.  I tried the
command with the KEY ID (the digits given at the site which I assume is
correct) and got that it was an invalid ID. The syntax I used was:
gpg --recv-key --keyserver keyserver.net  12345678
I did a quick look through the archives for subjects with armor in them and
didn't see anything for the last 7 months that has to do with this issue.
This morning I got another key on someone I already had and tried to import it
and got the armor error.  I tried it at work on the ISP server and used what I
think was the same key.  It worked. They have 1.0.6 on there.
Any advice on this?

@_subject: Query keyserver with email address [was: invalid armor header] 
That solves it.  This command imports as well; so I don't get that armor
error.  I noticed that sometimes I need to use small letters to get it to
work - ab12cd34 instead of AB12CD34.  Is that usual?  I assume that if I do not know the Key ID, I must go to the server and check
their email address to find it.  Or is there someway to query the server
with a gpg command using the email address?
Thanks again.  I just read that email I received this morning; so that makes
me happy.

@_subject: Receiver lost secret key and cannot read - neither can I 
I had asked the question before about finding keys using name or email
address and got 1.0.7 which solved that.  Thanks for that.
I found out that someone I sent a message to (to test if I could do it) was
unable to read it.  Seems he lost the secret key to an old key which is the
one I used.  I went to my Sent folder in Mutt and I can't read what I wrote. Is there any way I can read it?  Is there a suggested alternate way of
sending messages to cover such an event?  I suppose it might be wise to
write the mail in the editor, save it, and then encrypt it to mail - at
least if I send anything that I really might need to look at later.

@_subject: My public key not found [was: Receiver lost secret key and cannot read] 
Thanks, Todd.  That works.  I didn't get Lionel's message, but went to the
archives to look at it.  Thanks, Lionel. I put the line in ~.gnupg/options
and did a test mail.  It tried to encrypt with my key, but I got the
following message:
your_key_id skipped  public key not found
I find my key listed in 'gpg --list-keys' and don't understand this.  Can
someone shed light on it?

@_subject: Problem moving ~/.gnupg to another computer on network 
I have gnupg working on a computer.  I now have a second computer and have
it on a network with the first computer as the gateway.  I'm running Debian
woody and I have gpg v 1.0.7 on the first computer and 1.0.6 on the second. For some reason I compiled it for the first one - as I recall there was a
feature involving getting a key using an email address that I wanted.  I copied ~/.gnupg from the first computer and put it in ~/ of the second
computer - same username.  When I run 'gpg -e -r ajlewis2 test-gpg' on the first computer I
get the expected test-gpg.gpg file.  On the second one I get this:
gpg: /home/ajlewis2/.gnupg/options:113: invalid option
I commented out line 113 which is 'keyserver-options honor-http-proxy'
Now I get this:
gpg: /home/ajlewis2/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: invalid file version 3
gpg: fatal: /home/ajlewis2/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: invalid trustdb
secmem usage: 1408/1408 bytes in 2/2 blocks of pool 1408/16384
What might be the problem?  Also, is there some way I can omit using the -r
switch when running gpg.  I see 'encrypt-to' followed by my ID in the
options file and wonder why it is not just using that. I'm talking about
machine  which will encrypt if I use -r.
