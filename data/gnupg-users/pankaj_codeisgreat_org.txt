The best place start with is /The GNU Privacy Handbook/. Refer
specifically to the section
[[ Started]]
For your case, that is if you want to use shared key encryption, then
look for symmetric ciphers in section~2. Private keys are not meant to
be shared among users.

@_subject: agent refused operation when using GnuPG key for ssh 
I am trying to configure gpg key for ssh authentication. I have added a
new key specifically for authentication (usage). And then exported the
public key using --export-ssh-key and saved on the remote server
The above files are configured accordingly. And in my ~/.zshrc, I have,
--8<---------------cut here---------------start------------->8---
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$(gpgconf --list-dirs agent-ssh-socket)
gpgconf --launch gpg-agent
--8<---------------cut here---------------end--------------->8---
But when I connect using ssh, it tries to login using the GnuPG key. But
gets - agent refused operation - error. Below is the log.

How to diagnose this further?

The error was coming because it could not find the tty to ask for
passphrase. Now I am doing this in my ~/.bash_profile
 bash
export GPG_TTY=$(tty)
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$(gpgconf --list-dirs agent-ssh-socket)
gpg-connect-agent updatestartuptty /bye
In the stackoverflow archives, someone indicated about installing
pinentry-mac for macOS. This gave me hint. I had the pinentry-curses
already installed. So looked for how to tell this to gpg-agent and found
Then ran,
gpg-connect-agent 'help updatestartuptty'
