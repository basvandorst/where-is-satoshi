@_subject: Two questions ... 
Hi all. This is my first message to the list.
I=B4m using gnupg/v1.0.6 to sign my messages (sent from home,
I'm at work now). Before send the messages mutt says
Warning: using insecure memory! What does it means and how
can I fix that.
Second questions: Is possible to sign messages from an email
client like Netscape Messenger?
thanks and sorry for my english.
