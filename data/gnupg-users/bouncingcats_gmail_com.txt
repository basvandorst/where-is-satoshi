Why is that suggested?
If someone posts hundreds of kilobytes or more, I agree,
but in this case I argue the opposite, for these reasons.
Providing the information inline has several advantages:
1) all information is available in one place.
2) it's easy to quote/reference in email replies.
3) it's less work for the responders who don't have to cut
and paste from other places.
4) it avoids running pastebin javascript.
5) it preserves the integrity of the email archive, so that the
conversation can help future readers, particularly when pastebin sites
are ephemeral and/or provide only temporary storage.
6) some mailing lists strip attachments.
