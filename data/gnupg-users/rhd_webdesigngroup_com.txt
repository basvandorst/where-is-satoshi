Despite what the web pages say, this has not been offered for a
while now.  Try it; you'll get a message after a few days that PGP
is no longer availible and suggesting that you use MAIL-FROM.  I
don't know if CRYPT-PW is still offered or not.  I bet it isn't;
it's just more work for them.
   They did, I think.
   Who knows a .com/.net/.org registrar that does use a system
compatible with GPG/PGP5.5?  I have a couple hundred domains for
the first one who does.
