@_subject: estimate of of PGP keys in the Internet 
Hello Group!
I am working on a study about PGP in the EU legal context.
I'd appreciate any pointers to usage statistics about key servers and
any links that provide insight into the number of pgp keys used in the
Internet community or special countries.
Thanks a lot,
