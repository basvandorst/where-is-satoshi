@_subject: gpgsm: trust a specific sender but not CA 
Is it possible with gpgsm to trust a specific sender while not trusting the CA?  I tried putting the key?s fingerprint into trustlist.txt, but this doesn?t seem to work for individual keys.

@_subject: What are some threats against which OpenPGP smartcards are useful? 
Through an article [1] in LWN, I stumbled across a thread [2] on this
list that dealt with the usefulness of smartcards for storing
OpenPGP keys.
I understand that OpenPGP smartcards do not protect from a compromise
of the computer system that they are used with.  As Peter Lebbing puts
it [3]:
But then, what are threats against which smartcards *are* useful?
Robert J. Hansen justifies [4] his use of a smartcard as follows:
But then he also mentions his 128-bit passphrase and that he would be OK
to publish his (passphrase-protected) private key in a newspaper.  Why
then not store it on the disks of multiple computers?  Because the
decrypted private key could be stolen from RAM by an attacker?  But then
Robert also says that the computer being compromised is a game-over
condition anyway.
I got a smartcard to ssh from computers that I trust reasonably but
where I am not (the only) root to other (more trusted) machines that
I control exclusively and that hold data that I would not store on the
less-trusted machines.  From a fundamental point of view a smartcard
does not provide any additional security here, but I have the
imporession that in practice it does, because gaining access to the
remote machines becomes more difficult for an attacker (without
a smartcard, installing a simple keylogger is enough).  This is the same
kind of imperfect security we rely on in real life, for example with
door locks.  Would you agree with me?

Thanks, that?s a good point!  So if one?s concern is signing or
authentication, this is indeed useful.  However, if one?s concern is
protecting encrypted secrets that are regularly accessed (like
passwords) and can be thus stolen, there seems to be less of a gain.

Thanks a lot for the explaination, Rob.  Now I understand what you
How about the alternative of keeping small USB keycards (like a Yubikey
nano) permanently plugged into the machines that you are using?
Assuming that you trust the keycards to keep their secrets, wouldn?t
that provide at least the advantage of a much shorter passphrase?  Are
there any security disadvantages of such a scheme?
By the way, I would be still interested in expert opinion about the last
paragraph of my original mail, in case someone could spare the time.
