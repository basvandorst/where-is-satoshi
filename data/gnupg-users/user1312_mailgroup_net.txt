@_subject: Verifying Signature 
I am having a strange problem with the signature verification function using
WinPT 0.5.5 with GnuPG 1.06 (Windows binary).
If I sign and encrypt text in a single operation, the verification is always as
"The signature is good. From George Summerton user1312 (key ID
This happens no matter which of my secret keys I use to sign the text.
The problem is that none of my keys (DSA or ELG-E) has an ID or partial ID of
0x12EAD0 -- which, as you can see, is only 6 digits long anyway.  That string is
not part of the ID or fingerprint of any of my keys.  Besides, I get the same
key ID no matter which secret key I use for signing or what key I encrypt the
text to.  Strange.
Is this a bug in WinPT or am I missing something?  In PGP, I always get the
correct key ID of the signer's key when I verify text that has been encrypted
and signed in a single operation.  Does it not work the same way with GnuPG and
WinPT?  Is this a Windows binary problem perhaps?
Thanks for any advice.

@_subject: Help with PGP 2.6x Compatibility 
Would someone please publish an options file for the nullify version of GPG
1.06 for Windows that will allow me to communicate with users of PGP 2.6x?
I've read everything I can find and have spent a full day experimenting with
options -- but no luck.
I surrender and will gladly receive help and advice.
Currently, I have the following lines in my options file:
load-extension C:/GnuPG/Ext/idea
load-extension C:/GnuPG/Ext/tiger
load-extension C:/GnuPG/Ext/sha2
cipher-algo idea
digest-algo MD5
compress-algo 1
Thanks for any help!

@_subject: GnuPG on Pocket PC/Windows CE? 
Is there a GnuPG binary that will run on an IPAQ (206mhz ARM
processor) under Pocket PC 2002/Windows CE?
Thanks for any information.
