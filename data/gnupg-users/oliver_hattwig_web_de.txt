@_subject: Mac OS X 
Hi out there!
I'm new to the mailing list and watching this thread a fairly long time.
Though I'm neither a Mac OS X user nor interested in supporting a
specific given point of view in this discussion, I just wanted to
mention some more facts.
one or=20
That's not correct regarding what Apple says on its own pages
"[...] Darwin is the core of Mac OS X. The Darwin kernel is based on
FreeBSD and Mach 3.0 technologies [...]"
And even clearer from the Tech Specs page from Apples own web site
"[...] At the foundation of Mac OS X lies an industrial-strength =
UNIX-based core
operating system that delivers unprecedented stability and performance."
So, IMPOV Mac Os X is not based on Linux but - at least partially - =
based on
FreeBSD. And what I think is more important is the fact that Apple =
itself claims
Mac OS X to be UNIX-based.
Any discussion whether it is Linux-based or FreeBSD-based is therefore =
of no
big relevance. Let's sort things out and find the reasons why GnuPG is =
problems on Mac OS X, whether the installation is not working properly =
something has to be done on the code.
Regards and HAND,
