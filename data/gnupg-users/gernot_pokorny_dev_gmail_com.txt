@_subject: gpg - difference --encrypt-to and --recipient 
What is the difference between --encrypt-to and --recipient and what are
the advantages and disadvantages of using one over the other, which one
should you use for encrypting your own files and what does the following
--encrypt-to ... The key specified by name is used only when there are
other recipients given by the user or by use of the option recipient. ...
I also posted that question under stackoverflow:
Thank you

But isn't the documentation wrong for the edge-case when you specify
--encryp-to within gpg.conf and do not specify a recipient? According to
that documentation when you only specify --encrypt-to, but no --recipient,
then the value of --encrypt-to should also not be used and that means we
would have no valid command and that there should be an error, which is not
the case in the gpg implementation. The gpg that I have running simply
takes the name from encrypt-to as a recipient, which makes sense, but is
not in sync with the documentation.
