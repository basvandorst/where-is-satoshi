@_subject: Can't import secret keys 
I'm using GnuPG 1.0.6 and PGP 6.5.8. I was able to import my public key ring, but when I try to import my secret key ring I get the following message: If not failed because of invalid Key-data.
I've tried importing the keyring itself and I've also tried exporting the secret PGP key to an .asc file and trying to import that with GnuPG.  Same results.
Any advise? Thanks in advance.
