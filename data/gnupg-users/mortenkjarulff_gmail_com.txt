@_subject: Is it safe to put an encrypted file on a public web server 
I am new here, so sorry if I ask stupid questions.
I would like to use my unused storage on various web servers for
backup of my personal data, including the file with all my passwords.
Q1) Assume that I make a good passphrase, would it then be safe to
encrypt my backup with "gpg --symmetric ...", and put the backup where
anyone can get it?
man page for --symmetric say: "... The  default symmetric  cipher
used  is  CAST5,  but  may be chosen with the --cipher-algo option.
...". "gpg --version" says:
Home: ~/.gnupg
Supported algorithms:
Pubkey: RSA, RSA-E, RSA-S, ELG-E, DSA
Cipher: 3DES, CAST5, BLOWFISH, AES, AES192, AES256, TWOFISH
Hash: MD5, SHA1, RIPEMD160, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, SHA224
Compression: Uncompressed, ZIP, ZLIB, BZIP2
Q2) Why would I use another cipher?
Q3) Are some ciphers stronger than others? If so, which is the best
for my purpose? (is it purpose dependent which is best?)

Thanks. I get the point - for me, any minimal encryption would be
enough, as nobody cares about my photos of my famely.

Is it the 4th user or "user4" that has a problem? That is, who gets
the problem with this:
gpg -r  -r  -r   -r  --encrypt file.txt

@_subject: Is a document signed with hellosign legally binding? 
This is a off topic question, but I do not know where to go with it.
I just signed up with hellosign.com. It is a service where you upload an
image file with your handwritten signature. Later on you can upload a
document and they will merge your signature and document, and mail it to
the one you specified. (at least that is how I understand it)
They claim ( that electronic signatures
are legally binding, and refer fx to "European Directive (EC/1999/93)" (
As far as I can see, this document is about digital signing using
certificate and so on.
As I see it, the service provided by hellosign.com has nothing to do with
the topics in "European Directive (EC/1999/93)".
Am I right or wrong?

Thank you all!
So, a bare email is also legally binding, but it can be hard to proove who
sent it. Same for hellosign.com, it can be hard to proove who really signed
a document there, and it was that fact that confused me, I made "legally
binding" and "proove who signed" the same thing.
