@_subject: Error messages when generating new keys 
Hello Werner,
I modified a lot my Linux box these last few days:
upgrades, new WM (ratpoison instead of gnome) and so on.
I then tried gpg2 again and I have no error message anymore.
Great! Even though I have no idea what solved my problem.
In a few days, I'll have to install it and use it on
computers running Windows. Hope everything will run fine.
Thanks again,

@_subject: Error messages when generating new keys 
I'm a newbie GPG user. I'm using Linux and GPG2.
When generating new keys, I get several error messages:
gpg: problem with the agent: Bad CA certificate
gpg: problem with the agent: Invalid card
gpg: Key generation canceled.
What mean ?Bad CA certificate? and ?Invalid card??
How can I solve these problems?
Thanks in advance for your help!

What i did:
1. I installed gnupg2 [1] on my linux box [2]
2. I tried  "$ gpg2 --gen-key", chose default options
    and entered my infos (email address, name,?)
    and I got:
       gpg: problem with the agent: Bad CA certificate
       gpg: problem with the agent: Invalid card
       gpg: Key generation canceled.
Am I precise enough or do you need more info, log,??
Thanks in advance for your help!
