Why is that now undocumented?  I'm sure it used to be in the man page.

Isn't that an undocumented option too?  I've just tried "gpg --help

@_subject: GPG creates two files? 
It *is* encrypting your Word file.  The foo.doc file is your
unencrypted original, unaltered by GPG, and foo.doc.gpg is the
encrypted version.  GPG doesn't remove the original because it doesn't
know you want to get rid of it (you might only want to send someone
the encrypted version) and it doesn't have a built-in way to delete it
securely (you need some kind of file-wiping utility, which will depend
on your OS).

Under OpenPGP->Preferences->Basic you can set   "Remember passphrase for ___ minutes of idle time" to any value up to 9999, which is almost 7 days.

@_subject: (UK-specific) consultation about RIPA 
Consultation on the Investigation of Protected Electronic Information
under RIPA
The Home Office has issued a consultation on a revised draft statutory
code of practice on investigation of protected electronic data data,
which relates to the exercise and performance of the powers and duties
that will arise from the implementation of Part III of the Regulation
of Investigatory Powers Act 2000.
Part III of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000
established powers to impose a requirement upon a person to put
protected electronic information into an intelligible form or to
disclose a key which will enable the data to be put into an
intelligible form. The Government has kept under review the need to
implement the provisions in Part III. Over the last two to three
years, investigators have begun encountering encrypted and protected
data with increasing frequency. This, and the rapidly growing
availability of encryption products including the advent of encryption
products as integrated security features in standard operating
systems, has led the Government to judge that it is now timely to
implement the provisions of Part III.
Please ensure you read the consultation document which can be found at

@_subject: Getting KMail to let me encrypt to an unsigned key? 
(Two apologies: this is slightly off-topic, and I've also posted the
same question to the debian-user list.)
I'm running the Debian kmail 3.3.2-3 package and gpg 1.4.3 compiled
from the source.
As far as I can tell, it flatly refuses to let me encrypt a message to
any key that doesn't have a signature chain back to a trusted key.  I
can see the usefulness of a warning about doing this, but I've
accidentally sent a message unencrypted while trying to find a way
around the problem.
Is there any way to override this restriction?

I'll try that next, thanks!
Would lsign-ing the key circumvent the problem?  Would it cause any
other problems?

I'm not sure what you mean.  Thunderbird (for example) lets the user
designate unsigned keys for recipients in the address book and encrypt
to them.
Thanks.  Will it be possible later either to un-lsign the key or to
sign it properly (for export)?
