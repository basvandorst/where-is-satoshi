maybe you changed somehow the message... and so the verify fails...
have u checked u r verifying against the right key?
instead of cutting and then sending and the verifying try saving the text f=

missing something...
are you using GNU/Linux or any other bad proprietary, copyrighted, buggy OS=

gpg: NOTE: THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT VERSION!
gpg: It is only intended for test purposes and should NOT be
gpg: used in a production environment or with production keys!
gpg: unable to execute program "gpgkeys_hkp": No such file or directory
gpg: no handler for keyserver scheme "hkp"
gpg: keyserver send failed: Keyserver error

if I try to sign a file with:
gpg --sign -b --use-agent file_to_be_signed and file_to_be_signed.sig already exists after saying "yes" when asked to overwrite I get:
File `aa.sig' exists. Overwrite (y/N)? y
gpg: ath.c:201: _gcry_ath_mutex_unlock: Assertion `*lock == ((ath_mutex_t) 1)' failed.
and out file has 0 size...

the point is that gpgkeys_hkp is missing... I tried searching on / but nothing... only gpgkeys_mailto...

whenever I try to send or receive keys to/from a keyserver I get:
gpg: unable to execute program "gpgkeys_hkp": No such file or directory
gpg: no handler for keyserver scheme "hkp"
gpg: keyserver receive failed: Keyserver error
I have no clues... :(

done... and copied gpgkeys_hkp to /usr/local/bin (same as gpg) but... _nothing_ changed... gpg still complaining gpgkeys_hkp is not found... :(
eh... noticed that...

ahem... the point is that gpgkeys_* aren't built when compiling 1.9.10 (and 1.9.9 afaik)... they are created by 1.3.6... but 1.9.10 simply ignores them (after copying them to /usr/local/bin along with other gpg* binaries... this is the story so far...
