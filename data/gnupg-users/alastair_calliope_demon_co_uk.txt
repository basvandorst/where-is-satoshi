@_subject: suggest a keyserver 
According to Bryan K. Walton:
The 'options' file just allows one to specify default values to
various gpg options and hence save us the trouble of typing them each
time we use the software. The file resides in ~/.gnupg. See the man
A keyserver is a host that holds a database of peoples public keys.
On receipt of a signed communication, we can ping a keyserver,
retrieve the person's key and hopefully verify the signature. All
automatically (mutt allows this quite nicely for instance). Keyservers seem to be of variable accessibility but I find the
following works in my ~/.gnupg/options file ;
keyserver wwwkeys.cz.pgp.net
Hope some of that helps.

According to Johan Wevers:
If your supposition is that most people do not care whether or not
they are breaking the law, then I object. It is a serious matter,
whether one agrees with said law or not.
As the main developer of gnupg, Werner is the person who is most
likely to feel the 'long arm of the law' reach out and so his
discretion is both understandable and correct.
Best Wishes,

According to Bruce Richardson:
I've had no problem submitting keys and seeing them propagate (I used
 originally). However, I often have problems with
response (or lack of) from a particular keyserver used for lookup.

@_subject: Best way to indicate key 
According to Bruce Richardson:
I don't think there's one best way - the keyid (like below), a pointer
to a key on the net or a URL to search a keyserver e.g.
I'm not sure what headers you mean but I don't think it's anything to
do with PGP itself - probably the mailer. Mutt (like exmh) integrates
quite nicely with PGP and will lookup a key from a keyserver (if
configured) when it encounters a signature.

@_subject: Using search.keyserver.net? 
According to Ben Beuchler:
They're not all very reliable. In my experience, some work well and
some don't. I've been using 'wwwkeys.cz.pgp.net' because it seems to
be more reliable for me (I'm in the UK). As the saying goes, 'your
mileage may vary' ...
