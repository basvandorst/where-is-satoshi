@_subject: Help Compiling GnuPG 
I am trying to install GnuPG for the first time.  I am using the gnupg-1.2.2
on HP-UX 11i (11.11).  When I issue the make, I get the following errors:
types with unknown size.
make[2]: *** [random.o] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/scs_apps/GnuPG/gnupg-1.2.2/cipher'
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/scs_apps/GnuPG/gnupg-1.2.2'
make: *** [all] Error 2
I have tried using HP basic compiler and an ANSI/C compiler with the same
results.  I've also tried using Gnu's make command without any luck.
Any ideas?  Thanks in advance.
