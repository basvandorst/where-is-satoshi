hmm, just my Euro 0.02:
On FreeBSD you don't have to reboot your machine to change the IRQs used. Just do, as root :
to add the IDE/ATAPI IRQs if they are used. Replace with your SCSI card IRQ
if you have SCSI instead. I don't know if it's really secure to add a network
card IRQ there.
On OpenBSD, you simply can't add or remove entropy sources. At least it
doesn't seems obvious to me while I was browsing man pages on

Unfortunately, one should read the next line :
     Since physical memory is a potentially scarce resource, processes are
     limited in how much they can lock down.  A single process can mlock() the
     minimum of a system-wide `wired pages'' limit and the per-process
     RLIMIT_MEMLOCK resource limit.
     These calls are only available to the super-user.
     Mlock() will fail if:

is a bit odd. But since timestamps can't be trusted anyway, maybe GPG should

GPG didn't do anything in these 30 minutes, it simply waited for random data
to become available from /dev/random.
If you're working locally, FreeBSD should collect random data from your
typing, but if you're working from an ssh session, the box won't have a good
source of entropy to fill /dev/random.
You can add to you /etc/rc.conf to use IRQ 14 (IDE) or your SCSI card IRQ as a source of
random data. See random(4) and /etc/defaults/rc.conf. I don't think that
using your network card IRQ is really secure.
