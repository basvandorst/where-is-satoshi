@_subject: gpg-agent in Enigmail/Thunderbird 
Hash: SHA512
I recall some time ago I had a question as to how I can use gpg-agent
in Windows for Thunderbird/Enigmail. Since there is no release of
gpg-agent for Windows (without building it yourself), I had to enter
in my passphrase every time TB started up (I had the pass cache for
9999 minutes).
I figured out that in the Enigmail options, you can have it add string
of options before the command. If you add --passphrase " it will
bypass the --passphrase-fd 0 that it puts there by default. The only
downside is that the pass is not stored securely.

Hello, All! I use Thunderbird with Enigmail. For some reason, enigmail
will not sign and/or encrypt my messages (even when I manually click
encrypt). My keys work fine, and I can decrypt and verify already
encrypted and signed messages, but I can't do it myself. I have to
manually sign the message with gnupg. I've used TB and enigmail
previously, and it worked then. Does anyone have this problem or know of
a solution?

Hash: SHA1
Did you try using an environmental variable instead of using the registry?
Assuming you're using WinXP, open up the system properties
(right-click "My Computer">Properties). In the "Advanced" tab, click
the "Environmental Variables" button on the bottom. You should now see
a popup with 2 panes, one on top and one on the bottom. If you have
admin access, open the "Path" variable. You going to want to add the
path to the GnuPG EXECUTABLE (not the keyrings, unless they're in the
same folder) at the end (make sure that you separate your addition
from the string before it with a semicolon [;]. look rest of
the "Path" variable to see an example of how they are separated). For
example this is my "Path" variable before the addition:
Notice the semicolons between them and the lack of spaces. This is
what mine looks like with the addition (just replace my GnuPG path
with whatever yours is):
Make sure that you do NOT put it in quotes (as we are used to doing in
the command prompt when a filename had spaces). What the "Path"
addition does is it tells the Windows Shell where to look for
executable files (like when you say "cmd" at the "run" dialog, it
looks in \windows\system32 for "cmd.exe"). So now when you type "gpg"
(no quotes) at the "run" dialog or from a cmd prompt, it will run
"gpg.exe." If you don't have administrator access to the computer, you
can just add a new variable named "PATH" in the top pane (user
variables). Just add the GnuPG exec path to that.
The second thing to do is add one last variable. This one doesn't
normally exist in Windows so you must create a new system (or user)
variable named "GNUPGHOME" (case-sensitive). The value for that
variable is going to be the directory of you GnuPG keyrings (i.e. my
GNUPGHOME variable's value is "d:\gnupg" (no quotes), as that is the
folder where my keyrings are).
Once those variables are changed/added, just "OK" out of the remaining
dialogs until System Properties is closed. You don't have to restart
or anything.
P.S. the environmental variables override the registry settings, so
you don't have to worry about cleaning them up.

@_subject: gnupg-agent not working... 
Hash: SHA1
I am using Thunderbird with the Enigmail extension. It gets annoying
to me to have to enter in my password every time I want to send a
signed (every email) or encrypted (only some) email. Sure, it saves it
for 5 minutes idle time, but it's not like someone is going to go on
my computer and send emails signed by me as it is a private computer
which only I have access to. In the past I have used the gnupg-agent
to not have to enter my password and it worked, but now it doesn't. I
do not know why. I have GnuPG 1.4.3 under Windows XP (I have it for
SUSE 10.0 also, but I haven't tried it on that machine yet.).
Thunderbird is 1.5.0.4 and Enigmail is 0.94.0. Thanks.

I've always wondered how to get comments put under the signature

@_subject: signatures 
Hash: SHA1
What I meant was to add a comment after the header for the OpenPGP
signature of a file. For instance when you cleartext sign an email
(like this one) there are comments under the "BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE"
header. I've figured it out though is enigmail. In the preferences for
enigmail where it asks for the GnuPG executable, you can have enigmail
append command line options. I just added the option "--comment [my
comment]" so any time it signs an email, it will add the comment.

If I *do* use DSA/ElGamal, what bitrate should I use? I know there are
FAQs and documentations that say to use a certain bitrate, but I would
like to know the reason behind that...

I already sent out the revocation signature to the keyservers.
I've already decrypted all the files that I can think of. I'm also
keeping the floppy with the original (before it was revoked) secret key,
and the revocation certificate in case I come across another file.

does it encrypt text or something?

I'm trying to make a shell script that would run in my  that

I'm using KDE, sorry. But I do actually use KGPG, which is (I'm
guessing) the KDE equivalent of Seahorse. That is what I currently use
to encrypt/sign/... my clipboard. But I have to go through 20 million
steps in order to do that (copy input, click KGPG's Kicker icon, paste
the input into KGPG's editor, click encrypt/sign/..., choose the key
to encrypt it to (or my secret key for signing), copy the output to
the clipboard, close the editor, paste the output to wherever I needed
it). It becomes a pain in the ass to do *all the time*. I wanted to
make a script to do all that in three steps (copy input, run script,
paste output).
I realized that KDE's clipboard program, Klipper, supports "actions".
I.e. if it receives a clipboard entry beginning with a particular
reg-exp, it will execute a certain action, or something like that. I'm
not sure, but I'm investigating it.

It is... and it gets worse after *every* email I encrypt (which is quite a few)
I'm *always* in a programming mood! :) But unfortunately, I don't know
QT. Right now, I'll get by. I think there was a program I heard about
somewhere that enabled the clipboard to be read from the console.
OR.... Google could always code some kind of GnuPG encryption feature
in their Gmail UI (which I am waiting for, and have suggested it to
them many times). I know about Freenigma, but it is too
"proprietary"/one-sided (it doesn't let you import your keyrings, and
it locks your account with a custom created key)

I use the gpg-agent to store my passphrase. The problem is that my

How would I get that to work correctly?
I use Psi v0.10 (which uses GnuPG encryption and the gpg-agent). Would
that have anything to do with it?

Maybe I can encorporate the "fade to binary" into the GnuPG logo.
Along with the lock in the gnu's nose. I was also thinking that I
could do something with the gnu with the lock as an earring. I'll do
one draft with the nose idea and another with the earring to see which
looks better.
Also, one question. Should the icon be detailed enough to be big (like
the gmail logo:  Or
should it be smaller and less detailed (for use as a program icon or
small logo (like the small gmail logo, which is the "m" in the gmail
logo by itself)?
I was thinking do two versions, maybe have one big and one small (like
the big "Gmail"/small "m"; or the abiword logo which has "Abiword"
with the special "A" which can be used as a logo itself). Maybe have
the gnu with the lock in a bigger logo (for the website, etc.) and
then do a smaller, less detailed one with the gnu/lock geared more
towards program icons (like 16x16 or 32x32 or 64x64).

What I can do is focus on making a hi-res logo for the website (which

I can, after I finish the hi-res, convert it into a small icon.

There is a small program called Locknote (tinyurl.com/25q3m2).
It is a Windows executable (AFAIK it does not work on Linux,
unless Wine would work). It is a simple text editor that
encrypts itself when you close it. I'm not sure how secure it
is, but it seems alright (256-bit AES symmetric). I just wanted
to put that out there if you wanted to try it.
Note: the executable file saves to itself (the editor itself is
the document) so i'd make a backup of the original executable to
make more docs.

I just realized something. You have the option to NOT use swap
space in Linux. Does this mean that there is no memory written
to disk? If so, then it might be plausible to either have a
dedicated machine with no swapfile for the encryption or
temporarily turn off swap for the encryption/decryption process
and then re-enable it after.
