@_subject: What can I expect at a Key Signing party? 
You will be able to tell that I am a newbie as far as PGP and GnuPG are
concerned, though I have it running on my machine now (not with this
MUA, though).
If I want to get people to sign my public key, it seems that the best
way would be to go to a Key Signing party. What do I bring? What do I
get back.
It seems to me that I should need to prove who I am. A photo-ID, such as
a U.S. (in my case) passport should suffice for that, I guess. I suppose
I should also bring a floppy disk with my public key (armored, I guess)
on it would also be needed.
At the end, do I come home with a floppy with my public key, signed by a
bunch of people whose photo-id I have checked to put back into my public
key ring, and after that, to export it to various key servers? Or is
that done at the party?
Is that it? It does open up questions.
How do people know that the e-mail address in the public key is really
mine? I could have put anything in there, is really me. Since my e-mail
address is jdbeyer it might be pretty likely that that is
really one of my e-mail addresses, but if my e-mail address were
something cutsie like sweetipie there would be no reason to
believe it. Similarly if I put press in there.
Do I have to verify the photo-id of everyone there? and verify that
their e-mail address is one that is really there? How do I do that with
cutesie e-mail addresses?
So how are these issues usually handled?

I could not imagine bringing a floppy with my private key anywhere
(other than to my safe deposit box) unless it were someone that I REALLY
TRUSTED; i.e., perhaps one of my sisters. (But since she runs Windows,
while I trust her, I might not trust her machine.)
If you examine a person's ID and compare it with his printed 'gpg
--fingerprint' and perhaps sign that with a pen, why is it necessary to
read off names, keyids, and fingerprints? What errors would be caught?
What does signing (as contrasted to trusting) mean? It seemed to me that
signing implies that you are convinced the public key whose fingerprint
you have really and truely belongs to the person whose ID you have
checked. I do see a problem here that I do not know how to solve: I know
the person who handed me the slip of paper with the gpg fingerprint on
it is the one whose name is on the passport (or whatever it was) because
the pictures match, say. It is likely, but not certain that the
 is truely that of the guy on the passport because it
Anthony Brian User on the passport. So it might really be his. But it
might just as well belong to Albert Barnaby User and Anthony Brian is
trying to hijack his signature. Perhaps nothing can be done about this.
Now if I personally knew Anthony, perhaps I could be sure that he would
not be creating a signing key to impersonate someone else, but at a Key
Signing, it is quite likely that I know none of the other people.
So let us say I meet you at a Key Signing and hand you a slip of paper
that says:
GnuPG and PGP key information for Jean-David Beyer.

Regimented Whimsey)              Fingerprint: CC3C 3A4D D593 3491 DA41  8FE9 3EDB B65E 9A2F
The public key for this can be obtained at the following sites,
among others:
and perhaps you hand me a similar slip of paper.
Now if I send you an encrypted e-mail using the public I got for you by
looking up mwl+gnupg on a keyserver, someone will get it;
presumably you, and only you should be able to read it. Is what protects
you from erroneously signing my public key the fact that the email came
to you from jdbeyer Certainly the fact that I have
your public key gives you no assurance. Can you really trust the From:
or Return Path: headers? I guess a man in the middle would not be
expected to do this on the off-chance of catching this exchange. Is the
unlikelyhood of this sufficient to induce you to sign my key?
And symmetricly if you want me to sign yours, of course.
It would seem the polite thing to do. I thought it was not possible to
update someone's public key other than your own. I am new at this and
could be wrong about this.

1024g key to replace EEF02424 and export it to some keyservers. But what
happens to the e-mails I have received (assuming I have kept them) that
have been encoded with EEF02424? I would not want people sending me new
email with EEF02424 after that key expires, and I suppose they will not.

delete it from my private keyring)?

@_subject: key security 
I keep mine on the hard drive (with a backup on a floppy, and it gets
backed up along with everything else onto backup tape daily). Bear in
mind that to get at it, the attacker must:
1.) Find out my login and password, OR
2.) Find out the superuser password, 3.) AND guess my passphrase that is fairly long and is composed of two
nonsense words with screwball capitalizations.
Furthermore, this is essentially a single-user machine (though there are
a very few other users (mainly my sister) who very seldom log in.
Rather than guessing my superuser password or my login and password, the
would-be attacker should steal my backup tapes and find a computer with
a similar tape drive, or find my safe-deposit box key, guess my bank,
and get the floppy from there. (S)He would still have to guess my
I.e., my system is not foolproof. Furthermore, I know no one who cares
enough about security to get PGP or GPG, and only one who has a VeriSign
digital signature certificate, so I guess it does not really matter.

Red Hat's up2date updated my Mozilla from 0.9.9 or something like that to 1.0.1-2.7.3 recently. It would not update until I uninstalled some rpms from Enigmail. I am running Red Hat Linux 7.3, with all the updates I would expect to get from their up2date program.
So I went to Enigmail's site:  and tried to download the stuff for 1.0.1 Red Hat, and the stuff will not install. This is what they say, apparently for me:
If you are using a Mozilla 1.0/1.0.1, or Netscape 7 on Windows, Linux, or Solaris, choose (other systems snipped):

I suppose the trouble is that I am using a Red_Hat_7.3 Mozilla build from Red Hat and not from Mozilla.org. Do I just wait around for them to come up with new RPMs that will use mozilla 1.0.1? The previous Mozilla build (the 0.9.9 one) worked with the enigmail rpm download.

missing from my keyring. This is not a surprise.
I should be able to click on that question mark and have it download a
signature from a keyserver. I stuck in the following keyserver that

which is, of course, excessive. I put the key in so someone receiving this can look the key up. I put a keyserver in there with the key correct, since many keyservers have mine either wrong or very out of date, and the fingerprint for what seems to me to be a very weak reason.
If I were to receive a GPG | PGP signed e-mail, I would still be in doubt if the person who sent it to me were really the person I think it was. And so far, WOT not withstanding (there is only one person in my WOT, and I do not know him well enough to be sure how strict he is with his signing other people's keys, and I know NONE of the people on his publically available key. So basically I have no web of trust. Of course none of my correspondents take security seriously anyway, and none have keys of either the PGP or VeriSign type, so I really get no use out of it other than trying to set a good example.
The only way that I can think of is to speak with the sender over the telephone, provided the sender is someone I know, and whose voice I can pretty unambiguously identify, and exchange a few obscure facts. Even then, though, I must assume such a person is not under duress, but I do not think I am _that_ paranoid.

Chicken and egg problem. In addition to a GnuPG public-private key pair,
I also have a VeriSign digital certificate. Web sites can query me for that and it would be unnecessary for them to ask for a login and password. But I know of no web sites that do that.
I imagine the problem is that no web site wants two mechanisms for user authentication, and until a large majority of the public has such certificates, the method used by VeriSign (and others) will not be used.
Similarly for PGP or GnuPG: until the majority of computer users our there are using them, and their keys are in the web of trust of the web site operators, the web site operators will ignore these too.
After several years, I have actually met someone who has a GnuPG public key in person. (We exchanged fingerprints after examining each others' passports.) At this rate, all this encryption and digital signature stuff will be used mostly by hobbyests amusing themselves, and in certain very specialized situations.

If I were running a police state, I would prohibit encrypted e-mail, and
anyone using it would be presumed, ipso facto, to have something to hide
and I would chop off their heads.
Now if everyone used encryption for every email; i.e., if encryption
were a standard instead of something people who were just paranoid
flakes like me, or conspiracies of criminals, they would have a tougher
time prohibiting it. E.g., if Microsoft made encryption the rule,

When I had Red Hat Linux 5.0, I had that problem just logging onto the
machine until I discovered that it interpreted the numbers across the top of the keyboard as different from the numbers on the number pad. I have not seen that since the login-password part of that version of Linux, but perhaps something like that was happening to you???

I do not know that, but it seems in the same category, and possibly
worse than, those who send an email encrypted to those whose public keys they know, and unencrypted to the rest of some mailing list.
Or even if the sender does not make that mistake, one receiver could decrypt it and send it to others unencrypted.
It seems to me you must really trust the person to whom you send encrypted e-mail, and to trust their computer systems as well. I could imagine myself being paranoid enough never to send encrypted stuff to people whose machines run Microsoft Windows, for example. As if I knew anyone who gave a hoot about security and encryption anyway. 8-(

It looks like my new ISP is in a number of blacklists, which is not
uncommon for DSL and cable modem providers, unfortunately.  As you've
discovered, these lists have a high (I would say unacceptably so) false
positive rate.  I too run spamassassin, but use only the local
content-based filters and the bayesian filter, in order to stop
misfiling legitimate email like this.
What would the spam score have been based upon content-filters alone?

Simililarly, I brought my US Government Passport that had my picture in it and I even wore the same sweater that I wore when the picture was taken. He brought his fingerprint, as I did mine. We then exchanged signed encrypted e-mails where I sent him a message with an encrypted string in it that looks like something the password in the /etc/shadow file which he encrypted and sent back. It matched.
But really, I do not know who he is. I am not claiming I signed his key with insufficient care. But I may have. I know he has access to the private key corresponding to the fingerprint he showed me. Is that enough? For all I know, the poor owner of the machine(s) where that secret key resides is tied up in a warehouse somewhere, and this guy is a fraud. (I really doubt it of course, but if forced to testify in court, I could not really swear to it.)
So I have signed only one person's key, and only he has signed mine. I get no use from gnupg because no one I know has the slightest interest in secure communications. I would like to believe this is more than a hobby for some propeller heads (even though I am considered to be one of them), and _it should be_. Why is it that so many people make paranoid sounds about security but will not take even the first steps to get some?

I went to where the secrets were kept, told my name to the person at the desk at the front door, where guards with submachine guns were standing around, and they asked where my clearance was. I told them Johnsville, MD., they telephoned someone, and I walked in. They did not even check my driver's license (no photo id in those days) to see if I were who I said I was.

and disable any ability to save the decrypted mail with the mail user agent,
I do not see how it would be possible to stop the reader (i.e., the person,
not the program) from copying and pasting that decrypted email; e.g., by
pressing a save-screen button, or by simply copying and pasting with the

My guess is that if someone serious about this, such as a large government
agency, were to do it, they might do something really simple, like replace
some board in your machine (modem?) with another one just like it but with
the keylogger on it. It would see everything going down the ISA or PCI bus
of your machine and do what needs to be done. And if they were _really_
_serious_, the replacement board would look exactly like your present one,
but the keylogger would be between something else and the board, or a new
chip would be there that did everything it used to do and keylogging
besides. Unless you check the board everyday with a large magnifier, for the
obvious; or just replacing them all from a private stock hidden from this
hypothetical large government agency, you would not stand a chance of
finding it.
So you better have your machine in a suitably armored steel box, preferably
at a secure alternate location, one that locks with an unpickable lock.
Thank you for clearing up that point.
Once a computer or other device that needs secure access is sufficiently
protected, it becomes cheaper for a large government agency to resort to
bribery or torture to get the information it wants. Assuming they do not
wish to try bribery, are you sure you want your machine that safe?

It is pretty easy once they have the passphrases or private keys. And once a
suitable keylogger is in there, they get them very easily.
I imagine if the NSA really wanted to decrypt a gpg-encrypted message, they
have the resources to do it. It would probably take them a while if they had
to use brute force (and perhaps that is what they would do, again, if they
felt the information was actually worth it). Probably no one on this
newsgroup actually knows how much compute power the NSA has at its disposal.
At one time, the budget of the NSA was about 10x the budget of the CIA (to
the great annoyance, apparently, of the DCI). I imagine a lot of their
budget was spent on computing equipment, general purpose and special purpose.

In there, it says, in part:
"If so, that means most intelligence agencies can probably already crunch
most common key sizes. It still means that the capability is likely limited
to intelligence agencies, which is some comfort for many of us, but not of
comfort if you happen to live in a country where civil liberties are not
well respected and keys and data are considered to be "on loan" to citizens
- - you be the judge on that call."
The trouble with that is that in such countries, using any encryption will
probably call attention to you, even if you are only encrypting grocery
lists and dentist's appointments, and the penalties can be severe. No point
having encryption so secure that the government will find torture to be a
cheaper way of getting the information it feels it needs.

I had an occasion to work on a large project that management said had to run
IBM IMS/DB (hierarchical model) almost 10 years after the relational model
came out. We had lots of problems because the transaction handling provided
by IMS did not handle transactions as perceived by the users, so if nothing
were done, concurrent updates would be a problem. There were to be something
like 5000 clerks entering transactions from all over the country. I figured
out a way to provide locks for the transactions the users perceived (which
involved several database transactions) to solve this. But it required 8
bytes per record. They argued that the disk space required for the locking
procedure was excessive, and that the IO cost would cripple the system. I
argued that the indices and the rest of the data in the records was so large
that no one would notice the 8 bytes, and the locking procedure required
only one more IO per transaction. They said that would double the IO cost,
but I counted the IOs required and they went up from 19 to 20, or almost 5%.
Management was not convinced, so I took it all out of the code. They said
the odds against the concurrent update being a problem were a million to
one. I calculated it to be far less than that, but that even using their
number, we would have a problem every week or two. They ignored me, and the
first problem was detected in only a few days. By then it was too late to
change anything as there were hundreds of programs relying on the structure
of that database and nothing could be changed. They decided to use manual
methods to prevent concurrent updates. I got off that project, fortunately,
so I do not know how they figured out how to coordinate 5000 employees
scattered all around the country by manual methods.
In your case, it might be that the encrypted records will actually be
shorter than the unencrypted ones, since gpg compresses the things. But for
security, it is difficult to imagine a program enhancement applied after
sensitive data has been stolen that will get it back, is it not?
I feel pretty cynical about corporate management. Perhaps there are well
managed corporations, but they must be in the minority.
