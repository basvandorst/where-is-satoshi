Attempting to export individual keys to a file fails silently.
I can list keys in both the public and secret keyrings without
any problem. I can encrypt and decrypt messages without any
problem (I have not tried every key yet, however). I can not
do anything that would change a key ring, however.
Any ideas about the cause, or even better, a solution?
