@_subject: public key used by many users on a single system 
I'm currently working on setting up gpg for it to encrypt documents my software is producing.
Basically, I only require the signed public key from a client in order to encrypt my data. My problem lies in the fact that multiple users log on to the computer (windows  server 2003/2008/2012).
Let's say I have users a and b. Both user will send to the same 'c' user for which I have the public key.
What is the best way for both users to have access to the key ?
Should I log on to each user and use gpg -import ?
Or is there a better way ?
