@_subject: [gpgol] bug in GPA during decryption 
have installed Gpg4win 2.0.1 (2009-09-28). Default setup.
am running windows XP SP2
outlook 2003 -(11.8206.8221) SP3
I managed to create the keys and import someelse key.
No pbm sending encrypted email - they are ok at the destination, but cannot view them in the sent items folder locally (see error in the capture).
Cannot view encrypted received emails also with the same error.
Any advise will be greatly appreciated.
Have a great day, Beno?t Andry
