@_subject: Newbie: Sharing GnuPG info betn Windows and Linux 
I am a newbie to Linux and GnuPG and I have only today downloaded: GnuPG Windows Installer, GnuPG Linux Source Code, GnuPT and GPG Shell. I have Windows XP, SuSE 9.3 and Fedora Core 4 running on my system.
First I have created my public and private keys using KGPG on SuSE 9.3. (I always use KDE.) Now I wish to transfer this to Windows and use the same keys from both Linux and Windows.
I have read The GNU Privacy Handbook PDF file, but it gives all instructions based on the command line, and does not help me beyond how to create keys etc.
I wish to use PGP encryption on:
  SeaMonkey Mail Client
  Explorer
  SeaMonkey Mail Client
  KMail
  Konqueror
Please advise me how I should proceed.
Thank you.
