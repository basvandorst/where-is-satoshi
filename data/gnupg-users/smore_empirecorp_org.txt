@_subject: Build of gnupg-1.0.7 on Solaris 
I am having problems building gnupg 1.0.7 on Solaris:
global register use not covered .register pseudo-op
global register use not covered .register pseudo-op
global register use not covered .register pseudo-op
Then I tried with CFLAGS=
cc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I.. -I.. -I../include -I../intl      -DIS_MODULE
-shared -KPIC -o rndlinux ./rndlinux.c
"./rndlinux.c", line 226: warning: assignment type mismatch:
        pointer to void "=" pointer to function(void) returning int
ld: fatal: option -h and building a dynamic executable are incompatible
Is there someway to fix this or should I try to compile an earlier version ?

@_subject: gnupg and egd 
I am trying to compile gnupg so that it only uses the Entropy Gathering
Here are the flags I send to configure:
After it is built I try to encrypt a file even though I do not have my egd
I expected to get an error message saying that it can not get random data,
instead it looks like it encrypted the message.
Is there a different set of arguments I should be using to configure ?
