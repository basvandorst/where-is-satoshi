@_subject: Key signing with non-primary UID 
I would like to sign someone's key with my non-primary UID.
Why? To reflect that given UID is the one I use when contacting owner
of the key I want to sign.
I failed to find how I can do it, though.
Previously, I asked about this on  IRC channel a few days ago.

The topic has not been brought up later, so now I'm reaching the ML.
I'm using GnuPG 2.1.10. Is it possible nowadays to do what I want in it?
If we can select whether we want to sign particular UID of someone's
key, then I think we should be able to select which our UID will be
used during key signing.
P.S. Please CC me, I'm not on the ML.
