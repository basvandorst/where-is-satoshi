@_subject: Help on the gpg usage. 
Hi there:
I just compiled gnupgp-1.0.4 on my solaris system with the
Meanwhile, I also installed EGD into my system because the configurator
said that the unix random generator is not good enough. After starting the
EGD daemon, I tried to create my new key by gpg. But it doesn't work.
The error message is shown in following:
sh>  gpg: fatal: can't connect to `entropy': No such file or directory
     secmem usage: 2272/2272 bytes in 7/7 blocks of pool 2272/16384
Actually, there is such a file in ~/.gnupg directory. However, it is empty
and I can't open it. And, in directory, GNUPGPPATH/lib/gnupg, there
is no file named as "rndegd". What's wrong with my PGP?
PS: please CC to me.
