@_subject: Question about a perfect private Key store for today's environment 
Hi all.
Due to the fact that more and more users, including me,
want to use pgp and smime for end-to-end-encryption I asked myself the What could be a perfect or at least a very good storage of the
private Key.
What could be a secret use of the pgp and smime technology implemented today's user environment.
My definition of "today's user environment":
1.) Private  mobile device, tablet, notebook with private E-Mail program
2.) Business mobile device, tablet, notebook with company E-Mail program
     with company key and private key
3.) Private  mobile device, tablet, notebook with Web mail only access
4.) Business mobile device, tablet, notebook with Web mail only access
5.) more to defined
There are for different clients different tools available but the problem from my point of view is that you must always add your private key into the different clients.
This is a lot of work and sometimes not possible as in point 3+4 Point 1+2 are also not very secure due to the fact that nobody knows what really happen on such devices.
There are some HW-Solutions like
but how could this or other HW-Solutions be usable along with Point 1+2 In case you have your own server with your own web mail solution like roundcube, Horde or any other and you have secured your private Key on this server then you have a solution for point 3+4  but not for 1+2.
What solution is available for public Web mail providers like gmail, gmx, hotmail, .... .?
In this case there must be a way to sign the message with the private key on disc or USB-Stick.
 From my point of view I don't see a secure and usable solution for the most users out there.
Maybe I have the wrong point of view.
I'm sure that I don't know not all possible solutions.
What are your opinions about the thought above?
What are your solution which you use?
Thanks for reading and looking forward to your answers.

Thank you for your feedback.
I'm not sure how much 'normal' or mass user are able to use this OS.
Maybe there is a possibility to get pre-installed Replicant OS for the main stream, like the current devices with the pre-installed Vendor OS.
Currently i don't know this possibility.
Do you see any other solution for the users to use safely the private Best regards

Ok, that sound possible for people which have linux or unix experience, not the 'normal' mainstream user.
The other question was how can a user could use such a key to sign or encrypt his or her mail on e.g. Smartphones?

today a message from german site heise have pointed me to a google openpgp solution.
End-To-End is a Chrome extension that helps you encrypt, decrypt, digital sign, and verify signed messages within the browser using This is the source code for the alpha release of the End-To-End Chrome extension. It's built upon a newly developed, JavaScript-based crypto library. End-To-End implements the OpenPGP standard, IETF RFC 4880, enabling key generation, encryption, decryption, digital signature, and signature verification. We?re releasing this code to enable community review; it is not yet ready for general use.

Have anybody seen this plugin or maybe used it?

Hi Robert.
As a long time reader and partly gpg user I would like to thank you for
the post.
I do not want to create a conspiracy theory but it's wiggy that
EFF favors *NO* security ,pgp or s/mime, instead to fix the current
possibilities and promote signal.
As serveral people mentioned in the different Internet medias is signal
not a replaceable for e-mail, until the signal company does not offer a
own e-mail service.
That's just my gut instincts the future will share some lights into this
EFAIL scandal.
Best regards
