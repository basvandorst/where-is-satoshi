Thank you for the time you've spent on this, but a minor quibble if you don't mind. Could you please provide signatures for the dmg files, and ideally sign the messages you send to the list about them?

@_subject: [Announce] GnuPG 2.1.1 released 
If you look at (what in my mind are) the parallels in Windows
(exes/installers) and Unix (tarballs) I don't have to perform any
actions on them at all prior to verifying the signatures. I'd like to
have the same luxury for the dmg file.
In addition to the above, the 1 signature only covers that 1 item, there
are other items in the dmg file.
Now that said, perhaps it is my relative unfamiliarity with the dmg
format that is causing my concern. It seems to me (on experience and
some reading, both limited) that there are "things" that happen when I
open one, similar to the autoplay feature for optical discs in Windows.
That's part of the reason I'd like to be able to verify the dmg before
opening it.
If that last concern is misplaced, then I am less hesitant, however it
would still seem to be a good operational practice to sign the whole
blob. Admittedly that is less tidy, as now you have two files to keep
track of instead of one, but since I use all 3 OS', it's not
particularly burdensome from my perspective.

That's true, although pinentry-curses actually does a pretty good job
remotely unless the thing that you're calling GnuPG from is taking
extreme control of the terminal. For instance, if you're ssh'ing into
a remote system and running a simple shell script, or even doing gpg
on the command line, pinentry-curses is fine. However if you're doing
something more exotic (a mail client like Alpine for example) then all

@_subject: Symmetrical encryption or ... 
Hash: SHA256
Either symmetric or PK encryption would suit your needs, but as
someone pointed out already, a better solution is to use a password safe.
KeePass is an excellent solution, and I use the same password db
between Windows, Linux, and OS X (not in that order). :)  You want to
use the lowest common denominator format between those systems, which
at this point is the 1.28 version for Windows, and the keepassx
version that comes with most Linux distributions (I use Ubuntu
primarily). For OS X it gets a little trickier, since the version that
includes auto-type is community sourced, but the person who produces
it is well trusted, and a lot of people use it.
Schneier had an interesting blog post recently about password safes,
with a link to papers that did extensive research on them. KeePass
came out looking pretty good, as one of the key problems with most
password safes is that if the auto-type is truly automatic, it can be
triggered by malicious software and grab your passwords off the
clipboard in windows. While KeePass does have an auto-type feature,
you have to trigger the key sequence to use it, and that sequence is
user-configurable. And obviously you don't want to use solutions like
LastPass, where your stuff is stored in their cloud. The question of
"What if they get hacked?" is no longer academic, since it happened
For synchronization between systems I use SpiderOak, which also has
clients for all 3 platforms. KeePass already encrypts the db file, and
SpiderOak, unlike most "cloud storage" platforms, encrypts the files
it backs up locally (on your system) with a special key that the
company does not know. The upload channel is encrypted to their
servers as well, so your data is never available in the clear. Because
they don't know the encryption key your data is never de-duplicated
with other people's stuff, although if you set up folder
synchronization between systems the same files will be de-duplicated
within your own account.
... and speaking of folder synchronization, one of the things I like
about SpiderOak is that you can set up arbitrary folders to
synchronize between systems, you don't have to put all of your stuff
in one folder. You can also configure it to exclude certain files from
syncing, which is handy to avoid synching the .lock file for KeePass. :)
If you use this link to sign up for SpiderOak, I get free space. :)
Or, here is the regular link, if you prefer:

@_subject: MIME or inline signature ? 
FWIW, I hate this debate, and try hard to stay out of it. But it really bothers me when people spread factually incorrect information, especially when they try to use that as the basis of their arguments for/against one method or the other.
Why are you signing mail that is being sent to people without PGP support in the first place?
This hasn't been true for almost a decade, assuming that the person using the non-ASCII characters has correctly set up their environment. And FWIW, it's also not true that PGP/MIME will be 100% successful when one of the communicants has not correctly set up their environment.
Nothing you wrote in this section is 100% correct. You *can* send one signature per attachment, but you don't have to. You can also bundle the attachment and signature in an archive, or you can bundle a lot of attachments in the same archive, and sign that, or you can bundle all of the attachments and signatures in one archive .... etc.
It's also not true that PGP/MIME protects you from metadata analysis. The messages are not "one big blob," they are actually separated into parts, including the attachments. It's trivial to see how many attachments are in a message just by analyzing the MIME headers, whether the message/attachments are encrypted or not.
... or, you could use what your correspondents are able to handle, since theoretically that's the point of communication in the first place? :)

... and yet, you not only responded to this thread (fair enough, so did
I), but you took the time to write up an entire web page full of FUD on
the topic. :)  Methinks you do protest too much.
me if I'm
If you are referring to the display of the message after it's decrypted
(which is influenced by the content-encoding header) then see below.
You demonstrate what you claim to be a collision where signatures verify
in both cases (I am willing to give you the benefit of the doubt, I
haven't tested it). However the collision isn't meaningful. I don't
think anyone would receive a message that says, "pay 13" and think that it was what the
recipient intended to send. Not to mention, if you were actually sending
a message that meant to indicate an amount in monetary units you would
spell out the amount in addition to displaying it numerically.
Show me a *meaningful* collision that your attack surface is vulnerable
to, and I'll pay more attention to it.
I don't deny the fact that PGP/MIME encodes the charset info in the body
that is signed. I simply deny that this fact is meaningful to the
overwhelming majority of users.
The OP was talking specifically about signed messages with attachments.
I made the leap to encrypted, and you're correct, I'm at least partially
wrong about that. (I vaguely recall that there is a way to do an
encrypted MIME message with attachments that does not end up in one big
blob, but I may be mistaken about that. It's been a while since I poked
that stuff.)
However in the context of signed but not encrypted, my point still stands.
Some more errors from your web page:
1. Enigmail is very clear about what parts of the message are signed
when decoding an in-line signature. My implementation for Alpine is as
well. Do you have any concrete examples of implementations that are not?
2. IME (that is, actually writing code to decrypt and verify e-mail
messages of both types) it's actually MIME that is way, way worse to
handle when it comes to wrapping, EOL canonicalization, etc. The various
implementations play very fast and loose with the "standards" here,
Apple being by far the worst culprit. Of course, that means little to
nothing to the average users, since their MUA should be able to handle
these messages.
Just to give you an example, my script to verify in-line signatures is
84 lines, and most of that is the setup (secure temporary directory,
error handling, etc.) and the text of the messages that the script
prints to indicate to the user what it's doing. The MIME equivalent has
basically the same setup cost, but it's 159 lines long. Almost all of
the difference is exception handling for MUAs that don't properly follow
the standards.
3. Your point that non-MIME messages can't do MIME is accurate, but
However, you're wrong that you cannot do signatures for attachments,
even with multiple attachments, with a message body signed in line.
I get that you have a preference, and personally I don't care how you
sign your messages. But as I stated before, it really bothers me when
the zealots (on either side) misrepresent the facts in order to bolster
their case.

The way I read Hans-Christoph's message was that there is a lack of coordination amongst various teams who have started API, wrapper, or other projects based on GnuPG tools, and that this fragmentation has harmed those efforts in various ways (including diverting precious resources to projects with little or no chance of success). And that it would be nice if we could take a hard look at what the real world requirements are for APIs and/or wrappers for various platforms, and have some coordinated effort put into work in this area.

Because in this situation you're often dealing with beginners who don't understand the subtleties involved in validating keys.
Assuming you get the package, the signature, and the fingerprint from the same *.gnupg.org resources, what does that buy you?
If you've somehow downloaded the wrong key by short Id, the signature won't validate. If you have the right key, it will. That's enough to tell the user that the contents of the package are unaltered.
More extensive checking would be great, but would require a lot of documentation to teach the users how to do it ... are you volunteering to write it? :)

Step 1 is that you have to get a validated version of the fingerprint of the key that you would have been using to verify the package if you could have downloaded that key in the first place.
The concept of validating keys is a much more advanced topic, and while I admire Peter's enthusiasm, isn't really a useful exercise for you to engage in at this point, especially since you can't seem to download the key that you would be validating with the fingerprint in the first place.

I think you missed my point. If all three resources related to verification are provided by the same source, then verifying the fingerprint gets you zero added security. It's more or less equivalent to using a hash by itself.
I covered that later in the message, but basically, yes.
So to start with, that's a pretty big hurdle to jump, and if you have access to do that, then you almost certainly have access to do other things like changing the fingerprint to verify.
So in my threat model once Eve has access to the site where the downloads are posted, it's already game over. You can posit a threat model where Eve has access to one thing, but not the other, and that's fine; but there are way too many technical and social engineering tricks that can be performed if you have access to just the downloads. Your idea of "verify the fingerprint from a web page" provides little to no improved security in a world where the nefarious actor has no access to the downloads in the first place, and zero when they do.
Why would you bother? Why not just sign it with a completely new key, and include in the comments something like "2015 Q1 Signing key for official purposes?" That's enough social engineering to "catch" the overwhelming majority of users, even the ones sophisticated enough to actually review the key that they just downloaded.
... even assuming that this is relevant ...
when the malicious actor has access to the downloads, those people are already hosed, regardless of what extra security you're suggesting.
... and as above, it's totally unnecessary.
In the first place, I disagree with your premise that no guidance is better. If for no other reason than providing the "wrong" guidance is likely to spur the people with the "right" answer into responding when they otherwise would not.
I also disagree with you that I'm providing the wrong guidance. :)

Because it tells you that the package was not tampered with. I've covered this several times now.
Again, I think you're missing the bigger picture here. If you have write access to the FTP site, why would you even bother creating the signature for your malicious package with a key that has the same short key Id?
You're trying to defend against an incredibly unlikely threat model. If I download 'malicious package' + 'signature for malicious package created by key controlled by malicious actor,' one of two things is overwhelmingly likely to happen:
1. I blindly import the key, verify the signature, and move on; or
2. I import the key, perform a cursory review, verify the signature, and move on.
Either way, your short key Id collision is out of spec. The user in this situation has no way to know that there should be a short key Id other than the one that is related to the signature that they have in hand. Since both the package and the signature are under Eve's control, the threat model you are suggesting is a complete red herring.
Thank you for confirming your real motives. :) I understand in theory that relying solely on the short key Id is not a good practice in a situation where you want things to be "very secure." But we do indeed have a bootstrapping issue here, which is, "Where do you start when it comes to rank beginners?" I think you are asking way too much, and giving near-zero value in return.
Sure, but now you've entered a very sticky briar patch, with a lot of bootstrapping knowledge that is not easy for a rank beginner to grasp. You and I "get" what you're talking about, but that knowledge came from experience. (and again, the extra security that you get is of very limited value at this stage of the game)

Originally you suggested that they verify the fingerprint, and use that to retrieve the key. Glad to see now that you realize that was not the right course of action. :)
I would argue that verifying the signature when available is slightly better, but I won't quibble on this point. For most users it is true that the checksum is likely to be "just as good" as a signature We will have to agree to disagree on this point.

I conceded from the start that there are scenarios where Peter's threat model is valid. However they are overwhelmingly unlikely.
You also seem to be ignoring the bootstrapping problem of educating the new users on doing proper validity checking for fingerprints, keys, etc.
Yes, and mirrors, by definition, are copies of the original. So either they are all compromised (because the master is), or the subset of systems that get compromised will auto-correct at whatever interval they are set up to mirror the master.
So the scenario where "download the package and signature from one site and verify the fingerprint from another site provided by the same operator" is useful still falls into the "incredibly unlikely" category.
The announcements are of no use to the user going to the FTP site to download a new package unless they happen to be on the mailing list. And in any case, the archives and gmane.org mirror fall into the "same operator" trap described above.
The thing I'm trying to avoid here is adding complexity that does nothing but satisfy the OCD of experienced users who know the good/right/best way of doing things and add no real value to new users who are just trying to get started with the software.
If there were a comprehensive new-user guide that could explain all of this stuff that would be a valuable addition. But there isn't, and I'm not going to write one. So personally I'll settle for offering practical advice to folks at the level I think they're ready to deal with it.

How are you using the term "breakdown" here? If their client isn't doing PGP they see some extraneous text, and a signature block. While I agree that for those not using PGP that is clutter, I am not sure what you mean by "breakdown."
We've already established that PGP/MIME is a "cleaner" solution for those that don't use PGP. I'm not debating that point, and I don't think anyone else is either.
The question at hand is for those that *do* use PGP, which is more effective? TMK there are no mail clients that fail to process a valid in-line signature, but obviously there are still clients that cannot correctly handle PGP/MIME.

There are several more possible scenarios.

@_author: Doug Barton 
@_subject: basic identity mgmt 
Right, that's what I suspected. I have set up similar systems myself, and I'm very familiar with security requirements there.
X.509 is very different from PGP, although I do understand that in some ways the semantics are the same. Most particularly X.509 is used primarily to establish trust relationships between systems, not people. So the ability for a system to identify itself to another system, without human review being involved, is something much more precious that deserves a higher degree of protection.
OTOH, PGP is designed primarily to establish trust relationships between people, with human review of the results an integral part of the process.
I read your example, and there are numerous flaws with your theoretical threat model. Let's assume your premise, that someone could root a laptop, and by so doing gain access to use all of the PGP keys on that laptop (Note, I disagree with this premise, but let's grant it for argument's sake). There is no need to deal with the certification key at all in order to do the kind of damage you proposed. All you need to do is sign a message that authorizes your nefarious deeds. Said attacker would also have the ability to decrypt all manner of messages and/or data, all of which are likely to be vastly more interesting than what you propose.
In fact, I assert with a great deal of confidence that *for PGP*, the certification key is the least interesting key of the bunch, and yet it's the one that people have created this intricate protection mechanism for.
Further I don't see signing as all that interesting either. As has been discussed several times on this list the primary area of reliability for signing is to make sure that the message that arrived was the one that was sent. But it provides no guarantee about who was in control of the key when the message was signed, whether the signer was coerced, etc. We can infer things about these topics from our knowledge/beliefs about the sender, but I can't think of any rational person would go along with a request to "Pay Joe $10,000" just because the message was PGP signed. Forget the validity of the key, that kind of request would require serious OOB authentication.
Glossing over authentication (because there's no real use case for those keys yet), that leaves us with encryption, and that's where it's at, my friends. But unless you really enjoy making your life harder than it has to be, you can't routinely use encryption with an air-gapped key, so I remain unconvinced that there is a use case for air-gapping PGP keys. But I'm still willing to listen. :)

True enough, but what do those signatures actually mean?
But more importantly, what security measures are in place to prevent a rogue key from entering that WOT, in addition to a certification signature from a random key? Is the only thing someone would need to do to compromise a single certification key?
Sorry, all that does is replace something that already existed, works well, and is widely supported; with something more complex, often buggy, and not widely supported. That's not a use case, that's a solution looking for a problem.
That's not to say that someday there won't be a use case for authentication keys, but I haven't seen one yet.

[after lots of snipping]
Your example is a good one, but again I assert that it would be overwhelmingly foolish to rely on *just the signature* to indicate that the request to meet is a legitimate one.
You glossed over the points in my previous messages about the fact that we cannot know for sure if the person sending the message is actually who we think it is (i.e., that the legitimate correspondent has not lost control of the key), and that they are not being coerced, based on the signature alone. At minimum there should be some sort of "steganography" based on how the message is constructed, certain words or phrases, etc. That combined with the signature may be enough to prove the validity of the message.
But this thread started trying to refute my assertion that keeping certification keys air-gapped is pointlessly complicated. I haven't seen a refutation of that premise yet. :)

The IETF is currently working on a specification for a DNS record (secured by DNSSEC) that will allow users to find a PGP key from an e-mail address. I'm interested in feedback on how y'all think that should work.
In one version the receiving user would create a truncated version of their key, using only the UID that is related to that e-mail address. The sending user would retrieve that key, and the mail software would rely on it to encrypt the mail to the receiving user. There is also some discussion in regards to how or whether the software doing the DNS lookup would, or would not, also utilize the sending user's key ring, but let's keep it simple for now.
In another version the receiving user would place the full fingerprint of their key in the DNS, and the sending user's software would use that fingerprint to retrieve the key and compare that retrieved key to the user's existing WOT, then inform the user of the results.
Of these alternatives, which do you see as most useful, and why? Or, do you imagine a different approach?

No, the question *most* users that bother to use the signature at all ask about it is, "Did it validate?"
The answer to *your* question, "How much confidence should I invest in it?" is, "Very little."
Except in certain specialized situations the only utility for a PGP signature is, "Does it show that the thing signed arrived unchanged?" You cannot reasonably place more confidence in it than that, regardless of the number of known signatures the key has.
1. You don't know if the key was in full control of the person/organization it purports to represent before, during, or after the signatures you are trusting were applied.
2. You don't know if the person in control of the key at the time the thing you care about was signed was being coerced, or not.
And as Robert pointed out, for organizational keys there is no way that you can associate control of the key with a known, trusted individual.
So trying to validate a key in the manner you described in your e-mail is at best a fool's errand. If you enjoy the work, by all means help yourself. But let's please stop pretending that signatures mean more than they really do.

Yes, I am. I'm trying to make a point. One which I think you failed to I'm assuming that this is not a serious question.
No, it's *not* beside the point. You keep saying "better than nothing," which is technically correct, but not sufficient. We need to understand and discuss exactly *how much* better than nothing a valid signature is before we can seriously discuss how much weight to put on it, or how much spelunking through the WOT we're willing to perform, or (more importantly) recommend.
Ok, so let me be more direct, since I was obviously too subtle the first time. You described downloading keys and validating signatures in an effort to validate a key which signed a random software package that you downloaded from the Internet which is, by and large, a colossal waste of time. Further, you seem dangerously misinformed about what value to place on the work that you performed (that is, any actual increase in trust or validity that you placed on the key after you were done ... hint: It's zero).
Because of the three points I listed above, any work spent validating they key that made the signature is simply a waste of time. You cannot, and more importantly should not, impart any additional "trust" in signatures made by that key due to the work you performed.
Now it's your time to spend, so if you want to spend it thusly, that's great. More power to you. But before you create any grand plans or recommend that others do the same kind of work you really need to understand the situation better.

First, and an important question for security-related stuff generally, what is your threat model? In other words, what dangers are you guarding against by using PGP? You mention evangelizing your key, and asking how to get more people to use PGP with you. Those are reasonable questions, but the first is the most important.
If you simply want a secure way to communicate with people that you know without others being able to snoop on the conversation, there are other, arguably better, and certainly easier, solutions. PGP has its use cases, but unless we know why you want to use it, it's nearly impossible to give you good advice.

and importing the exported signing-only subkey with the expected
However, that still doesn't address the "issues" with this approach. It
only works for signing, if you want to be able to decrypt messages sent
to you on your devices then you need to keep a copy of your encryption
subkey on them as well. Personally, I would argue that is a much bigger
risk in terms of compromise, as people being able to send messages
signed by my key would be an annoyance, sure. But people being able to
decrypt things that I wanted to keep secret could be potentially
That said, as long as you have a suitable passphrase your risk of key
compromise is really, really minimal, even if they did get total control
over your device. Barring coercion, the chances of someone guessing your
passphrase is near zero. And currently that's the only way to gain
access to a secret key, even if you have it in your possession.
But let's say that the worst happens, and your device is compromised by
the bad folks, and they gain control of your key as well. Let's even use
a signing-only subkey for this scenario. Now, your attackers have access
to your full list of contacts, and your e-mail (so that they can get a
solid idea of how you write). Then they send the following message to
everyone in your contact list (assume for the sake of argument that the
following is written in something close enough to your personal style to
pass with your friends and family, etc.):
Woah, dude, major bummer! My phone got stolen! Totally bogus! Not only
that, but my PGP key was on it, and now they have that too! Sucks, man! So here is my new key fingerprint. Please download it ASAP, revoke your
signatures on my old key, and mark it as bogus! And definitely, if you
get another message from me signed by this key, DON'T TRUST IT! That'll
be the hackers, man!
Of course, the new key that they send the fingerprint for will be one
that they have created, with all the same UID information, etc. Now this
won't fool everyone of course, there will be some of your correspondents
who will want to verify with you, some who won't act because they don't
know what you're talking about, etc. But the usual stated goal of using
a separate signing-only key is to protect the reputation of your
certification key, and to avoid having to create a whole new key in
response to a compromise. My argument is that in the unlikely event that
the bad folks get control of your secret key (of any flavor) there is
more than enough damage that they can do with it, even if they don't get
your certification key.
Now beyond THAT, you stated that your goal is to be able to ENCRYPT your
communications on your devices, and presumably that means to decrypt as
well. You can ENcrypt using just the recipient's public key of course.
But you can't DEcrypt unless you have your own encryption subkey on the
device. See above for why that's a much more significant risk (IMO). In
light of that requirement, a sign-only subkey doesn't get you much, and
given that with a good passphrase it's essentially impossible for them
to compromise your key, even if they do get it, you're adding complexity
for little, if any, benefit.
I could go on, but I'll let you respond first in case I've already said
enough. :)
hope this helps,

Yes, you did. :)
You are correct, but that's a different threat model than someone simply stealing the device (which is what I wrote about). What you're describing implies a level of sophistication and coordination on the attacker's part that few of us are subject to, and certainly wasn't included in what Will said he was trying to guard against.
Well, yeah, but, again, not relevant to my post. :)

We really need to stop referring to this as signing. The number of ways that the same term is used to mean different things in PGP is a huge contributor to the confusion on the part of new users.

Robert's answer was more than a little snarky, yes. But, you send your question to a free mailing list, you get what you paid for. :)
Meanwhile, go back to your first post, and remember the question I asked you, before anything else?
What's your threat model?
As Robert pointed out, it's really hard for us to give you a map if you can't tell us what you want your destination to be.

There is nothing wrong with that point of view of course. The danger comes in when people promote things like smart cards to newbies as "The right way to do PGP." They are/would be overkill for 99.9% of people who use PGP, and the additional hassle and complexity serves as a barrier to

You and Rainer have gone on at great length about the part of the threat model equation dealing with the attacker. However, you don't seem to take into account the other part of the equation, what you are protecting.
The overwhelming number of PGP users simply use it because it's cool. They don't have anything approaching significant secrets to protect, it's just fun to do cryptography. There is nothing wrong with that, in and of itself. (Note, I acknowledge that there are people for whom signatures and encryption actually matter.)
There is not even anything wrong with the idea that using smart cards, air-gapped computers, detached signing subkeys, etc. *can* be part of that fun. The concern is that when folks tell the new users that they are *required*, that becomes problematic for a couple of reasons. First, it gives a false impression of how secure the "basic" version of GnuPG is in the first place. Perhaps more importantly, it places a much higher barrier to entry for new users; for no measurable ROI.
So if folks want to imagine that you live in a Bond film, and that SPECTRE is out to get you, so be it. I don't begrudge you that fantasy. But when it comes to offering advice to new users, please be realistic about what they are actually going to benefit from.

That's not how you use haveged. It is supposed to start when the system boots, and run in the background, collecting entropy to seed the PRNG.
That said, if you are using a card for signing that's way more likely to be involved in the problems you're seeing. Try creating a key on the file system, and test using that first. If that works, then you've narrowed down your problems.
