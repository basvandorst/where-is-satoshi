@_subject: Mantra via command-line? 
I just wanted to know (in order to write some scripts/batch files) if there
is a way to submit the Matra to gpg via command-line? I want to do symmetric
en/decoding on a lot of files, and it would not make a lot of sense if I had
to enter the mantra each time I do this on a file...
Thnaks in advance,
Arndt Pohlmann
