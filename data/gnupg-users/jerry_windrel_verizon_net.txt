Hash: SHA1
Someone mentioned on this list a while back that GPG supports
extracting the symmetric session key used for a message.  If you
provide this session key to someone, they can use GPG to decrypt that
particular message only, including the signature.  I'm not sure what
the exact commands are.

@_subject: group key? 
Can you please expand on the notion of what you mean by a "group key"?  Is
such a thing commonly used and in what situations?
Just to give you a reference point for possible correction... what I'm
imagining you mean is that a key pair is generated and assosicated, not with
a person as is customery, but rather with a group.  The private key (and any
passphrase) would then be distributed to all members of the group (which
would be quite an unorthodox practice, in terms of PGP).  Then, all messages
to the group would be encrypted to that "group key".
The ramifications of this would be: the group private key would be only as
secure as the weakest practices of any of the group members; you would be
able to add but not remove members (unless you generated a new group key).
Please clarify and correct as necessary

That's actually a crucial question that needs to be resolved in order for
digital signatures to be more widely adopted.  If anyone can just revoke
their key and claim a hacker break-in, then what good does it do to generate
signatures to begin with?

@_subject: Revoking Old Keys... my problem 
Hash: SHA1
Here's some good news for you, after all that bad news.  It's not
perfect and I may not be remembering it perfectly either, but I think
it's a big help, although it relies on exploiting a flaw in the
protocol of key servers, which I read about recently.  Maybe others
on the list can fill in the blanks of this method.
1) Download the bad public key from a key server.
2) Export it in binary form (not ASCII armored).
3) Get a binary editor (HexEdit is a shareware product that I use...
there are many others)
4) Using the binary edtior, alter the User ID, i.e. your real name "John Smith " (or 1 of them, if there are many... DO
NOT change more than one!), to say something like, "Bad Key, use
0x1234ABCD".  Unfortunately, you will have to be brief, as you cannot
use more characters than were in the original User ID.  You will be
somewhat lucky if your name is long :) If you're lucky enough to have
more than enough room, replace the unused characters at the end with
spaces.  Technically, there may be a way to make it longer, but that
would require really getting into the binary format of export files.
Don't forget to save the binary file.
5) Import your lobotomized binary export file.
6) You should be able to see the new "User ID" in place of the old
7) Upload the key.
8) Search on the key server to see the result.
9) You might expect the key server to also show the old userid
replaced by the "Bad Key..." userid, but that's NOT what will happen.
 The old userid will remain (since you haven't done anything to
delete it from the key server, and deleting it from key servers is
not usually even possible), but you will have a new userid, namely
"Bad Key...".  Now whoever looks at the userids for your key will see
that "Bad Key..." warning.
It's not the ideal solution, which is to get rid of the bad key, but,
key servers are quite an apt metaphor to life
itself... sadly, there are mistakes that can be made that just cannot
be undone.  Seen in that context, having un unrevokable key, while
frustrating, quite pales in comparison to the possible other
irreversable mistakes that can be made in life. Chalk it up to

At the risk of veering off topic...
The problem of having a key that you cannot revoke, and the partial
solution I outlined, reminds me somewhat of the situation in the Book
of Esther where a king sent out a proclamation signed with his signet
ring.  The rule in those days that a proclamation signed with the
king's signet ring could never be revoked, not even by the king
himself (similar to the "non-repudiation" property of digital
signatures).  When the king later regretted that proclamation, the
only solution was to send out another (non-revokable) proclamation
that mitigated the effect of the first one.

You should be able to continue using full Outlook if you use GPG with a
graphical front end like WinPT that allows you to encrypt and decrypt inside
any application's window (Outlook, etc.).
I actually use the free version of PGP for that.  It has somewhat of an
advantage of being all in one.  It has "hot keys" which let you do your
encryption/decryption/signing all from within whatever application you're
using (Outlook, etc.).  The beauty of the hot keys is that the application
doesn't have to have any specific support from PGP, so it will work in
Notepad, Word, web browser text boxes, etc.

The PDF manual that comes with it is pretty good, but I wish it would
give more emphasis to the HotKeys, which I've found is the most
convenient way to use it, since they allow you to
encrypt/decrypt/sign/verify in any application, without a plugin. I
do 99% of my stuff with the HotKeys (or the right-click PGP context
menu that gets added to Windows Explorer).  I almost never use the
PGPMail tool, which the manual focuses on.  It took me a while to
clue into using PGP that way, though.

It seems like you'd do the following:
Take the length and do an integer-divide by 256.  (If your language doesn't
have an integer-divide operator, do a floating-point divide and chop off the
fractional part to get a whole number).  Add 192.  That's your first octet.
Take the length and do an integer-remainder by 256.  (If your language
doesn't have an integer-remainder operator, multiply the result of the
integer-divide above [before you added 192] by 256 and subtract that from
the length.) Add 192.  That's your second octet.

Thanks!  But I'm wondering if perhaps an imporovement is possible.  You
state: "Photographic UIDs are also going to be signed with a level of 3 if I
can still remember the signee's face when I will be back at home."  That
places somewhat of a limit on your ability to sign photos, since you have to
remember which face goes to which key.  What about this... before the key
signing or meeting, print out the photo as well as the key's properties
(length, type and fingerprint).  Then when you meet the person you can check
the photo right there and make a notation to sign it later.

Isn't there also a simpler attack that achieves the same result
without resorting to subkeys?
Alice publishes her legitimate public key.  Mallet can obtain Alice's
public key, replace Alice's name with his own (i.e. Mallet), then go
to a key signing or notary, etc. and show his I.D. along with the
public key's fingerprint.  Thus he could get lots of signatures
attesting that Alice's public key really belongs to Mallet.  He could
then claim documents signed by Alice were really signed by him
Some signers guard against this attack by sending the signed copy of
public keys to their owners, encrypted to them, instead of uploading
them directly to key servers.  That ensures that their signature will
only be able to be used by the legitimate owner of the public key. But not everyone follows this precaution.
Can you describe the fix?  Would this fix also address the simpler
attack I outlined here?
