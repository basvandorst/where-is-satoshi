@_subject: upgrading gnupg 
I was looking through the thread's in the past few months, but didn't find anything on the subject.
I'm using gnupg in the W2K-environment and want to upgrade gnupg from 1.2.2 to 1.2.3. Do I just unpack and put the new files on the old files in the my gnupg-directory? Will my old keys, created in 1.2.2 work properly  with 1.2.3? Just wondering since I've had problems with my key's in different versions of gnupg.
