@_subject: Temporary directory/automated environment 
I'm planning to use GnuPG in an automated environment.
Now, the GnuPG wants to have write access to the directory where the
keyrings are. I found this quite amazing.
gpg: failed to create temporary file
`/home/me/.gnupf/. Permission denied
By reading the sources I found about an option "--temp-directory", but at
least in version 1.0.7 it doesn't have any effect.
Then, I'm trying to compile GnuPG 1.2.2 on a Redhat (have to find out the
version). I get this.
checking size of unsigned long long... configure: error: cannot compute
sizeof (unsigned long long), 77
So.. any help in either of these problems?
