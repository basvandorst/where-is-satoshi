Hash: SHA1
Hello John,
   I'm a 74 year old retired American writing to you from the
island of Luzon in the Philippines. I live in a place called
Baguio City.
   I blundered across an old message on the internet in which,
among other things, you apparently said:
   Based on the context of the message I infer that you were
saying you planned to modify GPG v.1.4.8 in such a way as to
make it usable on a USB stick. A kind of latter-day GPG2GO
   If I am right about that, I ask if that later model of GPG2GO
is now available and if you will share a copy of it with me.
I've been using the older version (1.4.1) but a few problems
developed for me.
   If you require payment for that later version, and if you
will tell me what it is, I will somehow manage to send the money
to you.
    Be aware that I have a PGP package I'd be willing to trade.
Using a number of additional programs and a few batch files, I
cobbled together an encryption packet using PGP 2.6.3i multi 06
that works quite nicely. Using it from a hard drive is a snap,
but it can also be used from a USB stick without leaving traces
in the Windows registry. I'm doing essentially the same thing
with GPG 1.4.1 except GPG will not securely WIPE a file as PGP
will. Nothing is perfect, I guess.  :^)
