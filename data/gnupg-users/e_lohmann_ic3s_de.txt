@_subject: GPG and GPA 
Hi all,
 I am using GPG 1.07 and latest version from GPA.
 If I have only my private/public key imported into GPG and start GPA,
 all looks fine.
 If I import some other public keys (ca. 20) and start GPA,
 I can see that GPA try's to read my secring.gpg 3 times and after that
 I get a core dump.
 If I list my sec und pub keys, only with gpg all looks fine.
 Do anyone know this problem and maybe a workaround?
 ... the same problem appears with gpg 1.06.
 Greetings Eike
