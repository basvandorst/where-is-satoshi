@_subject: Receiving keys as root user 
I think this is a bug in gpg because /root/.gnupg should be irrelevant for the
pacman keyring in /etc/pacman.d/gnupg (and I also think that the 'fix' in
archlinux is wrong since the root user doesn't need to have a .gnupg dir).
Confusingly, it seems [1] that dirmngr should be working though...
