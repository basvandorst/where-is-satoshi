@_subject: OpenSSL vs GPG for encrypting files? Security best practices? 
Security Experts,
I'm considering encrypting a tar archive and optionally a block file system
(via FUSE) using either utility.  Does anyone have comments on the best
practices and tools for either?
I read that the OpenSSL AES-CBC CLI mode is prone to a malleable attack
vector and it's CLI interface should not be use directly for production.  I
have also read that GPG is the suggested alternative to OpenSSL CLI due to
this.  I have followed through with the OpenSSL CLI AES tests and am
curious where the malleable attack is (in the pipe?).  I am also curious to
why GPG, which is an asymmetric key manager, is used for file based
encryption when only a single key is required.  How does GPG solve this
malleable attack vector.
A security expert's guidance here is much appreciated.
Thank you,

@_subject: Most secure GPG combination for Mac OS X 
Does anyone have suggestions on the most secure and reviewed combination
for bits for sending secure email on OS X?
I noticed that there are two OSX packages for GPG:
          Mac GPG Installer from the gpgtools project
          GnuPG for OS X Installer for GnuPG
Is any one preferred, have more eyes reviewing source, better release
management in terms of security concerns?  Any details?  Am I better off
building from source?
I'm considering using the Mac Mail.app, however am interested if
Thunderbird is better integrated from a security standpoint.  At the lowest
level, my assumption is that the command line tools can be used to encrypt
Appreciate a security experts guidance immersing myself into more secure

This raises another question about the security of the ports project
itself.  I read that Homebrew had some security issues, a majority which
come from the installer making /usr/local/bin writable by users other than
root.  This allows an unprivileged application to inject a malicious binary
there, for instance sudo.  /usr/local/bin is first in the search path and
therefore the administrator password could be captured.  I also read
Macports may not have this security issue because the installer runs as
root and all installations run as root.
on Macports as well.  I suspect there could be many security holes based
upon the tool chain to compile the ports and all hands involved in the
source trees.

Interesting.  How about this for a start?

@_subject: Support for RSA keys > 4096 bits 
I read in NIST 800-57 Part 1 Rev. 4 pg 53 that RSA keys length of 15360
bits is equivalent to a 256 bit AES symmetric key.  I also read in other
documentation that NIST recommends such key lengths to protect data beyond
2030.  As email may be retained for many years it would seem appropriate to
secure such communications with a larger key.
Does this data agree with security experts?  Is there a reason why GnuPG
limits RSA key length to 4096 bits?
Thank you,
