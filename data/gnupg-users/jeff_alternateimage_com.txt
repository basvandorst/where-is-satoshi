Nobody is actually clicking on anything. The file creation, the encryption,
the FTP transfers, the decryption is all done automatically by scripts that
are designed to specifically handle SDAs. I know they have the ability with
their commercial version of PGP to handle whatever I send them but their
system is specifically looking to read from an FTP folder and decrypt it as
an SDA.
