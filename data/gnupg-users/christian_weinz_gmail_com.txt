@_subject: Smart card reader security 
I bought a cyberJack go [1] to use it with my openPGP smart card for
authentification. Since the firmware of that device is upgradeable and
is capable of saving atleast 2 GB of data, how can I be sure it is not a
security threat by saving sensitive data?
Best regards,
