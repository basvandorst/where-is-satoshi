Yes, I got this too (I run GnuPG under Win98).  I ignored it, and
nothing seems to have happened.  Later I received word from another

Unless somebody can advise me differently, I'll continue to ignore it....

PGP has a plug-in which integrates more seamlessly with Outlook than

trying to get a MUA (Mutt) which defaults to PGP/MIME under Linux, to
produce something which can be understood by a Windows application
(Outlook) for which there is no PGP/MIME support.  Despite somebody
telling me that this difference is not an OS problem, but an
application problem, most Windows MUAs do not have PGP/MIME support if
they have PGP.

I understand that, but for we Windows users, PGP/MIME seems so

As a general rule, under both GnuPG and PGP, I generate a key pair for
*each e-mail address* I shall use to send signed/encrypted mail.  If
you are really trying to make your mail as secure as possible, each
key pair will have a different passphrase, but for a small number of
addresses a common passphrase would do (although if the passphrase is
known by others they will then know all your passphrases...so its
often a trade off between security and what you can remember).
You can keep all your keys on a floppy which is then used from machine
to machine (I've never actually done this with GnuPG, only with PGP
under Windows).
Hope this helps..

Hi there, Keith Ray,

KR> I guess that's why no one has EVER asked for an IDEA capable Windows version?  KR> I guess there are no Windows users who might want to communicate with PGP 2.6x KR> users or use most remailers?
As a Windows user of GnuPG, I use PGP 2.6.3ai to access remailers, as
well as running GnuPG.  The PGP 2.6.3ai keyring contains mainly
remailers (this keeps them off my main keyring).  I use Windows front
ends for both GnuPG and PGP 2.6.3ai, and if GnuPG fails to
decrypt/verify, I use PGP 2.6.3ai.  For convenience, it would be nice
if GnuPG could be used for this purpose, but it would mean importing
my remailer list into my GnuPG keyring, so not much would be saved by
my doing this.

I agree, but perhaps the way forward is for the Windows version to be
placed on the same level as the Linux version, and the IDEA support
should be an "official" plug-in for non-commercial use only.  Until we
have a fully functional GnuPG with a GUI similar to NAI's, GnuPG is
going to be a Windows backwater...unfortunately.

Again, I agree, but see my comments above.  GnuPG needs to be more
Windows-friendly, and I feel that Windows OS is being supported almost
as an afterthought (I mean no disrespect to Werner here).  First, we
need a GUI that rivals PGP *without* recourse to the command line, as
this will make more Windows users look at the undoubted merits (even
superiority) of GnuPG.  Secondly, we need full keyserver support
through that GUI. Finally, we need IDEA support as an official plug-in,
as with Linux.  Any chance of any of these occurring soon....?

To Outlook?  Well, I guess you must start somewhere, but Outlook and
Outlook Express are generally reckoned to be the vehicles for the
carriers of so many viruses under Windows, that I hope full support
will come in the way of plug-ins which will interface GnuPG with MUAs

At present, in Windows, GnuPG is totally a command line program. There are two good interfaces for it that act somewhat like PGPtray,
and these are WinPT and GnuPGShell.  Using either of these, you can
use GnuPG with any Windows MUA.  My own Windows MUA, Becky!2, has a
GnuPG plug-in which will enable you to interface GnuPG directly from
within the program.
WinPT is available from:

WinPT has currently limited keyserver support, but this is being

use a web based server such as the Esnet server at:

show an error warning to the effect of bad parameters, but will
(eventually) accept GnuPG keys.  Currently, GnuPG has no keyserver

As a general rule, under both GnuPG and PGP, I generate a key pair for
*each e-mail address* I shall use to send signed/encrypted mail.  If
you are really trying to make your mail as secure as possible, each
key pair will have a different passphrase, but for a small number of
addresses a common passphrase would do (although if the passphrase is
known by others they will then know all your passphrases...so its
often a trade off between security and what you can remember).
You can keep all your keys on a floppy which is then used from machine
to machine (I've never actually done this with GnuPG, only with PGP
under Windows).
Hope this helps..

Hi there, Keith Ray,
On 24 December 2000, I received the following message from you regarding
"GnuPG 1.0.4-1 + IDEA for Windows"
KR> I guess that's why no one has EVER asked for an IDEA capable Windows version?  KR> I guess there are no Windows users who might want to communicate with PGP 2.6x KR> users or use most remailers?
As a Windows user of GnuPG, I use PGP 2.6.3ai to access remailers, as
well as running GnuPG.  The PGP 2.6.3ai keyring contains mainly
remailers (this keeps them off my main keyring).  I use Windows front
ends for both GnuPG and PGP 2.6.3ai, and if GnuPG fails to
decrypt/verify, I use PGP 2.6.3ai.  For convenience, it would be nice
if GnuPG could be used for this purpose, but it would mean importing
my remailer list into my GnuPG keyring, so not much would be saved by
my doing this.

I agree, but perhaps the way forward is for the Windows version to be
placed on the same level as the Linux version, and the IDEA support
should be an "official" plug-in for non-commercial use only.  Until we
have a fully functional GnuPG with a GUI similar to NAI's, GnuPG is
going to be a Windows backwater...unfortunately.

Again, I agree, but see my comments above.  GnuPG needs to be more
Windows-friendly, and I feel that Windows OS is being supported almost
as an afterthought (I mean no disrespect to Werner here).  First, we
need a GUI that rivals PGP *without* recourse to the command line, as
this will make more Windows users look at the undoubted merits (even
superiority) of GnuPG.  Secondly, we need full keyserver support
through that GUI. Finally, we need IDEA support as an official plug-in,
as with Linux.  Any chance of any of these occurring soon....?

At present, in Windows, GnuPG is totally a command line program. There are two good interfaces for it that act somewhat like PGPtray,

use GnuPG with any Windows MUA.  My own Windows MUA, Becky!2, has a

If you are generating keys and they are not to be sent to keyservers,
then the issue of the expiration of the keys does not matter: you
simply delete the key.
My experience with PGP in Windows leads me to believe that its better
to have keyservers have a key on them, even if revoked.  If it is
revoked, people will know that the key is not to be used, and this is
better than them having no record of a key.  It is better that those
keys have no date of expiry, therefore.  At present there are no
keyserver facilities in GnuPG for Windows, so the issue does not arise
(keys are sent to keyservers via PGP).
There is just one area where it could be advantageous to have a time
limited key: when digital signing of documents prepared on a
particular date is required.  In order to ensure that the signature is
correct, you will need to verify that signature at any time, so this
is perhaps not a good idea.
And what happens if somebody totally new to PGP/GnuPG generates a key
with a date limit, encrypts a message/document with that key, then
cannot decrypt it because of the date limit?

with messages using keys generated by PGP 5.x AFAIK.
GnuPG will deal easily with Twofish encryption as used in PGP 7.0

Becky 2 is still beta, so you'll have to look for the program at the RIMArts

Which version of PGP were you using to generate the RSA keys?  Using Windows
98, I have found the same using RSA keys generated by PGP 2.6.3 (or
variants); however, RSA keys generated by PGP 5.x to 6.5.8 seem to work with
GPG.  PGP 7.0, however, generates RSA keys as "Legacy" keys and these are
different to RSA keys generated by PGP 5.x to 6.5.8 and I understand (though
as I do not have PGP 7.0 I cannot check this) they will have problems in
being accepted by GPG.
The next question is: why use RSA keys?  What application are you using them
for?  If to use with remailers, they will often ask for RSA keys but are
happy to accept keys generated by PGP 5.x to PGP 6.5.8 (there are programs
for use with remailers which also use nym servers and will not work with PGP

Good evening, Armin Hartinger

 Subject:Re: understanding what gnugp can do
 Yes Armin, there is!
You need both Becky 2 and the GnuPG plug-in, but be warned GnuPG runs as a
command line Dos program under Windows with no keyserver support.  For this,
at present, you will also need to download the freeware version of PGP.
Becky 2 will allow you to Sign, Encrypt, Decrypt, and Verify but you will
need to undertake key management through Dos.
It is at the present time the *only* Windows e-mailer supporting GnuPG,
although I understand The Bat! will support OpenPGP when v 2 is produced
(don't hold your breath!).  There is a version of Pine for Windows but it
does not support GnuPG and nobody who has written PGP support for Pine under
Linux that I have contacted has thought about Pine for Windows.
So, for the moment, its Becky 2.  Currently its in advanced Beta form and
available from:
This program is shareware (or will be when out of Beta) but the GnuPG
plug-in is freeware.  It is available from:
It too is Beta, but very stable.
If you want to download these, I'll be pleased to talk you (or your wife)
through setting it all up!  I like Becky 2 and the plug-in, as you can see
from below!

 Subject:Re: understanding what gnugp can do
No, because the plug-ins I've referred to do not access the command line,
which is how GnuPG is implemented in Windows.  PGP 5.0.x up to PGP 6.5.8
have a command line version, too, but its the version of PGP that *does not*
run from the command line that is accessed by these plug-ins.  In my
experience (though I have yet to have it confirmed) I believe there is a
"bug" in the command line version of PGP 5 and up which prevents "sign &
encrypt" working.
I'd be interested in his results.

The Becky 2 plug-in invokes the command line version of GnuPG for Windows. It does not confer any additional facilities, but is simply there to allow
encryption, decryption, verification, and signing.  You still have to enter
Pc-Dos for commands, and until there are keyserver facilities, you still
need a GUI version of PGP running to access keyservers.
Incidentally, there is also a PGP plug-in for Becky 2 that also utilises the
commandline version of PGP 6.5.x, but does not have the same functionality
as the GnuPGP plug-in.
An earlier posting referred to Becky being available for 30 days' trial. That is Becky 1 (Rebecca), not Becky 2, which is in Beta at present.

This is correct.  You'll still need to run the NAI Windows GUI alongside
GnuPG, but you can access keyservers through that.  To do so, you will have
to maintain two sets of keyrings: one set in your GnuPG directory and the
other in your NAI PGP directory.  In fact the "Windows" version of GnuPG may
be the basis for a future Windows version, but it is in reality a PC-Dos
version at this time.
I am not a Linux user, but use GnuPG for PC-Dos as well as PGP.  If I can

Hi there!  I'm new to this list, so please help me if this has been answered
I am using GnuPG through the plug-in for the Becky 2 e-mail program running
under Windows 98.  The mailer calls the commandline version of GnuPG but
uses its own interface.
Is there a Windows "front end" to access the Key Management commands of
GnuPG (similar to the Windows "front ends" for PGP 2.6.3?) and is there any
way I can access keyservers, except by importing my GnuPG keys into PGPkeys
and sending them to the Ldap servers?
Finally, whilst I realise RSA keys are not supported by GnuPG, are the
Legacy Keys produced by PGP 7.0? (I believe these are RSA based, so I would
assume not).
Thanks in advancefor any help you can give me.

Becky 2 is still beta, so you'll have to look for the program at the RIMArts
website, which is:
and the GnuPG plug-in can be obtained from:
Both programs are japanese in origin, although Becky 2 has been under
appraisal here in the West and is easy to follow, but being Beta, there's no
Help File (yet).  Documentation with the GnuPG plug-in is still totally in
Japanese, but the menu lists and pop-up boxes are in easy to understand
English (it too is in Beta).
If anybody wants to try Becky 2 and don't know how to set up the GnuPG
plug-in, please contact me off list.

Which version of PGP were you using to generate the RSA keys?  Using Windows
98, I have found the same using RSA keys generated by PGP 2.6.3 (or
variants); however, RSA keys generated by PGP 5.x to 6.5.8 seem to work with
GPG.  PGP 7.0, however, generates RSA keys as "Legacy" keys and these are
different to RSA keys generated by PGP 5.x to 6.5.8 and I understand (though
as I do not have PGP 7.0 I cannot check this) they will have problems in
being accepted by GPG.
The next question is: why use RSA keys?  What application are you using them
for?  If to use with remailers, they will often ask for RSA keys but are
happy to accept keys generated by PGP 5.x to PGP 6.5.8 (there are programs
for use with remailers which also use nym servers and will not work with PGP

facility with Windows GnuPG).
Also, Ldap keyservers (for instance) are supposed to share key information,
and there have been problems of keys on http keyservers reported to the
PGP-Basics discussion list, so probably the best idea would be to get a
list of *reliable* keyservers that share information and they are

The accepted ettiquette (at least with PGP) is that you sign a key and
send the signed key back to the originator.  He/She then uploads a
signed key to the keyservers.
Using PGP in Windows, there is a function to update the key, rather
than just send it to the keyserver, but there is no keyserver access
built into GnuPG for Windows, so if it is your key that needs updating,
send the key via a web based keyserver....I'd suggest Hope this helps

I use PGP 6.5.8 and GnuPG 1.0.4 in Windows 98SE, so I'll try to help. PGP 7 will (I understand) import GnuPG generated keys OK.  PGP 6.5.8
throws up a "bad parameter" error message but will eventually import a
GnuPG generated key into its keyring.  However, every time you go to
PGPkeys you will get this error message, and you just have to keep
clicking on the OK button until it goes (I think the number of times
this box pops up relates to the number of GnuPG keys on the keyring).
Hope this helps

You have probably been doing nothing wrong.  I noticed you were using
Eudora Light under Windows for your MUA, and so the answer is the way
in which PGP for Windows relates to GnuPG.
Keys generated by GnuPG will be recognised by PGP 7, put on the
keyring without fuss, but for versions of PGP before that, you will
have problems putting a GnuPG generated key on your keyring, or even
decrypting messages encoded using keys generated by GnuPG.  On the
other hand, GnuPG for Windows will recognise all PGP generated keys
with the exception of PGP 2.6.3, but has no keyserver support or
GnuPG uses the Blowfish algorithm which PGP 6.5.x does not support, so
you will get a "bad key message" or even a "bad parameter" message
from PGPkeys when attempting to put a GnuPG generated key on your
keyring.  The situation is not so bad with PGP 7, as it's designed to
be (partially) backwards compatible.
If you want to use your GnuPG keys under Windows, I would suggest the
best way is to put GnuPG for Windows on your PC, and then use one of
the Windows front ends (WinPT, GnuPGShell) with your existing MUA, or
get Becky!2 with the BkGnuPG plug-in.  Then use PGPkeys for keyserver
access, putting up with the annoying error messages.  I use PGP 6.5.8
and GnuPG 1.0.4 under Windows, and access them both through Becky!2
using the plug-ins, but accessing keyservers through PGPkeys and
through web pages.
Hope this helps........

Not that I'm aware of.  The only GnuPG mail client in Windows that
supports GnuPG that I know about is Becky!2, which is shareware,
although the GnuPG plug-in for it that interfaces directly with the
command line program is free.
Becky!2 is available at: BkGnuPG plug-in at: : Outlook Express is so full of security problems that I would not use
it at all.....
