Also, it isn't our fault, that M$ does use such simple crypto algorithms. I
personally share this opinion, but only for the encryption side. For
decryption, I don't understand why it should be a problem.
A problem is, that an user new to the Unix world wants to decrypt the
messages sent to them, regardless of the encryption system the sender used.
And since the gnupg solution is used by the popular KMail of KDE, no KMail
user is able to decrypt this Outlook crap sent to them. Is telling the
Outlook users to use another mail program or use no encryption at all the
solution? I don't think so. I even tried to convince Outlook to use 3des,
but couldn't figure out how to do that.
So, thanks for the explanation, keep up the good work.
