@_subject: [new-user] question 
I'm trying to understand the principals and benefits of using pgp/gpg
I think I understand that I send the part of my key that is public to
somebody and they use that key to encrypt a message which only I can
So what if somebody uses my public key to send me a message purporting
to come from somebody else ?
what is the mechanism to ensure it came from who I think it did ?

I don't know why procmail finds this list more elusive than any other.

what is the reasoning for attaching the key ID to the end of the
fingerprint string ?

@_subject: can someone verify the gnupg Fingerprint for pubkey? 
I see that it would be handy to have this stuff in the header where
presumably the client could respond and would take up less space in the
message body where it can get cluttered with all the sigs etc.

I'm using dreamhost. I appreciated that it seems quite handy to have all
that random characters stuff outside of the message body and I was
pointing out that it it is not universally accepted to have daemon thingys
like finger running so limiting the take up.

@_subject: private key protection 
reading this it occurs it me that keyboards are cheap so it would be
reasonable to swap all the keys about on a keyboard and then use some
easily memorably combination of real words to save on so much memorizing.

The turtle ( teenage mutant ninja ) is ok because it shows armour but also they are slow normally so probably making it look faster somehow would be a good thing, with wings ?

@_subject: Why the software is crap 
Something is strange, I don't know much about this stuff but it seems important to you to have encryption working. It is so easy these days to install an OS automagically I would, in your case, make a fresh installation on some other machine and do what it is you want to do to prove a point. Then once you see it working you have confidence.

I remember something like this happening with shorewall or smoothwall
or something where this guy tried to get ownership of the opensource
so then everybody jumped ship and made ipcop. Some guy came on the new
mailing list and you would swear he was a wind-up, knew enough to keep
you on your toes but retarded in composition, no idea if real or not.

@_subject: failed decryption 
The problem with encrypting files for storage seems to be that if there is any corruption there is no way to get any of it back.

I think Werner can make his own authority and certificate ?
That sort of information stuff used to much more readily accessible on the net, like how to run your own DNS.
For forgetful people is difficult to track things down now with so much available.

@_subject: where is gnupg configure file 
I made a key pair a couple of years ago but I never used them.
Now I try to make new Debian email server ( just for me ) all nice and there is enigma plugin for roundmail.
I imported my private and public keys and they seem to be in the keyring "gnupg -K --list-secret-keys" lists the secret keys
  but ~/.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d directory is empty.
Using enigma it doesn't seem able to find the keys.
First what I would like to do is find a configure file for gnupg ?

Ah OK, so there is no other config file somewhere with pristine install ( Debian)
Is there any point me exporting private keys and putting them in private-keys-v1.d directory ?

version is 1.4.18
from what I read I don't think I can use gpg2 because
Debian GNU/Linux 8 (jessie)apt uses gpg1 at present.
I'm certain private-keys-v1.d was there before I attempted to use there is this but I do not know if that is everything required for gpg2
mick at rapunzel:~$ locate gpg2
I have asked on roundcube list.

is clearer I think but issue is does jessie apt work with gpg being gpg2 I can just try but I spent best part of a week making my new server thingy as I would like it and I don't want to change something without knowing what I am doing.
