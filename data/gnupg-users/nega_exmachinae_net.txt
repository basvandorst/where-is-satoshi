 Be sure and read the notes, as setup is slightly different if you're
using Emacs or XEmacs.
XEmacs's crypt.el is part of the os-utils package (or xemacs-sumo
package if you go that route.) XEmacs also has a "encrypto" package, though I couldn't tell you
anything about it.
You can get those packages from the "packages" subdirectory at any
XEmacs mirror site.
While we're at it, use mailcrypt ( or gpg.el
for encrypting email (in most of the emacs mail readers). You can use
mailcrypt with Gnus, but I believe the Gnus folks recommend using their
included functionality. Since I use mailcrypt I can't tell you
anything about gpg.el (or even where to get it) except that if I
remember right, it is gpg specific (ie: it doesn't support pgp) and it
might do S/MIME, where mailcrypt doesn't.
