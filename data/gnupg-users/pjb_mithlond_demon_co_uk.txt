@_subject: GnuPG 0.9.10 interoperability with PGP 6.0.2i and 6.5.1 
Looking through the documentation and various list archives, I can't see
something matching this problem, so I'll ask here. User A is using GnuPG 0.9.10 on Linux.
User B is using PGP 6.0.2i on Win98.
User C is using PGP 6.5.1 on Linux.
All keys have been generated with default options (except for some
occasions of using longer keylengths).
User A can read encrypted and/or signed messages from user B.
User B can only read encrypted messages from user A, but cannot verify
signatures from user A.  (The error is `bad signature from....')
User C has the same problem as user B wrt user A.
Is this problem known, or have I missed something obvious?
If it's a problem, is there a fix or is someone looking into it?  (Otherwise, it's time to look into the problem more deeply myself.)

Content-ID: Alas, the file concerned (a posting I grabbed from rec.humor.funny...) has
no tab characters (at least, I couldn't spot any using cat).  On deeper
inspection, the problem affects both clear-signing and armoured signing. I have uploaded some files to my WWW site:
Can anyone determine why PGP6.x.x complains of a bad signature on these

Ah, no, I was using the defaults.  I thought that --force-v3-sigs was
only needed for interoperability with PGP5.  When I use that switch, I can get PGP6.5.1/Linux to verify the
signatures, as can another user using PGP6.0.2 on Windows 9x.
But now I am confused -- can anyone suggest why some people can get
good verifications of the test signature, when others get bad
