@_subject: New to OpenPGP  getting frustrated. 
Okay so I'm using Open PGP software in conjunction with Thunderbird in
Linux.  I've figured out about everything except the only way I can add
public keys to my key ring so far is to save them as an attachment from
an e-mail sent to me.
How can I just copy a public key to my clipboard and add it to my key-ring?
