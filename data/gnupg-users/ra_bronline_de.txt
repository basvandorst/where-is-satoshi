Passphrase please. Passwort hints at short words (like your normal
password) being sufficient. And it should be a phrase, not a word.

Err. No. I cannot even write the names of several people I know just
using plain ascii. Neither can I write all the words I use in day to day
e-mail just using plain ascii. It might work for the english speaking
folks out there, who aren't from german/swedish/whatever ancestry, but
other languages *depend* on characters which cannot be found in the
ascii charset.
And for these people inline signing *does* break extremely quickly.
