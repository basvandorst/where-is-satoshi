@_subject: decryption failed : secret key not available 
I'm new on the list and I have a problem ...
I'm also new to gpg and wonder if i've made all the required steps in order to encrypt/decrypt files between two machines.
Machine A :
RedHat Linux 8.0; gnupg-1.2.0
Machine B :
Windows 2000; gnupg-w32cli-1.2.0
I generated keys on both machines, 2048 bits using DSA & ElGamal, exported public keys (still on both) and imported public keys A on B and B on A.
Then I tried encrypting a file.txt on Machine A like this :
# gpg -r "Machine A" -o file.gpg -a --encrypt file.txt
On Machine B :
# gpg -o file.txt --decrypt file.gpg
gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit ELG-E key, ID 012345ABC, created 2002-10-10
      "Machine B (B) "
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
I din't find any valuable information on lists and searches, so I wonder if I did all the required steps (traditionally, when I don't find a lot of information on my problems, it's a misunderstanding from me ...)
Could someone helps me ?
