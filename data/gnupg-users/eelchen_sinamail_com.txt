Dear all,
Per my poor English that I have a question after read the man page about --debug. Could someone kindly explain what is "or-ed" means?
--debug flags
                 Set debugging flags. All  flags  are  or-ed  and
                 flags may be given in C syntax (e.g. 0x0042).
Thanks in advance!

You may use HTTP protocol instead FTP for same link. I use this way to download the file.

Hello Werner,

I tried to download. I couldn't make the connection with FTP program,
and I couldn't connect to  with my browser. Looks
like I'm SOL.
