@_subject: Did I break my Ubuntu GPG installation? 
Hello there.
I'm quite new to GnuPG. In November I played around with it and
generated my first key.
In the meantime I started to read more about it and decided to start
anew, generating a masterkey under more secure conditions (I used
Tails), keeping it offline afterwards and generated signing and
encryption subkeys for daily use.
The problem now is as follows: on my Ubuntu machine I deleted my old key
and imported the new subkeys. But GPG wouldn't let me en- or decrypt
anything. So I thought, maybe it would be a good idea to uninstall GPG,
delete the .gnupg-folder and install it again. I did that and imported
the subkeys, but it still doesn't work. The error is as follows:
Could translate to: "no valid OpenPGP-Data" and "unknown system error"?
But gpg --edit-key stefan.boehringer at posteo.de shows me:
I don't know why so much is stated as "unbekannt = unknown"...
On another Arch-Installation and on my Android-Phone using OpenKeyChain
it works just fine. What could I do?
Best regards

Thank you Damien for your suggestion. I set trust to ultimate, but still
the "no valid OpenPGP-Data" error occurs.

Hello Peter and thank you very much!
That worked. I really misunderstood the gpg commandline. :-)
