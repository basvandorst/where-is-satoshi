I am inclined to agree....O'Reilly have recently published a Guide to
Debian Gnu/Linux, and they are considered to be the ultimate in GPL
practices (Debian that is) The distribution I believe is an integral part
of the Publication....so how did they marry the two?
I for one would be very interested in a hard copy manual, and hope you

Has anyone managed to integrate GnuPG and Kmail...and if so how?

Hash: SHA1
I have recently added some UIDs to my keys, but unfortunately have been
unable to Change the Primary UID used . I have read the manual, but have
been unable to find anything which works.
Is this facility available?
I would appreciate some pointers.

Hash: SHA1
Hi Folks
I am currently getting an error warning when I encrypt using a combination
of Geheimnis,and GnuPG 1.0.1d
The error received is 134514624. Can anyone explain what this means....as
the messages are signed and encrypted properly.

Hi Folks
I posted about part of this a short time ago and received no answer. I have
been investigating several combinations and permutations of mail programs
and guifront ends for GnuPG.
Until recently I have been using XFmail which gives good GnuPG support. I
am nowplaying around with a patched version of KMail, and I have also tried
the Geheimnis GUI.
I have found that on a regular basis I have to delete my keyrings and
reinstall from my backup.
1) XFMail is able to sign messages, but is unable to find public keys for
2)Kmail signs OK, but encrypts to the recipient and does not encrypt to
3)Geheimnis both encrypts and signs, but returns the following error
Executing: gpg --no-batch --comment "Made with Geheimnis" -e -s -u 010FA449963EBA765 -a -t

Hash: SHA1
Hi Folks
I have a question regarding the behaviour of sub keys.
If I have a time limited primary subkey, and generate a new subkey. without
revoking the old one....what happens?
Are both keys used..or.is the original used until it expires with the new
one taking over?

@_subject: Possible Bug in GnuPG? 
Hash: SHA1
Hi Folks.
Today I installed PGP on a windows system which uses Outlookexpress as the
mail agent.
All encrypted  messages I send using GnuPG are displayed as a single line,
with heavy vertical lines where the line ends should be.
I asked for advice from the PGP users list, and was informed that this is a
GnuPG Bug.
I set up OE5 on my windows partition and carried out a few tests...GnuPG
messages are displayed as described above. PGP 6.5.2 command line displays
as it should be.
Has anyone else noticed this?
Brian
