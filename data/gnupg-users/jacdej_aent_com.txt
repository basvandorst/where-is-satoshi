In building gnupg v1.2.1, I encounter the following error --

@_subject: gnupg v1.2.1 
receive the following error:
# echo 'hello world' | pgpe -r  | gpg --decrypt
No files specified.  Using stdin.

You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: "userid
gpg: public key decryption failed: bad passphrase
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
When I retry the steps and include the step to create a blank passphrase, I
get a "bad passphrase" error.
Any suggestions?
I am running gnupg 1.2.1 on hpux 11.11 system.

In compiling pinentry-0.6.8 on an hpux 11.11 system with HP ANSI/C compiler,
the process fails with the following error --
checking for fopencookie... no
configure: error:
*** fopencookie(3) is needed to build this package.
*** We will provide an replacement in a later release.
I am running the following command --
Is there an alternate version of glibc-2.3, containing "fopencookie", which
is available for hpux 11.11?
Thanks for you reply.

this problem -- On a unix server, decrypting a file which was encrypted on
an NT server running GNU PGP.  However, I don't see any posted solution.
I have exported, re-imported both public and secret keys; I have set 'trust'
to ultimate; and 'lsign' the public key from the customer running GPG on NT.
Thanks for your help,
