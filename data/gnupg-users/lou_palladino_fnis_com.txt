@_subject: Trying to build libassuan for gnupg 
I am trying to build a 64-bit libassuan on Solaris 10 SPARC.  I have tried
with Sun?s CC, GCC, make, and gmake (as well as 32-bit) but they all bomb
gmake[3]: Entering directory `/tmp/libassuan-1.0.5/tests'

root at atlst2000 # All of the other GnuPG dependencies have built fine in 64-bit mode with GCC
and gmake on this box.
Thanks in advance.
