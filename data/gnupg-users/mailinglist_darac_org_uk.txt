There's also a shell-based reimplementation, if the dependencies of the original are a bit too heavy:

@_subject: Folks, complete novices unfamiliar with a message turns up with 
I would suggest their very next step is to search, using their preferred
search engine, for a distinctive phrase from the "gobbledygook". One
phrase that the user may notice is common to the messages is: "BEGIN PGP
SIGNED MESSAGE".  If I enter that into a search engine, I get several
results, including a number of sites purporting to be tutorials or
introductions or howtos for either "PGP" or "The GNU Privacy Guard".
With luck, one or other of those will enlighten the user.

@_subject: about how the MUA mutt signs mails 
This is "PGP-MIME" format, as refined in
. Section 5 of that clearly states:
   The multipart/signed body MUST consist of exactly two parts.  The
   first part contains the signed data in MIME canonical format,
   including a set of appropriate content headers describing the data.
   The second body MUST contain the OpenPGP digital signature.  It MUST
   be labeled with a content type of "application/pgp-signature".
So, the MUA must convert the message body to MIME format (with the right
line endings, with any Base64 or Quoted Printable encoding applied) and
add the Content-Type header BEFORE signing the message. Similarly, the
MUA must verify the signature BEFORE parsing the body's header for how
to decode the message for display/saving.
To re-iterate, when you save the message body, mutt strips the header
and decodes the file (imagine if this was a binary attachment in Base64
encoding; you DO want mutt to reconstruct it back into binary form).

@_subject: Having trouble adding gpg key to apt keyring in Debian 9.0 
Thank you. I've been meaning to switch my apt sources over to this style
for a while, but couldn't seem to get apt to see the separate keys. It
looks like I was missing out the "[signed-by=...]" part.
