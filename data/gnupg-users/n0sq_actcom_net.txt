@_subject: trouble running GPG 1.0.6 on Mandrake 8.1 
Even though I set gpg as SUID I can't get it to work with my mail
programs. Below are the permission settings for the various files. At
least one of them is set wrong. BTW, I can execute GPG as root but not
as a user.What have I done wrong? It worked fine under Mandrake 7.2.

What would prevent GNUPG from importing my secret key from PGP 6.5.8? I
tried to import it with gpg --allow-secret-key-import but it doesn't get
added. I thought that it was a problem with GNUPG 1.0.4 but I upgraded to
1.0.6 and had the same problem. I was able to import it on another machine
running Mandrake 7.2 (I'm running 7.2 on both machines) with 1.0.6 installed.
