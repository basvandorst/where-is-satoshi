@_subject: Key propagation 
I was wondering if it is possible to limit key propagation, that is the number of times a key can be exported and reimported.
If I understand correctly, once a key is created, there is no way to limit the number of times this key is going to be propagated.  If I give my public (or secret for that matter) key to someone else, that person in turn can export it and give it to someone else, ad infinitum.
If I want only 1 or 2 other people to have my key, is it possible during the key creation to give it a parameter stating that this key can only be exported x number of times?
Of course all this assumes that I still have control of the key file, for instance I go on the other person's computer, import the key and then delete the original key file that was used for the import.

Thanks for the answer Daniel.
That's more or less what I thought, even though I could retain the control of the exported key file, of course once imported on the other computer, it is then written in the gpg conf files that could in turn be copied to another
