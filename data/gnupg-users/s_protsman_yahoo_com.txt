@_subject: gpg dependency issues (krb5 & klogd) 
I am running SuSE Linux Enterprise 9 on an iSeries
(Power5 chipset) server:
Linux l336649e_pub 2.6.5-7.139-pseries64  SMP Fri
Jan 14 15:41:33 UTC
2005 ppc64 ppc64 ppc64 GNU/Linux
The installed version of gpg is 1.2.4.  I would like
to update the system to 1.4.x.
gpg 1.4 was not available via yast so I downloaded
gpg-1.4.0-4.src.rpm from the SuSE 9.3 tree.  Upon
rebuilding the RPM I get the following:
Installing gpg-1.4.0-4.src.rpm
error: Failed build dependencies:
        klogd is needed by gpg-1.4.0-4
        krb5 is needed by gpg-1.4.0-4
klogd is installed and in my path:
And I know I have the kerberos stuff installed:
# rpm -qa | grep -i heimdal
So, I am a little confused as to why these dependency
issues appear.  Thoughts and suggestions are
appreciated in getting this dependency issue with
klogd and krb5 resolved.

Hi David,
I have considered removing those references from the
"BuildRequires" section of the gpg.spec file but I'm
somewhat hesitant.  __________________________________ Do you Yahoo!? Yahoo! Small Business - Try our new resources site!

I've searched via Google the above message and found
one post that said to remove the "--no-tty" from the
gpg.conf file.  Well, I don't have a line with that
parameter in the file.

@_subject: Decrypt file from PGP Desktop Professional 
This is not a problem. I use both, PGP Desktop, gnupg and PGP Command Line interchangeably all the time. You would decrypt the file the same way you would any other file.
Encrypted file with pgp:
$ pgp -e appts.txt -r jd at foo.com
appts.txt:encrypt (0:output file appts.txt.pgp)
Decrypt the file with gpg:
$ gpg -o appts.tmp.txt -d appts.txt.pgp
You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: "John Doe "
2048-bit ELG-E key, ID 6AD4EB61, created 2007-02-12 (main key ID BB93ECF1)
gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit ELG-E key, ID 6AD4EB61, created 2007-02-12
      "John Doe "

Hi !
I'm a newbie in gnupg.
If a file is encrypted using PGP Desktop Professional, is it possible for me to decrypt that file using gnupg ?
If it's possible , how to do that ?

@_subject: export keys and import to pgp 7 
I'm running some tests and exported some keys from my gpg 1.4.7 instance using the instructions here:
I then attempted to import into an older PGP 7.01 (command line) installation:
Now, when I receive a file and attempt to decrypt that file with PGP 7 it still doesn't accept my passphrase. Does anyone know of a workaround?       ____________________________________________________________________________________

@_subject: export/import additional user id 
I have a user that has two email addresses attached to their key:
pub   1024D/630934DC 2007-08-27
uid                  Mike uid                  Mike sub   2048g/113A7E70 2007-08-27
They exported with the following:
$ gpg --armor --ouput mike.asc --export Mike
When I import I only get mike.h at foobar.com and not the first one. Therefore I cannot encrypt to the first address. Any idea on what we are doing wrong? I've tried "--export mike at foo.com" and all sorts of combinations.

My work around (which I hope there is a simpler way) was to extract the text I wanted to encrypt, paste it into a text file, encrypt that file with --armor, cut and paste the encrypted text out of the temporary file and back into the email, then send to the correct email address. I'd love to know of a more efficient way of doing this.

Thanks David,
That is fine but this still leaves me with a problem. I compose a new email message (in this case with Mail.app), select Encrypt, but cannot address it to the first email address because gpg doesn't seem to see that address in the keyring. I am forced to select the email address that I'd prefer not to use. Any ideas?
