You have not imported the private key.
You can list which private keys you do have with:
    gpg --list-secret-keys
If you do see the 1CC8C8AD84BF7E76 key listed, look closely to make sure that you also have the 7E5B6A6AB3392A8D sub-key, which the file was encrypted to.  If you don't have that sub-key, you'll need to find it and import it too.
