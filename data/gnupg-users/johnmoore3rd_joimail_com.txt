Hash: SHA1
If you're just beginning to use GnuPG I would suggest version 1.2.6
since it is the last "stable" release.  While I have personally had no
problems with 1.3.92, Command Line use does have a learning curve and a
stable release would probably make it easier to determine whether a
problem was with you or something in the version code.
Should you decide to remain with 1.3.92 (as I assume it's installed now)
I do recommend that you maintain a Keyring back-up "just in case."  I do
not know which O/S you are using, but if it's M$ Windows I generally
steer new people to the Nullify version (1.2.3nrl) as it may be
downloaded with a Windows installer.
Personally I find command line very easy once one is familiar with it;
however preferences vary.  You should also look into a "frontend" for
GnuPG on a Windows box.  My preference there is GPG Shell, but many
others prefer WinPT.

@_subject: Should I use S/MIME? 
Hash: SHA1
If you truly wish to use S/MIME I highly recommend CAcert as a source to
obtain a Free Certificate.  You will also need to download their Root
Certificate into your Certificate Manager as they are not Universally
supplied with most software.
In order to establish Trust you will need to meet with Assurers to prove
your identity. (This is also true with Thawte & the others)  However,
since the vast majority of CAcert Notaries are also PGP/GnuPG users,
getting your Key signed at the same time is no problem.  CAcert will
also sign your PGP Key as well, indicating the level of attained trust.

@_subject: Should I use S/MIME? 
Hash: SHA1
However it must be pointed out that with CAcert (and Thawte) the only
way to have your Name appear on the Certificate is to physically have
your identity verified by another Member or Members (called Assurers)
who then sign your key vouching for the validity.  The only personal
information they ask/require is some government issued number which you
can produce to an Assurer later to confirm you are the same individual.
~ A simple email address is easy to Spoof!  It's hardly "proof of
identity" and neither CAcert or Thawte truly cares if you "make up" a
number for ID purposes; however, without a way to "prove" that number is
yours you'll never get enough Assurance Points to have your Name placed
upon the certificate.  Think of it as having a Bill of Sale notarized
for future proof that you did sign the contract.

Hash: RIPEMD160
On August 1st...Maxine Brandt died in Hospital.  The COD was a chronic
lung infection.  Below I am including the Post I placed on PGPNET, in
addition to some comments included to other folks.
 Maxine was the 2nd PGP contact I ever made and at the time of her
passing was the Very Best On-Line Friend I've ever had.  She "demanded"
that I switch to Foxfire & Thunderbird. (of course, She always said that
if Mozilla ever caved in and allowed T-Bird to archive decrypted mail,
She'd drop it and never trust it again.)  When I wanted to "try" GPG she
steered me to Nullify and told me to "Stay There until another Nullify
version is released!"  Yet, whenever another build of GPG came along she
patiently walked me through installing it and getting it working.  Below
is the Post to PGPNET.....
She was a Journalist for RFO based in Tahiti.  She loved working on
stories about Government corruption.  She broke the story about the 800+
gov't employees receiving Direct Deposit paychecks to a Bank in the
Caymen Islands.  Trouble was, no one could actually "lay hands" on any
of them.  Caused a topple of the local Government in Tahiti that
actually resulted in "the People" occupying the President's House while
he was in Paris trying to "explain things."
The lung condition was the result of something toxic she breathed while
covering a story several years ago.  After the story broke in Tahiti she
was transfered to London (I actually met her as She passed through
Atlanta), but due to the weather, had much trouble breathing so
requested re-assignment back to either Tahiti or New Zealand.  She got
Tahiti; and I learned how to "cuss" in French as she described "passing
her things" in a plane while they were traveling by ship in the other
She mailed me a huge box of software to forward for her, but being lazy
I was able to send it right back to her.  Of course I kept the CD's she
earmarked for me, that's how I managed to upgrade to M$ 2000 Pro from
98se at no cost.  I am also in love with the gift of Executive
Diskkeeper Pro 9....automatic defragging whenever it is needed.  I was
in the middle of learning how to compile GPG Binaries when my old PC
failed.  Once I have time/energy to parse my old HD (now a slave on this
PC) for the saved emails and "tools" I hope to continue learning on my
own.  I still have a long list of questions I was gonna ask her once I
got back on-line.  S*** Happens!
She did once tell me that she found "Rites of Death" very depressing and
when Her time came....she hoped that all of her friends would get
together for a fantastic Chineese Banquet followed by all night drinking
& dancing.

Knee-jerk response is to say "It does Nothing to you Key/sub-Key" but

You're using GnuPG 1.2.1, so the immediate suggestion would be to
upgrade to 1.4.2.  A *lot* has changes since 1.2.1.

I cannot speak to the gpg-agent issue; But, Enigmail *does* allow you to
set the time it will store the passphrase.  5 minutes is the Default,
but you may change it to any number of minutes you prefer.  Look under
OpenPGP > Preferences.
One reminder; whenever you Close/Exit Thunderbird the passphrase will be

Hash: SHA512
If I am reading your Question correctly, You wish to add the 'Signature'
which can be read *after* the message has been Decrypted.  Using
Thunderbird, go into Account Settings and there will be a Box in which
to add your desired signature.  This is done by 'Browsing' to a .txt
File on your HD that contains the Signature you prefer.
If you intend upon using multiple signatures based upon addressee,
whimsy, Key used, etc. then you should simply add the Extension
'Signature Switch' to Thunderbird.

@_subject: RSA vs DSA/ElGamal 
Hash: SHA512
My personal preference is for an RSA signing Key with an ElGamal
encryption sub-Key.  My reasons are twofold:
RSA Keys have *all* the hash functions available to them.  Nothing
truncated.  RSA Keys are more difficult to 'forge' signatures due to the
built in "firewall", for lack of a better word.  Much has been written
on PGP-Basics regarding this ability within RSA Keys.  Robert J. Hansen
also explains this very well in his 'Un-Official PGP FAQ' which is
accessible from my Homepage.
I use an ElGamal encryption sub-Key solely because I feel that
bit-for-bit, ElGamal is the stronger.  Others can & may differ.
The way to avail yourself of all the Options in Key Generation is simply
to add the single word _expert_ to your gpg.conf File.  This single, 1
word line in gpg.conf will also allow you to accomplish a lot of silly
things.  For instance, absurdly large Keys may be generated.
If by 'bitrate' (bit rate?) you are referring to the hash function, you
are limited to a 160 bit Hash and I'd suggest RIPEMD160.  If you are
using a Compiled version of 1.4.4 and have decided to generate a DSA2
Key, then I'd specify SHA256 to obtain security & maximum verification

Hash: SHA512
That's Fine!  There is *no* security weakness there; as long as the Key
size is 2048 you should be in great shape.
Assuming you still have control over your 'compromised' Key you may wish
to generate a Revocation Certificate for it and Import it into your Key
and then send the Old/Original Key (now Revoked) to the Keyservers so no
one will attempt to use it in the future.
Word of Caution:  If you have any Files encrypted using the Old/Original
Key; Decrypt them first.

@_subject: personal-cipher/digest-preferences 
Hash: SHA512
Well, Yes & No.  Your personal-preferences are just that.  These are the
ciphers & digests you prefer using.  When Encrypting to *one* other Key
or Many, GnuPG will compare Your preferences to the ones the
recipient(s) have indicated on their Key are theirs.  GnuPG will then
accommodate  all Recipient(s).
In your example the message would be Encrypted using Twofish.  This is
because you are doing the Encrypting and this is what You *prefer* and
the recipient has shown that s/he can handle Twofish.  Should they click
'Reply' and email you back, it would be Encrypted using AES since they
are originating the Encryption and that's their preference and you have
indicated you find AES acceptable.  In the case of multiple
recipients/Keys, GnuPG will determine the common denominator.  This is
why in large Group Encryption environments you will most likely see SHA1
used as the Hash.  It's "common" to every engine.  In encryption you
will generally find 3DES used as the cipher for the same reason.

Hash: SHA512
Welcome back from your UK vacation...my query is more along the lines of
 what should/can be added to gpg.conf to perhaps automatically protect
the secret Key from being surrendered?  In order to be able to provide
the Session Key *only* what can be automatically introduced into GnuPG
encryption 'each & every' time?  If it isn't possible to do this via
gpg.conf, can it be done via Enigmail "Additional Parameters'?

Easiest method would be to ignore the gpg.conf/Options File and, using
Enigmail, Open the Preferences > PGP/MIME tab and select the Digest
algorithm from the drop down box.

David makes a very good point!  The possibility strongly exists that an
individual has requested a /specific/ Keyserver for refreshing or
downloading their Key because they have control of their Key that way.
They may *not* wish that their Key be exposed to the 'gossip Servers'
and would be irritated.

The 're-signing' of the Key will automatically override the Local Sig.

If clarity is your goal; 2440bis isn't going to provide it.  DSA2 is

versions of existing Hash algorithms.  They 'work' the same as existing
DSA Hash functions.
