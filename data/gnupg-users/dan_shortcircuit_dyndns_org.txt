Sks works just beautifully as a matter of fact. And I have a keyserver
that is up to date if anyone wants to use it :>
keyserv.shortcircuit.dyndns.org. Standard port. I keep it upddated.

Read the yellow text above the subject line. If it says UNVERIFIED
signature, you lack the public key. if it says UNTRUSTED signature, you
have their public key but it has not been signed. If it says Good
signature, you have their public key and it's been signed by someone else.

@_subject: Revoke a public key w/o the secret key? 
Is this possible? Reason I'm asking is I found that some PGP Keyservers are still floating an old key of mine around that was SOPOSED to have been revoked some time ago. I don't have the associated secret key anymore so I cannot generate a revoke by simply using gpg --gen-revoke. Is there a way to generate a revoke certificate w/o having the secret key?
