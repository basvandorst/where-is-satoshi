@_subject: Gpg4Win:  Setting TEXTMODE On ? 
We are using the Gpg4Win product for encrypting files.
The files we are encrypting and sending are text files with carriage-return and linefeed characters at the end of each line (record).  The receiver of these files needs the CR and LF characters preserved by the encryption-decryption process.  The files contain valid text data only.
When the file is decrypted by the receiver using another PGP-compliant product, the CR and LF characters are lost.
I BELIEVE we need to use the TEXTMODE=ON option when encrypting the file but the GUI for Gpg4Win does not reference this option.
QUESTION:  WILL Gpg4Win RECOGNIZE A PGP.CONF FILE CONTAINING "TEXTMODE=ON"?
