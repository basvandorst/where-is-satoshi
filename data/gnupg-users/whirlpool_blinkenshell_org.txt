It seems that APG and OpenKeychain on Android supports GPG key exchange
via NFC just like BBM pin exchange via QRcode.

@_subject: GPG's vulnerability to quantum cryptography 
Using GPG encryption is still good, although it's vulnerable to quantum It's a good idea to set an expiration for each of your GPG key.
So that, when the expiration time comes, you'll be able to generate a
new GPG key to address a possibility of your old keys being cracked.
GPG is not perfect. It's just pretty good as the name suggest.
At least, it'll be able to protect your secured data for the rest of
your life or for the time specified at the expiration date.

It depends on how important the data is. Of course, if the data is so
important, when the expiration time comes, all the data encrypted with
the old key need to be decrypted and encrypted with the new generated
Although it's not truly necessary to do this work when the data is no
longer considered as important.
For encrypted communication, it's better to use the new generated key
when the expiration time comes.
I don't enforce my idea to be applied by everyone. This is an advice for
myself to do a good gpg practice.
Someone may refer to a key revocation rather than enforcing an
expiration time. That's also good practice.
I believe everyone of you has a method to prevent quantum
cryptodecryption on your public keys.

This is also a good practice. Revoking a key which is suspected to be
compromised seems a good gpg practice. Because we don't know when
quantum computing will be ready to use. Maybe 50 years later, or maybe
10 years later? Just find out how Intel is shrinking miroprocessor die
size every year.
Quantum computing is still long way to go. For now, as long as we stick
to good gpg practice, no need to worry of compromised keys.
I know that when the expiration time comes, the data will not be
automatically decrypted.

@_subject: one key/pair for multiple email accounts 
This depends on your situation.
If you want to be identified as one single person for all mails, you
are better use one key id and add each mail address to your primary key as additional identities.
If you want to hide your real identity by having multiple email addresses, you may create a separate identity key for each mail address.
That's what I thought.

@_subject: one key/pair for multiple email accounts 
There is no limitation of how many keys can be associated with a single
mail address. You may generate one key for each computer you are using
and tell your contacts to encrypt the messages with a specified key.
For example, on a private subject - you may use the key stored on your
private computer, so that the sender will ensure that you read the
encrypted message on your private pc not on your public system.
If privacy isn't absolutely needed, you may use the key stored on your
public system managed by another administrator. Your key is safe, as
long as you protect it with an uncrackable passphrase.
The system administrator may gain access to your private key file, but
not to your private key usage right.
One last thing to remember: if you don't trust the system, don't store
any private key on it. That's a bit paranoid, but it's better to be safe
than to trust and regret later.

@_subject: email bot for PGP/MIME PGP/Inline conversion 
There is a mail program supporting pgp messages. It's K9-Mail with APG
encryption software. It supports PGP/MIME message format.
Whenever a PGP encrypted message is detected, it calls APG to do the
cryptographic tasks and view the decrypted message.
Of course, there is no way to convert PGP/MIME to inline PGP because
this will break the PGP signature validity.
I recommend to leave the smartphone as is and do the encrypted mails on a pc.

@_subject: Mutt: Decrypting inline gpg format directly 
I wonder if Mutt can be configured to decrypt inline pgp messages
automatically, without piping the attachment to `gpg --decrypt`.
I know, piping works, but it'd be more convenient to have mutt do the
piping task and automatically display the decrypted message inside.
If anyone has an idea or experience with Mutt, please give your answer.

@_subject: Mutt: Decrypting inline gpg format directly 
Yeah, thanks for giving me this idea.
I've asked on mutt mailing list and got the answer that inline pgp
messages can be manually decrypted using ESC + P button.
Automatic decryption is invoked by putting `set pgp_auto_decode=yes` on
~/.muttrc file. So this is the most convenient method for me.
Again, thanks for giving me your idea.

@_subject: Problems invoking gpgsm with curses interface. 
Gnupg has s/MIME component to manage x509 certificate, which is called
gpgsm. Running gpgsm with a working desktop such as KDE is fine. But
when I'm running it on a shell, using pinentry-curses as passphrase
input backend, I got an error saying that LC-CTYPE is unknown.
gpgsm: pinentry-curses: no LC_CTYPE known - assuming UTF-8
I've set GPG_TTY environment variable and started gpg-agent as daemon.
For your information, I run gpgsm to import a p12 certificate
`gpgsm --import mycert.p12`
Is there any workaround to fix this strange gpgsm behavior?

Yes, gpgme backend is great. But there is a problem with s/mime
handling. Before doing any s/mime decryption/encryption, a p12 private
key is needed. Since gpgme backend uses gpgsm to handle s/mime, I need
to import my p12 certificate.
The problem is pinentry doesn't come to foreground when I invoke `gpgsm

Yeah, I love the gpgme idea. But I dislike the gpgme part is not working
with s/mime. I mean there is always problem to invoke passphrase input
dialog on s/mime messages.
Is there any workaround to fix s/mime issue?
