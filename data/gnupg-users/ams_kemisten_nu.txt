It has restrictions. One can't study it or modify it which are
two of the four freedoms when one speaks about about Free Software [1].
GPGShell may be free as in free beer, but not free as in freedom.

@_subject: hide warning 
Yes, read the FAQ.
6.1) Why do I get "gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!"
On many systems this program should be installed as setuid(root). This is
necessary to lock memory pages. Locking memory pages prevents the operating
system from writing them to disk and thereby keeping your secret keys really
secret. If you get no warning message about insecure memory your operating
system supports locking without being root. The program drops root privileges
as soon as locked memory is allocated.
On UnixWare 2.x and 7.x you should install GnuPG with the 'plock' privilege
to get the same effect:
filepriv -f plock /path/to/gpg
If you can't or don't want to install GnuPG setuid(root), you can use the
option "--no-secmem-warning" or put
no-secmem-warning in your ~/.gnupg/options file (this disables the warning).
On some systems (e.g., Windows) GnuPG does not lock memory pages and older
GnuPG versions (<=1.0.4) issue the warning
gpg: Please note that you don't have secure memory
This warning can't be switched off by the above option because it was thought
to be a too serious issue. However, it confused users too much so the warning
was eventually removed.

@_subject: Confused about sub-keys. 
This is an silly, ugly hack to suit my needs nothing else, and I do
not recommend anyone to use it either, anyone who does cannot blame me
for anything that goes wrong (like gpg sending your secret key and
password to some evil three letter agency, etc.).  Oh, and it is
completely untested!
This patch will add "***" to the beginning of the key listing of
--list-secret-keys indicate that the secret key is absent.  I don't
know how much one can trust that sk->protect.s2k.mode will be 1001
when the master key is absent, but it works right now... $ gpg --list-secret-keys

@_subject: Confused about sub-keys. 
Is it possible to store a sub-key separate from the "master" key (for
the purpose to store the master key off-line, and then only using the
sub-key for encryption, or something along those lines)?
(section "Selecting expiration dates and using sub-keys", first
paragraph).  I can think of many situations where it would be very
handy to be able to store the master key (the one that collects
signatures) off-line and then use a sub-key to encrypt/sign documents

@_subject: Confused about sub-keys. 
Oh, now that is great. Now the only thing left is to get
--list-secret-keys to output some useful information if the master
key is not present.  Or is this already implemented in GnuPG 1.2.0?

   As a US legislator once remarked, "If it (a bird) looks like a duck, walks
   like a duck, quacks like a duck, then it's probably a duck." Then you proboly never used GNU.

@_subject: restoring ~/.gnupg folder 
Looking at the list of files in ~/.gnupg, it looks like maybe I
   should chmod 644 a few of them.
Only if you want everyone to be able to read you secret key!  Better
used 600.
   [root root]# ll /home/charles/.gnupg
   total 32

Yeah, why not adapt computersystems to use hyroglyphs, rhunes and
   cuneiforms too. All very usefull. Noone cares that the message
   sizes grow significantly, we all have glass fiber lines to our

If size of the message is so important to you, please remove your

non-sense you could put into that that people would have to download!
Really, if you are that worried about size, please move this thread
