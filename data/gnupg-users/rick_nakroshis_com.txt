@_subject: Renewing expired keys 
Been a while since I used my GPG installation, and my keys have expired.
Looking at the docs, I see how to set up an initial set of keys, but how
about a follow-on set?  Do I generate a new set with same email address,
and sign them with my expired key to show they come from the same person?
Not quite sure   Suggestions/advice, please?

What version of GPG are you using?  I used v2.2.0 and had to make some
minor changes
--armor instead of --armored
--fingerprint instead of --with-fignerprints
After those changes, it worked just fine, and did output four lines that
were nicely parseable and without any error messages.
