@_subject: GPA Problem on Mac 
I recently compiled GPA on my Mac running Tiger, and I got the  following error when I tried to run gpa (in xterm):
$ gpa
dyld: Symbol not found: _pth_connect
   Referenced from: /usr/local/lib/libgpgme.11.dylib
   Expected in: flat namespace
Trace/BPT trap
Is there a way to fix this?
Thank you in advance for any help,
