@_subject: winpt still active? 
Hash: SHA1
I've seen several (old) references to winpt as the GUI for Windows.
Before I download and install it, I would like to ask whether it is
still maintained and whether it is still the proper choice of a GUI for
that platform. Mind you, I have a working installation, but I wanted to
see what I could see as long as it is currently maintained software.
Thanks for any pointers,

I like the idea of the lock in the gnu's nose.
What about a big, bright chain around the gnu's neck with a gnupg lock
on it? Sort of like 'bling' as they say.
IANAA (I'm not an artist) or I'd sketch it.

@_subject: three computers and one secret key? 
Hi folks,
I'm new to the list. I live and work in Austin, TX.
I've been trying to find this answer and have tried various things but
I'm not having any luck. The only thing I'm sure of is that this can't
be an original question, so I apologize for that and for not having
found the answer already.
I set up macgpg and enigmail on my home computer (running Mac OS 10.4.7)
and it is working great (with SeaMonkey and Thunderbird). Now I would
like to use the same secret key on both of my work computers, one is Mac
OS 10.3.9 and the other is Windows XP. Both of these computers also have
SeaMonkey and Thunderbird installed.
Ooh, I think I just got the Mac to work by (securely) moving my at-home
.gnupg folder into place on the work computer and reinstalling the
enigmail extension. Oh darn, it almost works but it gives an error when
sending mail: Error - bad passphrase.
So what am I supposed to be doing? Assuming it can be done, how do I
export my secret key for use on other computers? Do I have to use a
memory stick or other portable device to make this work? Is it possible
(and prudent) to put it on a server somewhere in a secure fashion?
Thanks much for any pointers,

Thank you very much for your help. I believe that I have both (all three
really) working now.
It seems that on MacOS 10.3.9 I needed to disable the OpenPGP option
"Use gpg-agent for passphrase handling." (The enigmail error mentioned a
problem accessing gpg-agent.) Additionally, since it is using gpg 1.4.1,
the command is a little different:
gpg --secret-keyring --no-default-keyring ~/path/to/mykeys/priv.asc
On the PC (running gpg 1.4.5--with no man pages apparently), I moved the
files to:
C:\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\gnupg
... and renamed them to pubring.asc and secring.asc.
Issuing gpg --import on each file appropriately created the correct
pubring.gpg and secring.gpg that I needed.
Do I have a volunteer to accept an encrypted message from me so that I
can verify it's working? (Does it make sense to ask this question? Can
sending an encrypted message to someone other than myself verify this
any better than just sending one to myself--which I know works?)

I wonder why the enigmail plugin for SeaMonkey asks for my FIPS password every time I open it then?
