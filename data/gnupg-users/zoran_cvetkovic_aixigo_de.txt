@_subject: readonly file systems 
we are going to run gpg on our webserver.
For security reasons we do mount some partitions read only
Thus our gpg home belongs to such a ro directory.
Now we have got the problem that pgp is not able to
create its lockfile there.
Is it save to use the no lock file option in such an environment (read
only FS)
Is there a way to relocate the lockfile ?
Kindly Regards Zoran Cvetkovic
