@_subject: Elliptic curve point multiplication with libgcrypt 
Hi gpg hackers!
I want to implement an elliptic curve point multiplication (Q=dG) operation
with libgcrypt. I attach my code but my program doesn't work and it has
many errors. I comment the workflow of my program in the attached code.
my question is how do you implement Q=dG in C with libgcrypt? any idea
about my mistakes and how should I fix them?

Hi gpg hackers,
I want to see gpg2 key parameters packets. pgpdump v0.32 doesn't support
gpg2 (especially elliptic curve cryptography packets) and "gpg2
--list-packets" doesn't show key parameters. is there any way to see key
parameters (d, q and curve) of ecc in gpg2 imported secret subkeys?

I find my answer, my gpg version was my problem, more information in the
