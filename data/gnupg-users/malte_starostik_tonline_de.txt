@_subject: --list-keys slow 
Hash: SHA1
Every time I run gpg --list-keys (or KMail runs it to get the available public keys), it takes horribly long. My pubring.gpg contains some 400 keys. There is a noticeable delay before one of the keys is output, which is especially long (3360). Unfortunately --fast-list-mode can't be used as the names and addresses are needed.
Someone told me gpg also does some verification while listing the keys.
Would it be possible to implement something like --fast-list-mode but with additionally outputting name/comment/email or would that take as long?
