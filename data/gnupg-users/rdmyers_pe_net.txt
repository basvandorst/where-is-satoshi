@_subject: GPG 1.2.2 released? 
Just upgraded from 1.2.1, to 1.2.2, and now Sylpheed gives the error
Could not find any key associated with the currently selected key id
'0x7256FA2F'. I even tried the sub key, which is my new email address.
This did work earlier in the morning, before I upgraded. Any help would be appreciated.

My brother just got a Mac laptop, I'm trying to get him setup with an
email client that has seemless (as possible) gpg support.
What suggestions does the list have?
