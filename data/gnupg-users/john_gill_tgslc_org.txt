@_subject: E-Mail Encryption: Why Isn't Everyone Doing It? 
The interface is too confusing for the "average-home" user.  It's like
asking them to perform a tune-up on a car. They just don't know or care to
know.  Encryption is a great idea, but because of user interface issues it's
still for power-users or better.

Why isn't everyone doing phone encryption?  Why isn't everyone
encrypting their personal postal mail?  Just because something is
technically possible doesn't mean everyone should use it.

@_subject: Verifying a signature 
I had to do this too.  To solve it, I created a master key database and
created a custom keyring only when I needed to decrypt a single item.  Into
that custom keyring I placed my public key and the public key of the sender.
The b2b network I was working with required all participants to put a set of
identifying information in the subject/filename so that the receiving party
knew who should have signed the file.

If I'm running gpg in an automated environment, what is the best way to make sure that a good signature came from the sender I expected?
For instance: I run gpg decrypt with --status-fd and analyze the output to see that a GOODSIG was included.  Now how do I make sure it was ACME's signature and not somebody else on my keyring?  Do I check the output for ACME's name or email or whatever identifying information they have with their public key?

@_subject: compress-algo issues 
I'm trying to interoperate with pgp and gpg, and the sticking point seems to
be the compressi-algo option.  I think I should be using the option for ZIP,
but what is the numeric code for that?  I thought that it was 1.

@_subject: difficult problems with 1.2.2 win cli 
I'm having an annoying problem with gpg1.2.2 for windows.
Using the following batch file
"C:\DEV\crypto\gpg.exe" --homedir "C:\DEV\crypto" --batch --logger-fd 1
--gen-key "C:\DEV\crypto\opts.dat"
and the following options file
Key-Type: DSA
Key-Length: 1024
Subkey-Type: ELG-E
Subkey-Length: 2048
 y
Expire-Date: 0
Name-Real: genkey

%pubring C:/DEV/crypto/37827.4753785069
%secring C:/DEV/crypto/37827.4753785069.sec
If I run this in a "clean directory with only the gpg exe's in the directory
with the genkey.bat and opts.dat file I'll get a Dr. Watson error about 8
times out of 10 OS is win2k sp 3
Is there anything I can do, or am I out of luck?

After digging around a little more, it looks like the problem is happening
at the end of the DSA key generation. John W Gill
