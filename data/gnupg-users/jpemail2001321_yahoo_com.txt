I?ve encrypted some text to try out the passphrase-only encryption.
I?ve got this "error" after decryting the message although the message was decrypted correctly.

So its not really safe, is it?
 The problem is I need to encrypt a message but I dont know the recipient yet. So I considered a passphrase method.
Cause he dont need to send me his public key (if he has any). But.... OK I will try to encrypt the message with a new created private key (specially created for the recipient) which I will send later to him, so he will be able to decrypt the message. A bit complicated but possible, I think!? ^^
