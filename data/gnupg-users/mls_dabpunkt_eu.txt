either gpg or gpg2 show the umlaut in your key correct here. My locale
is LC_ALL=de_DE.UTF-8.

Am 27.07.2015 um 14:15 schrieb Neal H. Walfield:
As far as I understand, the email is encrypted with the public key of
the owner ? so as long as we think that GPG is safe, Nico?s
verification-emails should be also safe.
What could be a problem: The state or the ISP could create a key-pair of
its own and upload it, intercept the mail and verify it.

maybe I?m blind, but how can I receive a key from a pka- or
OpenPGP-DNS-entry without encrypting a (dummy-)file?

If I send a encrypted message to you and EvilPerson (together in the
same eMail), you receive the email and gpg would warn you ?Heh, you
don?t trust EvilPerson!?: What would improve? The EvilPerson received
already the email, neither you or I could do anything about that.

The OpenPGPKey-DNS-entry for my mail-adress works, if you like to test gpg.

sorry, this is a misunderstanding. I meant: My entry is correct in the
DNS, while Felix? is not. I have no such recent version of gpg to test
if it is working there.

AFAIK the card doesn?t support 4096 bit keys. The webpage given by you

?Key lengths reducable to 1024 bit; key length of signature keys

while it is off-topic: The In-Reply-to and References-header are not the
same. The in-reply-to-header tells you, for which message a message is a
direct reply. The reference-header tells to which emails the mail
belongs. Now-adays the reference-header are not very useful anymore, but
in the old-times it could happen that a reply reached a third party
before the original message reached the third.
Example: You have 3 emails.
Starter: Message-ID: A
Answer: Message-ID: B, In-reply-to: A, References: A
Answer-Answer: Message-ID: C, In-reply: B, References: An, B
If the answer-answer (C) reaches you before the answer (B), your
email-program still knows that it somehow belongs to the starter-eMail
(A). When the answer (B) reaches you, your eMail-programm can sort it in
the right position, using the in-reply-to-field.
P.S: I learned it the hard way that people that use the reply-button for
new emails that not so bad like the smartphone-guys that write an new
email for an reply.

there was an issue and it is fixed already?
