@_subject: Patch for using GPG on 64 bit Matching 
Hi fellow gnupg-users,
I am new to gpg arena though I have used PGP in the past.
We have 64-bit servers and I was wondering if there is a Patch to apply to
gpg so it could run successfully on 64 bit.
Please let me know.
Currently, my command line scripts does not run when automated but I can
run them manually.
Please help.

Hi David,
OS is: Windows 2008 R2 Enterprise (64-bit). We are running Gpg4win version
2.1.0 (2011-03-15)  which contains GnuPG 2.0.17.

I agreed with you David, these are very similar issues. I am exploring the
possibility of using Rational robot to run the script.
