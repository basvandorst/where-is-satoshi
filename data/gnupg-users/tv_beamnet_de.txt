@_subject: gpg --edit-key when the key has many signatures 
sometimes when editing a key (in order to sign a specific uid associated
with the key) it takes quite a while until the command prompt shows. It
seems to be related to the number of signatures on the key and occurs
also when only the key to be signed and the signing key are in the
public keyring.
Is there a way to speed this up? I've tried the various --no-XXX and
--skip-... switches, but didn't find anything that matches.
Kind regards and TIA
P.S.: I'd appreciate being CC'ed in replys.

3 Minutes 5 Seconds
A total of 3300 signatures on 16 uids.
(That's on a notebook with Pentium M 1.5 with Debian.)

No, they're 16 uids in the list and 8 on edit, as one might expect from
these figures, all uid's are there twice.
list keys is fast, check sigs is fast.
Yeah, thanks, it looks like it's got something to do with the uids, right?
Kind regards

I use (don't ask me why) pgp.earth.li.
Are there keyservers that don't / tend less to send duplicate uids?
Is there a way to get gnupg to repair keys non-interactively?
Kind regards

OK, at Marcus suggestion I tried subkeys.pgp.net and didn't have any
problems with that.
Thanks so much for tracking down the problem,
kind regards

@_subject: GnuPG 1.2 encryption key selection with authentication keys 
I've added a triple of subkeys on the OpenPGP card to my key, including an authentication subkey. It seems that GnuPG 1.2 prefers this key for encryption (and with gpg 1.2 I see encryption and signing as capabilities), because I generated it last.
Is there a way to make GnuPG 1.2 prefer the actual encryption key by Kind regards and thanks in advance

Thanks, David, for the quick answer.
Unfortunately, my own upgrading won't fix the bug on the side of the encryptor
whose preference to use old versions of GnuPG I'm not having much hope of
influincing. Is there anything (short of revoking it) I can do to make the
authentication less attractive to (the broken versions) of GnuPG?
I considered manipulating the encryption key's binding signature to have a
newer date, but my guess is that while this would work locally, I'd probably
run into trouble with the keyservers.
Kind regards
