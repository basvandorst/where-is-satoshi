@_subject: Loss of data during encryption 
Hello everyone,
To begin, please excuse my English wich is not as good anymore as it was.
I come to you because I have a problem with GPG. I have for habit to
encrypt the files I don't use regulary. But recently I needed one of these
encrypted files. So I decrypted it and realized that the file didn't
contained all the documents it should.
These lost documents while encryptin / decrypting have never been found
Have you ever had this kind of problem ? and if yes how can I fix it ?
Thank you in advance for your replies.
