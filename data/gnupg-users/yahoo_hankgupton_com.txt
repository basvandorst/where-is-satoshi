Even better than that, you can CHANGE the expiration date on the
subkey that has no expiration date to anything like.  You can extend
the date out further or cut it short.  But, this will effect only your
key, and not the copies of your key that everyone else has.  It might
be better to revoke your old subkey and spread the revokation far and
wide.  And then, as you say, make a new subkey.
