@_subject: GPG is not working because of log-file configuration 
Hello, I'm a user of GPG and I got some problem.
Recently my machine showing this message when do something in GPG:
[sample at localhost ~]$ gpg
gpg: /home/sample/.gnupg/gpg.conf:5: invalid option
[sample at localhost ~]$ cat -n ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
     1	
     2	 GPGConf ---+++
     3	utf8-strings
     4	debug-level basic
     5	log-file socket:///home/sample/.gnupg/log-socket
     6	 GPGConf ---+++ 2018? 02? 22? (?)      7	# GPGConf edited this configuration file.
     8	# It will disable options before this marked block, but it will
     9	# never change anything below these lines.
I think Kleopatra or another GPG frontend misconfigured my gpg.conf. How do I fix it myself?

Sorry for another thread with same contents. My email client had some problem.

@_subject: Is there an easy way to create an Android application? 
If you just need Android front-end for GPG, please consider using OpenKeychain. But if you want to create an application, you should learn how to make application and take a look at some PGP library.

I don't think this error is because of that because error message says gpg.conf.
