Nothing's wrong with it unless you want to sign and/or encrypt mails
with attachments. I'd like to sometimes, but then mailcrypt doesn't
support it. And we're beyond the times of uuencode. Right now, the best
thing is to have a mailer that can handle both, ascii armor and
RFC2015. For the future, it'd be great to have just one sufficiently
general standard that all/most mailers can handle. Cheers, Nils

@_subject: ADK discussion and GnuPG 
Hi all,
the german online news from Heise Verlag has an article on the PGP/ADK
vulnerability. In there, they claim that PGP >= v.5 and GnuPG are
affected, only PGP 2.6.x to be secure. This has provoked an intense
discussion on their bulletin board. I think they're wrong ... :-)
What happened?
They refer to  where Ralf
explains why in his view ADKs are a bad idea. He explains, how ADKs work
in V4 key certificates (which are used by new PGPs and GnuPG).
Then they have taken the following paragraph from Ralf's page:
 How to Avoid Version-4-Signatures
 But how can you be sure if you have got someone else's public key with
 a Version-4-self-signature?
 Since DH-keys all have Version-4-self-signatures, you should avoid to
 use those for encryption. But detecting V4-RSA-keys is sometimes
 difficult. Using PGP553i for Windows V4-RSA-keys do present themselves
 as V3-RSA-keys with key-IDs and fingerprints computed in
 Version-3-style. Upgrading to PGP651i for Windows shows the same key
 with a new V4-style key-ID and with a different new fingerprint but
 truncated to the first 16 bytes, so that it looks like a V3-style
 fingerprint, which it clearly is not. So if you see 16 byte
 fingerprints you cannot be sure that the key does not have a
 Version-4-self-signature. To be sure you have to go into byte analysis
 of the key packets. Using GnuPG make things worse because all
 V4-signatures I have created on RSA-keys were made using this program.
neglects the fact that GnuPG *ignores* the ADK part.
The only problem is (which Ralf might be aiming at), that a GnuPG user
"Bob" might think "I'm not affected, nothing can happen to me, 'cause
I'm using GnuPG". What in fact could happen is that Bob's generated V4
certificate is being extended by an ADK from the malicious
"Mallory". Mallory fools PGP-user "Alice" into believing that the
extended Bob-certificate is genuine. Alice includes this key into her
keyring and uses it to encrypt messages to Bob. If Mallory intercepts
these messages, he can read them.
BUT: this all depends on PGP using ADKs in the first place and not
checking whether the ADK is signed (that's what the current fuzz is
about). So it's a problem of Alice using a vulnerable version of PGP.
So, GnuPG is not "affected"!
Does anyone disagree with this explanation?

I think we all understand the issue by now. We all know what Ralf
S. intended to say. What I was criticising was that in his "report" he
was recommending against the use of GnuPG in a way that people might
think it was broken and needed a fix, just like PGP. That's just not the
case. What he didn't do was distinguishing between the fact was PGP was
flawed and shouldn't be used before it was fixed, but GnuPG's only
"flaw" was that it could be used to communicate with a flawed PGP (and
thereby the communcation from PGP to GnuPG could be endangered). This
should have been clearly stated as a different issue.

I do not think that he suffers misunderstandings. I think he knows the
subject very well. It appears to me more that his rage against ADKs is
so, well, "strong" that he'd like people to take extreme measures. Using
software that only uses v3 signatures is such an extreme measure. It
might well be the case that all this confusion about the vulnerability
of GnuPG was kind of deliberate, in order to serve the goal. That's what
I'm opposing. Raising the issue was right, but he did a lot damage as well.
To most people, telling possible PGP users to update their versions,
being cautious when PGP warns about the use of an ADK, or even convince
them to use GnuPG is a not-so-extreme and perfectly acceptable measure.
The warning against GnuPG raised a lot of confusion because a lot of
people didn't know which part of the warning was based on technical
grounds and which on personal opinion.

I think, the act of signing (whether email or anything else) is roughly
what I wrote above. The fact that you'd like people to get in touch with

that's just your personal addition (which may be sensible, but is

That's for sure. Encrypting only the important stuff is not a good idea.
But my point was not to say you shouldn't sign/encrypt all
mails. Whether or not doing that is a personal preference. What I am
opposing is *automatically* signing (i.e. without entering a passphrase)
all mails, as some people seem to do. That is about the same as having a
pile of blank stationary paper only with a signature, and using this
paper to write each letter. The signature becomes almost
meaningless. IIRC, the legal implication of "signing" is that someone
had to take his time and, while being fully aware of the consequences,
"signed" a document to tell others it's genuine. If this deliberate act
is missing (because it's being done automatically) - what does a signed
mail tell you? That someone used the account of John Doe's computer to
write a mail with his mail client who automatically signs all mails as
John Doe. And that almost meaningless ... ;-)

t> gnu emacs and mailcrypt.el.
That's what I'm using right now, however there are some
shortcomings. The big issue is which standard to use and only after
that, which mailreader to use.
In general, there are three popular options for encrypted mail:
- PGP Ascii armor (used by Emacs/Mailcrypt and lot's of other
  mailers. This is the "old" standard. No MIME support whatsoever, just
  plain text.)
- PGP/MIME and OpenPGP [RFC 2015 and 2440] (This is what Mutt, Pine,
  Emacs/Mew a.s.o. use. It's MIME multipart/encrypted. From "our"(i.e. gpg)
  point of view, this would in theory be the best to use.
However, there is also:
- S/MIME: also RSA based encrypted-MIME mail format defined by an
  industry consortium. Slightly different design choices from PGP/MIME
  and not compatible. (implemented by Netscape, MS Outlook and others)
Now the bad news:
- S/MIME and OpenPGP are being developed independently and can, so far,
not interact with each other. It would be by far more preferable to have
just one standard. The Internet Mail Consortium is aware of this
problem, a discussion is here: There are rumours that they might be merged. That'd be good news. But
then you need mail clients to support this.
- If we leave S/MIME aside, you've still got to decide whether to use
Ascii armor or PGP/MIME. I found (so far) no Unix-based mailreader that
can handle both (but there might be some, who knows. Maybe pine). It
really depends on the person you're mailing with which format to use.
So coming back to the question which mailreader to chose: you have to
take into account
- Do you need MIME?
- What format are the people using you're communicating with?
Personally, I stick with mailcrypt as I found most people in my reach
are still using Ascii armor. However, it has several bugs/misfeatures
(especially when using it with a non-7bit Ascii character set), but I
don't see an alternative. If someone writes a good Emacs mail client
that can handle both formats, or even better, adds this functionality to
an existing mail client like VM or GNUS, I'm sure he'll get his merits :-)

in Aug 99 Larry Lidz asked in whether in was safe to use /dev/random from the Solaris Easy Access
Server 3.0 together with gnupg. Werner's answer in that thread was that
is is not possible to discuss the safety without examining the code.

@_subject: Open issues 
there seem to be some problems which are known but are not
addressed. Example: I found, for a particular key (generated by pgp 6.x),
which I imported into my gnupg 1.0.1 keyring and signed (all uids), that
gnupg --list-keys --with-colons showed the 'q' value for one of its
uids. This should not happened as the key was signed by myself. The
trouble with it is an error message when trying to encrypt sth. using
this key: "couldn't find a valid trust path ..." I found no way to
assign full trust to this uid.
Now, this seems to be a bug, and I found at least two mails to the
gnupg-users list concerning this very issue in the last
months. However, no one replied to it.
Another one: I had repeatedly problems (all this on Solaris 2.6) with the
trustdb, as gnupg --export-ownertrust was hanging indefinitely. I had to
remove the trustdb an let it be reconstructed. I remember several mails
on gnupg-users concerning problems with the trustdb.
But none of this is being discussed nor does it show up in the bugs
file ... :-(
I still got one: say, if you revoke a subkey and add a new one, your key
contains a revoked one and a valid one. Now, if you encrypt using this
key, specifying the name of the primary key, you would assume that gnupg
selects the valid subkey. It doesn't. Instead, it selects (the first in
time order?) revoked one and complains about the invalidity. I would
call this a mis-feature or bug. Workaround: specify the keyid of the
valid one.
I don't send this to gnupg-bugs as most of this was already on this list
and should be known. But what to do about it?

I'm not quite sure I understand what you're asking. The security of your
key depends (among other things) on the degree of unpredictability
(=entropy) of some data used to generate that key. Unpredictable here
means that after key generation, an attacker should not be able to make
assumptions on the state of your machine at the time so as not to being
able predict the data fed into EGD, which in turn was used for key
generation. My personal opinion is that for most peoples uses a busy
server has more than enough entropy for key generation. If you're really
concerned that your machine doesn't have enough going on for this, I'd
recommend a big compilation task (mozilla, XFree, maybe with parallel
make) to get some activity.

IIRC, the problem with PGP2 is that gpg has to know the length of the
input in order to encrypt it in a way that PGP can handle it. If you pipe
it to gpg, then you don't have that info. The resulting file format can
then not be read by PGP2 (I think it's called "partial length headers").
IIRC, PGP6x can read partial length headers. If you can fix your problem
by changing LF to CR/LF, then I'd assume that your problem is different
to the one described in the above FAQ question.
Werner, what's your take on this?

IIRC, the problem with PGP2 is that gpg has to know the length of the
input in order to encrypt it in a way that PGP can handle it. If you pipe
it to gpg, then you don't have that info. The resulting file format can
then not be read by PGP2 (I think it's called "partial length headers").
IIRC, PGP6x can read partial length headers. If you can fix your problem
by changing LF to CR/LF, then I'd assume that your problem is different
to the one described in the above FAQ question.
Werner, what's your take on this?

 WK>  The current state of PGP/GnuPG support for Mozilla is being

with a yet unreleased NAI PGP-plugin. This patch might also work with
GnuPG. However, the patch will not go into the trunk and Mozilla staff
has delayed further work on it until after Mozilla 1.0 release (which is
scheduled by end of 2001) for various reasons. The main one is that they
have just too much work and other priorities for 1.0. They say that
eventually there will be PGP support but not now. Another reason given
is that PGP/GnuPG support will require architectural changes that the
current patch lacks. I've had a brief look at Bernd Rausch's work and
would expect his patch to be dismissed by Mozilla staff for the same
reason. They seem to aim for a generic solution for Mail/News

Hi all,
 >> Is there any way to change the "dotted" id?
 WB> Take a look at the archiv. Which is a bit difficult since it doesn't have a search engine
anymore. :-(
 WB> What about adding this point to the FAQ?
Certainly. My problem is that I don't have the time to follow all
discussions in detail and then compile FAQ entries from them. (And not
every question being asked actually belongs to the FAQ.) I usually have
been waiting until threads came to some agreement before compiling an
entry, but this point is occasionally difficult to judge beforehand. And
later on, it's easily being forgotten ;-)
Example: When this Mac OS X thread came up, one of the first replies was
along the lines "That's well known. Mac OS X's sed is broken, get a new
one." Even when I couldn't remember having seen this question before,
it's a good candidate for the FAQ, although I would prefer something
like this to be in the INSTALL file/release notes (which is true for
quite some FAQ entries). So I included it, as the poster seemed
confident (I have no way to verify his answer). But then, a lengthy
thread developed whose bottom line is not quite clear to me. Something
like "Mac OS X's default shell is zsh, which has by default a CDPATH
that causes trouble. As Werner refuses to change the autoconf stuff to
take this into account (which would be possible), you have to unset
CDPATH before compiling GnuPG."
Now, this might be more accurate, but how can I know without someone
with Mac OS X access confirms it? Anyway, I'll remove the "wrong" entry
until that happens. This does only show that I shouldn't be too quick to
add entries.
To sum up: you shouldn't rely on me scanning all messages and compile
verified FAQ entries from them. I have to rely on your help. If you are
confident that you have the correct answer to a frequent problem, please
send it to me. If you have corrections, please do so as well.

Excellent. I've received a submission for a FAQ entry that involves a
workaround I have yet to test. But having "native support" is clearly
the better way so I'll just wait until your code shows up on CVS.

As the time of that writing, it was already corrected in the CVS. Since
then, there has not been a new release. I thought there would have been
one quite soon - hence the wording.

The fix in the mailing list archive is trivial and the same that was
incorporated into the CVS. Unfortunately, with gnupg 1.0.4 you'll either
have to patch it or live with this message :-(
Alternatively, you could use a development release, with is just a CVS
snapshot at some (probably) stable point. The latest is But then, your manager type might not like the warning "Don't use this
on a production system". This is issued by default by all non-official

Hash: SHA1
Hi Ralf and Lionel,
thanks for writing this FAQ entry. Your help is very much
appreciated. If there are no further suggestions I will include them
into the FAQ. However, I'm a bit hesitant to include information that
refers to the current gpg version but is likely to change in the
future. These kind of questions have to be revised every time we have a
new release and - as things are - might be forgotten at some point. The
result would be an outdated/incorrect FAQ entry.
Do you think it is necessary to describe the actual gpg 1.0.4
preferences and to include the code? Wouldn't it suffice to generally
desribe the concept and mention possibility to change the default by
altering the source? I'd say, the latter is enough, but if you object
then I'll include the full entry.
Regards, Nils

FW> GnuPG is *not*
 FW> vulnerable to the described attack if you use RSA keys.  At the
 FW> moment, I'm not sure if the attack works against DSA keys; GnuPG
I don't quite understand your point. The document describes attacks
against RSA signature keys in format v3 and v4 and DSA signature keys
v4. The last one is being used in GnuPG by default, RSA v3 keys could be
imported from PGP. The attack was performed using PGP 7.0.3 and seems to
work because of insufficient integrity checking - PGP did not notice
that the private key was tampered with.
However, the authors describe simple integrity checks that can prevent
this attack. OpenPGP does not specify any of them, so the standard might
have to be revised. PGP 7.0.3 does some, but apparently not
enough. After having had a brief look at the GnuPG source, it seems to
me that GnuPG does some basic integrity checking. More detailed
inspection will show whether or not it's enough, and therefore, whether
GnuPG is vulnerable at all. I expect Werner will do this after he has
To sum it all up (at least, from my view ;-):
1. So far, it is unclear whether GnuPG is affected at all.
   We'll know in a few days.
2. An attack would probably be noticed.
   The attack requires the modification of the private key ring and the
   subsequent capture of a signed message. It may then lead to to
   compromise of the signature key. The attack will not go unnoticed
   because signatures with the modified key won't verify.
3. You have to protect your private key anyway. Then you're safe from
   this.    It is crucial to the security of an public key cryptosystem that you
   guard your secret key. If you prevent the attacker from accessing
   your private key, this attack won't work. However: as stated in other
   mails, if the attacker has access to your system in order to modify
   your key, has has other, possibly simpler ways of comprimising your key.
Therefore, the attack, if possible on GnuPG at all, has minor
impact. You do guard your private key, right? :-) I perfectly know that
people are using GnuPG on multiuser systems where they can't really
protect their private key. That's ok, but they have to know that they're
risking a compromise anyway, regardless of this attack.
So, the bottom line is that on a multiuser system, the use of GnuPG/PGP
has already not been very secure (and probably will never be). This
attack has made it even a little bit less secure, but didn't change the
situation fundamentally.
I expect for the future that OpenPGP implementations will improve their
integrity checks for key data (and maybe even change the packet format)
to prevent attacks like this one.
Besides, it would have been nice of the authors if they had contacted
OpenPGP developers ahead of time - and not making a press conference
right at the start of CeBIT, only to present details of their attack a
few days later.
Cheers, Nils
