@_subject: GPGOL - Error registering DLL 
I'm trying to install GPGOL for use with Outlook 2003 on Windows XP
SP2. I've followed the instructions and am attempting to register the
gpgol.dll file - getting the error message
GetLastError returns 0x0000007e
There's probably a few "non-standard" components here, but nothing I
can see that would cause a problem.
I've downloaded the zip from the ftp site and put the other DLLs in
the system directory.
Any ideas?

I sent this message previously, but there was no sign of a delivery.
Apologies if this is a duplicate...
