@_subject: gpgv vs. gpg --verify 
Hash: SHA1
Hello all,
after I tried a while to see the difference between gpgv and "gpg --verify", I googled about an hour to recognize that these commands use two different keyfiles (gpgv -> ~/.gnupg/trustedkeys.gpg ; "gpg --verify" -> ~/.gnupg/
Can anybody explain me why this is so?
My initial problem was that I didn't know how to add keys to the trustedkeys.gpg? Can anybody tell me how this works?
Regards Michael
