Hi all,
I just started using gpg and was looking around for an emacs mode to

references to crypt++, but they are all stale web sites and messages
from years ago.  I finally managed to locate something that looked like
the crypt++ web site, which had a notice that development on crypt++ had
ceased and that instead crypt.el from xemacs should be used.  However, I
downloaded the current version of xemacs and found no crypt.el.
Can anyone tell me what's going on with this?  It seems like such an
OBVIOUS thing that I'm really surprised, given that people have written
emacs modes for every conceivable and inconceivable need, it's so hard
to find information.

allow public-key encoding. So far, I've got:
