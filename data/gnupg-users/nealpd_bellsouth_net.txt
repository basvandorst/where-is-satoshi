@_subject: pgp decryption Failed - 2 
We are using gnupg version 1.2.1.  When our customer sends in an  encrypted file we are unable to decrypt it because it keeps getting an  error of "pgp decryption Failed - 2".   The customer can then start  completely over and encrypt the file again, send it through and it  works fine then.  The file always fails on the first couple of tries  though.  They have asked us to research and find out what the "pgp  decryption Failed - 2" error message means and I can find nothing in my  documention to tell me what it is.
