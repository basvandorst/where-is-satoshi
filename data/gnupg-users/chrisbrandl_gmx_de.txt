@_subject: terms and conditions in using encryption with gnupg 
Hello Sirs and Madams,
presently, we are using pgp encryption software form Network Associates. Regarding to a possible migration to another encryption-software, I have
some questions. I hope, you can help me with that.
The most important one:
What are the terms and conditions to use gnupg in business matters? Which is
the best way to get support for our customers?
Thank you in advance for your help.
Best Regards,
Christian Brandl
