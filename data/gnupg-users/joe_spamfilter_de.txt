@_subject: Is a .gnupg directory /w write access mandatory? 
Hello all,
I am trying to use gnupg in a boot script for a high-security boot process. It only has to decrypt an ascii-armored symmetric ciphertext but at the moment it fails miserably because gnupg seems to ultimately demand write access to some .gnupg directory even if it is not needed for the task at all!
At that point in the boot process there is no writable file system whatsoever because we still need to decrypt those keys for the file systems to mount! Talk about tail biting...
I'd rather not mount a RAM-disk just for the purpose of getting around this, so is there some - maybe undocumented - way to make gnupg just decrypt my file and skip the ".gnupg" issue?
Thanks in advance,
