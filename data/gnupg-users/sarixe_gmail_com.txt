@_subject: GPA on a USB flash drive? 
Hey all,
I was wondering if it was possible to configure GPA to run solely from a
USB drive.  Is it possible to have a gpa.conf on the USB so that it
doesn't require it in Application Data?  Thanks.

No, I mean GPA.  I already have successfully installed GPG on my USB
device.  It's GPA (GNU Privacy Assistant).  Actually, It doesn't need to
be GPA, I'm just looking for a portable frontend to GPG that I can
install on the USB device and use on multiple computers.  One of these
computers has the users configured in such a way that the privileges are
very limited, thus I can't have anything with a registry value, etc.
Any suggestions?

... I have no idea how this happened, but now, on each new computer I
use, WinPT is asking me where GPG is.  It seems that the registry
settings just remember where gpg is, and the program just asks if it
doesn't see anything.  this isn't a problem, as i am able to use it
after setting it up.  In effect, my goal is accomplished, just a little
annoying to get started.
