This is not strictly a GnuPG question,
however I believe you might shed light on it.
The message that follows can be decrypted by GnuPG (v1.2.2),
but PGP v8.0.3 says "error decompressing data":
The file has been symmetrically encrypted with passphrase "a", CAST algorithm and ZIP compression (RFC1951),
normally supported by both GnuPG and PGP.
It has something to do with the last part of the compressed
packet, the rest of the data is correctly decrypted by PGP.
Any guess appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Never mind, I realized that garbage data
was added to the compressed data, before
encryption. Glad to see that GPG behaves
better than PGP in this occasion.
