Hi Jacob,
Yes, definitely.
No, subkeys are not necessary.
You have to add another user-id:
- edit the key ("gpg --edit YOUR_KEY_ID" e.g. "gpg --edit 0x19DC86D3"
  for my key)
- add a user-id ("adduid")
- enter the necessary information
- save changes ("save")
Of course, this is only possible for your own keys (you'll need the
secret key).

I don't know about the original poster, but sometimes I would like to
change the "main id" of keys that I don't own. (I know, no real need
to do that; call it aesthetical reasons :-) The "primary" command
responds with "Need the secret key to do this" when I try that.
I assume that the "main id" has no particular relevance (for the key /

Oh, ok, it's a subpacket, I really should have known / remebered that.

I totally agree with you.
Before I go on further, let me point out that it's really a minor
thing, I was rather curious than being interested in seeing that point
changed in gpg (or changing it myself).
Having said that, I think it wouldn't be necessary to change or add a
subpacket: Since it's only a matter of how I prefer the key data to be
displayed, my preference could as well be stored outside the keyring
in some config-file.

@_subject: Newbie here- how do I use this thing? 
Hi Sean,
While it would theoretically possible to install gpg on the webserver
(only if you have the right access permissions on that server!) and
use it via a script (e.g. modified formmail) to encrypt the data that
has to be mailed to you, that would not give you the kind of security
you probably have in mind. Please take a look at the way, the data has
to take to reach you:
  customer's computer -> webserver -> mailserver -> your computer
Since gpg is running on the webserver, only the second and third part
of the way can be secured with it. There are a few possible solutions:
- The webserver has to communicate securely with the customer, this
  can be done with SSL.
- Then the webserver can use gpg to encrypt the data with your
  (public) key and send it to you.
  Or the data could be stored on the webserver and you use a
  SSL-secured connection to access and retrieve the data (with your
  webbrowser and not via e-mail).
Sorry, I can't give you actual implementation tips. Getting SSL to
work depends on the type of webserver you use (shared hosting
environment / your own server / server of your company?) and other
things. If you use the services / servers of a webhosting firm, it's
probably a shared hosting environment, you should ask your webhoster
how to set up a SSL-secured form. In other cases, the admin of the
webserver should know how to do it.
I never used gpg in a script or on a webserver, so I can't help you
with that either, maybe others on this list can. Also, please take a
look at the gpg-FAQ, point 4.14 (

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding you, but a revocation certificate is
not some kind of root-key and also it (probably) isn't stored on a
smartcard, no need to do that. So, just one card.
The revocation certificate is created using your own, private key (the
same one that is / will be stored on your card). It definitely needs
to be protected and safely stored, because everybody who's got it can
revoke your public key.
But in no case a central issuer is required.

Hm, so you're acting on the assumption that the admin (or any users
with root privileges) can't be trusted and that they will (at least
potentially) abuse their power.
Well, using an USB stick won't help you then. The evil admin could
trivially and automatically copy your secret key exactly in the moment
your calling gpg. And no 10-word diceware passphrase will protect it
in this scenario, because the admin would log that just as well.
I know, I know, it _is_ (somewhat) safer to do it this way. The evil
admin has to jump through a few more hoops to get your key. But in the
end, it's just security by obscurity and might make you feel a lot
safer than it really is. IMHO at least.
So, ever done that USB stick thing? In this case, you should consider
your key "hopelessly compromised" and it "MUST be revoked". *smile*

Absolutely not.
Signing a key (scenario 1) means: "I certify that this key belongs to

sure that the keyholder (in control of the (secret) key that says it
belongs to "Blake") is really "Blake". Usually this involves meeting
with Blake, checking government issued ID, verifing the fingerprint of
the key and making sure that Blake is in control of the E-Mail-Adress
that is associated with the user-id "Blake".

Hello David,
Well, RSA is the asymmetrical cipher that PGP2 uses, IDEA is the
symmetrical one. Doing a "normal" encryption, both are used: RSA for
encrypting the symmetrical IDEA-key (which is used to encrypt the
actual message).
So you can't encrypt a message using RSA only. (Theoretically it's
possible of course, but PGP won't do that - IIRC).
They are right, as long as they are not using a (earlier by others
mentioned) modified Version of PGP.

Yes, as long as your key requires the use of IDEA-encryption,

I don't think that's true: Decryption is (usually) handled by the
encryption subkey and there's absolutely no guarantee that this subkey
is controlled by the same person as the primary/signing key. There may
even be valid reasons to split the two "roles".
Since UIDs are attached to the primary key and the primary key is the
only one that can modify UIDs (and signing a key is all about UIDs)
this system can't prove what it's supposed to prove: The link between
