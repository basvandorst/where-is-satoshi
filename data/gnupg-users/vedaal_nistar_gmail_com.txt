@_subject: compiling GPA to run on windows // do-able? 
downloaded the source code for GPA 0.9.2 and tried to compile it on
didn't quite work  ...
here is what happened:

configure: error: GPA requires zlib ( or install Debian
age zlib1g-dev)
couldn't find zlib on the gzip.org site
is there anywhere else to find zlib?
are there any other dependencies that are also needed before compiling?
is it supposed to be 'not do-able' under windows?
(the compililer *did* give the encouraging message of:
'checking whether build environment is sane... yes'
;-)   )

am trying out thunderbird with enigmail, and a new gmail account, to try
to not 'break threads'
please let me know if it still breaks,

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

that if you believe SHA-1 is insecure
then you need to stop using OpenPGP.
Well, Yes, and No. ;-)
SHA1 is hardwired into the fingerprint of v4 keys.
An open pgp consensus on a v5 key will not happen overnight.
So when is it reasonable enough to suggest that SHA1
is broken enough to start working on a v5 key?

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

If you *ever* signed a message with SHA1 and posted it publicly,
(maybe in the 'olden days' before any vulnerability in SHA1 was known)
then that signature could become a source for a forgery,
 whenever SHA1 becomes broken enough.
(A clever, malicious attacker could backdate the clock,
and have a forgery of something you did in the past,
when you couldn't claim:
"Hey, that's an obvious forgery!
I'm on record as saying I would never use SHA1 to sign anything anymore!")
