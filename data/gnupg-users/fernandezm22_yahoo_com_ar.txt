@_subject: Exporting key with photo ID 
Hi, I have errors exporting my public key to any key server.
For example, when I try to submit it via www, I paste the key (in Ascii)
in the MIT server ( there is a message saying  'Error
decoding keyblock'.
I searched in previous messages, and there was one person having exactly
the same problem (June-2002), and I figured out that is the Photo ID my
key is including. The answer was "try with ldap servers, like
ldap://pgp.surfnet.nl". I tried again with this server, and I got errors
too (I configured my .gnupg to ldap://pgp.surfnet.nl:11370):
[marcelo marcelo]$ gpg --send-keys mfernandez
gpgkeys: error adding key mfernandez to keyserver: Already exists
gpg: keyserver internal error
gpg: keyserver send failed: error del servidor de claves
[marcelo marcelo]$
[marcelo marcelo]$ gpg --search-keys mfernandez
gpgkeys: searching for "mfernandez from LDAP server
gpg: key "mfernandez not found on keyserver
I'm working with Mandrake Linux 9.2 (Spanish config) and Gnupg 1.2.3.

Well, I uploaded my key (with Photo ID) to a SKS server, now MIT,
Blackhole, etc. (older PKS servers) have my key (I can found it when I
search in those servers)... Is this a problem parsing the key when you upload it?
Will I have any problem with those PKS servers from now on? (I don't
think so, but... I have to ask) :D
