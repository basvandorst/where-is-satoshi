@_subject: Need help: gpg: public key decryption failed: Wrong secret key used 
Hello Experts,
We are implementing PGP solution using GnuPG. We have hit one issue, below
is the error,
gpg: public key decryption failed: Wrong secret key used
gpg: decryption failed: No secret key
I'm trying to encrypt sample test message without using armor (--no-armor).
I'm getting above message.
But with armor i don't see this issue with same key pair.
We are having 2.3.3 version of Gpg4Win.
Need this help to go forward.
Already tried following with no luck,
1. Killed gpg-agent & restarted
2. Writing the encrypted content to file. Then tried decryption directly in
Kleopatra tool it works but i get same error as above
