@_subject: Cannot genkey with 1.0.4 
Does anyone know why when I try to generate a new key I get the
following errors:
gpg: keyblock resource `/home/adanen.gnupg': file open error
gpg: can add keyblock file `/home/adanen/.gnupg/pubring.gpg'
Key generation failed: file create error
gpg: can't create `/home/adanen/.gnupg/random_seed': No such file or directory
???  This is with the 1.0.4 Mandrake RPMs.  I know previous versions
used to work and I'm wondering why this doesn't work now?  Obviously
if I create ~/.gnupg first, it'll work, but we never used to have to
do that.
Any ideas on how I could go about fixing this annoyance?  I'm not a
member of this list so please cc any responses to me directly.
Thank you!

I know that will do the trick.  But why in 1.0.2 when I generated my
own first gpg key did gpg make the directory itself and now it no
longer does it?  That's the problem I have... it used to work one way
and now all of a sudden there is an extra step... =(  any ideas on that?
