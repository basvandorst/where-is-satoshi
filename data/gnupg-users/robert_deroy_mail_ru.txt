Good Morning,
I send you this letter because maybe you can help me about somethings,
i know that my english is not perfect at all..
Is it possible to remake an original gpgconf file ?
I don't understand how i could use this commands :
--default-preference-list string
And how could i use this one ? :
--personal-cipher-preferences string
Is it possible to set preferences for the gnupg software globally ? Or maybe it is possible just for a key especially ?
Preferences are recorded inside the keys ? Or in the gnupg software ?
When we generate a new key, preferences of cipher algo or digest algo are impacting the new key ?
I try to set a default user with those commands, but it works not :
--default-recipient --default-recipient-self Is a gnupg portable for linux exist ? Or maybe i should use wine.
A lot of question.. Thank you very much for your work, and your answer.
