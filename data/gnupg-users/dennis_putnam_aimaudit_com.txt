@_subject: user-agent failing with Open Directory mounted home directories 
I am trying to install GnuPG and have a problem with the path for '.gnupg'. The path extracted is incorrect for an OD mounted home. Is there a configuration setting that lets me change the prefix for the '.gnupg' path? Thanks.

I just realized I was not clear about what was going on here. The problem is that the user-agent will not launch since it cannot find '.gnupg'.
