@_subject: revoke an revoked userID and e-mail from the GnuPG-Server 
How can I revoke an revoked userID and e-mail from the GnuPG-Server? How can I solve my problem in any way? I am new at this topic. I created my gpg key with one e-mail address. Later
I decided to add a second e-mail. I recognised that my second e-mail was the
default signature and could not change it.

Hello Laurent,
When I try to add the same user with ( adduid ) it is not possible.
 GPG answer: (Such a user ID already exists on this key!)  But I do not want to change my name or e-mail! What do you mean exactly by "Revoque"???    Revoke of the Revoke?? How? Sorry, I stuck a little bit.
