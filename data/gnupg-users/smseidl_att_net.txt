@_subject: Using a Revocation Certificate (without sending to keyserver) 
I am working a setting up GNUPG on a home server, but have run into an issue.  The original key I have created has expired.  I am trying to revoke that key with the revocation certificate I created when I originally created the key.
I have imported the revocation certificate to the key ring, but am unsure how to invoke/apply the certificate further.  I have found directions to publish this revocation certificate to a KeyServer, but I was not intending on using Can someone please tell me what I need to do to invoke/apply this revocation
