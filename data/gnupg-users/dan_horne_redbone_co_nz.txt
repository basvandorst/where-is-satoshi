@_subject: Verify that the file is from who I expect it to be from 
Hi all
maybe I'm missing something, but how do I verify not only that an encrypted
file is signed, but that it is signed by the party I expect to have signed
it? In other words, if two parties can supply a file with the same name I
want to make sure that when I think I'm dealing with a file from party A,
it is actually signed by party A. At the the moment, when I decrypt the
file, it seems to simply be checking that the signature is valid.

Thanks - I get the line saying "good signature" i n my message, but are you
saying that I have to grep the output for the message and the email address
of the encryptor?

Yes - that's what my OP meant - Verifying the key. But I'm hoping to avoid
greping the output. What I'd love to do is provide the key I want verified
and for GnuPG to confirm e.g. something like the following would be fab:
gpg2 --verify-sign

Thanks. I exported my keys to ~/.gnupg/trustedkeys.gpg. I tried gpgv2 but
got the following
bash-3.2$ gpgv2 declaration.pgp
gpgv: verify signatures failed: Unexpected error
Adding --verbose did not affect this (Note this is a OpenCSW install)
However, if I simply decrypt the file I get confirmation of the signature
bash-3.2$ gpg2  --output declaration.txt  --decrypt declaration.pgp
gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit RSA key, ID C0F7C32A, created 2017-10-26
      ""
gpg: Signature made Mon Oct 30 13:04:26 2017 NZDT using RSA key ID 0A5F3B0F
gpg: Good signature from "" [ultimate]

@_subject: "Insecure memory" (yes setuid set) and "get_passphrase failed" 
Hi. I'm trying to get GnuPG working on Solaris 10
Our Unix administrator installed the CSW package. I'm trying to create my
$ gpg2 --gen-key
However at the time it comes to generate the secret  key I get:
You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.
Warning: using insecure memory!
gpg-agent[10073]: command get_passphrase failed: End of file
gpg: problem with the agent: End of file
gpg: Key generation canceled.
Regarding the warning, the recommended response I found via Internet search
# chmod u+s /path/to/gpg
This was done, but didn't affect the warning:
$ ls -l /opt/csw/bin/gpg2
-r-sr-xr-x  25 root     bin        12252 Jul 25  2016 /opt/csw/bin/gpg2
Regarding the passphrase, I've made sure that pinentry is in my path:
$ which pinentry
Which is a symbolic link to pinentry-curses
$ ls -l /opt/csw/bin/pinentry-curses
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     bin        58004 Jul 11  2011
It still doesn't work
After a bit more Googling, I tried adding the following to my gpg.conf
file, but it caused a syntax error:
pinentry-program /opt/csw/bin/pinentry-curses
Any advice appreciated

@_subject: Using GnuPG when switching users 
I'm using GnuPG 2.0.29 on Solaris. This specific version is being used
because it's the only one we could get installed and working.
I'm trying to generate keys  from a user I have su'd to, but I get the
following error:
gpg-agent[23024]: command get_passphrase failed: Permission denied
gpg: problem with the agent: Permission denied
gpg: Key generation canceled.
I believe that thus occurs because when pinentry-curses is invoked by
gpg-agent, the tty is owned by the original user I logged into via SSH, not
the user I switched to via su.
I've seen various workarounds online, but most are relevant to GNU/Linux,
not Solaris (e.g. run the "script" command with the -c option, which
doesn't exist on Solaris). Others have suggested using the loopback
pinentry-mode, which doesn't seem to exist in version 2.0.29 of gpg-agent ,
as far as I can tell.
Has someone got a workaround? I need to be able to use "su" as we are not
allowed to log into the user directly. I'm also stuck with Solaris and the
specified version of GnuPG

@_subject: Using GnuPG when switching users 
I'd love to have gone to 2.2 but getting GnuPG to work on Solaris is
extremely difficult. We tried compiling from source, but hit several
roadblocks. Looking online, several others have reported the same issues,
but have had no resolution. I messaged this group, but unfortunately, none
of the suggestions worked.
In the end, our admins found an old packaged version of v2 on an open
source for Solaris repository. The workaround was to make the virtual
device terminal of the original user accessible to the su user who was
creating the keys. This is a security hole that we're not happy with, but
it was only temporary as we don't require an interactive passphrase
following key creation.
