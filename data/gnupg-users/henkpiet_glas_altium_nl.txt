Dear All,
I'm using the following config file:
keyserver hkp://subkeys.pgp.net
keyserver-options honor-http-proxy,verbose,auto-key-retrieve
And http_proxy is as follows:
 From the command line I use:
gpg --verify gnupg-1.4.0.tar.bz2.sig
Which returns:
gpg: Signature made 12/16/04 11:50:52  using DSA key ID 57548DCD
gpg: requesting key 57548DCD from hkp://subkeys.pgp.net
gpg: MyUserName: host not found: ec=11001
gpg: can't get key from keyserver: No such file or directory
gpg: Total number processed: 0
gpg: Can't check signature: public key not found
It looks as if 'MyUserName' as embedded in the keyserver URL is wrongfully assumed to be the host. I am currently using version 1.2.5 of gpg. Is this a bug or am I overlooking something?

Wondered if  anyone  would  notice. Got  Werner's  key  and
installed 1.4.0 and  made  sure  to retry  but now have the
following output:
    gpg: Signature (...) Time using DSA key ID 57548DCD
    gpg: requesting key 57548DCD from (...) subkeys.pgp.net
    ?: subkeys.pgp.net: Host not found: ec=11001
    gpgkeys: HKP fetch error: No error
    gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
    gpg: Total number processed: 0
    gpg: Can't check signature: public key not found
The one that puzzles me is:
    ?: subkeys.pgp.net: Host not found: ec=11001
I repeat, http_proxy has been set to:
    Any thoughts? Things I can do to futher trace this?

That first didn't  appear  to work. I was  using  the  same
http_proxy  as  before  (one  that  includes  user name and
password). However when  I used  HTTP_PROXY  with the  same
contents it works. I  used lowercase since gpg.man lists it
as lowercase. Thanks for your help.

Turns out both work. Just tried it (I am using XP). In both
tests  I  made  sure to start with a fresh environment i.e.
neither HTTP_PROXY nor  http_proxy  exists  initially. Only
one is set  before verifying. Werner is right about windows
SET. Doing:
    SET GLAS="aap"
    SET glas="noot"
Results in a single variable:
    GLAS="noot"
Yet in all cases I work from cygwin and after:
    export GLAS="aap"
    export glas="noot"
I have one lower and one upper  case  environment  variable
called glas. When  I  say "both work" I  mean  both exports
work. I am now using http-proxy[=value].
