Noteworthy changes in version 0.3.1 (2002-02-09)
 * There is a Texinfo manual documenting the API.
 * The gpgme_set_keylist_mode function returns an error, and changed
   its meaning.  It is no longer usable to select between normal and
   fast mode (newer versions of GnuPG will always be fast), but
   selects between local keyring, remote keyserver, or both.
   For this, two new macros are defined, GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_LOCAL
   and GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_EXTERN.  To make it possible to modify the
   current setting, a fucntion gpgme_get_keylist_mode was added to
   retrieve the current mode.
 * gpgme_wait accepts a new argument STATUS to return the error status
   of the operation on the context.  Its definition is closer to
   waitpid() now than before.
 * The LENGTH argument to gpgme_data_new_from_filepart changed its
   type from off_t to the unsigned size_t.
 * The R_HD argument to the GpgmePassphraseCb type changed its type
   from void* to void**.
 * New interface gpgme_op_trustlist_end() to match
   gpgme_op_keylist_end().
 * The CryptPlug modules have been renamed to gpgme-openpgp and
   gpgme-smime, and they are installed in pkglibdir by `make install'.
 * An idle function can be registered with gpgme_register_idle().
 * The GpgSM backend supports key generation with gpgme_op_genkey().
 * Interface changes relative to the 0.3.0 release:
gpgme_data_new_from_filepart    CHANGED: Type of LENGTH is size_t.
GpgmePassphraseCb               CHANGED: Type of R_HD is void **.
gpgme_wait                      CHANGED: New argument STATUS.
gpgme_set_keylist_mode          CHANGED: Type of return value is GpgmeError.
                                The function has a new meaning!

@_subject: GPGME and Debian 
You need -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64.  I past the relevant section of the
manual below.
This is a FQ, we probably should have a FAQ.
Largefile Support (LFS)
GPGME is compiled with largefile support by default, if it is available
on the system.  This means that GPGME supports files larger than two
gigabyte in size, if the underlying operating system can.  On some
systems, largefile support is already the default.  On such systems,
nothing special is required.  However, some systems provide only
support for files up to two gigabyte in size by default.  Support for
larger file sizes has to be specifically enabled.
   To make a difficult situation even more complex, such systems provide
two different types of largefile support.  You can either get all
relevant functions replaced with alternatives that are largefile
capable, or you can get new functions and data types for largefile
support added.  Those new functions have the same name as their
smallfile counterparts, but with a suffix of 64.
   An example: The data type `off_t' is 32 bit wide on GNU/Linux PC
systems.  To address offsets in large files, you can either enable
largefile support add-on.  Then a new data type `off64_t' is provided,
which is 64 bit wide.  Or you can replace the existing `off_t' data
type with its 64 bit wide counterpart.  All occurences of `off_t' are
then automagically replaced.
   As if matters were not complex enough, there are also two different
types of file descriptors in such systems.  This is important because
if file descriptors are exchanged between programs that use a different
maximum file size, certain errors must be produced on some file
descriptors to prevent subtle overflow bugs from occuring.
   As you can see, supporting two different maximum file sizes at the
same time is not at all an easy task.  However, the maximum file size
does matter for GPGME, because some data types it uses in its
interfaces are affected by that.  For example, the `off_t' data type is
used in the `gpgme_data_seek' function, to match its POSIX counterpart.
This affects the call-frame of the function, and thus the ABI of the
library.  Furthermore, file descriptors can be exchanged between GPGME
and the application.
   For you as the user of the library, this means that your program must
be compiled in the same file size mode as the library.  Luckily, there
is absolutely no valid reason for new programs to not enable largefile
support by default and just use that.  The compatibility modes (small
file sizes or dual mode) can be considered an historic artefact, only
useful to allow for a transitional period.
   GPGME is compiled using largefile support by default.  This means
that your application must do the same, at least as far as it is
relevant for using the `gpgme.h' header file.  All types in this header
files refer to their largefile counterparts, if they are different from
any default types on the system.
   You can enable largefile support, if it is different from the default
on the system the application is compiled on, by using the Autoconf
macro `AC_SYS_LARGEFILE'.  If you do this, then you don't need to worry
about anything else: It will just work.  In this case you might also
want to use `AC_FUNC_FSEEKO' to take advantage of some new interfaces,
and `AC_TYPE_OFF_T' (just in case).
   If you do not use Autoconf, you can define the preprocessor symbol
`_FILE_OFFSET_BITS' to 64 _before_ including any header files, for
example by specifying the option `-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64' on the
compiler command line.  You will also want to define the preprocessor
symbol `LARGEFILE_SOURCE' to 1 in this case, to take advantage of some
new interfaces.
   If you do not want to do either of the above, you probably know
enough about the issue to invent your own solution.  Just keep in mind
that the GPGME header file expects that largefile support is enabled,
if it is available.  In particular, we do not support dual mode

At Mon, 11 Apr 2005 23:10:00 +0200,
I wouldn't think so.  The config scripts are traditionally just for
the compiler and linker arguments to find the header files and the
libraries whereever they are installed.  It's a no-brainer.
Setting the file offset bits to 64 is a deeply penetrating decision
that must be done consciously by the developer, and needs to be
coordinated with the other libraries used and the application code.
It has global, far-reaching effects.
Werner forwarded me your suggestion on gnupg-user from a while ago.
It is easy to add, and I think I can do it soon.  The information is
already provided by gnupg, we just need to store it in the result
np.  Note that such issues are all more appropriately for gnupg-devel,
which I am following (I don't follow gnupg-users, sorry).

Noteworthy changes in version 1.1.0 (2005-10-01)
 * You can now configure the backend engine file name and home
   directory to be used, as default and per context.
 * Information about the recipients of an encrypted text is now
   available at decryption time.
 * New status GPGME_STATUS_PLAINTEXT.  This is analyzed by the decrypt
   and verify handlers, the information about the plaintext filename,
   if available is made available in the new field file_name of the
   respective result structure.
 * The code for "automagically detecting the thread library" has been
   removed from libgpgme.  It is deprecated since version 0.4.3.
   Since then, you had to link against libgpgme-pthread for
   applications using pthread and libgpgme-pth for applications using
   GNU Pth.
   The code was removed because it caused compilation problems on
   systems where the pthread.h header from GNU Pth is available in
   addition to the system header (FreeBSD 6 and later for example).
 * "./autogen.sh --build-w32" does now build gpgme.dll.
 * [W32] The environment variable GPGME_DEBUG now uses a semicolon as
   delimiter.  The standard install directory is used when locating
   gpg or gpgsm before finally falling back to the hardwired name.
 * There is a new flag for keys and subkeys, is_qualified, which
   indicates if a key can be used for qualified signatures according
   to local government regulations.
 * You can associate a filename with a data object using the new
   function gpgme_data_set_file_name().  This filename will be stored
   in the output when encrypting or signing the data and will be
   returned when decrypting or verifying the output data.
 * You can now set notation data at signature creation with the new
   function gpgme_sig_notation_add().

Noteworthy changes in version 1.2 (2006-03-03)
 * New function gpg_err_init, which binds the locale directory to
   the text domain.  This function is a constructor on GCC targets,
   so it does not need to be called explicitely.  The header file
   defines GPG_ERR_INITIALIZED in this case.  This is experimental for
   now.
 * "./autogen.sh --build-w32" does now also build a DLL for W32.
   Translations are not yet provided for this platform.
 * New error codes GPG_ERR_UNKNOWN_EXTN and GPG_ERR_UNKNOWN_CRIT_EXTN.
 * New error code GPG_ERR_LOCKED.
 * New translations included for France, Romania, and Vietnamese.
 * Interface changes relative to the 1.1 release:

@_subject: [Announce] Scute 1.0 released 
g10 Code GmbH is pleased to announce the availability of the new
software package Scute.
Scute is a PKCS  implementation for the OpenPGP card using the
GnuPG 2.0 framework.  It allows you to use your OpenPGP card for
client authentication in Mozilla-based web browsers.
Scute is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License
(GPL).  Scute works best on GNU/Linux or *BSD systems.  Other POSIX
compliant systems are also supported but have not yet been tested very
Getting the Software
Please follow the instructions found at or read on:
Scute may be downloaded from one of the GnuPG mirror sites or directly
from ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/ .  The list of mirrors can be found
at  .
On the mirrors you should find the following files in the *scute*
  scute-1.0.0.tar.bz2
  scute-1.0.0.tar.bz2.sig
      Scute source compressed using BZIP2 and OpenPGP signature.
Please try another mirror if exceptional your mirror is not yet up to
date.  Scute requires a couple of libraries to be installed; see the
README file for details.
Checking the Integrity
In order to check that the version of Scute which you are going to
install is an original and unmodified one, simply check the supplied
signature.  For example to check the signature of the file
scute-1.0.0.tar.bz2 you would use this command:
  gpg --verify scute-1.0.0.tar.bz2.sig
This checks whether the signature file matches the source file.
You should see a message indicating that the signature is good and
made by that signing key.  Make sure that you have the right key,
either by checking the fingerprint of that key with other sources
or by checking that the key has been signed by a trustworthy other
key.  Note, that you can retrieve the signing key using the command
  finger wk ,at' g10code.com
or using a key server like
  gpg --recv-key 1CE0C630
The distribution key 1CE0C630 is signed by the well known key
5B0358A2.  If you get an key expired message, you should retrieve a
fresh copy as the expiration date might have been prolonged.
NEVER USE A GNUPG VERSION YOU JUST DOWNLOADED TO CHECK THE
INTEGRITY OF THE SOURCE - USE AN EXISTING GNUPG INSTALLATION!
Documentation is currently only available in the file README.  More
detailed instructions will be part of the next version and become
available on the web page in the next two weeks.
Improving Scute is costly, but you can help!  We are looking for
organizations that find Scute useful and wish to contribute back.  You
can contribute by reporting bugs, improve the software, or by donating
Commercial support contracts for Scute are available, and they help
finance continued maintenance.  g10 Code GmbH, a Duesseldorf based
company owned and headed by GnuPG's principal author, is currently
funding Scute development.  We are always looking for interesting
development projects.
Happy Hacking,
  The Scute Team (Werner and Marcus)

 * The encoding of gpgme_data_t objects can affect the output encoding
   of export, sign and encrypt operations now (the same operations
   that are also affected by the ASCII mode switch).  We believe this
   change in the ABI is innocent enough not to break existing
   applications (it only affects the S/MIME backend on certain
   operations).

   UI Server protocol".

   cancel any pending operation at any time, from any thread.

@_subject: [Announce] libassuan 2.0.0 released 
libassuan 2.0.0 is a new branch of libassuan development.  It provides a
shared library which is a dependency of of the upcoming versions of GPGME,
GnupG 2.1.x and others.  Note that this version of libassuan is incompatible
with previous versions of libassuan, and can not be installed side-by-side
with libassuan 1.0.x.

Because this is the first version of libassuan providing a shared library, a
lot of effort was spent into making the API/ABI of libassuan extensible and
future-proof.  Please see below, the file NEWS and the file
doc/README.apichanges for details.
Noteworthy changes in version 2.0.0 (2009-01-08)
 * Now using libtool and builds a DSO.
 * Lots of interface cleanups.  See below for details of the most
   important changes.  Here is a quick note on how to upgrade:
   For each invocation of the connect or server functions, allocate a
   context with assuan_new and use that.  Instead of assuan_disconnect
   or assuan_deinit_server, call assuan_release.  Use
   assuan_set_gpg_err_source instead of assuan_set_assuan_err_source.
   If you use assuan_pipe_connect with NAME of NULL, you have to
   provide a non-NULL ARGV argument and check that against "server" or
   "client" to determine which end you got after fork().  If you use
   the assuan sock interface, you must call assuan_sock_init after
   setting global context defaults.  Add a NULL as the last arg to
   assuan_register_command.
 * Pth support has changed.  This now follows the same style as
   libgcrypt by setting system hook callbacks.
 * Interface changes relative to the 1.0.5 release:
_ASSUAN_ONLY_GPG_ERRORS        REMOVED

@_subject: STEED - Usable end-to-end encryption 
Hi Peter,
thanks for your feedback.
You are right that it is a challenge to get the support in the providers, but
note that changes in the mail client are required anyway.  Sure, changing the
client and changing the DNS infrastructure are two different kind of beasts,
but we probably can not do without the providers completely if we want
ubiquitous support.
Yes, P2P networks are great, let's do more of those.  But why stop at
certificates?  Just use a P2P network for all of DNS.
See what happened?  I just turned it around. :)
The paper notes how we can utilize DNSSEC to strengthen our trust model.
Similarly, we can utilize a P2P based DNS system.  Now instead of one problem,
we got two :)
P2P systems are tricky to get right, and have their own tradeoffs.  Also,
while acceptance for our proposal among service providers will be tough to
get, I'd expect that getting acceptance for a P2P based system would be even
harder.  A lot of things have to fall into place to make a P2P network a
viable alternative, and not all of them are technical.

@_subject: STEED - Usable end-to-end encryption 
Maybe.  But the only way to fail for certain is by not trying.  There are
other business models and market pressures beside those that you are
highlighting.  It's not easy to predict.
STEED is fully compatible with existing mail encryption, so we do not include
the headers in the plaintext.  I am not an expert, but as far as I know the
regulation usually demands to store connection data that is available, it does
not ask for data that is not available for whatever reason.  I think your
interpretation of the regulations in that area is overly pessimistic, but I
could be wrong.  Maybe you can verify this?
I think everybody deserves private email communication, not only those who are
willing to be their own provider.  We don't expect people to carry out their
own snail mail letters either, and the business model of the post office does
not require spying on the letters.
Now, it may be the case that the freedom box is (or will be) a more attractive
way for people to do email, and everybody will use it and nobody will use
proprietary email service providers.  That would be excellent!  The FreedomBox
project is a very important project, and it deserves our strongest support
possible.  If it is a better alternative, we still need to convince the
FreedomBox project to adopt the STEED proposal (not a single word in the paper
would have to change).  And I agree that this is an overall more appealing
task than trying to convince the proprietary providers.
But, we have to go where the users are, and we have to try our best to get the
providers cooperation.  There is no benefit in ignoring them and their users
just for our convenience.
If this is too daunting for you, please remember that we do not have to get
their active cooperation.  If they accept it grudgingly because not following
along would be bad business (or illegal), then that's good enough.  That
requires that we raise the state of the art in the field.
Maybe you are still not convinced.  Then let me give you an illustrative
analogy.  (Disclaimer: I am not associated with SawStop or anybody involved,
nor have I met anybody involved or used their product).  An inventor created a
table saw that can prevent injury by stopping the blade as soon as it is
touched by human flesh ("SawStop").  According to the inventory, he could not
get the technology to be marketed by the big table saw companies.  His claim
is that the companies think that by raising the safety measures in the table
saw, they would be more liable for table saw accidents, which would make them
subject to litigation.  Eventually he created his own SawStop product line.
Now, after several years, lawmakers and regulators have taken notice and might
make sawstop like technology mandatory in table saws.
Now, maybe SawStop is bad technology, maybe it's good.  But at least something
is true: As long as no candidate technology like it exists, the question
doesn't even come up.  That's the state we are at with email encryption.
Everybody who tried has learned that email encryption is not worth the hassle.
 Everybody who hasn't tried just expects email to be secure and might not even
be aware that it is not.  It's time to change that equation, don't you think?
The good news is that STEED will integrate extremely well in P2P systems.  The
dependency on a provider in STEED is not integral to the proposal, but just a
consequence of people already relying on their providers infrastructure for
everything else.  If users use different infrastructure, STEED will also work
over that infrastructure just as well.

@_subject: STEED - Usable end-to-end encryption 
Hi Matthias-Christian,
thanks for your comments, I think they are entirely correct.  With respect to
convincing ISPs, STEED is not a complete proposal yet.  The STEED paper covers
the technical aspects of making email encryption usable for the user.  It does
not cover the policies of the parties involved and strategies to break down
walls of tradition.  I think there are good reasons for this.  It is easier to
present the technical aspects in the form of a paper, while the policy stuff
is probably more a learning process that involves entering a dialogue of
multiple parties.  Also, success of STEED may depend on external policy
changes to some extent.  When those happen, we should already be in place, though.
So, you summed it up best: "there is a lot to be done"

1 A New Bugtracker for GnuPG
1.1 dev.gnupg.org
  The GnuPG project has just launched [dev.gnupg.org], a new hub for
  GnuPG development!  The site features a user-friendly task and bug
  tracker, a wiki, a Git repository browser, a calendar and utilities
  such as an URL shortener, a paste tool, bookmarks, customizable
  dashboards, and a meme generator.
  Starting today, the task and bug tracker replaces the old [Roundup]
  installation at [bugs.gnupg.org].  All existing tickets have been
  migrated under the same ticket number.  Links to
  [ are redirected to
  [ while all other links are
  redirected to the main site.
  The new wiki is currently empty, but ready to use. We are inviting the
  community at the [GnuPG Wiki] to join us on the new site, and will be
  glad to assist in the migration of existing documentation after the
  dust has settled.
  In the calendar you will be able to follow the GnuPG release cycles
  and the development sprints.  We also plan to keep track of community
  meetups and hacker conferences there.
  The Git repositories provide a mirror of the core GnuPG and
  GnuPG-For-Windows projects with a very nice visual source code
  browser.  There are no plans to replace the primary Git hosting at
  [git.gnupg.org], but we might add new community-oriented repositories
  in the future that are writable by a larger group of people.
  [dev.gnupg.org]   [Roundup]   [bugs.gnupg.org]   [GnuPG Wiki]   [git.gnupg.org] 1.2 Phabricator
  dev.gnupg.org uses [Phabricator], a free, self-hosted and complete
  software development platform already deployed successfully by other
  free software projects such as [KDE] and [MediaWiki].
  Phabricator supports a lot of features, but we disabled some of them
  to make onboarding easier for new users.  However, we plan to roll out
  some of the additional features in the near future.  In particular, we
  are interested in Phabricator's code review and audit capabilities,
  and are also looking at deeper integration with our Jenkins
  installation.
  If you are missing a particular feature of Phabricator on
  dev.gnupg.org, let us know!
  [Phabricator]   [KDE]   [MediaWiki] 1.3 New Users
  If you are a new user, you can [register a new account] with just a
  username and an email address.
  [register a new account] 1.4 Existing Users
  If you were a user on bugs.gnupg.org, your account has been migrated
  to dev.gnupg.org under the same username and email.  You have to use
  the [password reset form] to set a new password.  After logging in you
  might want to configure the "Email Preferences" under your account
  settings.
  In some cases, duplicated accounts have been merged, and some [email
  addresses had to be adjusted] for Phabricator.  If you have trouble
  recovering your account, contact [marcus] for support.

@_subject: [Announce] Libgcrypt 1.7.8 released to fix CVE-2017-7526 
Caveat: I have only looked at the code of the oldest and newest
versions.  Remember that old versions may not even have 64-bit support,
so they run on different CPU architectures.  But the code is essentially
the same as the vulnerable code in libgcrypt 1.7.7 for these:
Probably all versions up to 1.7.7, starting from at least 1.2.0 (which
is the oldest I could find).
Probably all versions from 1.0.4 up to 1.4.21.  (I could not find 1.0.3,
which according to the NEWS file is the first version with RSA support).
I made a backport of the patch for GPG 1.4.21 here:
I have also found a paper that indicates that the exponent blinding
defense is not as solid as one might think naively, and in which the
author indicates that OpenSSL defended against these kind of attacks
conclusively in 0.9.8f (Oct 2007). I have only glanced over the claims,
but it's certainly intriguing:
