Hello gnupgp administrator,
I am trying to decrypt a file and I receive the following error:
gpg: mpi too large (63451 bits)
and a pop up window reading:
 gpg has generated an error and is being closed by Windows.
Please Help.
Thank you,

@_subject: mpi too large (63451 bits) Error 
I am trying to move this pgp system off of unix and onto nt with gpg.  While at the same time keep all of the public, private, and secret keys.  I've managed to import the keys but when I decrypt the existing unix files on nt, i get this error: mpi to large and a windows pop up saying gnupg has generated an error and will be closed.  Any clues?

@_subject: moving from unix/pgp to NT/gpg 
How should I move my key rings out of unix/pgp to NT/gpg without messing it up?  When I am on NT I uses: gpg --import pubring.pkr and gpg --import --allow-secret-key-import secring.skr.  It seems to take, but when I decrypt I get: gpg: mpi too large (63451 bits) and gpg is shut down.   Thank you =)

I've successfully imported both the public and private keys from unix/pgp to nt/gnupg.  C:\gnupg>gpg --list-key
sec   768R/5CA8A29D 1996-10-15 bendless
However when I decrypt a pgp file I still get:  gpg: protection algorithm 1 is not supported
gpg: encrypted with 768-bit RSA key, ID 5CA8A29D, created 1996-10-15
      "bendless"
gpg: public key decryption failed: unknown cipher algorithm
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
Any clues?
Thank you =)

@_subject: RSA support? 
Does the Precompiled binaries for MS-Windows 95, 98 and NT available at ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/binary/gnupg-w32-1.0.6.zip have RSA support?  I am testing and does not look like it does.  Also is this compatible with 2000 or XP?
Thank you =)
