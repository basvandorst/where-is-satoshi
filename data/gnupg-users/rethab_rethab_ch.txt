@_subject: Is it possible to set a passphrase_cb in gpgme with openpgp protocol 
I have set a passphrase callback with the gpgme library, but still I am
prompted by an external window to enter my passphrase when I call a
function that needs it.
Please note that I did not (intentionally) start the gpg-agent. Is there a
way to force the callback being used rather than that external window? I
would really like to handle this programmatically in this case.
I read in the ruby-bindings library that this only worked with version 1.X
but seems not to work anymore with 2.X. Is there any truth to this?
