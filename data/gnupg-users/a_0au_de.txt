@_subject: Checking multiple smart cards before asking for one 
Hi there,
I have two smart cards, a regular card that I plug into the builtin reader of my
laptop and a yubikey, that have two different keys on them. I store some
passwords in a file that is encrypted with both keys.
When I try to access the passwords, pinentry will always ask me to insert the
yubikey first, even if the other card is already inserted.
Is there a way to define the order this is checked per machine (the laptop will
usually use the card reader, other machines the yubikey), or to force gpg to
check for all cards before asking me to provide one? I'm up for trying to patch
this myself, if somebody will point me in a rough direction :)

Hi Wiktor, thanks for the reply. That issue is indeed what initially prompted me
to make a second key for the second card, but seems a bit different from my
current use case - I have two completely different keys, but two card readers.
Do you think that with that ticket resolved it will allow me to have either key
