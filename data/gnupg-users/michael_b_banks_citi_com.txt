@_subject: gpg version 2.0.17 with libgcrypt 1.4.6 
Another developer and I have downloaded and compiled and built the versions of gpg listed.  I have generated the keys successfully and when I try running gpg as a test to encrypt a file I am getting bus errors.  I have started the agent as you can see below as well.  I also did a list-keys to show my keys I'm testing with as well.  Does anyone have any ideas as to why I am getting a bus error? I've looked at a lot of documentation and browsed the internet but am not finding anything.
gpg (GnuPG) 2.0.17
libgcrypt 1.4.6

mb55918[crdap400] cat test.log | gpg -v -e -r mb55918 --output test.gpg

First off thanks for your reply back.
Can you give me the exact commands on how to run the debugger?  I am not fluent in gpg and could use a little help
We are using Sun Solaris version
SunOS crdap400 5.10 Generic_144488-11 sun4u sparc SUNW,Sun-Fire-15000

Please let us known what OS and what CPU you are using.
To track down such a bus error we need a stack backtrace.  If you run
gpg under a debugger the debugger should break at the bus error and
allow you to generate a backtrace (when using gdb you would enter
"bt full" and then "info registers").
