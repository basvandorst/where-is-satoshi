@_subject: Mail address to account conversion (keybase.io) 
Dear all,
Recently, keybase.io stopped their email forwarding service. Now, my
noctua at keybase.io uid can no longer receive email. I'd normally revoke
the uid, but my account, keybase.io/noctua, can still receive messages
through the website.
I'm in a dilemma now: should I revoke the uid because the email address
is invalid? It's nice to have a reference to the account in my key,
Any advice on this would be welcome.

No, this is for my own PGP key of which I uploaded the public key to
them. I just added a uid with the keybase email to my key.

I indeed do have those, but I'm not sure keybase will bounce. I tried
mailing myself there earlier (with a third address) and all I got in
return was silence.
Thanks for the opinion, I find myself agreeing. I should probably stop
collecting signs on that uid on keysigning parties, though, I shouldn't
bother people with sending signed keys an unconventional (and manual)
