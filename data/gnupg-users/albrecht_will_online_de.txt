@_subject: Errormessage KGPG in Mint KDE 13 
if I start KGPG I get an error-message translated from German to English): "The start of GNUPG failed..., Details: gpg: Optionendatei ' ~/.gnupg/options': file or folder not found.
This is very new for me. I never had this message before since 10 years.
Can anyone help?
