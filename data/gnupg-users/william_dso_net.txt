@_subject: New UK crypto law and an idea on how to defeat it 
You might be interested in reading Richard Stallman's article on this at
 which also links to the actual
text of the bill.  There is AMPLE room for this thing to be vastly abused.
It's a real case of circular logic.  They need something to base their
suspicions on to invoke the law, and your use of encryption and
unwillingness to co-operate makes you suspicious, so they can invoke the
law.  The court that would oversee all of this is a secret closed court,
hence their is no public accountability for their decisions and actions.
The ends don't justify the means.  Sure they have concerns with child
pornography and domestic terrorism, but once the door is open to trample
on people's individual rights, that door can be forced wide open and
abused in ways it was never intended.  Closing the door after the fact is
extremely hard, if not impossible.

I created a key on my linux station, but I have to PGP on my windows

I tried to gpg -a --export-secret and then tried to import it into
PGP6.5, but it rejected the key as invalid.
Is there some special argument I have to use to export a key that can
be imported into PGP?  Or should I just revoke this one, and create a
new PGP key and import it into GnuPG, since I know this method does

I finally just gave up on this and revoked my GPG generated keys and generated
the keys with PGP and imported them into GPG, and it is working no problem
I was not able to export a GPG generated private key in a form that PGP6 could
import and use.  I was able to do the reverse, however.
If anyone comes up with a way to do the GPG private -> PGP export in a working
fashion, please let me know.

When I encrpt a file to a public key using GPG, then decrypt it using PGP 6.5.2
on windows, I get an error "An error has occured: encypted session key is bad"

@_subject: encrypted session key is bad 
Hash: SHA1
Just an addendum, the original error was when attempting to use the GSecure cgi
script to encrypt form input before emailing.  As I said, I can decrypt fine
using GPG, but in this case the client is using Windows PGP 6.5.2.
This morning I encrypted a text file manually, and tried to decrypt it using
PGP 6.5.2 in windows (gotta love vmware) and had the same problem (encrypted
session key is bad) and it can't decrypt it.  So it's not directly related to
the CGI script.
I've been reading the docs and list archives and so far can't find any option
that might solve this, so if anyone has any possible solution for me to try,
I'd be most appreciative.

The only responses I have gotten to this (and those privately) are from people
saying "I'm having that problem to, let me know if you get a fix."
But so far no one who has any clue to fix this interoperability problem.
My next option is to replace gpg on the server with PGP, something I really
would rather not do.  The solution is for emailing form contents from a CGI to
the user in encrypted format
How do all of you handle encrypting to people that are using PGP6?  I know that
this problem isn't unique to me, from the private responses.   Is there anyone here who is using gpg to encypt to PGP6 users and has gotten
around this problem?  I'd sure like to hear from you if so, or even if you just
have an option to try that you think might work.   The problem occurs only with
encryption, not with signing,verifying signatures, etc.

The problem is persistant, and anytime I encrypt a message using GnuPG, users
of PGP 6.5.x (for windows at least) cannot decrypt the message.  It gives an
error.  I've reported this a few times in the past over the last few months.
This is not an intermittent problem.

The restrictions would apply only to distribution of the solution.
However, there is nothing that would prevent you from doing it
strictly for your own purposes or use.  Nothing in either license
would prohibit you doing it for yourself.
Unfortunately, the GPL's lack of freedom would prevent you from
helping others by making your solution available to the public.

No, there is no way to do this.
What you may want to do in the future is either make a copy of the
unencrypted key on a CD or floppy, or even just print it out, and
store that unencrypted copy in a secure location.  Then at least you
have an unencrypted copy you can enter in and use in the event you
forget the password you encrypted the private key to.
