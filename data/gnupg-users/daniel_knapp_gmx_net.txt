Hi Thomas,
I am sorry, but there is no executable file GPG where you can choose from one
of the algorithms that you mention below. These algorithms are not part of the
GNU Project and are not freely available. They are all licensed products and
can therefor not be integrated in GPG.

I am pretty new in this mailinglist and in addition, I am still a GNUPG / PKE
newbie. I read all the statements, from Pedro, David and Dirk and I was
wondering, if an exported keyring (-exported to Floppy Disk) wouldn`t increase
the data security? I mean, everyone would still be responsible for their
keyring, but there would be no need to store them on a public PC.

Hi Caitlin...
1) Since you use Yahoo-Mail, you cannot use an eMail Programm to download the
mail, right? OK, then you don`t have any other choice but to copy and paste the
encrypted message to an textfile (like in notepad)
2)  Same procedure as in 1) Copy-paste-notepad....and then you can import the
key without any problem
3) Yes, copy the whole text into a file and then you can compare the
fingerprints with the fingerprints published on keyservers or you compare it
directly with the owner of the key!

Hi People...
....I have a problem! I don´t know, how I can delete a public-key from my
keyring. A friend of mine forgot his passphrase and he generated a new pair of
keys. I imported his new public key without any problem, but now, I have two
public keys with the same uid....and I was wondering how I could delete of of
these keys...
Thanks in advance
