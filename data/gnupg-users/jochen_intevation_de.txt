@_subject: How to silence gpg-agent? 
Hi Dahsamir,
I digged the code a bit and found, the piece of code. As you already assumed correctly, the trust-db is checked periodically, if the --no-auto-check-trustdb option is not set, and a log output is made, when the option --quiet is not set (./g10/trustdb.c:970), but the validate function is always called. So setting --quiet will just silence the otuput "gpg: checking the trustdb". If you dig a bit deeper in the validate function (./g10/trustdb.c:2057), you'll see that the logging output about the validation is always done and it doesn't care about any flag.
You can redirect the log output to a file with the --logger-fd option. You still have the output from the trustdb check, but maybe its easier to parse it from a file, then from the stdin.
Kind regards
