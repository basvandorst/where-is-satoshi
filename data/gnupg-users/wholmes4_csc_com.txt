@_subject: secret key not available 
We recently generated a new key pair because of a server domain change.  We
generated a new armored public key and provided it to companies that send
us files via ftp.  They have encrypted files with our new public key and
sent these files.  We cannot decrypt them.
Here is what we get when we try to decrypt:
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
gpg: encrypted with ELG-E key, ID 7725AAB6
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
We're using GnuPG version 1.0.6.
What have we done wrong?
