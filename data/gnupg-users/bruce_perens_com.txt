@_subject: Seeking officers for Free-software-friendly Certification Authority 
Hi GnuPG users,
With the absorbtion of Thawte into Verisign, we're concerned that the only
remotely free-software-friendly commercial CA will change its policies. The
lack of competition bothers us too. So, let's do something about it. A good
CA could do more for free software than we've seen so far. We'd like to hear
from candidates who could assume the technical leadership of a
free-software-friendly CA. A deep technical background in applied cryptography
would be required. Please write to me at  .
