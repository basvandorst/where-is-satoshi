Is there any documentation on the library calls used in the
encryption/decryption?  I want to incorporate gpg into a C++ program with out
having to break out to the system to encrypt/decrypt.

@_subject: exported GPG keys seemingly not behaving in PGP 
First thank you to the two individuals who helped me with exporting public
keys that PGP would accept.
I'm still trying to get our gpg to play nice with our customers pgp.
I generated keys and exported them.
I sent the public key to our partner.  He imported them and signed them.
I imported his public key and did the following
gpg --sign --encrypt --output file.gpg --recipient  file
I thought all was right with the world.
When they decrypted the file they received a WARNING message that the
signature in the file was incorrect.
Any ideas?

@_subject: Compilation Issues 
I'm working on a HP-UX 11.0 system.
In util/iobuf.c, there are several blocks of code prefixed by
 defined (HAVE_FOPEN64) && defined (HAVE_FSTAT64)
The lines/blocks in question generate the following errors:
iobuf.c: In function `iobuf_open':
iobuf.c:601: warning: implicit declaration of function `fopen64'
iobuf.c:601: warning: assignment makes pointer from integer without a cast
iobuf.c: In function `iobuf_create':
iobuf.c:670: warning: assignment makes pointer from integer without a cast
iobuf.c: In function `iobuf_append':
iobuf.c:703: warning: assignment makes pointer from integer without a cast
iobuf.c: In function `iobuf_openrw':
iobuf.c:730: warning: assignment makes pointer from integer without a cast
iobuf.c: In function `iobuf_fopen':
iobuf.c:769: warning: assignment makes pointer from integer without a cast
iobuf.c: In function `iobuf_get_filelength':
iobuf.c:1327: storage size of `st' isn't known
iobuf.c:1335: warning: implicit declaration of function `fstat64'
iobuf.c:1327: warning: unused variable `st'
make[2]: *** [iobuf.o] Error 1
I looked in sys/stat.h and found they were using _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE around
the definitions for fstat64(), etc.
When I add the test for _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE to the tests in util/iobuf.c,
 defined(_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE) && defined (HAVE_FOPEN64) && defined
(HAVE_FSTAT64)   it compiles and the executable seems to work.
I'm wondering if I should be concerned about this condition and am I missing
any functionality?

@_subject: 1.0.3 - 1.0.4 diff 
I have downloaded the 'diff' file for 1.0.3-1.0.4.
It saves as a .gz file. It is not in .gz format.  It's plain text.
Then when I try to run 'patch -p1', I receive the following message:
Hmm...  I can't seem to find a patch in there anywhere.

The folks ate NAI/PGP have made the assertion that GPG has taken PGP and
reverse engineered it in order to obtain the source fo GPG.
Can you provide the GPG side of this story?

@_subject: encryption algorithms 
Is it possible to make use of the other algorithms for encryption?
When generating a set of keys it offers a limitted set of the algorithms that
--version says are supported.
I'd like to be to use RIJNDAEL or even RSA as my chosen encryption.

@_subject: export/import 
We are evaluating whether to use PGP or GPG.  One of the issues I'm facing is
how to get the two to play-nice together.  I'm currently have trouble getting
PGP to cleanly import a gpg public key.
I executed
gpg --armor --output  -export When I try to import it and sign it in pgp, I get 'unknown type' and 'unable
to encrypt to key' messages. Did I miss anything?  Any ideas?
