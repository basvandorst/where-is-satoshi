Ooops, I hadn't noticed that. Yes, then VirtualAlloc and VirtualLock can
be used to avoid leaving traces of sensitive data on the swap file in
the way you described (i.e. lock before fill and sweep before
I still think that's not the kind of task that the function has been
designed for. The authorization constrain you mentioned and other
possible side effect tend to make it unpractical for naive usage.
However, a background console app that allocates a few memory pages for
storing sensitive data (e.g. a gpg agent?) should use it to increase
data security.
