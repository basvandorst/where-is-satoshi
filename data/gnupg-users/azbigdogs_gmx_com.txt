I was thinking about getting an app called iPGMail for iPhone/iPad to

Is there anyway to revoke an OLD LOST PGP key? I no longer have either

@_subject: Revoking a Lost Key 
I figured it was not possible but just wanted to double check. It is an
OLD key from the 90s attached to an email address for a ISP that no
longer exists so it's not really used. IF it was possible I would revoke
it but since it is not, it will just live out there forever.

These were keys created in the 90s on probably 3 computers ago. I looked
through some old CDs that I had laying around but they didn't have the
saved keys. I don't use these keys anymore and having in over a decade.
In fact the email address and even the entire ISP are long gone now.? I
was just thinking if I could revoke them I would but it doesn't look
like that is possible.

I can't even remember what program I used to create them. I think it was
when Symantec first started with the PGP program and was beta testing
it. Anything that the keys encrypted is long gone anyway so not a huge
loss. I just would have "properly dealt" with them if possible. I didn't
think so, but figured I'd just in case.
I remember the old FidoNet days. I was involved with QWK mail reader way
back then.

I was wondering what effect changing the passphrase has on the keys. Not
only the keygrip file but also on the exported copy of it that can be
used with other programs. If you change the passphrase, do you need to
re-backup those keygrip files and re-export those keys again?

Thanks for the reply... Probably safer to back them up again just in

Kinda of a stupid question here about updating your keys. I'm curious as
to what changes would require you to re-upload it to a keyserver.???
I assume updating the passphrase would not because that is tied to the
private key but does it change anything in the public key where that
might be require it to be updated??
How about changing the expiration date of the primary and secondary
keys? I assume that would be needed to be updated to the keyserver.?
Which then brings me to another question, what happens when you
re-upload your key to a keyserver. Does it overwrite the older one or ??

Thanks for all the tips on which files to backup and how to export to
for use in other apps (which is another thing I want to do later). MANY
years ago (mid 90s) I created some PGP keys with the old Norton PGP
program I was beta testing... Unfortunately those private keys are long
lost (several computers ago) and have no idea where any backups of them
are. Learning from my mistake here so want to make sure I have backups
of what I need. Yes I am using GnuPG 2.2 as part of GPG4Win and Enigmail.
I will take a look at if I have all those files, some don't look
familiar plus take a look at that Sherpa program

I was thinking along the lines of backing up that entire directory into

that archive. I know there are other options maybe even some that use
biometrics to decrypt the database.

With the posts of backing up files and anonymous private keys it got me
thinking. Is there a mechanism in place that protects (encrypts) a

contact list and with some mail providers encrypting contacts I wondered
if such a thing existed with pgp keys??
Obviously I know you can install it an encrypted volume (depending on
your OS) but was curious if the program or even the "pgp standard" took
that into consideration or am I just too bored and that it's a stupid idea?

One of the potential problems I can see is multiple key rings. which I
have just recently discovered in my own setup. I have the "standard" key
rings that GPG4Win/Enigmail use and then I discovered 2 unknown files in
my gnupg directory. PAPubring.gpg and PAsecring.gpg. I eventually
deduced they came from an archiving program I use that has PGP built in
called Power Archiver.?
Granted I am a newbie with PGP but the thought of having to make sure
multiple key rings are all synced sounds like a hassle.

@_date: 2020-05-30 11:54:35
@_author: Mark 
@_subject: Certified OpenPGP-encryption after release of Thunderbird 78 
So then do you have multiple pairs of key rings? One pair for TB78 and
its built in PGP and another pair as part of GNUPG?
If so how do you keep them synchronized?

Doesn't TB also need your secret keys to decrypt messages???
Also what if you need your public keys outside of TB such as encrypting
a file?
The reason I'm asking is that awhile ago I posted about unknown files in
my GNUPG directory. PAPubring.gpg and PAsecring.gpg. I eventually found
out those are key rings used by a program I have called Power Archiver.
I'm not sure why it has it own set of keys, still awaiting an
explanation from support. If every app is not using the same pair of key
rings (and there is no synchronization between them) could that not lead
to problems?

@_author: Mark 
@_subject: Certified OpenPGP-encryption after release of Thunderbird 78 
That is what I see happening too. When you start having multiple key
stores, which one contains the "correct" keys?? I saw that happening in
just my very limited usage where another program has its own key rings...?

============================== START ==============================
So for all of us that don't use a smart card to store our keys, they are
stored in TB?? What if we also have need for that key outside of email
such as signing or decrypting files? We still need that key in GNUPG as
well. If we change the key at all then we have to make sure it has been
updated in both areas???
I could see a similar situation could develop with the public keys where
the ones stored in TB are not in sync with the ones stored in GNUPG.?
What happens with keys that are obtained from websites for places like
Apple, Microsoft, etc that are not being directly imported from an email?
Maybe I am overthinking it or just missing something but I see potential
problems with this. If they are not using the same data (key rings) or
in constant synchronization, the "wrong key" could be used.?? Hopefully
they have a way to address this.
