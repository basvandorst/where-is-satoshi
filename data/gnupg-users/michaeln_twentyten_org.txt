@_subject: gpgme: encrypt/decrypt help 
So, I've been going through the samples, and I'm still sort of unclear about
how to get the right public key read in so I can do an encryption.  I'm
looking at the following function:
gpgme_error_t gpgme_op_encrypt (gpgme_ctx_t ctx, gpgme_key_t recp[],
gpgme_encrypt_flags_t flags, gpgme_data_t plain, gpgme_data_t cipher)
The question is, how do I build these recipients?  I have a bunch of public
keys in a MySQL database keyed by email address.  I want to populate recp[]
with these public keys and encrypt, but I'm not sure how to go about doing
Could someone give me a quick tutorial on how to get this going?  You know,
something like:
 - Take your text keys from MySQL and read it into a char string
 - Run gpgme_blah_blah with blah and blah to turn the public keys into the
recp array
 - Pass that value to gpgme_op_encrypt and away you go
Thanks for your patience guys.  I'll keep going over the samples...

So...  I'm trying to get started, but I was wondering if the people here
could give me some suggestions on what I need to do.  The How-To's and
guides seem to focus on using the GnuPG command line package, but what I'm
trying to do is create a GnuPG aware application.
Basically I want to write a GnuPG plugin for Postfix.  What libraries do I
need to download?  I started with GPGME, but realized that I'm not really
sure what I need here.  Is there a place where I can look at function
prototypes or a similar type guide?
Thanks in advance!

Eh...something very custom for our customer base.  It wouldn't be useful to
anyone else.  Basically, what I'm going to do is allow a PGP option for our
users.  We'll have a bunch of key generation and storage stuff, but the part
I'm going to write is this:
 - Email comes in for user
 - If user is set to have "PGP enabled", check to see if the email is
 - If encrypted, check the user's key rings and decrypt it
 - Write this new decrypted buffer to the maildir
That's really rough, but I hope you see what I'm getting at.  I intend to do
the same thing for outgoing mail.

Yes, I think GPGME seems good enough.  I just wanted to know if this is
indeed what I should be using.  Thanks guys.
