@_subject: Dumb Question 
Ok to you users of GPG this is surely a dumb question, but humor me
and either explain how to get started or point me at something
that explains it...  Ive looked at the two books I have, and Im going
to have to read a lot more than I have time for right now to just get started Ive just pulled the current GNUPG sources and the *.sig file.
Lets assume I have a running gpg, so HOW do I go about checking the sig?
I tried and I get
So how do I get the key and insert it on my keyring?

@_subject: Anyone having problems with RedHat up2date and gpg 1.2.0? 
Ive been using RedHat's up2date to keep my system up to date
with respect to bugs and security problems.
I just tried it tonight, and Im getting an error popup
that says that it cant find GPG, even though 'where' finds
it ok.
My only thought is that I recently updated from 1.0.6 to 1.2.0.
Putting symbolic links in all the reasonable places doesnt help.
Anyone else see this problem????

@_subject: ARRRGHHH Had GPG working, now it doesnt. 
I had GPG working.
I updated from version gnupg-1.0.6 to gnupg-1.0.7.
This moved gpg from /usr/bin to /usr/local/bin and I changed the path
in the exmh 'executable'.
With that fix, EXMH knows I have GPG, and puts the line
in messages with GnuPG signatures.  But punching the line ALWAYS
        Signature made Thu Aug 29 00:27:17 2002 MDT using DSA key ID BDDF997A
        Can't check signature: public key not found
So, something else is missing.
Can somebody tell me what it is,- Ive tried grepping on everything
that I can think of with no luck at all.
