I know that gpg can use 3DES cipher algorithm, but how do I generate the   128-bit key used for this?
I can see that gpg can generate DSA and ElGamal, but I can find out how to generate keys for 3DES.

Well, this true when I use gpg in both ends.
But my problem is that the opposite end only uses symmetric ciphers and I have to inform them about my 3DES key for this session (encrypted with another 3DES key).
So therefore I need to generate 3DES keys, encrypt it with a given 3DES key, at send it to the receiver.
(I haven't 'invented' this system, the receiver did.)
So is there any way I can generate/get 3DES key?
Perhaps using some library?

I had a closer look at "The GNU Privacy Handbook" Chapter 2 under Symmetric ciphers, it says: "... 3DES, Blowfish, and IDEA all use 128-bit keys, ..."
(I agree that is seems a little strange to call it 3DES then.)
But now I came to think about it.
Can I in principle use 'any' bit-string with the required number of bits as my key?
If that is so, then I could use a high-quality random number generator to make my keys?
Then that may well be the solution to my problem.

This sounds reasonable to use --show-session-key
But I don't get any keys shown :-(
It might be because I use it in a wrong way, but the man-page isn't that =
I've tried to have the option both during encryption and decryption,=20
with no difference.
I've tried the following:
gpg --show-session-key --cipher-algo 3DES -c and was of course asked for a passphrase, which I gave.
- but no session key was shown
I tried hereafter:
gpg --show-session-key .gpg
gave the passphrase as before.
- no session key was shown
Any idea about what I do wrong, and perhaps an example of how I should do=

To be more correct, the receiver uses two-key Triple-DES
This form of Triple-DES is used by the RSAREF library.
I think I've found the solution to my problems in the openssl libraries.
