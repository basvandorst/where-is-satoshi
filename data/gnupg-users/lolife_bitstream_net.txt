What does this mean:
gpg: cipher algorithm 1 is unknown or disabled
gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit ELG-E key, ID 9DBCAC2E, created 2002-04-01
      "Michael D. Koppelman "
gpg: public key decryption failed: unknown cipher algorithm
gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit RSA key, ID FF1452BB, created 2002-03-20
      "VISI.com billing "
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
I have RSA installed:
Supported algorithms:
Cipher: 3DES, CAST5, BLOWFISH, RIJNDAEL, RIJNDAEL192, RIJNDAEL256, TWOFISH
Pubkey: RSA, RSA-E, RSA-S, ELG-E, DSA, ELG
Hash: MD5, SHA1, RIPEMD160
Is this because of goddamn IDEA?
