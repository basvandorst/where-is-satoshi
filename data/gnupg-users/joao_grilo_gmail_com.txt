Recently, I was asked to backup and archive a ton of sensitive data, so I
used gpg keep it away from evil eyes.
Now, trying to recover it on a different machine, it fails with the
following error:
debian:~# gpg mybigbackupfile.tar.gz.gpg
gpg: CAST5 encrypted data
gpg: encrypted with 1 passphrase

Hello again,
First of all, thanks for the quick reply.
The checksum did reveal that there are differences. I know this isn't
directly related to GnuPG, but since the file in question is so big
(100gigs), and I don't have physical access to the original file any more,
is it possible to simply transfer the difference between both binaries
through a network connection? If so, what would you consider the best option
in this situation? Rsync?
Thank you for your time, and I'll understand if you redirect me to the rsync
mailing list instead of providing an answer.
Best regards,
Joao Marques
