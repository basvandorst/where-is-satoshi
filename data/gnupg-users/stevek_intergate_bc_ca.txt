@_subject: Fw: encrypting and signing a file without a passphrase 
Hi all,
 I am using version 1.2.1.  Can someone help me with the following:
 I would like to send encrpyt and sign a file without having to enter a
 passphrase each time.  I could not find a way to pass the passphrase as an
 argument to GPG.   In the FAQ, there was some mention (article 4.14) about
 batch process and removing the passphrase using --edit.  I tried that, but
 when I entered:
     gpg --edit foo
  I had no means of editing foo.
 Any ideas how I can encrpyt and sign a file without having to enter my
 passphrase?

I read about --passphrase-fd n, but I do not know what value to specify for
the file descriptor.  If I have a temporary file called, pswd.txt,
containing the passphrase, what value do I specify for the file descriptor,
and how will gpg know the name of the file it needs to read to get the

@_subject: Newbie -> trusting public key via batch method 
Thank you all for your help in passing a passphrase using --passphrase-fd.
I am trying to sign and encrypt a file using a public key which I have
imported.  However, I am prompted about the trust-worthiness of the public
key.  Is there a way to import a public key and place trust on it without
interactively editing the public key (gpg --edit-key   ; trust ; 5)
such that when I try to use the key, I won't have to answer the prompt.
I am using ver 1.2.1 running on Win2K.
Thanks in advance.
