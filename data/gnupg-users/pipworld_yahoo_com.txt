@_subject: Can a new version use old keys? 
I've recently been forced to upgrade from 1.0.6 to 1.2.1 and am having trouble decrypting. Do I need to regenerate the keys or should the old keys still work in the new version?
I'm encrypting on Linux and decrypting on Windows, something which has been working fine for years with 1.0.6.

@_subject: Decryption of truncated data? 
Is it possible to decrypt a data block which has the first 43 bytes I inherited a wrapper script which was removing the PGP headers and footers using hard-coded string lengths, but after a GPG upgrade, the headers changed length and this part of the data was truncated. I've now got lots of small data blocks (around 1k) I need to decrypt.
I know this is unlikely due to the damaged structure of the encrypted data, CRCs, etc. but is there any way of recovering the partial remaining data?
