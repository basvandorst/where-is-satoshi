Even with PIN-pad on a compromised computer you still have no guarantee
WHAT you are signing.
My opinion is that if the computer is compromised you are lost anyway.

Very interesting ideas and valuable discussion. Why is this issue so
important to me?
Because I personally witnessed the Austrian government giving away
hundreds of so called "B?rgerkarten" smartcards and free smartcard
readers during the 2009 student election. They gave them to the students
without explaination and everyone chose a PIN on a public, possibly
compromised, laptop form the university. The whole procedure took about
3 minutes per student.
What nobody explained to them was that these cards can be used to sign
almost anything. The signatures are equal by law to written signatures
in almost all kinds of contracts. If your computer is infected you can
not tell if you just sold your car for 20.000 euros or 5.000 euros.
I think this was a mayor scandal but I never heard anything about it in
the media. This is why am I so sensitive about this distinction. This
card is still sold and required for online activities with the goverment
Back to gnupg:
Thats absolutely right. And I think this is why we use the gnupg
smartcard including me ;)
However you trade this for other disadvantages. My laptop is closely
monitored for physical access and I think it's temper evident for me if
someone would install a hardware keylogger.
So tell me where is the key more secure:
1. on my laptop, which is protected with full disk encryption
implemented in open source, and which I operate with an open source
operating system and where I employ a rigid patching policy or
2. on a smartcard, where I know nothing about the hardware
implementation and where my key is either not encrypted at all or
encrypted with a pin that is 6 digits only by default.
I have no idea what hardware flaws the card has and how well it can
withstand reverse engineering [2]. I am pretty confidet that my  OSS-FDE
protected harddisk does a better job in protecting my key against
physical attacks.

Hi Alphazo,
thanks for this great howto. I got it working right away.
Where I still have problems: The gnome-keyring (seahorse), still demands
the user-password. Also I often have to unplug and replug the reader to
authenticate. This works, but it is very inconvenient.

I use the OpenPGP card for signing, encrypting and SSH and I like it a
However I find that OpenVPN does not have support for the card yet. :/
So I am forced to use scute, a PKCS  implementation for the OpenPGP
Now my question is: would this work? Has anybody tried this successfully?

This is great news. How do you know this? Are you affiliated with scute?

@_subject: OpenPGP card and poldi-ctrl 
I want to do login with my OpenPGP card. So I am following some tutorial
on how to do this with Ubuntu (see [1]) but the howto seems outdated and
I get an error:
  poldi-ctrl: error: unknown option '--register-card'
  poldi-ctrl: error: parsing argument vector failed: Unknown option
So I thought maybe I have to build from source which I did from
  svn://cvs.gnupg.org/poldi/trunk poldi-trunk
but this poldi-ctrl does not know the option "'--register-card" either.
So what I did was read the textinfo files and added my serial to
of etc/pam.d/common-auth I still cannot authenticate.
I found very litte documentation and discussion regarding poldi on the
web and would be happy if someone could shed some light onto this issue.
