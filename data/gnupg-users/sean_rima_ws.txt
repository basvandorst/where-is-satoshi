Hello gnupg-users,
  I may have the chance to inherit a Gemplus gemPC430 USB card reader
  to use with my PC. I am looking to get an gpg card from kernel
  concepts, but want to know if anyone has used this reader with gpg

Hi Folks
I am trying to setup claws to use smime and the only part that I do not

With Werner's help I made progess but there is one last one that I
cannot get past. I created a debug and get this:
posix-io.c:135: closing fd 21
wait.c:160: setting fd 21 (item=0x90cea70) done
posix-io.c:329: gpgme:select on [ r23 ]
posix-io.c:375: select OK [ r23 ]
posix-io.c:329: gpgme:select on [ r23 ]
posix-io.c:375: select OK [ r23 ]
posix-io.c:72: fd 22: about to read 1002 bytes
posix-io.c:79: fd 22: got 0 bytes
engine-gpgsm.c:702: fd 23: error from assuan (-1) getting status line : Invalid crypto engine
posix-io.c:135: closing fd 23
wait.c:160: setting fd 23 (item=0x90ceab0) done
Not sure why I am getting an invalid crypto engine

Ok, it was a bit strange but the problem was that I was cjecking the
sig on my sent mails which claws does't seem to do, but on incoming
mails it is working prefectly. So I am happy :)

I use gpg --export --armour KEY-NAME > my-pub-key.asc
You can have different keys with the same name but different email addresses
Hope this help
