@_subject: cv25519 subkeys not sent in recv-keys or shown in search-keys 
Using gpg2-2.1.8 with libgcrypt-1.7.0-beta262, I did the following:
(1) made a master sign/certify ed25519 key.
(2) made 3 subkeys (ed25519 sign, ed25519 authorize, cv25519 encrypt)
(3) send-keys to keys2.kfwebs.net (rumored to support ecc): success
Here are the keys:
    pub   ed25519/3AED5886 2015-10-04 [SC] [expires: 2016-10-03]
    uid         [ultimate] Scott Mcdermott     sub   cv25519/9300DF68 2015-10-04 [E] [expires: 2016-10-03]
    sub   ed25519/C0223044 2015-10-04 [A] [expires: 2016-10-03]
    sub   ed25519/EB2BDC84 2015-10-04 [S] [expires: 2016-10-03]
Ok, now I want to see if others can see them:
(1) make a brand new user account
(2) empty homedir except gpg.conf with keys2.kfwebs.net.
(3) recv-keys with the master ID (0x3AED5886)
ok, so the subkeys should now be in my new user's keyring, yes?
But NO.  Using list-keys, I see the sign and authorize (the ed25519s),
but *not* the encrypt subkey:
    pub   ed25519/3AED5886 2015-10-04 [SC] [expires: 2016-10-03]
    uid         [ unknown] Scott Mcdermott     sub   ed25519/C0223044 2015-10-04 [A] [expires: 2016-10-03]
    sub   ed25519/EB2BDC84 2015-10-04 [S] [expires: 2016-10-03]
However, when I search-keys for the hexid of the encrypt subkey,
it returns the master public key, so the server knows about the subkey.
Then why doesn't it send to me when I --recv-keys ? For that matter,
does output my keys, but does not show the very key that was
searched for!
Is it possible the server supports ed25519, but not cv25519? Are there
any keyservers known to support both these key types? It seems that
almost all do not, even keys2.kfwebs.net (got this one from

@_subject: how to configure default sign key for particular user? 
I have multiple keys for the same userid.  When using:
    gpg --sign --user email at address.foo
gpg-2.1.11 is always choosing the wrong one.  The 'default-key'
setting is ignored (as documented) due to presence of '--user'.
Does this mean there is no way to tell gpg to automatically sign
with a particular key, unless I specify the actual keyid instead
of the email? How can I configure the default signing key to use
*for a given userid/address* (not just in unspecified case)?
Otherwise, any application [which knows only username/email] has
to be know also the specific keyid to override gpg's default
selection (which I'm guessing is the first key in the keyring);
this seems wrong, it should be configurable in gpg, just like
it's configurable if no userid is given (i.e. default-key).
(aside: the default key selected for a userid should probably be
the later key anyways, I would think, under the assumption that
one always want to use the newer key, not the oldest one.)

MFPA on 2016/05/09 +0100 I'm talking about signing, not encrypting, which uses my own
secret key, not a published key.

Robert J. Hansen on 2016/05/08 -0400 Any such application, and myself, would never claim that a
userid was unique.  A key is chosen if not specified; gpg
already has an algorithm to do this.  If it was wrong to choose
a key, then gpg should bomb out if a uid is given instead of a
full key id, and furthermore there should be no default-key
configuration option at all.
Instead, what it does is to select a key; probably, it uses the
first key found in the keyring that matches the uid.
There is a configurable 'default-key' already for a reason: to
instruct gpg what to do if an application asks to sign
something, but doesn't specify the userid at all.  The
information about default key preferences should be kept in gpg,
not every single application.
Here we have a case where *more* information is provided than
none (which is the case when 'default-key' is used), i.e.
userid, but less information is provided than the specific
keyid.  In such a case, a default should be configurable.
Possibly, gpg could overload default-key based on how many args:
    default-key uid1 keyid1
    default-key uid2 keyid2
    default-key keyid3
If no userid is specified, keyid3 is chosen, otherwise the
specified keyid is chosen.  If an unconfigured uid is specified,
the current algorithm is used (presumably first on keyring --
although I personally think this should be last on keyring for
signing, but that's a separate matter).
