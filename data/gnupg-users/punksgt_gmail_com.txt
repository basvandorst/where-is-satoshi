I using S3 / duplicity back up script , save my files. It has been working just fine, until I added a second gpg key. Then all hell broke loose. I tried to deal with two keys, then I delete the second key. Then I remove / purged gpg altogether and started with a fresh start.
I created a new key and this is the response I get. |GPGError: GPG Failed, see log below: ===== Begin GnuPG log ===== gpg: no default secret key: secret key not available gpg: [stdin]: sign+encrypt failed: secret key not available ===== End GnuPG log ===== | Here is my back up script (but I dont think that is the problem)
Here is the details of my keys:
sec   2048R/7E4B6B9B 2015-07-15
uid                  Chad H I have also modified the conf file to make this key the default one. I have spent far to much time on this but I'm obessed for some lame reason, I'm at my wits end, thanks in advance.

Okay, not to be a complete noob.
So I created a new key and selected  "RSA and RSA"
