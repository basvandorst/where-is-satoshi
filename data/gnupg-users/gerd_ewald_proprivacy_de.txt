GPGShell, which is not OpenSource (FYI).
A full description "How to install" may be found here:

I guess you are using Windows as your MUA is "Microsoft Outlook
Express 5.50.4133.2400". In this case try  There is an
English translation of how to install GnuPG and a Windows-Frontend.
If you are going to use PGP (Ver 6.5.x) you may want to look at
 where an English tutorial on PGP is published
(It was written for TheBat!-Users, but it is useful for others as
I remember another good site, but that is written in German, so I'm not
sure whether this is of any help.

Hash: SHA1
Hello Carl-Eric,
On Sat, 5 Jan 2002 15:24:42 +0100 GMT your local time,
No, not really. I use GPG 1.0.6 on w2k and on NT4 and never had that
problem! I reproduced this (gpg --gen-key) a minute ago: key pair
generated without problem!
Have you got the error message? What does it say?

@_subject: Sub Keys versus Session Keys 
Hello David,
On Wed, 20 Mar 2002 16:58:42 -0000 GMT your local time,
Not at all. The session key is needed for encrypting the message using
one of the symmetric algorithms (CAST, 3DES, Rijndael or whatever...).
This key should _not_ be used again (this is what good cryptographers
RSA or any other asymmetric algorithm is used to encrypt the session
key with the public key of the recipient.
