@_subject: GNU Privacy Guard - Installation on Windoze poorly explained 
I wanted to install GNU Privacy Guard on my WinNT PC. I read the "Readme.w32" in the ZIP file. I got stuck on Step 4 of the "Installation Here is the vague text for reference:
4. If you did not use the default directory "c:\gnupg", you
   should enter a string with the directory into the Registry
   under the key:
    \\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\GNU\GnuPG\HomeDir
   Please use forward slashes and not the backslashes when
   setting filenames for GnuPG into the Registry.
A. It doesn't state * where* exactly in the registry the string should be entered (in left pane, or under "Name", or under "Value").
B. should the directory path end with a "\" or not?
C. Is "HomeDir" to be * replaced* by the actual directory path, or should one replace the path under "name", under "value" (DE = "Wert")? Under the Name = "Standard", or does one create a new Name? What should the name of the new Name be?
D. At which location exactly does one use forward slashes?
E. What does "setting filenames" mean?
F. An *example * of a correct registry entry in the rteadme file would have solved all problems.
G. Step 5 says: "Enter "gpg" and see what happens". I doubleclicked on "gpg.exe" in the install directory and only got a DOS window asking me to type something - very unimpressive, and defietely not what I was hoping to get out of this; namely the ability to encrypt emails using Mozilla (and the "enigmail" module -  ).
Please provide usable instructions and reply to me directly. I would be very happy to use and evangelize this useful-sounding tool (if it works on windoze machines).
