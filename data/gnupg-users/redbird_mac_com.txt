@_subject: Question about images 
Hash: SHA1
Okay, after searching the archives I couldn't find anything except for a message from a while ago about how images are not officially part of OpenPGP or something like that.
Anyway, my problem is this:  all images in GnuPG look something like this:
uid                            [revoked] [image of size 2493]
Yet in my copy of PGP 6.x I'm running everything is fine.  Any ideas about what is going on?

@_subject: Do not use GnuPG under Mac OS RNG 
First off, sorry I missed this discussion when it was getting going, since my domain name is down at the moment and I'm sending from this mac.com address.  Anyway...
Okay, first, let's make sure we're talking about the same thing. rndunix is what I'm getting if I call rnd(), correct?  I assumed that's what you meant, but I thought I'd better check.  If this is it, yes, the patterns are horrible, often generating alternative odd and even numbers and such other obvious patterns.
Secondly, egd claims to be collecting from 21 sources on my machine. If rndunix is just one of those, won't the entropy from the other sources take care of this?
Finally, thank you to pplf, who apparently saw my notice on the Mac GPG web site that my e-mail was down and forwarded this to me. Please, cc me in the rest of this discussion, because I don't really want to be signed up twice to the list (vix. I'm assuming that my domain name will be up again soon).

Okay, we seemed to be saved.  I can't find rndunix on my system anywhere; the only place randomness comes from is stdlib from rand().  From what I can tell, the reason for getting such unrandom numbers is because rndunix is not used.  Could someone working with Darwin directly confirm (I'm going to try to check this out myself, but if someone could confirm for me, that would just as good)?

Looking around the source code I couldn't find anything, but then I don't know Darwin that well, so maybe I just couldn't find it.
Anyway, if the case is as I have restated it, egd should be safe on OS X, correct?

Yes, I see, a big misunderstanding.  Okay, I've figured out what you mean now and am looking into it.  Guess that's what I get for not knowing GnuPG inside out.  ;-)
Okay, just to check again, gnupg passes all of it's self tests (running make check).  I know that a URL to a paper about this topic was posted (I have the paper and am reading it), but is there anything else I need to do to make sure that rndunix.c is returning really random numbers?  What's the best way to get some random numbers from it (I'm thinking I'll just print them out and at least make sure that there are no visible patterns)?

@_subject: Do not use GnuPG under Mac OS RNG 
After doing some more checking, it seems that everything is okay. The numbers being generated are random and safe for usage from what I can tell.  So, I'm going to recall the warning I issued this morning (I told people to stop using their keys and be ready to revoke them if I gave the word after making sure that this was really a problem) if I don't get a message giving me reason not to in the next couple of hours.  I'm glad that this all proved to be a misunderstanding, not an actual problem.  :-)
Also, I have a question for the list.  Since egd generates random numbers pretty much the same way gnupg does by itself (except for the extra hashing done by egd), does egd really give numbers that are that much more secure?  I'm wondering if it's even worth running egd, because it's something extra that I have to explain to users to get working with gnupg after installing gnupg binaries and egd's files.

I got it working (passes all tests) by using the powerpc64 assembler code.  Don't know if that's going to work for all processors, but it worked for mine (867 MHz G4 in a 12" PowerBook).  Maybe powerpc32 and powerpc64 got swapped somehow?

@_subject: New Mac GPG Administration 
Hash: SHA1
Hi, everyone.
For the past few weeks I've been trying to find a replacement administrator for the Mac GPG Project.  I'm glad to report that Alexander Nouak, our current Webmaster, translation coordinator, installer constructor, and generally all-hands person is going to become the new administrator for the project.
I'm resigning for several reasons.  Primarily, I'm burnt out.  I just don't have the motivation to do the job anymore.  After three years of dealing with the project on an almost daily basis, doing a lot of the development and coordination, I'm spent of energy for the project.
Also, my interests have changed.  I still think cryptography is interesting and important, but as I move to graduate school I'm focusing more of my time on research and less of it on producing software for end users.  The reading and writing I need to do for my research interests is a lot of fun, but also time consuming, reducing time for Mac GPG.
Finally, because of my time restraints and loss of enthusiasm, I felt that continuing on as your administrator would be a disservice to the project.  You need someone more active, and I think Alexander fills this role.  I'm confident that he will take the project in exciting I want to take a moment to thank everyone who has used the software.  It's gratifying to know that you can affect many people's lives, helping them protect their privacy and, in some cases, their lives!  I'm very appreciative of all the support I've received over the years from countless users who wrote in to say "thanks".  Well, this is my big thank you to everyone.  You guys really are the best group of users a developer could ask for.
Although I'm moving on, I'm sure this is not the last time I'll contact some of you.  Paths often converge unexpectedly and I look forward to colliding with some of you in the future.  :-)
So long, and thanks for all the crypts!

Interesting.  I'd like to see how longer passphrases like are often used with GPG hold up.  For example, I often use nonsense poetry that contains punctuation, numbers, and uncommon words to devise passphrases for GPG keys.  My own anecdotal assessments suggest that they're pretty good, but this is hardly rigorous.
