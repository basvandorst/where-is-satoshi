@_subject: 2 local user-ids, 2 distinct key pairs but only 1 user-id can sign. 
Hi list,
this is my first message here.
Firstly, thank you Werner Koch and collaborators for such a superb software.
More than an enthusiast on cryptography, I am a Brazilian citizen,
concerned with the privacy and authenticity "components" involved in
information exchange transactions (not only in digital format).
Mainly, I'm concerned with the proper degree into which privacy and
authenticity can contribute to a fair relationship between society and
Digressions left aside, I've been using GnuPG for a while both in
Linux distros and in Windows XP, without facing big issues. Until now.
Let me depict the situation.
OS: Windows XP Home SP3.
GnuPG version: 1.4.7
I have already generated a GnuPG key pair with ELG-E and DSA and
everything was working fine.
I was able then to sign files, simply with (e.g.):
(1) gpg --clearsign "myfile.txt"
by the time I generated a second key pair (again with ELG-E and DSA)
to a new, distinct "user-id", this problem took place.
Now, I want to sign some stuff with the new local user id's private
key, and I try the command (e.g.):
(2) gpg --local-user "[NEW_ID_NAME]" --clearsign "somefile.txt"
and it prompts me NOT for a passphrase, nor does it even create an
empty "asc" file.
Instead, it only returns the message:
usage: gpg [options] [filename]
So far, I can only sign files with (1), using the first private key my
GnuPG installation generated, which represents sort of a
default-and-only usable "user-id".
Is it expected? Am I missing something? Is it possible to sign files
with my second "user-id"?

Hi Erik and Charly,
thanks to you, I realized the problem was all about the argument I was
giving the "--local-user" option.
I was using the uid name (not a system account username) whereas I
should have used the key id.
Well, now it worked =)

@_subject: digital signature primary key and encryption subkey 
Hi list,
one lame confusion I'm facing now.
I was reading GnuPG's "Signing Subkey Cross-Certification" page [1],
and as a matter of fact, these two simple doubts did arise.
Suppose one provides the command:
gpg --gen-key
and chooses the default "DSA and Elgamal" option.
1st doubt:
DSA will be the basis for the primary key and Elgamal, the basis for
the encryption subkey, is this assertion correct?
if so, 2nd doubt is:
both my public and private keys will be built upon my DSA primary key
and my Elgamal encryption subkey?
That's all. Regards,

Considering a password/passphrase, which has -- by default, its

If I adjust (via --s2k-count) my GnuPG's iterations number, will it
generate and store a new sum value for my actual passphase? Or for
this passphrase specifically, it will continue working with the number
of iterations used by the time the passphrase was created?

Hi list,
when symmetrically encrypting a file, e.g.:

the command above generates a "gpg" extension encrypted AND compressed
file, is that correct?

Hi Werner,
so, focusing on key pair generation, one could state RSA keys are
built upon the product of large primes, which would put factoring as
the main problem to be solved;
whereas Elgamal keys are more complex than that, once it involves
primes under the discrete logarithms' context.
And as a conclusion, Elgamal problems would be harder to solve. Is it correct?

let me utilize this thread to clarify something.
I've never used those external devices, and my private keys have
always been one place only located, a computer.
That situation is a sort of "trade-off" for it keeps the referred keys
more protected/restricted whereas it gives me little chance of using
them in other hosts, easily.
So, I guess one of the ideas behind making use of those devices would
be the facility of taking all of my keyrings ("secring.gpg" for
example) with me everywhere, is it correct? If so, by doing that,
weren't we losing the whole point?

and perhaps, it's a good idea to own more than one of those devices.
One would be in constant use and the other(s) would mirror the former
for backup purposes. Because a small size device is easier to be
carried, and maybe this fact increases the chances of losing it or
getting it stolen.
I know its contents cannot be used by other than its legitimate owner.
Still, a coherent backup policy would include at least a second
However, considering what ?ukasz Stelmach answered to Andre Amorim:

possible to create a mirroring/"synchronization" scheme between them?

there's this guy, named Timothy Mullen who recently released this TGP
(Thor?s Godly Privacy) encryption utility for the cloud.
Timothy wrote (note that his complete text goes forwarded below):
"... I designed TGP with ?encryption for the cloud? in mind. ?That
means that not only does TGP do everything your normal PGP-type
applications do, but it does things a bit differently ? differently in
a way that can change the way you work with your encrypted data. ?At
the simplest level, this is done by encrypting data into byte arrays,
and then converting those byte arrays into Base64 encoded text wrapped
inside XML tags. ?In this way, not only do you get your typical
file-based encrypted representation of your data, but you also get
data that you can copy and paste directly into any email, mailing
list, blog-page, or social networking site..."
Have anyone tested it so far? How different can this XML wrapped byte
array encryption be? Is this cloud oriented difference only about its
XML capabilities?
He continues:
"... What I think is interesting about this is that if we choose to,
we no longer have to be the custodians of our encrypted data ? we
don?t have to worry about actually housing the files: we can just post

Maybe I'm the one who's getting crazy (and old) for not accepting this
so called "cloud" trendy paradigm driven by "megacorporations" but
that seems weird to me even if I think of combining this guy's
proposal with, say, that Diceware methodology.

requests will be limited.? For those looking to break it, I would look
at fuzzing the XML documents and the "drag and drop public XML"
parsing feature.

ask to keep it on the list so that everyone can get the full benefit
of productive security development.? ?The read-me should pretty much

TGP ? ?Thor?s Godly Privacy?
06/13/10 v1.1.06
TGP is a small yet very powerful encryption utility.? With all eyes on
?the cloud,? I decided to write an encryption application better
suited to an environment where portability and security were, at the
least, challenging.?? In cloud computing, not only is the use of file
structures becoming more abstract, but the very concept of a ?file
server? is becoming more and more ubiquitous.
As such, I designed TGP with ?encryption for the cloud? in mind.? That
means that not only does TGP do everything your normal PGP-type
applications do, but it does things a bit differently ? differently in
a way that can change the way you work with your encrypted data.? At
the simplest level, this is done by encrypting data into byte arrays,
and then converting those byte arrays into Base64 encoded text wrapped
inside XML tags.? In this way, not only do you get your typical
file-based encrypted representation of your data, but you also get
data that you can copy and paste directly into any email, mailing
list, blog-page, or social networking site.
What I think is interesting about this is that if we choose to, we no
longer have to be the custodians of our encrypted data ? we don?t have
to worry about actually housing the files: we can just post them to
the internet and let someone else assume the burden of storing the
files for us.
If I want to share encrypted files with someone or secure my own
files, all I have to do is TGP encrypt the data I want, and post it to
a mailing list somewhere.? In the case of a list like Bugtraq or Full
Disclosure, the data is actually automatically replicated out to any
number of archive sites, thus distributing my data for me.? I can
literally be anywhere in the world and just do a quick search for my
post to retrieve my data.? And since the TGP public key files are also
text representations of encrypted key data, I can do the same with my
Normally, you want to keep your private keys as safe as possible.
This is still the case with TGP.? However, it is trivial to build as
many private keys as you wish to use for anything you want to use them
for.? TGP Private Key files are password protected and individually
salted, so with a strong passphrase you have very reasonable assurance
that no one is going to get to your key any time soon.? So, you can
create a private key with a strong password, post that, and then, say,
encrypt a scan of your passport and post that.? Then if you are ever
in a pinch while travelling or something like that, you can simply use
Google or Bing to access your data wherever you are.
Of course, that?s just an example, but I think it illustrates the
power of encrypted file structures like this.? You can literally use
Facebook to post encrypted documents that you don?t have to maintain.
That?s really the main different between TGP and an application like
PGP.? That and of course, TGP is free, and personally, I think PGP is
tardware.? It?s bloated, it?s far too expensive, it?s hard to use, and
if you don?t watch your licensing, you can get screwed hard like I did
when I didn?t want to buy the extended support and one day my
encrypted drives stopped working until I paid them.? That doesn?t fly.
?TGP also doesn?t require that you are an admin to install.? However,
the .NET installer for the 4.0 client profile does ? that?s not my
doing.? Regardless, here are the file structures TGP uses:
Things that still suck about TGP
Currently TGP uses a memory stream for the destination of the AES
cryptostream.? This sucks because it makes the maximum file one can
encrypt based on available memory.? It?s not a huge deal, but it does
keep you from encrypting a gigabyte file.? I?ll be changing that soon.

Hi Daniel,
Sort of a conceptual remark at this point.
See, this database password you refer to is a symmetrical one. And you

So, is this last GnuPG encryption also symmetrical?
If so, and if your DBA is GnuPG's password keeper, GnuPG's encryption
would make little sense, considering you're concerned with "high
It would be more sensible to cease that encryption cascading
(databases's AES + GnuPG's some supposedly symmetrical algo) and let
your DBA carry somehow the AES clear text password, directly.
Check your database's documentation. Perhaps it could maintain
authentication after a failover. And chances increase in redundant
environments, if the referred system depends only on its own
encryption resources.

It seems unjustifiable because there exists an option in which secret
keys need not to take risks. And if there's any security concern and
one's to choose between zero risk and any other positive-value risk,
it's reasonable to pick the former.
No secret key can ever be intercepted or shared.
I am obviously considering signing and encrypting.
There is secrecy sharing so maintenance of this repudiability's
