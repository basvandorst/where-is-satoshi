@_subject: Error running auto-key-locate wkd in Windows 10 
I'm trying to fetch a key using wkd in Windows 10. I installed
Gpg4win[1], but when I run this command:
  gpg --auto-key-locate nodefault,wkd --locate-keys torbrowser at torproject.org
I get this error:
  gpg: error retrieving 'torbrowser at torproject.org' via WKD: Ricevuto un
  messaggio di avviso fatale   gpg: error reading key: Ricevuto un messaggio di avviso fatale
The same command works fine in Debian 10. Running the command above with
'gpg --verbose' mode wasn't helpful. I searched another key using a
specific keyserver and worked, so Gpg4win seems to work. Thoughts?
[1] Gpg4win 3.1.11 (Released: 2019-12-17)

============================== START ==============================
It was a ciphersuite change on our server, and it's fixed now.
Thanks all!
