Looking backwards (history) if there was a possibility to build in a backdoor such one
always had happened and had been exploited.
It applied and still applies for "most" of commercial IT software and hardware vendors
and even such OSS projects focused on securiry like openBSD (in the past).
Smart cards are good only for a certain level of privacy to keep rather primitive ciriminals away.
As long everyone is not able to audit the source code of firmware or operating systems
(in particular closed source software products) there are a lot of other possibilities to steal your secrets.
I didn't follow the history of the CryptoStick until now but I would like to add my "few cents" somewhere later.
An idea would be not to trust anyone and to create so called linux live images yourself.
(saving them on a read-only medium and booting from it into live mode).
Example and some description how to do it:
Due to my limited time resources all existing .iso images there are currently NOT up to date (8 months old).
It is for me a time intensive challenge to patch gnupg 2.0 or the much more interesting 2.1
to support longer keys and create .deb packages with all dependencies.
(like RSA 15k .. even they are not inside "secure" standards  .. from my "paranoid" point of view)
A little security is not real security. There always can be backdoors in the firmware (BIOS, closed source drivers etc).
Kind regards, Mark

Excellent article! Thank you.
Writing firmware I meant every piece of code "for / inside" all involved hardware components and in particular with their own controllers (eg. keyboard, USB ...) and not only the BIOS of the motherboard.
Some backdoors can be hardcoded in  the hardware of controller chips (eg. network controller etc).
Sending a special sequence of data to them can turn them in the "debug or whatever" mode.
Hacking smartcards is more complicated but possible.

@_subject: Implementation idea of CURVE25519 for gnupg 2.1 
There is GPL 3 based implementation of CURVE25519 called Pretty Curved Privacy (pcp1).
What do you think about using parts of the ppc1 source code to implement such functionality into gnupg 2.1?
Myself I like this "SCII Case Demo" video how to use this utility:
Short description (from the website):
# ---
Pretty Curved Privacy (pcp1) is a commandline utility which can be used to encrypt files. pcp1 uses eliptc curve cryptography for encryption (CURVE25519 by Dan J. Bernstein). While CURVE25519 is no worldwide accepted standard it hasn't been compromised by the NSA - which might be better, depending on your point of view.
Caution: since CURVE25519 is no accepted standard, pcp1 has to be considered as experimental software. In fact, I wrote it just to learn about the curve and see how it works.
Beside some differences it works like GNUPG. So, if you already know how to use gpg, you'll feel almost home.

Are there formal reasons why the max length of the RSA key is limited in gnupg[2] linux packages to 4096 Bits only?
One thing are the available performance and sane defaults, the other one the available security.
(without patching the source code and rebuilding packages)
The max length of the key does not have anything to do with zero-exploits.
When collecting tons of data there is only this data .. nothing else to break in.
I don't trus NIST myself and I guess most of you know why.
The question is if similar institution in Europe, Asia, Africa or Australia cen be trusted more.

Is there any possibility to create a minimal version of gnupg?

,' says Theo de Raadt on the misc@ mailing list. This is shortly after a new utility, signify , was committed into the base tree. The reason a new utility had to be written in the first place  is that gnupg is too big to fit on the floppy discs, which are still a supported installation medium for OpenBSD. Signatures are based on the Ed25519  public-key signature system from D. J. Bernstein and co., and his public domain code once again appears  in the base tree of OpenBSD, only a few weeks after some other DJB inventions made it into the nearby OpenSSH as well."/
