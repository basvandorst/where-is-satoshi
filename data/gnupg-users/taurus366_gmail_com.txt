Please specify how long the key should be valid.
          0 = key does not expire
         = key expires in n days
       w = key expires in n weeks
       m = key expires in n months
       y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0) 0
Now there's another problem.
Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? o

I'm sorry list for replying to myself but I have solve the last error.
As it can serve others, I'll explain.
1st. Updated Gemalto PC Twin Driver from Gemalto.
2nd. When I pressed "(O)kay/(Q)uit? O" I move the mouse open disks,  etc for entropy!
Which of the two actions did the trick I don't know.
Thank You.

Hi all,
I am trying to change the expiration time of 2 sub-keys with no success.
I edit the main key and with command expire I selected the uid(s) and  the result is this:
Secret key is available.

And this key continues unavailable for signing or encrypting in Mail  I can't figure what I'm doing wrong, any help is welcome.

@_subject: Changing expiration time of subkeys 
That was my mistake, I selected uid's and not the key.
I succeed to change the expiration date of the subkeys when I use the  'key 1' and 'key 2' command. Before I was using only 1,..2,...
I understand this.
This key I use in private and mostly with family.
Thank you very much.

Could it be  related to the fact that in the new macbook I have

pcsctest is fine. Werner says the Gemplus readers are buggy, they  don't support extended
