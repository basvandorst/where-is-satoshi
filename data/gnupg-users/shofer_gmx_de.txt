Dear Listers,
I am a plain user of gnupg and new to this list. SO I would like to greet you Now the problem: I found some discussions about the "invalid packet (ctb=2d)" thing but none of it helped me.
I have been running gpg with the same keys since 2003. I started to use them on SuSE 7 and Win2K. Then I moved to Debian without a problem. Now I had a disc crash recently and switched to ubuntu. When I try to import or use my old keys I get this:
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=2d)
gpg: keydb_get_keyblock failed: eof
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=2d)
gpg: /home/seb/.gnupg/pubring.gpg: copy to `/home/seb/.gnupg/pubring.gpg.tmp' failed: invalid packet

gpg:               imported: 1
[GNUPG:] IMPORT_RES 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The keys where transfered from my external HD (backup) with all the other stuff in my home directory. Some weeks ago I tried import a copy the keys I still had on a W2K machine at work. Same error.
Today I thought I will use the weekend to fix the problem. One of my guesses is that there are conflicts between my new ubuntu and the old stuff I got from my backup done on Debian Sarge?!? So I wanted to erase gpg completly and then reinstall it. But there are billions of dependencies ... What should I Thanks in advance and cheers,

Dear Listers,
I solved my problem (see at the bottom). But first the SUM of the answers I No answers, nor reactions oder hints :(
The solution was:
I had to delete the .gnupg-directory in my home directory. It seems like I copied old settings from Debian to Ubuntu taht caused the troubles.
