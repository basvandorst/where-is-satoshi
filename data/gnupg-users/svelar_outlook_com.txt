@_subject: Problem compiling gnupg on Ubuntu 14-04 
It's a problem which has come up before, but I can't find a search
engine for the archives, so I'll have to ask again.
When making gnupg-2.0.28 I get the following error message:
../../g10/gpg2: error while loading shared libraries: libgcrypt.so.20:
cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
I've seen this in various places on the net, but not yet found one with
a solution.  I'd appreciate help.
Thanks in advance.
