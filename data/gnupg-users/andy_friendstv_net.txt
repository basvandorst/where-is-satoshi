I've just installed GnuPGP and tried to make myself a new key.
When I do it gets to:
We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.
Not enough random bytes available.  Please do some other work to give
the OS a chance to collect more entropy! (Need 20 more bytes)
and then hangs. I do as it says, run a few programs, bash at the keyboard,
etc.. but it still just hangs there. I've left it for 10 minutes before
thinking something wasn't working.
I'm on FreeBSD 3.4-STABLE and using version 1.0.1
Anyone help me out here with what I've done wrong?
Can you also please CC me a copy of the email as I am not subscribed to the
