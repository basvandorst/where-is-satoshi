I'm trying to get gpg2 up & running on linux.
I've installed
I can generate key pairs and rev certs OK.
But when I try to upload/retrieve from any keyserver, I get "ERR 167772346 No keyserver available ".
Here's an attempt with keyserver == pool @ hkps://hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net
I've tried a bunch of different keyservers with always the same result.
What am I missing?

just fyi, more here @
It doesn't matter what schema+server I use.  The result's always the same so far.
