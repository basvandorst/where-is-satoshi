While I understand the response. It fails to consider the persistence of the exposed password. If it is volatile within the script issuing the commands, then the pass-phrase has considerable value as a security measure.
My problem (which relates to this) I have an ODB (OpenOffice.Org) database file which I would like encrypted. The process would be to get the pass-phrase from the user, decrypt the file, run soffice -base, and then re-encrypt the results with the same password.
