Is it possible to obtain further details on the OpenPGP card?
I have such a card and a working smartcard reader but, ideally, I'd like to
obtain copies of the sourcecode and program my own cards.  However, it's extremely difficult to
track down any specific information!
Many thanks,

I didn't.  I posted it to gnupg-users and -devel as I felt my enquiry
was equally suited to both lists.
Yup - that's exactly what I've discovered!
I agree with Werner - it is a very sad and ridiculous situation!
I shall stop being so lazy, and shall see what can be done!
Take care,

I've had a quick look at the PKCS and I think that you may have a point!
Nor me - the OpenPGP card seems to be anything but open to me!
I think MUSCLE (Movement for the Use of SmartCards in a Linux Environment
 uses PKCS - I could be wrong though, I need to read
through it in more detail.
I saw that...  Perhaps we should "fork" GPG and work on a PKCS compliant
version...  I'm fairly new to smartcards, but I have a fair bit of other
programming experience... I don't think it would be too difficult to implement with the libraries that
are available once I
get hold of a suitable card...

Seems a lot of effort and potentially risky...  Why not just use
electromagnetic radiation eavesdropping - such as TEMPEST?
