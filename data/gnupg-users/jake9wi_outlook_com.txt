The output:
gpg: malformed CRC
gpg: no signature found
gpg: the signature could not be verified.

@_subject: Key-Server Issues 
I've been getting errors when trying to get keys from a key-server.
gpg.exe --receive-keys  0x94CBAFDD30345109561835AA0B7F8B60E3EDFAE3
gpg: signature packet: hashed data too long
gpg: read_block: read error: Invalid packet
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: Total number processed: 0
If I use the web version
then it says "Error 502 bad gateway".
