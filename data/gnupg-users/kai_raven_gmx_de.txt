i have some difficulties with GPG revocations.
I have created a revocation for a test key with "gpg -o file

is it possible to fix the problem with RSA/IDEA keys when signing and
encrypting to a user in the next GPG release?
PGP 6.5.8 interprets these signatures as detached signatures and PGP 2.6.3
gives the message "Bad or missing CTB_CKE byte".
I think it's an old problem?

Hello Werner,
Now i see and the revocation was accepted by pgp5.ai.mit.edu.
It would be better to add this procedure in the documentation.
Ciao & Thanx
