I don't know, if I am right here.
I have trouble importing public keys
into GnuPG 1.0.1. GnuPG (called with "gpg --verbos --import pubkey.txt") fails with the following message:
 gpg: armor header: Version: CryptoEx OpenPGP CryptoEngine Version 2.1
 gpg: armor header: Comment: OpenPGP CryptoEngine Version 2.1
 gpg: pub  1024D/991CA19D 2000-07-10   John Testuser
 gpg: assuming bad signature due to an unknown critical bit
 gpg: key 991CA19D: invalid self-signature
 gpg: assuming bad signature due to an unknown critical bit
 gpg: key 991CA19D: invalid subkey binding
 gpg: key 991CA19D: skipped user ID 'John Testuser '
 gpg: key 991CA19D: skipped subkey
 gpg: key 991CA19D: no valid user IDs
 gpg: this may be caused by a missing self-signature
 gpg: Total number processed: 1
 gpg:           w/o user IDs: 1
To allow testing/debugging I have appended a sample key
from to this message.
The keys are 1024Bit DSA/2048Bit ElGamal keys
and were generated by CryptoEx 2.1.4,
an Exchange/Outlook plugin which claims
to be OpenPGP compatible.
The manufacturer says, CryptoEx is fully OpenPGP
compatible and it's GnuPG's problem.
As far as I have gotten to know, usually the open
community is quite correct in interpreting standards
and often the manufacturers are not.
The manufacturer refers to RFC 2440 and says, it ist GnuPG's problem.
I do not believe it. But I cannot prove it. Can you help me ???
Please send me the mail as CC, since
I am not on the list.
