@_subject: gpg-agent troubles 
1. gpg-agent ignores changed values in ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf after
SIGHUP. I have to kill/restart him ?!
2. gpg-agent ignores "ignore-cache-for-signing" in config file. I
had to set "default-cache-ttl 0"  (which is for all) ?
3. pinentry do not drag mouse(keyboard yes) even if there is no
"no-grab". With pinentry dialog open I can still work with mouse
- switch windows, copy/paste text, ... I'm not sure, if it is any
security risk, but ...
Please Help
I Use Ubuntu 10.10 - gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.10
gpg-agent cmdline:
"usr/bin/gpg-agent --daemon --sh

The option not reloaded after HUP is "default-cache-ttl".
Why not ?
Maybe would help to update man page - to get more detailed
It sounds logical. Again ... man page.
Yes - I have pinentry-gtk2 0.8.0
gpg-agent (GnuPG) 2.0.14
Thank you once again.
