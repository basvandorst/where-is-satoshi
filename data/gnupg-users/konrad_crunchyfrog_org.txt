RFC 3156 is exactly what you're looking for. The last time I had a look
at it was quite some time ago, so don't rely on anything I say here.
IIRC you have to convert your newlines to CRLFs, remove trailing
whitespace (unless you encode it) and calculate the signature over the
data and its content headers (which in your case means anything between
the MIME boundaries). There are a few gotchas so you should really have a look at the RFC.
