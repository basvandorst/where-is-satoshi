So then it looks like dmtxwrite is the issue then?

Hi David -
If I do:
paperkey --secret-key ./secring.gpg --output raw.paperkey --output-type raw
paperkey --pubring pubring.gpg --secrets raw.paperkey --output my-secret-key.gpg
It appears to create a new secret key, no complaining or anything...  What happens if you export a raw version and then import that raw version right back in again?  Forget dmtxwrite for now.

Greetings...
My google skills must not be working lately... Can anyone help point me
to the 2.0.16 binary for GnuPG / RHEL4?

Thanks Jean-David, and Breen (althoguh I never saw Breen's response on
the list).
I d/l'd the source for 2.0.16, installed the following items from source:
And it built !
Wow... thanks guys!

I am using paperkey 1.2 from and dmtxwrite version 0.7.3
libdmtx version 0.7.3
If I run this command:
gpg --export-secret-key mykey at me.com | paperkey --ignore-crc-error  --output-type raw | dmtxwrite -e8 -f png > my_pdf_file.png
I get the 2D barcode generated correctly -- if the key is 1024 or 2048.  If I try this with a secret key that is 4096, I am left with 20x20 pixel image that in no way looks complete.  I wonder if there's a limitation with either paperkey or dmtxwrite, or if I am doing something wrong.
If this isn't the right forum, please let me know...

Hi David -
Thanks for the quick reply.
I should note that I am on a Windows XP box.
When I run gpg --export-secret-key my at key.com | paperkey  --output-type raw for both the 2048 and 4096, I note that the output for the 4096 key is about 10% logner than that of the 2048 key.
I am not familiar with wc.exe, but will google it...
Paperkey doesn't care what size the key is.  Try doing that same command line, but use "wc -c" instead of the dmtxwrite part to check that the output is larger than with a 2048 bit key.  Perhaps dmtxwrite is having a problem?

Hi there -
Thanks to your help, and David's, I have tried a few other things.  Using yoru script I found that indeed it was dtmx that was failing due to the file being larger than 1555 bytes.
I deleted all of the commented lines such as this, and then ran dtmxwrite:
# Secret portions of key C8093ECE9373F385DB82D721245C4CBC467F1AE1
# Base16 data extracted Sat Mar 13 10:47:10 2010
# Created with paperkey 1.2 by David Shaw
# File format:
# a) 1 octet:  Version of the paperkey format (currently 0).
# b) 1 octet:  OpenPGP key or subkey version (currently 4)
# c) n octets: Key fingerprint (20 octets for a version 4 key or subkey)
# d) 2 octets: 16-bit big endian length of the following secret data
# e) n octets: Secret data: a partial OpenPGP secret key or subkey packet as
#              specified in RFC 4880, starting with the string-to-key usage
#              octet and continuing until the end of the packet.
# Repeat fields b through e as needed to cover all subkeys.
# That worked and it successfully generated the bar code.
I found that adding in some of the commented lines still allowed the bar code to be generated, albeit a different bar code.  What is the advantage of encoding the commented lines into the bar code?  I'll go investigate if paperkey will allow an output without the commented sections.
