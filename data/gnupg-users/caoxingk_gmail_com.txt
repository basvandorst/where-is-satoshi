@_subject: Fwd: Help, batch mode not working for --edit-key option ? 
I want to add many subkeys under a primary key,
now I can use `gpg --edit-key ` and
type addkey command blah blah... to do it manually,
then repeat these steps again and again,
until enough subkeys for current key I have.
But before it,
I use batch mode to auto-create (unattended) new primary key,
its so cool for bash script,
but batch mode seems not work for --edit-key option,
I want a unattended way to add subkeys.
I've read FAQ, man page of gpg,
source tree of doc/DETAILS,
and do so many google,
but cant help myself,
then I am here.
Thanks a lot.
