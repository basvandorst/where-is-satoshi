@_subject: HowTo: Encrypt a file for multiple recipients 
Apologies in advance if this was covered somewhere, I looked in
the FAQ, the mini HowTO, and several months of the list archive.
I have a file, foo, I want to encrypt so that several people can
decrypt it.  How is this accomplished in GPG?
I tried to put multiple NAME's after the --recipient but it did not
seem to work.
If answers are directed to me (rather than spam the list) I will
post the solution(s).
