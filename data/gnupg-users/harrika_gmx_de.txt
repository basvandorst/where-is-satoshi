@_subject: passing a recipient to gpg 
currently I am playing around with GnuPG for studying it's features and=20
Now I simply want to specify an recipient on command line using so I type=
gpg --recipient foo --sign --encrypt testfile
gpg -r foo --sign --encrypt testfile
But now gpg asks me for foo's passphrase, though foo is meant to be the=20
recipient, and ignores foo2's secret-key for signing the testfile.
Whats wrong??

for signing.
I have generated 2 key pairs: foo and foo2
gpg wants to foo to sign the testfile and also encrypts the file for foo.
How can I tell gpg to use foo2's secret-key to sign and not foo's?

Thanks Timo,
this one worked!
GPG always seems to perform a sign/encrypt.
Does one of you know how to change this order?
