Hi all,=20
I've huge difficulties (on Linux) to deal with binhex PGP data sent by
some boring customers :
% file report.pgp
report.pgp: BinHex binary text, version 4.0
...and of course :
% gpg report.pgp
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found
gpg: processing message failed: eof
I've tried to use the "macutils" package wich converts binhex :
% hexbin -U report.pgp
% file report.pgp.text=20
report.pgp.text: data
% gpg report.pgp.text
And here everything seems fines, gnupg recognizes that the file is
ciffered and which public key has been used. It also provides me the
right secrete key ID, asks me for the passphrase, says it's good, but
then fails to deciffer the file and tell me that secret key isn't
Of course I've verified that this secrete key is really available, and
that IDs provided by GnuPG before asking for the passphrase do really match
this key.=20
So I really don't understand : probably there is something missing in
the conversion but how could I could I complete it ? (if possible)
Did anyone encountered the same kind of problem ?
I don't think it's a gnupg specific problem, because I also tried with
pgp5 and get the same results : the right public and related secrete key
are identified (among 2 other one I have), passphrase is accepted, but
both PGP and gnuPG deny existence of the secrete key.

I've read it before and RTFM google/binhex/gnupg/pgp/ but found no
answer : the guy sending me binhex pgp files has a PGP key wich is full
compliant with my gnupg, and there is nothing in the FAQ speaking about
symptoms I described.
I used to have compatibility problems with PGP RSA keys, but in this
case the PGP block was explicitely refused.
Anyway ASCII doesn't pose any problem (even when they copy/paste it in
word documents...as it already happened...), so I really feel it's a Mac
binhex specific problem with wich macutils tools aren't able to deal.
I'm just trying the emil program (found in mutt/procmail tips to deal with
binhex) , I'll keep you informed if it works ...

I didn't managed to deal with emil, but it finally worked after I :
=2D - download the document on a Mac OS computer
=2D - rename it : *.pgp -> *.bin
=2D - Activate Stuffit Expander wich performs automatic mime conversion
=2D - Upload the output on my Linux -> then decryption worked fine with both
PGP and gnuPG
So I confirm it's a binhex problem, not a gnupg/PGP7 compatibility
issue...However I don't understand why unix tools performing mime and
hexbin or uudecoding conversions fail to do the same as the basic Mac
Stuffit...Anyway it's not a gnupg problem anymore, so I've to bore
another mailing list now :)
thank you

Quick solution from debian-french for people who may encounter the same
problem : binhex attachements can in fact be very easily and correctly
decoded by 'uudeview', then Mac/PGP7-Linux/GnuPG compatibility works

I just hope that mailcrypt inline features are standard....I test it on
this message, please me know if something curious appears in your
mailers  :)

 I think it's not only a verification problem and I'm guilty, as I
 forgot to define the apropriate lisp variable for mailcrypt...I hope
 it should be ok now, thanks for your feedback.
