@_subject: No secret keys after rsync 
I rsyncd my .gnupg-folder to a new computer (moving from Fedora to TrueOS). When I try to decrypt now something I get the message "no secret key available". But when I do gpg -K all my secret keys get listed and when I do gpg -k all public keys are listed. gpg is a symlink to gpg2 on that system. My old installation used gpg2. What could be the problem?

problem solved. I had a pinentry-program in my gpg-agent.conf which
doesn't exist on my new installation.

Please ignore this. I solved it already and sent the solution to the list. Sorry for the noise.
