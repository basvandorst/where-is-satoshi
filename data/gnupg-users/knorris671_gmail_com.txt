@_subject: Unable to edit card 
Hi all,
I got a CryptoStick back in November, set it up then and don't remember
password/pin I set. I reset it using back to factory defaults, now whenever
I try to change the pin (using default password) it doesn't allow me:
Your selection? 1
Error changing the PIN: Input/output error
1 - change PIN
2 - unblock PIN
3 - change Admin PIN
4 - set the Reset Code
Q - quit
 -----
Same thing happens when I try to change the name:
gpg/card> admin
Admin commands are allowed
gpg/card> name
Cardholder's surname: Norris
Cardholder's given name: Kevin
gpg: error setting Name: Card error
Anyone know why this is happening?
