@_subject: Importing gnupg secret keys into pgp 
The following workaround has served me to export secret keys created in  GnuPG (Mac GPG) MacOS X, and import them in PGP 6.5.8 or 7.0.3 (Macintosh MacOS 9.1).
- export the secret key in the Terminal, --armor.
- copy from Terminal, paste into an e-mail message Eudora for MacOS X.
- actually send the e-mail to myself.
- receive the e-mail in Eudora 5.1r Macintosh OS 9.1 (in a different - use the PGP plug-in for Eudora command "PGP Add Keys".
- when I used, as recipient, PGP 6.5.8, the keypair showed a blank field opposite Cipher, in the Key Properties. PGP 6.5.8 supports only CAST, 3DES and IDEA.
- when I used, as recipient, PGP 7.0.3, the keypair showed Cihper: AES-128.
PGP 7.0.3 supports AES CAST Twofish 3DES and IDEA.
- there was no need to change the passphrase before export. The same passphrase worked fine after import.
I have no idea whether this workaround can be accomplished in a Windows In a related topic (zeroing the passphrase): some Mac users have reported that when trying to export secret keys generated in PGP (MacOS 9.x.x), and import then into Mac PGP (GnuPG in MacOS X), an "algorithm 1 not supported.
.." message was produced. Those were *not* RSA keys with IDEA.
Zeroing the passphrase in PGP before export/import solved the problem. The passphrase was restored immediately in PGP, and entered in Mac GPG.
I had no such problems when  exporting keys created in PGP and importing them in Mac GPG.
I can now use RSA/IDEA keys, after importing the IDEA module into GnuPG.

I cannot answer your question (keyserver problem, or else), but I can add
the following information, hoping this might help:.
1. Importing your key 0x86ECAC0B with PGP 7.0.3 (Mac version):
- fp DEAB AF7A 9269 02E3 7BD1  570C 0AB2 6373 86EC AC0B
- signed with [same key] 0x86ECAC0B on April 23, 2002. This signature is
  dimmed, which in PGP's graphic convention indicates "bad or invalid
- signed with same key on April 14, 2002. Signature dimmed, same as in
- signed with same key on December 5, 2001. This signature appears to be
  valid, it shows a valid exportable signature icon.
- two subkeys:
  - valid from April 3, 2002. Expires: never. Size: 2048
  - valid from December 5, 2001. Expires: never. Size: 1024
Notes: the key is actually imported into PGP's keyring.
The key does not show the red X, which stands for "revoked" in PGP's
2. Trying to import that key using Mac GPG 1.0.6 shows:
gpg: requesting key 86ECAC0B from wwwkeys.us.pgp.net ...
gpg: key 86ECAC0B: invalid subkey binding
gpg: key 86ECAC0B: no valid user IDs
gpg: this may be caused by a missing self-signature
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:           w/o user IDs: 1
[The key was not imported into gpg's keyring]
[As indicated above, PGP shows a valid signature in that key.
3. Both imports were done at approximately the same time (less than one
minute difference), using the same keyserver.
4. In a similar case, a few days ago, a macgpg-users subscriber reported
having revoked the subkey (one and only) in his key.
Later, that key, when imported in PGP 7.0.3 (Mac) showed a red X (both in
the key row, and in the key's subkey. The red X is the mark for a revoked
The one and only self signature was dimmed.
There was no other signature in that key.
Mac GPG's output was:
gpg: requesting key FDB85841 from wwwkeys.us.pgp.net ...
gpg: key FDB85841: no valid user IDs
gpg: this may be caused by a missing self-signature
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:           w/o user IDs: 1
The key could not be imported into GPG.
I am far too lacking in formal computer science knowledge, but I have been
using PGP (Mac) since versions 2.x.x, and Mac GPG only since October 2001.
Therefore I wouldn't venture conclusions.
What I understand from the above, is that in Mr. Gaibler's example, the
key's subkey was *not* revoked, and that two "bad or invalid " signatures
were added to the key and uploaded to a keyserver. I really don't know
whether that means that these are, in fact, signatures revoked by the key
Another fact is that the key cannot be imported into gpg, precluding its
use by gpg users, but it has been imported in a PGP 7.0.3 keyring, where it
doesn't show as revoked.
Theoretically, it means that I could not use that key, in gpg, to encrypt a
message to Mr. Gaibler. I don't know whether I could use it, in PGP.
But could a message signed with that key be verified in gpg, who would only
access the key in the keyserver, and verify the signature without actually
importing the key? That's what PGP does.

You didn't specifiy what kind of key it is.
The only key I have found in the keyservers which relates to you is
0xA487766F, and it is a "Legacy" RSA key, with the IDEA algorithm.
Is that the key you are using for your tests?
Are you running a GPG system that is IDEA capable?
If you *are* running an IDEA capable gpg, and that you are *sure* your gpg
secret ring includes that RSA/IDEA secret key, there might have been a
problem when exporting it from PGP and importing it to GPG.
You could try the following:
- in PGP, change the passphrase of the secret key to a a blank passphrase.
- export the keypair (including secret key with blank passphrase)
- immediately restore the passphrase to the secret key in the PGP keyring.
- import the keypair into GPG, making sure you --allow-secret-key-import.
- immediately edit the secret key on GPG and change the passphrase from
blank to your choosen passphrase.

I have retrieved (Key ID) and search for (your name) your key, found only
There you can see that, indeed, there is no uid in sig!
In PGP, the self signature shows explicitly your full user ID, but there is
here something unusual:
The key itself was created on March 24, 2002.
The self signature was done on April 16 2002
There is another signature by 0xD67A4987, defined as "Unknown Signature",
made by CN=WEB.DE Trustcenter Voll-Zertifikate, EMAIL=trust OU=
TrustCenter CA, O=WEB.DE AG, L=D-76227 Karlsruhe, C=DE.
This would mean that when the key was created, March 24,2002, it was not
automatically self signed on the *same day*, as it usually happens when a
key is created. The self signature was done, according to PGP, much later,
on April 16, 2002.
Therefore, GPG would be right when it says:
"gpg: signature packet without keyid"
Moreover, GPG doesn't even mention the presence of a "signature unchecked
because lacking matching keys", meaning it doesn't recognize the format of
the Certificate delivered by TrustCenter Certifying Authority.
I've no experience with these kind of problems, but I have the feeling that
this particular key is either going to be impossible to use with GPG, or
will need some kind of manipulating, of which I have no clue, in order to be
accetped by GPG.
I hope other list members can help here.
PS - referring to your question about GPG returning a different key ID.
Although it didn't happen in the search I made with gpg, I have seen
keyservers returning a different key ID when searching for a "new-style" RSA
key (v4), and interpreting it as a Legacy RSA key.
I discussed the matter with the pgp-keyserver-folk people, and it
seems there is a bug in some keyservers which makes the keyserver compute
wrongly the key ID. There is a hack in 1.0.7 "refresh-add-fake-v3-keyids".
But as I said, this applied to a search for a v4 RSA key (which has a
subkey), when the keyserver "takes" it to be a Legacy RSA key, and returns a
different, fake, key ID.

The reason might be that gpg will not let you use for encryption a public
key for which gpg cannot found a trust path in your keyring.
There are options that can work around this limitation, but I wouldn't
advise to use them.
A simple, but maybe not elegant solution, is to sign *locally* those public
keys you want to encrypt to, using the private key of the keypair you
generated after installing gpg.
Signing locally means that the signature will not be exportable. But if you
know the owners of those public keys, and you are convinced that they are
the true owners (because of previous contacts, or any other mean that
satisfies you), you can sign the key *normally*, if you want.
Once signed (locally or else), those keys should be available for
encryption, and when gpg asks you to select the public key for the user you
want to email to, you can choose the appropriate public key.
I hope this helps.

The problem might be:
By default, gpg does not allow encryption to "untrusted" public keys.
I don't know about TheBat! with gpg, whether it has an option to "trust all keys".
If there is such an option in TB!, you could try signing, with your default key, the public keys of people you want to encrypt messages to.
You can sign "locally" (lsign) if you don't want your signature to be Apple Mail.app, GnuPG 1.3.6, GPGMail 1.0.2, Mac OS X 10.3.4

If a key is being used, with a passphrase known to somebody that left the company, a new key should be generated; or the same key could be used after changing the passphrase (provided you know the "old" passphrase), revoking the person's user ID, and adding whatever new user ID is required.
Better generate a new key. It will not mention the user ID of the person who left the company, and you will be able to set a completely new passphrase.
If you are using PGP, set the key you want to use for signing as the Default Key, using the graphic interface commands.
If you are using GnuPG, you should set that key as the default key in your gpg.conf file:

Hash: SHA1
The public key created with GnuPG in your linux system is, as you Please note that the subkey is 50FA58C8
Your GnuPG system in your linux box tells you that:
When encrypting to a DSA-ElGamal key, it's the subkey that is used for encryption. Therefore ID 26B23A2E should correspond to a subkey.
This does not check against previous information stating that the subkey of the public key you generated is 50FA58C8.
You cannot find 0x26B23A2E in your PGP keyring, because 0x26B23A2E is a subkey. PGP, in public key properties, displays the existence and the dates of a subkey, but not its ID. At least, this is the way it works in a Macintosh environment. I don't know whether PGP, in a Windows environment, displays subkeys IDs. I don't think it does.
Excuse my question: when you encrypted in PGP, are you sure you used 0xCC4BD445? Your PGP keyring contains such a key, as you reported; but did you use it to encrypt that test file?
As suggested by Neil Williams:
Encrypt a file using GnuPG and decrypt it using GnuPG without transferring it.

(2)     Clint Laskowski           1024 bit DSA key 373BDBAE, created: 2004-06-08
If those keys belong to you, if you can use them (you have the secret keys, you have the passphrase), and people with whom you correspond use them to encrypt to you, then you might consider keeping them, and keep on using them
Export the key blocks (public and private) from your "previous" PGP software, and import them into your current gpg keyrings. Please remember that gpg will accept key blocks with Unix line-ends only.
Yes, that would be advisable, in order to have a consistent trust set within your own keyrings.
Unless you have a compelling reason to revoke them (e.g. you suspect they have been compromised) you should keep them, provided, as already said, that you have the complete key pairs with their correspondent passphrase.
Of course, it's up to you what to do, but I believe the above pointers are consistent with PGP usage.

Hash: SHA256
 From man gpg:
"To revoke a subkey or a signature, use the --edit command."
Provided you didn't sign that key using the nrsign command, you can  still revoke your own signature.
It could look like this:
$ gpg --edit-key [key ID]
 >Command revsign [return]
You have signed these user IDs on key [key ID]:
      User name     signed by your key [signing key ID] on [signature date]
Create a revocation certificate for this signature? (y/N)
You take it from there. Eventually, you'll be requested to enter the  passphrase of the key you used for the signature you want to revoke,  a reason for the revocation, and a comment.
At the end of the process, the Terminal emulator (I am a Mac user),  or DOS prompt will show the key without your signature. Save it.
To check what you have done:
Type gpg --edit-key [key ID where you have just revoked your signature]
 >Command check [this will display the key's signatures]
there will be a line like:
rev! [your signing key ID] [signature date]  your name  *and also* a line showing your original signature.
This proves that the new keyblock contains both your original  signature and its revocation.
If the key (you signed) is already on the keyservers, you should  consider to upload the new keyblock to a keyserver too.

The only bad signature was with Eudora.
Eudora has a problem with utf-8.
This verification (with Eudora) is not, IMO, valid, and there is no

It is not the same and it does not mean the same. For the same e-mail,
gnupg indicates that the signature is bad, e.g. it does not verify (the
reason is not specified), whereas PGP 6.5.3 indicates that the signature
is good (it verifies correctly) but the key used to verify that
signature is invalid *in your keyring* because you have not validated
that key, either by signing it (even a local non-exportable signature)
and/or you have not set a trust value to it.
These kind of conflicting results (one BAD signature, one good
signature) can and do happen, the causes can be many, and different,
like the encryption software that was used to sign the incoming e-mail,
and how the verifying software "reads" the signed message. The e-mail
client very often plays an important part in this kind of problem.
I have no experience with Debian aid or with Windows (I am a Mac user),
but I have seen this kind of conflict when verifying the same email with
two different e-mail clients using different different encryption
software: e.g. Thunderbird + GnuPG will indicate a BAD signature,
whereas Mail.app with GnuPG or with PGP will indicate a good signature.
If you can post to the list how the e-mail was signed (MUA and
encryption software) and your own MUA (is it Evolution 2.2.2?), you
might get better answers.

I believe this issue has been commented upon in this forum, a couple of years ago maybe; it was about "public key algorithms 100 to 110" being 'reserved for private or experimental use'. I have tried to download key
EEE64249 from 4 different keyservers, nothing found.
As for "missing self signature", try to import the key while adding the option --allow-non-selfsigned-uid. But I don't believe this will solve the issue of algorithm 100.
I hope you get a better response from a more savvy user.

While carrying out some tests with GnuPG and the options --for-our-eyes-only and --output [filename], within the macgpg-users list, I tried to decrypt a test message composed with MacGPG (GnuPG for the Mac) 1.4.2rc2 configured with these two options.
The received message could be decrypted using GPGMail and Eudora GPG. Eudora GPG displayed, in its output 'gpg: NOTE: sender requested Using PGP 9.0.1 to decrypt that same test message, an on-screen window informed: 'Caution  The message you are decrypting is for your eyes only. It is recommended that this message only be read under the most secure circumstances.' and two buttons 'Cancel' and 'OK'.
Clicking the OK button produced a secure-viewer window with the decrypted message (and PGP testimonial) printed in tempest-resistant font.
My question to the pgp-users list is: how to set the request for the secure-viewer function for outgoing messages under PGP 9.0.1. In previous versions of PGP, the option could be enabled by marking a small square

@_subject: [PGP-USERS] Secure viewer in PGP 9.0.1 for Mac OS X - 
I have found how to do it, it requires to "force" PGP to display the  window where encryption key(s) can be selected manually to encrypt to  a recipient. That window includes two additional options that can be  set: conventional encryption, secure viewer.
In order to "force" (for lack of a better term) PGP to display that  window, one must go through the Services menu (Mac OS X), which might  be something similar to PGPtray.
The resulting message (composed with secure viewer selected) is  decrypted by PGP in the usual "visible" way, even when using the  Services menu. Moreover, when decrypting that same message with  GnuPG, the decrypted text shows but the GPG Output does not display  any mention of for-your-eyes-only.
All this requires some more testing (and some attention from PGP);  it's interesting to note that, as I reported previously, a message  composed with GnuPG, with the for-your-eyes-only and output options  enabled, is correctly decrypted by PGP 9.0.1, using the secure viewer  I have tried decrypting that secure viewer message using PGP from the  Services menu, and from the Dock, but without getting the decrypted  text to show in a secure viewer window. Only a message composed with  GnuPG and the required options gets PGP 9.0.1 to use the secure  viewer window.

According to man gpg:
In a few tests I did, using gpg 1.4.2rc2, self testing an encrypted  and signed text:
- without --output: the result is a message without text, that shows  'encrypted,signed' in its
   long headers.
- with --output [filename]: the result is an encrypted and signed  message that is processed by GnuPG as
   any other such message, without any special warnings or limitations.
The same message processed with PGP is decrypted, verified and  displayed in a "secure-view" window with
TEMPEST Attack Prevention fonts.
At the receiving end, how does GnuPG processes a message that has  been encrypted using
"--for-your-eyes-only", without --output? Where does the actual text  of the message goes? Is there such a text?

@_date: 2005-06-27 07:12:33
@_author: Charly Avital 
@_subject: "--for-your-eyes-only" 
Indeed, because 'long headers' has nothing to do with GnuPG per se, it
is a MUA viewing option that displays the 'long headers' aka 'extended
headers' of the message itself.
I pointed out that fact, because the receiving MUA (in long headers
mode) + GnuPG indicated that the message, although without text, had
been encrypted and signed.
If there is no text to be decrypted or verified, how does the receiving
GnuPG + MUA "knows" that this was an encrypted and signed message?
Then, is that combination of options, --for-your-eyes-only and --output,
meant to be used, at the receiving end, by PGP users only, and/or by
users of any other encryption software/platform that has the capability
to display the decrypted/verified text in a secure viewer form, or in
such a way that the decrypted/verified output can be viewed, but not saved?
A correction to my previous post:
when a message processed in MacGPG (GnuPG for the Mac), with those two
options, is decrypted using GnuPG (e.g. by command line) the verbose gpg
output contains a line reading:
gpg: NOTE: sender requested "for-your-eyes-only"
Is this line intended for the recipient's information only, or is there
a way the recipient can actually view the decrypted/verified text in a
secure viewer mode? I apologize if this a repetition of my previous

I may not understand what you mean by "portable".
I suppose that a secure viewer (software program) could not be nearly
ported to GnuPG?
As far as I can remember the evolution of PGP, I think (but I am not
sure) that the concept of a secure viewer is a PGP proprietary function
built-in in their software.
I shall not discuss whether TEMPEST attacks, when targeted to CRT or LCD
displays pose a real threat to encryption users (who is the targeting
agent? who are the targeted/chosen users?) because I have no expertise
or even reasonable knowledge of the technological aspects of that issue.
But if it is, in fact, a viable way to breach confidentiality, it is
possible that GnuPG could consider to include an external secure viewer
program in future developments. As a matter of fact, according to
Werner's email, some work has already been done, and is included in the CVS.

Those two versions, for the Mac, were not pure command line tools. I
have no idea what they did for Windows users.
Version 2.3 of MacPGP was the first PGP port to the Mac. Not really a
Mac application, it worked somehow with a combination of minimalistic
GUI and command line essentials. It was a good starting point for Mac
users who wanted to learn about PGP. I started with that, and I remember
it was nerve-wracking (for me at least).
Version 2.6.3x (maybe it was called FatMacPGP 2.6.3, I am not sure) was
a quantum leap (sort of): it would run on PowerPC and also on 68020 and
68030 CPUs, and behaved like a real Mac application, with many GUI
niceties (or maybe not really a GUI, but some kind of front or shell),
but also with an option to use CLI. There was a feature called something
like "allow viewing by recipient only", but I don't remember whether it
was the secure viewer with TEMPEST resistant fonts, or a warning meant
for the recipient that the decrypted message would not be saved into a
file, and would only be displayed on the recipient's computer display.
The recipient could chose to abide by the warning, or to save the
decrypted message using some specific command or option.
FLOSS = Free Libre Open Source Software.
PGP 2.x.x versions were free software (lower case, meaning free of
payment); Philip R. Zimmermann made PGP available for free (at the
beginning of PGP's career). Whether this qualifies for Free Software
(upper case), I don't know.

I have sent you directly an encrypted message, using the key you refer
to, in your message to the list.
I don't know what changes you may have done. But when I downloaded, a
few minutes ago, your key from the keyservers, it was identical to the
one that was already in my keyring. Therefore I suppose that you have
not uploaded your modified (if modified) keyblock to the keyservers.
Which means that you can always download that keyblock again.
The change I can see, from what you indicate in your message is that you
have deleted, in your keyring, the uid:
Niels Ringelmann (private email)  , where 'email' is
spelled with a lower case \e\, and set the uid:
Niels Ringelmann (Private Email)  , where 'Email' is

I can't see how this change may have affected your ability to use the

If you want the additional subkey for sign only, your choice of DSA or

A 'bad signature' can be caused by many different factors, one frequent
cause being a text wrap problem.
When a message is not only signed but encrypted+signed, the encryption
process *might* write off the cause of a bad signature.
You might try sending a signed message to the list; maybe some clue
could be found.

Hash: SHA256
I have carried out checks, tests, and research, and still cannot solve
the following problem.
I run gpg 1.4.3 on three different Macs.
All three have the same pubrings and secrings.
All three have the same gpg.conf settings.
On two of them, I have no problem using an additional signing subkey to
clear-sign with SHA256.
On the third one, whenever I try to sign in-line, with digest-algo
SHA256 enabled in gpg.conf, I get the error message "DSA keys require a
160 bit hash...". The warning shows with three different MUAs (Eudora,
Mail.app, SeaMonkey 1.0.1).
SHA1 works fine.
Does it mean that in that computer, gpg does not recognize or accept the
signing subkey, and why?
The only difference with this third computer, is that it is running OS
10.3.9, while the two other run 10.4.6. I cannot believe this is the
reason why the signing subkey is not used.
The key is the same key in the three Macs.
The "third" computer's clock shows the correct time and date, therefore
there is no possibility of gpg not recognizing a subkey that might have
been generated "in the future". I even enabled --ignore-valid-from, but
no change.
Any ideas?

Further to my previous posting, I applied the patch to a fresh copy of

The results were exactly the same as previously reported.
If you are interested and authorize me, I can send you, directly, the

Hash: SHA256
Running Thunderbird version 1.5 (20051201) + enigmail 0.94.0, Macintosh
OSX 10.4.4, GnuPG 1.4.2.
When I received Daniel's message, TB+Enigmail indicated, in a colored
strip over the message's text "click the Decrypt icon to import key" (I
don't remember the exact words).
When I clicked that icon, a message was displayed "...cannot import
revocation certificate key 9438F4F0...". Again, I don't remember the
exact words, but that was the gist of the message.
I then searched for Daniel's keys with CLI:
$ gpg -search-keys daniel (I don't have to specify the
keyserver in CLI, this is done in GPGPreferences, a feature of MacGPG,
which is the GnuPG for the Mac Project)
This produced two keys:
one created 2002-10-20
one created 2006-01-25
Both keys were valid, none contained any trace of revocation.
I then went back to Daniel's original message, clicked again the Decrypt
icon, and GnuPG[via TB+enigmail] displayed a long message the gist of
which was the successful import of the revocation certificate, and
detailing other data e.g. trust levels, etc.
Went to
$ gpg --edit-key 9438F4F0
with the following output:

@_subject: Cannot decrypt this file for the life of me 
Who encrypted the file, for whom, using what system?
Is it a text e-mail, or a stand-alone file?
If it is an encrypted text e-mail, can you post the actual encrypted
file? If not, can you URL a location where the actual file could be viewed?
I am not familiar with your system (I am a Mac user); extension .asc
applies usually to a plain text in ASCII format, that can be opened with
a text editor.
The two files you mention might be, as you indicate, your public and
secret keys (your key pair). If you open the file 'file.asc' with a text
editor, what are the headers and the footers? Is it something like:
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
If it is so, then that's your public key block, and the other one
'file_sec.asc' is your secret key block. You should be very careful with
the later, store it in a safe place, and *never* post it or publish it
in any way whatsoever.
You don't mention where those two files are located in your system. They
are your key pair (secret+public key). Do you know (can you see) the
contents of your keyring? That's where your keys are stored. Public
keys, yours and other people, are stored in the public keyring, secret
key or keys (yours only) are stored in the secret key ring.

Option 2 is better, IMO.
I don't think you can create a new uid *without* an e-mail address,
unless you present it (when going through the generation's prompts) as
something that looks like an e-mail address, e.g.
ICQ12345 of whatever you like, but
consisting of two parts separated by the at-mark (shift-2). Just a thought.

5. As you know, I am far, far from being an expert, or even
knowledgeable. But I remember from my first attempts at PGP (circa 1995
or so) similar occurrences with RSA keys (and this is an RSA keys
*without* subkeys) *showing* with two different Key IDs. Unfortunately,
I cannot document these occurrences, after such a long time.
6. PGP Desktop 9.5.3, after the key block is imported, shows a key:
- size 16834
- UID test at test.test
- Key ID 0x2D879666
- Cipher CAST
- Type: RSA
- Created: 4/7/07
- Self-signature 0x2D879666 marked with a red dot showing a white X,
suggesting that this self-signature is not valid.
I'll send you a report from the Intel Mac as soon as possible.
I'm not sure all this reporting should be posted to the list, occupying
space. If you prefer that I report OFF list, please let me know.

After reading Ludwig's post, I proceeded to import Feigl's key, using
the same procedure he followed.
You might remember that when I originally imported Feigl's key, I used
Thunderbird+Enigmail's OpenPGP option to import the key block (I
remember I expressly reported it), without having to copy+paste+save in
a stand alone file.
Now, when I import the stand alone file I created, I get the following
in Terminal:
*Therefore, there is a difference in results (Key ID and fpr) when the
keyblock is imported from Thunderbird+Enigmail (inside option), and when
the same keyblock is saved in a stand-along file that is imported via CLI*.
By the way, I also reported that PGP Desktop (where the importing is
done by drag/dropping the stand-alone file into PGP's open window)
recognized the key as 0x2D879666 (with an invalid self-signature).
I don't know why there is a difference, I am including Patrick
Brunschwig (Enigmail) in the distribution of this message.

I think you may have found the cause of the confusion (mine):
When I run Thunderbird+Enigmail, I am using gpg 2.0.3 (on an Inter Core 2 Duo Mac), not gpg 1.4.7, and the keyblock is imported by Enigmail+gpg 2.0.3.
Therefore the problem wouldn't be related to Enigmail per se, but to gpg 2.0.3.
Now, why gpg 2.0.3 would write out your key incorrectly, in such a way that gpg 1.4.7 fails to recognize it?

The most recent comments by Alexander Feigl point at the possibility
that gpg 2.0.3 is writing out the key incorrectly, in such a way that
gpg 1.4.7 does not recognize it.
Following that comment, I have already posted to the list that I am
running TB+Enigmail using gpg 2.0.3, and not gpg 1.4.7.
When I imported Alexander Feigl's large key, using the 'Decrypt' icon
(in TB 2.0.0.0 + Enigmail 0.95.0) or the OpenPGP option 'Sender's
key>Import Public Key (in TB 1.5.0.10 + Enigmail 0.94.3), I was using
gpg 2.0.3.
If indeed gpg 2.0.3 is writing out the key incorrectly, why it is doing so?
Just to remind what was happening:
- although TB+Enigmail/gpg 2.0.3 indicated that it was going to import a
key whose key ID was 2D879666, the key that was imported had the key ID
- gpg --edit-key 2D879666 did not find such a key.
- gpg --edit-key 17CACAE3 found a key that showed a self signature made
  with 2D879666
- but when the key block was imported through CLI as a copy/paste/saved
  file (i.e. *not* via TB+Enigmail/gpg 2.0.3), the imported key was
  2D879666, without any mention of 17CACAE3.

[ unknown] (1). Richard Stoddard shows that the primary key, the one you use for signing, is 1024 bits,
and as far as I can remember, one needs at least 2048 bits.
But the good news (I think) is that it is a DSA key, and if you are
running gpg 1.4.*, you could enable the following two options in your
gpg.conf file:
digest-algo     SHA256 (if you want to use SHA256)
For this, you have to edit the contents of your gpg.conf file.
I understand you are using GPG Keychain Access. Open its Preferences...,
that are also accessible from the Apple Menu/System Preferences/GnuPG icon.
Click the + round button at the bottom of the GnuPG window, and add:
enable-dsa2, hit Return.
Click again the same button, and add, in two fields:
digest-algo       and to the value field (at the right of the previous
field:  SHA256.
Hit Return
You can also, in that same GnuPG (System Preferences) window, go to
'Expert', hit the 'Reveal in Finder' button, that will make visible and
graphically accessible the contents of /.gnupg (the gpg home directory).
Click the gpg.conf file, open it with a text editor (you have TextEdit
in your operating system) and add the two separate lines:
digest-algo SHA256
By the way, you will see in the contents of that gpg.conf many lines
that are preceded by  which means that whatever follows # is not
enabled, only "commented".
Hope this is not too confusing...
Your signature verifies fine.

What I did before --enable-dsa2 was available, was to add a subkey (RSA)
with a value of at least 2048, and *select* the 'signing subkey' option.
Thus I had an additional subkey that I use use for signing with SHA256
(after enabling digest-algo SHA256).
I don't believe you can change the value of the primary key you have
already generated. If you want to keep on using it (it's already on the
keyservers), maybe you could do as I did, add a signing subkey:
gpg --edit key (your Key ID)
Command> addkey     (this is the command to add a subkey), and proceed
with the interactive dialogue: signing subkey, size etc...
There's another "thing" when you add a signing subkey to an existing
key. You should cross-certify your new subkey (equivalent of signing the
subkey, in order to validate it). You can use 'cross-certify' in the
interactive dialogue that follows --edit-key. I am not sure you can do
everything in one single operation. If, after creating the signing subkey,
Command> cross-certify does not work, you'd better save the key with its
additional subkey, and only then invoke it again with
gpg --edit-key [key ID] and proceed with
Command> cross-certify
When you have saved all the changes, you should upload the updated key
to the key servers.
Another possibility:
after enabling 'enable-dsa2', creating a DSA key with a primary key
whose value is 2048, enabling digest-algo SHA256, and testing that you
can actually sign a test message with SHA256, you can revoke the former
key, upload the revocation certificate to the servers, and upload your
new key to the servers.

There is a most inelegant way to warn the folks worldwide that your

Your e-mail is the first one I have received from the list's server

There was no problem downloading and opening it, and verifying its

Are you running some kind of firewall or  network monitoring software

There's something that I can't remember now, related to gpg stalling

it is applicable here.

@_subject: GnuPG, Thunderbird, and Armor Headers From PGP 9.5 
I am a Mac registered user of PGP 9.5.2, and I have just made some
googling on the issue you raise.
I have seen examples of similar PGP headers, originated only by freeware
versions of PGP Desktop (as far back as versions 7.*), where the header
Version: PGPfreeware 7.0.3 for non-commercial use Version: PGP 8.0.3 - not licensed for commercial use: comes in one single line.
I am aware that in your example, that header is longer because of the
'(Build.....) mention.
I correspond with a friend who uses a licensed PGP 9.5.2, where that
header is also shorter than the one you mention.
As far as I can remember there's an excellent list that addresses PGP
issues named PGP-Basics:
 where subscribers
and moderators are always ready to help.
You can also try PGP's CTO Jon Callas , who's usually ready
to help with PGP issues.
Good luck

I *believe*, but I am not sure, that you could have revoked *only* the
subkey, and generated a new subkey in its stead. That would have kept
your primary key "alive", with a new subkey, hopefully valid for
encryption to you.
I might be wrong, but I believe that in the present situation,
generating a new E subkey will not resuscitate your primary key.
I hope you get more definite opinions from other forum subscribers.

Apparently the "last" GnuPG version for 10.3.9 is 1.4.1. For better or

I also have a G3 iMac, running 10.3.9, works fine.

Not that busy, let's try to sort out this issue.
You are right, that's what the HOWTO indicates:
This document describes how to build GnuPG on Mac OS X 10.2+.
Please keep in mind that you need to have XCode 2.21 or the latest Developer
Tools with gcc 4.0.1 or later as well as the BSD Subsystem installed. Check
this by typing 'gcc -v' into the Terminal.
I am not sure what happened here; maybe, and I wish to stress 'maybe' an
editing error when updating Gordon Worley's instructions.
The facts are as follows:
1. On this iMac running OS 10.3.9, I have:
Xcode 1.5, and gcc (GCC) 3.3 20030304 (Apple Computer, Inc. build 1666)
As I informed in a previous e-mail, I have compiled GnuPG 1.4.7 on this
computer, without any problem.
I have included Mr. Alexander Nouak in the distribution of this answer,
hoping he will be able to clarify this matter. I know Mr. Nouak will get
this message also via macgpg-users, and I apologize for this double posting.

This does not mean that you wouldn't get feedback on this list

@_subject: Newbie GnuPG under Windows XP Pro - Redux 
Thanks John,
In MacOSX or in Ubuntu, I know how to open and edit ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf,
where gpg.conf is a text file where from gpg reads its options. I have
done it many times, when required.
But in Windows, there's something called gpg.conf.exe, which to my still
much limited knowledge of Windows, is an executable file, and I have no
idea how to actually open it. Sorry for the basic ignorance.
No I don't use it. But it's still annoying to have this warning show up.
I would gladly do that, if I only could comment or delete the
load-extension line about the wrapper (which should be required, I
believe, for the use of smart cards?)
Well, sometime I'd like to try, if I could only comprehend how cli works
in Windows. Even with a very limited knowledge of Unix, I can manage
with cli in MacOSX or Ubuntu, but in Windows almost everything I try
comes out with 'not known' or a similar output.
Well, gnupg-users is not the appropriate forum for this kind of queries.
I am not really a Windows user, nor intend to be. I believe I have
already indicated in a previous post that I am running Windows XP Pro,
or Ubuntu under a virtualisation program named Parallels Mac, that
interacts between Windows or Linux (or for that matter, some other OSs
too) and my Intel based computer processor.

In the pursuit of complicating my life with some fun, I have installed
Linux Ubuntu 7.04 under Parallels 3.0 Mac build 5160 (in addition to
Windows XP Pro). The current release of Ubuntu, 7.10 is not [yet]
digested by Parallels, but eventually it will.
Ubuntu 7.04 distribution came with GnuPG 1.4.6 already installed.
After much searching and installing I finally got:
- compiled 1.4.7 from source after installing 'build-essential', because
the C compiler that came with that Ubuntu release was not suitable, by
itself, to compile gnupg. - installed GPA and KGpg
- imported my keyrings from gnupg/MacOS 10.4.10 (Leopard is still
wandering in the jungle on its to my home), and reset the trust.
My question, please help: where, how can I find and open, actually open
and edit as required, gpg.conf? A ls search in .gnupg lists 'options'. I
remember that gnupg.options was the ancestor of gpg.conf (probably
before gnupg 1.2.*).
Sorry if the question seems [is] silly, but I have a block. I have tried
to use pico (nano), but I don't seem to strike the right commands.

To use gpg to decrypt such messages, it all depends on what MUA and

I am not familiar with that mailer. Does it have a plug-in that enables

I believe there is something called PGP Tray (or similar) that night
enable you to process messages with GnuPG in your mailer's message window.
A Google search with Yahoomail Web GnuPG brought up a number of links
that you can check at:
Check according to your operating system.
I use, here, Thunderbird+Enigmail. Enigmail enables Thunderbird to
interact with GnuPG. When I receive a message from the person who uses
PGP 9.8.1, Thunderbird+Enigmail processes it as any other encrypted,
signed, or signed and encrypted message; I use either icons in the tool

Hi Chris,
The raw source of your e-mail indicates that you are using KMail.
If that's correct, I'll guess that you are running Linux.
I am a Macintosh user, but run Ubuntu 7.10 under virtual-ware Parallels 3.0.
I have compiled 2.0.9 under Ubuntu, upgrading from 2.0.7, and then 2.0.8.
GPG2 requires that certain libraries be installed, before gpg2 can
actually be compiled and installed.
The README file included in the expanded source code of 2.0.9 should
indicate exactly which libraries should be compiled and installed, and
in what order.
In addition to the libraries that you have indicated above, there is
also the issue of gettext. I believe that if you have already a gettext
version that is above 0.14, you are safe. Type in Terminal
gettext --version, and you'll know.
All the above is "the fruit" of my empirical knowledge. I have a very
basic, limited and unprofessional grasp of all these matters.
If you really want to install gpg2 in your Linux environment, just arm
yourself with patience, and be ready that in spite of your having
compiled and installed everything that is required, you  *might* still
get some error-warning that you still need some other library, or a more
recent version of one of the installed libraries.

?You should be asked to type the passphrase IF the secret key of your

Kgpg (if you are using it) should display an icon showing two keys, at

2. IF 'use-agent' is enabled, but for some reason gpg-agent it is not

why your systems claims that the secret key is not available.

Maybe you could find some information in user specific files. From Enigmail help pages:
     * The settings are stored in an XML file in your profile folder called pgprules.xml.
       If you delete your profile for any reason, you should be sure to back this file up along with your mail, user.js, etc.
I believe you can do it, there's a button for that. I suppose that the next time you want to send an e-mail to any of the recipients, whose rule has been deleted, Enigmail will prompt you to set a rule, unless you disable the automatic creation of per recipient rules, in OpenPGP Preferences > Key Selection (see further)
  ...I am
Good move, but I believe that trimming Thunderbird's Inbox to zero entries might improve Thunderbird's performance, by saving indexing time.
If it was possible to disable the function 'automatically download keys for signature verification' that would be a good thing. I haven't found the ways to do it, maybe in pgprules.xml.
Alternatively, it is possible to disable OpenPGP>Automatically Decrypt/Verify Messages. I suggested, some time ago, to condition this rule to be "Automatically Decrypt/Verify Messages, *unless already read*.
Maybe you could also use the following (from Enigmail Help)
Tips and Tricks
If you wish to send a mail to somebody for whom you don't have a rule, and you wish to manually turn on signing, encryption, or PGP/MIME, it will be overridden by the settings in the Enigmail > Preferences > OpenPGP Security tab and the Per-Recipient Rules, and the message will be sent in plain text.
To get around this, add a new rule.
     * In the Set OpenPGP Rules for field enter @
     * Set Apply rule if recipient to Contains
     * Set Continue with the next rule for the matching address
     * Do not add any keys
     * Set Signing, Encryption, and PGP/MIME to Yes, if selected in message
     * Save the rule and ensure that it is at the bottom of the list of I am not sure I helped.

Welcome back.
I remember having had that kind of problem.
Please point your browser to:
All I can understand is that gpg started a process that it couldn't complete, and/or crashed. I very vaguely remember that the crash was due to a missing hash SHA224 (H11); but don't take me to my word, launch Terminal and type gpg -v --version, and see what you get.
The crash, or whatever it was resulted in the creation in ~/.gnupg of a file named secring.gpg.lock or trustdb.gpg.lock, any file with the extension .....gpg.lock. Remove that file, it should solve the problem.
By the way, an unrelated question: how did you install 1.4.8? Compiled src, or used the binary installer available at MacOSX 10.5.1

As far as I am concerned, that's  what I got from the keyserver I used, I believe  posted that:
"I'm not too deep into subkeys, but I just downloaded your key 0x8443620A from a keyserver and it had tow subkeys 0x070E0B73 and 0x7D57ED51 both valid till 1.1.2010.
But the self-signs on all the different Sub-IDs are expired on 5.1.2008.
All this didn't change when I imported the key from So my hint is to sign all the IDs too."
Thank you for telling me what I should not, I know the protocol.
There is such a thing named 'local sign', that makes a local signature non-exportable, not that I intend to upload your key, that just isn't done.
As I indicated in my complete post, I signed (local signature) just in order to find out whether it would make the interrogation point on your *second* "photo" go away, which it didn't, not unexpectedly.

That's not the key used to sign your message.
If you want recipients of your signed e-mails to be able to verify your

send your key directly and exclusively to your selected correspondents.
In the present case, this is a mailing list, so either you upload you

Hash: SHA256
After compiling and installing GnuPG 2.0.9, overwriting an existing
2.0.8, the pinentry window that shows (when required) is slightly
defective: the last text line shows only its upper part half, *as if*
the whole pinentry window had "shrunk".
This didn't happen when I compiled and installed 2.0.8 over 2.0.7.
It is only a graphical thing, the functioning of gpg-agent itself has
not been affected.
I am using a pinentry designed by Benjamin Donnachie for use in a Mac
environment, that has always performed impeccably till now.
I have replaced the existing pinentry with a fresh copy, it is a Mac
application, that is called by gpg-agent by a link in the the latter's
gpg-agent-conf. This didn't help.
Maybe this specific pinentry needs to be re-written, but I would to
know, as I asked above, whether there might something different in gpg
2.0.8's code that might affect pinentry *graphically*.

Thawte's certificates can be used both for signing and for encrypting,
using S/MIME, and they are not at all like gpg keys.
Your correspondent also must be using S/MIME to be able to verify your
signature, and to decrypt/encrypt using those certificates.
gpg 2.* is S/MIME compliant.
You should be able to import into Thunderbird the e-mail certificate
that was issued to you by Thawte: go to Account Settings/Security, and
try to use the available options.

I don't know which Thunderbird and Enigmail versions you are using, but
this should help (I am using the Macintosh version, but there shouldn't
be significant differences if you are using another platform):
If you want to use the key you have generated to sign outgoing messages,
and to self-encrypt, please select 'Account Settings" from your Menu
This will display a page where your account(s) are listed.
Select "OpenPGP Security", and input the options you want to use, first
of all 'Enable OpenPGP support (Enigmail) for this identity'
Select 'Use specific OpenPGP key ID (0x1234ABCD):
Click the button 'Select Key...' located at the right end of the empty
field. This will launch a window 'Select OpenPGP Key for Encryption.
Select (highlight) the row where your key is listed, go to the bottom of
the window, and click OK.
This will bring you back to the previous window, where your account(s)
is listed, but now the previously empty field will show the key ID of
your selected key, beginning with 0x (that's zero x).
Select other options you want to save, e.g.:
'Sign non-encrypted messages by Default'  IF you want to sign ALL your
outgoing messages.
'Sign encrypted messages by default', that's a good idea...
'Encrypt messages by default', NOT a good idea, since you will be
posting messages to lists, and you don't post encrypted messages to a
list (unless it is a special list where all postings are encrypted with
a shared public key). gnupg-users is NOT such a list.
'Use PGP/MIME by default', not a good idea, keep the choice to yourself.
Click 'Advanced', this will display another window where you can select
options for 'Send OpenPGP Header'
'Send OpenPGP Key ID' if you want your Key ID to be included in the
headers of the messages you send.
'Send URL for key retrieval: an empty field where you can enter the URL
where from your public key can be downloaded.
'Attach public key to signed or encrypted messages'. If you select that
option, *every time* you send a signed message to a list, your public
key will be attached, and that's a little too much, you can choose to
attach your public key manually in OpenPGP Preferences.
Click the OK button, you will be brought back to the previous window,
click the OK button, and you are set.
By the way, you choose to erase, in your message, the Key ID of your
public key, and that's your privilege. But if you are going to send
signed messages to people, you might want your recipients to be able to
verify your signature, and they need your public key.
You can choose to upload your public key (it is a *public* key) to a key
server, where from it will propagate to other keyservers, allowing your
correspondents to download your key when needed.
Last, but not least, since you are going to use Thunderbird+Enigmail, I
suggest that you subscribe to the Enigmail mailing list, visit
Enigmail's site  and
Best of luck,

there does seem to be such an option as --check-options.
There are such options as:
--import-options, --export-options, --list-options, --keyserver-options,
and a few more; all of them have to be defined by a value, e.g.
--list-options no-show-photos (do not show photos when listing keys
included in a user's keyserver), and so on.
Whereas the --check option is always (or usually) composed as
--check-sigs, --check-trustdb, etc.
--check-options as a inclusive option followed by a defining value is
invalid (I believe ung?ltige means invalid).
So maybe you'd be better erase (or comment) --check-options in your
gpg.conf file.

In my unlearned opinion, you can only add data to a keyserver, not
remove anything from it.
You can delete something from you key, upload the updated keyblock to a
keyserver; the latter will sync with other keyservers where your key has
retained all its original data, which will be restored.
If you revoke an UID in your key, and upload the updated keyblock to a
keyserver, the revocation is considered a data addition (which it is).
The revoked UID will show as revoked in all syncing keyservers.
But then, that's my unlearned opinion.

This happens because your command line indicated as argument your e-mail

by the last eight digits of the key's fingerprint.
As indicated above, you can use also the whole fingerprint.

Hi Steven,
that is the structure that I can see when I chose View/Message source.
I believe that's the way Windows Outlook Express (paired with some
crypto module that is installed by the GnuPG4Win installer, for all I
know) processes OpenPGP/MIME messages.
If you friend is willing to use e.g. Thunderbird, he will get a
completely different rendering of an incoming OpenPGP/MIME e-mail.
This is neither GnuPG nor gpg2 related.
Take care,

I can "bear testimony" to running Ubuntu 8.10-64bits under VMware
Fusion, on an Apple MacBook Intel Core 2 Duo.
The original distro (downloaded disk image) came with gpg 1.4.7 or 1.4.8
(I can't remember) which I updated to 1.4.9 by compiling the source
code. I also compiled gpg 2.0.10rc1 and later 2.0.10 (with gpg-agent and
pinentry). All run fine.
GnuPG, whether gpg or gpg2 interacts very well with
Thunderbird+Enigmail, thanks to the work of the Enigmail team. I have
found that it is easier to install Thunderbird using Ubuntuzilla
but it's all a matter of user's choice.

@_subject: Dan Brown - Digital Fortress book 
I read it years ago. I believe it's the worst book ever written by Dan
Some excerpts from: . I
believe the following list of Mr. Brown's errors (or delusions) is not
exclusive, to say the least.
Still, it's my opinion, only.
"Although the book's website cites reviews lauding Digital Fortress for
being extremely realistic, the book contains a number of technical
errors and misunderstandings in computers, math and technology.
    * Brown mentions a Hungarian mathematician, Josef Harne, who in 1987
proposed an encryption algorithm that, in addition to encrypting,
shifted decrypted cleartext over a time variant. However, neither Harne
nor the concept of rotating-cleartext ever existed.[1]
    * Brown says the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki was fueled by the
uranium isotope U-238. The Fat Man bomb dropped on Nagasaki was fueled
by plutonium 239, and U-238 is not an easily fissionable isotope of
uranium (needing a fusion reaction to initiate fission in the U-238).
    * Brown also inaccurately portrays the leadership of the NSA. As
part of the Department of Defense, the NSA director - by law - must be a
three-star Lieutenant General or Vice Admiral.
    * Brown confuses bits with bytes, describing a 64bit string as
containing 64 alphanumeric characters. In fact it would be just 8
assuming the most basic 8bit character encoding, each character being a
byte or 8 bits.
    * Brown suggests that TRANSLTR, a machine capable of breaking a
64bit key in 10 minutes would take just an hour to break a 10,000 bit
key. This is a gross misunderstanding of the relationship between key
lengths and the time required to brute force them. Such a machine would
take over 80,000 years to break a 96-bit key and over 350,000 billion
years (nearly 30,000 times the current age of the universe) to break a
128-bit key. The number of years it would take to break a 10,000 bit key
isn't even practical to write down - it has 2,987 digits.
    * Brown repeatedly confuses storage or processing of data with
execution. For example, TRANSLTR is threatened because it has tried to
crack Digital Fortress, which is actually a virus, and the database is
similarly threatened because Digital Fortress is sent to it by TRANSLTR.
Databases and password crackers do not execute the information presented
to them, so it wouldn't matter that Digital Fortress contains harmful
    * Characters who are supposedly experts in cryptography seem to
think there is no such thing as an unbreakable encryption scheme. See
one-time pad."

What I don't do is use the option offered by some systems that enable
the user to "save" the passphrase for a certain duration. Such saving
writes the passphrase to disk, not a good move.
I use GPG2 with gpg-agent.
gpg-agent does not save the passphrase, it caches it (encrypted) for a
period of time set by the user.
I tried to find your public on three or four separate servers, no luck.

Is key (1) the new one you generated after deleting (in your keyring)
the previous two keys whose passphrase you had forgotten? Is this the

Is key (2) valid, or have you deleted it (in your keyring)?
Since you are using GPGPreferences, please go to System
Preferences/GnuPG, click on the last bezel 'Expert'. This will display,
in graphical form, the contents of your gpg.conf file.
Please check whether 'rfc 3156' is enabled (the small square button at
the left of rfc 3156 is marked.
If it is, please unmark it.
If you have already an option named simply 'gnupg', and the small square
button is not marked, please mark it.
If not, please add a new option, name it gnupg and enable it (use the
square with the plus + sign at the bottom of the window.
Please check what 'digest-also' you are using.
If your key is 339FBBAE, I suggest you use SHA256, since that key is a
DSA2 key, and it will enable you to use SHA256.
Errors that mention 'algorithm 11' usually refer to algorithm H11
(SHA224), and *there might be* (I am not sure) some kind of problem
between hash algorithm SHA224 and RFC 3156 (related to OpenPGP MIME).
Again I insist: I am not sure about this SHA224 issue, but I remember
that a few years ago, it created problems. But that was some time ago,
and there shouldn't be any problems now.

OpenPGP/MIME is set by default when sending a message with an  attachment, or a multi-part message (e.g. HTML format).

@_subject: Why do people send email with an attached public key? 
The question about detached signatures (PGP/MIME) has been asked before
in this forum, and in many others that deal with crypto.
First, to answer the question in the subject of your message (BTW, it's
better to avoid inserting questions in an e-mail's subject, just state
the subject):
Attaching the sender's public key to an e-mail is not the same as
signing the e-mail with a detached signature (PGP/MIME). Attaching the
sender's key can be a courtesy to spare recipients the task of searching
for the sender's public key.
Some MUAs will offer you the possibility of either signing both the
e-mail and the attached public key in one single "encapsulated" message,
 and that will force PGP/MIME, or to sign the e-mail only, and not the
attached public key.
Other MUAs will automatically force PGP/MIME when the e-mail has an
As to the pro and cons, I'll refer you to David Shaw's post to this list:
There are surely many other posts on the same topic.
Not all MUAs are PGP/MIME compliant.
If your mailing list strips all attachments, that's an additional problem.

@_subject: unusable public key? 
Please try the command:
gpg --edit-key [Key ID].
1. If the output shows the letter D appended to the key length, and an
item like 'usage: SC', then this is a DSA key that can be used only for
signing and certifying, but not for encryption, and the only remedy I
can think of is that you ask your business partner to supply you with a
key that can be used for encryption.
2. If the output shows the letter R appended to the key length, then it
might be a "Legacy" RSA key, that needs the IDEA cipher to be included
and available in your crypto system.
IDEA is (or used to be) a licensed cipher, therefore you might want to
clarify this issue before you set your system to include IDEA.
3. Other possibilities: the key has been revoked by its owner, but that
information should show in the --edit-key output.
I hope this is not too confusing.

@_subject: Problem with the agent, gpg2 
I can only guess that gpg-agent has not been properly installed, in
spite of your successful compilation and installation.
Is gpg-agent pointing to the right pinentry program?  It probably
defaulted to one under /usr/local/ but I suspect that yours lives
under /usr/ - edit ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf as appropriate and restart
A work around (not the orthodox solution I'm afraid) would be to enter
in ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf a line that should point to the real location
of pinentry in your system.
Something like:
pinentry-program "path to pinentry"

@_subject: Problem with the agent, gpg2 
GnuPG 1.* (currently 1.4.10)  does not need pinentry.
pinentry is the interface used by gpg-agent to enter the pin (or the
passphrase), that will be cached (not written to disk) by gpg-agent.
Your query related to gpg 2.0.12 that you had compiled under Linux, but
that didn't work.

Hi David,
IMO, the problems resides with your installation of gnupg2 via Darwin Ports.
Darwin Ports installs a version of pinentry (required for gpg-agent to
function) that is not compatible with MacOSX.
If you want to install a functioning gnupg2 for MacOSX, with a Mac
native pinentry.app, you might want to try MacGPG2 2.0.12
that can be downloaded from:
That should be the problem.
Please see above.
Ditto, Darwin Ports does not install gpg-agent with the required
pinentry that will function under MacOSX

I don't remember whether using the MacGPG2 2.0.12 installer will simply
overwrite your Darwin Ports installation.
If it does, you will have a working MacGPG2 2.0.12, complete with
gpg-agent and Mac native pinentry.app.
If it doesn't, you might still have some problems with the remnants of
the previous install.

@_subject: verification/installation 
Hi Alejandro,
I am a little confused by your assertion that "gpg 1.4.7 came with Mac
OS X". GnuPG software is not included in any way in the MacOS X releases.
One has to to actually download the software and either compile it, or
download a binary installer, and install it.
Not found in your public keyring, or not found at all?
In my Terminal:
$ gpg --verify gnupg-2.0.13.tar.bz2.sig gnupg-2.0.13.tar.bz2
gpg: Signature made Fri Sep  4 12:35:03 2009 EDT using RSA key ID 1CE0C630
gpg: Good signature from "Werner Koch (dist sig) "
When the key you are searching for, with the command search-key and not
recv-key is found in a keyserver (following your CLI in Terminal), the
Terminal output will display the key information and offer the option to
import it. Once you have imported it into your public keyring, you will
be able to verify the signature. When using the command recv-key, the
key (if found on the keyserver you are using) will be automatically
downloaded and imported into your public keyring.
By the way, if you intend to compile gnupg-2.0.13 in MacOSX, you will
not, I'm afraid, succeed to have a working gpg2 2.0.13 unless you also
download and install the libraries required by gpg2. Even then, the
resulting installation will not "work" because you need to install
gpg-agent and pinentry that are compatible with MacOSX environment.
A binary installer for MacGPG2 2.0.12 is available for download from the
MacGPG2 project at
I believe a similar installer for MacGPG2 2.0.13 is in the making by Ben
Donnachie, manager and maintainer of the project.
MacGPG2 is a project separate from MacGPG Best regards,

This is a good approach, although it might "taint" the key. Users
wouldn't know why signers have revoked their signature, unless they care

They would certify your new key only if they abide by the rules. I
wouldn't sign a key because of a key transition document. I would have
to contact directly, and better, personally, the owner of the "old" key,
of the transition document, and of the new key.
To sum it up (as far as I am concerned, and to avoid further bandwidth

No problems with the keys per se, but I am referring here to the 'etc?'

GnuPG 2.0.14 will require the configuration and use of gpg-agent, that
will cache (without writing it to disk) the passphrase of your secret key.
Thus, for the value you'll set to gpg-agent's cache, you will not have
to type your passphrase, after you have typed it once for decrypting,
and once for signing.

I am running Gpg4win 2.0.4 on a desktop Acer Inspire, under Windows 7
Home Premium 64bits.
For test only. I am a Macintosh user, the Acer (incredible machine) is a
present from the family.
Outlook (Office 2007) recognizes gpg 2.0.14, but the interaction, IMO,
is unreliable.
For an example, Outlook strips in-line signed messages of what it calls
"extra line-returns" (?), therefore invalidating the signature.
Encrypted and signed messages are processed correctly.
I have still to text interaction with Thunderbird+Enigmail.
I am far, far from being an IT person. I am just an empirical end-user
Generally speaking, if you want to use *also* HTML emails with
encryption, you are headed for trouble, but that's your choice.

Did you actually skip that option?
Here, if everything is working correctly, you should have the pinentry

small square that, if unmarked, will enable you to actually see what you
are typing).
Once this down, a similar pinentry window where you are requested to
type the passphrase again, for confirmation.
Did you check whether gpg-agent is running and available?
In Terminal
gpg-agent [return]

I generated a new key pair (that I don't intend to upload to any key

As far as I know, Windows uses line-ends that are different from the

When you use TextWrangler to open Windows encrypted files, have you
tried to save them using the option Mac line-ends, and then decrypt them
with MacOSX? I am not referring to the use of GPGServices.
Without using GPGServices, have you been able to decrypt MacOSX

in the avalanche of news about the [recently] late Osama Bin Laden, I
noticed a small item: the area where he was caught had been *also*
defined/pinpointed by the lack of cellular phone communications.
Go figure.

I heard later on about no internet access and burning trash. I also read
that the compound was located in a densely populated, almost urban area.
Maybe someone will learn from all this (if all this is genuine) that too
much isolation will make you stand out.
An an aside, and this is really off-topic, burning trash instead of
putting out for pickup is a standard and careful procedure in areas
where garbage pick up is not an alternative reliably available. To say
the least.

The user insightfulmac who originated the request in the gnupg-users list (How to open Windows
GPG encrypted files on MacOSX), solved his problem using TextWrangler:
I personally prefer BBEdit, but TextWrangler (released by the same
software house) can also solve the issue of converting line ends, that
was the problem of insightfulmac .

You can try this, but I don't know how to integrate it into your

gpg: Go ahead and type your message ...
- copy/page the encrypted message. If it was encrypted to your public
key, your will be prompted to enter your passphrase. After you enter it,
the output will display to which user IDs and public keys the message
was encrypted, like:
You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for

Did you mean (copy-paste from the man page):
GnuPG  normally  does  not select and use subkeys created in the
future.  This option allows  the use  of  such  keys  and  thus
exhibits the pre-1.0.7 behaviour. You should not use this option unless
you there is some clock problem. See also --ignore-time-conflict for
timestamp issues with signatures.

That's normal.
You are verifying your friend's signature with the new public key he
created and that you imported.
Your friend is verifying your signature with your public key that is
valid and in use.
When your friend encrypts a message to you, he is using your existing
public key. This has nothing to do with your friend's new key.
I can't remember how KMail sets the usage of keys. I'm a Mac user, but I
have "dabbled" occasionally in Linux and some of KMail.
In Thunderbird, key usage is set in 'Per Recipient rules', that is not
the Address Book.
You don't have to remove his "old" public key from your keyring.
You have to edit "Per Recipient Rules" so that your friend's new public
key (in your public keyring) is linked to his User ID (e-mail address),
and used to encrypt to him.
In Thunderbird's menu please go to OpenPGP/Edit Per-Recipient Rules,
that will launch the "Per-Recipient Rules Editor". Use the search field
to search for the entry that corresponds to your friend's user ID (his
e-mail address) or choose it manually at your convenience, click
'Modify' and make the necessary adjustments to choose your friend's new
public key as the key that will be used to encrypt to him.

User-Agent: KMail/1.13.7 (Linux/2.6.35.13-91.fc14.i686.PAE; KDE/4.6.3;

It seems that this combination is part of the Linux distro you are running.
You might update to Enigmail 1.6 by downloading the appropriate release
from  and proceed according
to the instructions.
I think your query might be best answered in Enigmail User's list.

@_subject: Decryption problem - Large .png file 
I have received from a friend a very large file in txt. that I have been
so far unable to decrypt:
[serial number].png.asc.txt. Size is 36.1 MB and it is supposed to be
the encryption of a 600 DPI color file.
Sender is running GnuPG v1.4.12 (GNU/Linux).
Because of the size of the file, sender has used Dropbox, and I received
it via my Dropbox.
I have tried to decrypt it using Terminal/CLI, with -d and -a options.
The output was gibberish, with bell sounds now and then.
After typing in Terminal gpg [return], I get the prompt "go ahead and
type your message". I copied/pasted the ASCII text, and at the end I
got: "gpg: CRC error; E9433F - B65688", instead of the expected
information about the keys the file had been encrypted to. Googling CRC
error etc., didn't bring several examples from this list (and others)
but nothing that I could use.
Sender is positive about having used my public key to encrypt the file.
Your help will be greatly appreciated.
