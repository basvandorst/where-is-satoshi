@_subject: import pgp public key in gnupg 
I want to import a public key from pgp 8.1 into gnupg 1.4.1.
The pgp key is RSA 1024.
gpg returns this error messages:
gpg: armor header: Version: PGP 8.1
gpg: can't handle public key algorithm 100
gpg: key EEE64249: no valid user IDs
gpg: this may be caused by a missing self-signature
I do not understand the "missing self-signature" because the key has a
self-signature in pgp.
Any hints what I'm doing wrong ?

Hi Charly,
the key import works with this option.
gpg identifies this as "old style (PGP 2.x) signature" and warns, that this
key is not certified with a trusted signature.
Anyway, I could sucessfully extract a file  which was signed with this
public key and that's what I need.
So many thanks for your help !
I believe this issue has been commented upon in this forum, a couple of
years ago maybe; it was about "public key algorithms 100 to 110" being
'reserved for private or experimental use'. I have tried to download key
EEE64249 from 4 different keyservers, nothing found.
As for "missing self signature", try to import the key while adding the
option --allow-non-selfsigned-uid. But I don't believe this will solve
the issue of algorithm 100.
I hope you get a better response from a more savvy user.
