@_subject: GPGnet? 
I know that you can use PGPnet to connect to a VPN box using
IPsec. I'm not so sure you can do the same thing with gpg. Has anyone
tried this? Does anyone know if this kind of support is planned in the future? Is it even on the radar?
Thanks loads.

It's a long story. Blowfish is a fast and secure [so far]
algorithm. You'd have to ask NAI why they don't implement it.

This may be an instance, where if you don't know how- don't mess, but
I'll ask anyway.
Being inquisitive, and aware, I noted the new AES. I downloaded the c
code from ftp:gnuug.org [the link on the top page points to something
that doesn't exist], and compiled it. I put it in /usr/local/lib/gnupg along with tiger rndegd rndunix.
I tried to encrypt something with it, but it failed.
92 $ gpg -e --cipher-algo rijndael doc/josh_story.txt gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
gpg: selected cipher algorithm is invalid
So can some kind sould point out what I did wrong, or where to read
about how one goes about incorporating a new cipher into the program?
