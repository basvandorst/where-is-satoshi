@_subject: Two Signing keys in one key 
I wonder if this is a legal key:
pub  1024D/AF6650BF 2002-06-03 Mark Doll uid                            Mark Doll uid                            Mark Doll sub  2048g/43E38F97 2002-06-03 [expires: 2003-06-03]
sub  1024D/F115985C 2002-06-03 [expires: 2003-06-03]
I would like to use key AF6650BF for signing other keys only (without an
expiring date) and key F115985C for signing mails and 43E38F97 for
encrypting mails (the last two keys exipiring after one year).
Export/Import via files works:
dolltest gpg --import mykey
gpg: key AF6650BF: public key imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
dolltest gpg --list-key AF6650BF
pub  1024D/AF6650BF 2002-06-03 Mark Doll uid                            Mark Doll uid                            Mark Doll sub  2048g/43E38F97 2002-06-03 [expires: 2003-06-03]
sub  1024D/F115985C 2002-06-03 [expires: 2003-06-03]
but does not work via a keyserver:
dolltest gpg --recv-key AF6650BF
gpg: requesting key AF6650BF from blackhole.pca.dfn.de ...
gpg: key AF6650BF: invalid subkey binding
gpg: key AF6650BF: public key imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
dolltest gpg --list-key AF6650BF
pub  1024D/AF6650BF 2002-06-03 Mark Doll uid                            Mark Doll uid                            Mark Doll Will this ever work via keyservers? Or is should I use another method to
get seperate keys for signing keys and signing mails?
