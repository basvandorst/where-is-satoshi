@_subject: key capabilities usage meanings 
What is the meaning of usage/capabilities listings for keys(shown, for
example, during edit-keys interactive sessions)?
S -> sign
E -> encrypt
C -> ?
A -> ?
looking at doc/DETAILS I found
C -> certification
A -> authentication
But I dont' understand the difference between authentication and signing.
I have different keys, each for a different internet and I noticed that one primary key is listed as CSA and CS. The two keys were generated with the same options (DSA for signing
+ElGamal subkey for pubkey encryption), so why this Another question: I read in manpage that MDC is enabled by with newer ciphers(blocksize>64bit) and with CAST5. So why when you
decipher a symmetrically encrypted message you get "WARNING: message
was not integrity protected" and only with --force-mdc the goes away?
