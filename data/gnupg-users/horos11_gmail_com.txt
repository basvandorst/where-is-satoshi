@_subject: gnupg and encrypted empty files. 
I'm trying to use gpg-1.4.9, and noticed an odd thing.
When a file that is empty is encrypted, decrypting it with --output
does not produce an empty file.. It produces NO file at all, and NO
system errors.
This is exceedingly odd - is this by design, and if so, why? It sure is a pain..
