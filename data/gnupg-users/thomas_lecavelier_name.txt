Tiago, Anthony,
Thank you for your answers,
I think you lead me toward a rationalization of my digital identity. Here what I'm working on:
For my common usage, I'll use a USB key with my GPG ring on it. I'll say that's my "main" keyring. On it I'll have my SSH keys, too. I think it will become a full authentication token, too.
For my servers work (I'm a big screen session eater) I'll setup a sync from the key to the server (this server has a mutt session always active on my different mailboxes, so need my gpg ring).
It's still not very clear in my mind, but I hope I'll get something rather smooth.

I tried many times to use GPG on a day-to-day basis. It often starts very well: I sign every mail I sent, evangelis people asking about my strange signatures, etc. But there's a fact: I'm a computer scientist worker, so I work on many computers, but not at the same rate.
Currently, I'm at work, setting up my iMac. So I download an exported secring from one of my personnal server. But I compare it to my keyring on my laptop, and even on my phone: they *all* diverge. I'm owned.
Here my true question: what's your workflow to sync your keyring between multiple computers? I thought about having a ring for personnal usage, and a ring for pro usage, but I'm consulting both my personnal and private email on every computers. I can't think about a simple solution, so I'd be glad to have your thoughts about it :)
Thank you
