@_subject: Problem with revoking my old key 
Hello everybody,
This is my first post on this mailinglist so please bear with me ;-)
I've had a gnupg-keypair for about 4 years and the public key is published on
several keyservers. Recently however my key has been compromised so yesterday I
decided to make a new one. First I made a revocation certificate for the old key
using "gpg --revoke-gen --output revoke_old_key.asc daniel
The revocation certificate looks like this:
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: GnuPG v1.4.2 (GNU/Linux)
Comment: A revocation certificate should follow
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Now I've been trying to upload the revocation certificate to the various
keyservers but none of them wants to accept it. For example, when I try
uploading it to wwwkey.pgp.net I get this as a response:
Add failed: Malformed Key --- unexpected packet type and/or order of packets
Am I doing something wrong or why is my key not being accepted by the keyservers?
