@_subject: Biometric passphrase 
Do you have any experience with implementing biometric into gpg as passphrase. I mean to give user's biometric data from (for example fingerprint) scanner as passphrase during key generation and use it when she want to sign or decrypt something???
-Maybe the passphrase would be more random(???)
-Even she won't know the passphrase
-Maybe the passphrases would be in a predetermined format (according to the biometric algorithm)
-she will allways need a scanner to sign or decrypt
-she can loose her finger or iris ;--))
what do you think??

@_subject: A question?? 
I have a question.
Is there any way to encrypt a directory or to encrypt more than one file simultaneously with gpg (by using my keyrings or with -c option)?

@_subject: using my own public key 
When I encrypt a file, I think gpg uses my secret key as default. How can I specify gpg to use my public key in order to encrypt it for myself.

Re: Re: What about the GPG-Agent for Windows?
Re: Re: With it you can cache the passphrase instead of saving it in
Re: cleartext into a file. And it's more comfortable, because any
Re: program that uses GPG can use it. You just need to put the
Re: "use-agent" option in your GPG options file.
Re: Re: You can download it here: Re: Re: It's a W32 port of the original gpg-agent.c sources from the

@_subject: gpg -c option 
I want to ask some questions about -c option.
First which algorithm does the 'gpg -c' use?
Is there any way to define the algorithm?
And does output file have any special heading? It is a bit computer forensic question. I mean is it possible to understand whether a file is encrypted with using gpg or not?

I have too much public keys and I do not want to import all of them  but I want to use them from a file whenever I need.
Is it possible?
If yes how can I do it?

If asked before sorry for dublication.
 I want to store my private key in a minikey (token) and to make gpg read my private key from token when I would sign something. Is it possible? How can I do it?
 Thank you..........

@_subject: GPG Error on Kmail 
I am using Kmail as mail client. Two weeks ago I generated 2048 bit DSA and ElGamal key pair and begun to sign and encrypt my mails with Kmail.
But when I want to sign a mail now, Kmail is giving this error message;
This is error message of GnuPG;
gpg: skipped '0x3DF5FE9E': secret key not available
gpg: [stdin]: clearsign failed: secret key not available
I can sign documents from command prompth.
What can be the problem.
Thank you
