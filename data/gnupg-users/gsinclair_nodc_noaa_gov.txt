I receive a 'Bus error' when attempting to generate a first time key

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the

It then bombs with the bus error before sending any progress dots to

I built egd-0.8 - no problems, and egd.pl launches fine (mentions 16

@_subject: GnuPG versus PGP 
After carefully reading the man pagers for GnuPG (I'm currently
running version 1.0.4 fully patched on Solaris), and after seeing an
infinitude of messages regarding various compatibility problems
between sundry versions of PGP and GnuPg and supported or half
supported algorithms (IDEA, ElGamel, blah, blah, blah ...), I'm
confused and still *uncertain* how I should be creating detached
signatures and exporting keys that a user running PGP or GnuPG may
need to verify or import. Moreover, I have no idea who out there in
the world may need to import my GnuPG public key or verify my signed
files, and I can't very well control whether they're running GnuPG or
PGP and what versions respectively. If there are certain version
incompatibilities, I can live with that. I just need to know what I
should be doing on my end with GnuPG in order to best satisfy,
e.g. making two separate keys (one to sign files for PGP and one for
GPG, etc.).
Does anyone have the definitive answer on these two questions?
1. What is the correct syntax for creating a detached signature,
   suitable for e-mail, that a user running either PGP or GnuPG can
   later verify (here's what I've been using)?
      gpg --detach-sig --armor filename
2. How should I export a key that a user running PGP or GnuPG may need to
   import so as to verify the signed file(s) created in 1. above
   (here's what I've been using)?
      gpg --export --armor --output username.key username
George | gsinclair
NOTE: I have tested the syntax in 1 and 2 above with a Solaris copy of
      PGP 5.0 (`pgpk --version` shows the following: PGP for Personal
      Privacy Version: unix50fcs5) since this is the only version of
      PGP I have, and I note the following:
         A. I export my key, using GnuPG, as:
               gpg --export --armor --output username.key username
         B. I then import the key into PGP as:
               pgpk -a username.key
         C. I can then verify files signed in GPG (as shown in item 2 above).
      My experience shows, however, that either or both of the
      additional options:            --force-v3-sigs
          --openpgp
      in any order will have no effect on the exported key. In each case, the
      exported key will have the same checksum. These options only have an
      appreciated effect when they're used to sign a file.
      The option: '--force-v3-sigs' can be included but appears to have no
      appreciable effects on my ability to later verify the signature using
      PGP 5.0. However, the option: '--openpgp' will create problems unless
      the option: '--force-vs-options' was also included.
      If the '--openpgp' option is used without the '--force-v3-sigs'
      option, then the resultant output signature file will be slightly       larger. Otherwise, the output size will always be the same as long
      as '--force-v3-sigs' is included or neither of the aforementioned
      options is included.

When a key is created, a trust value pair is associated with
the key. The first is the assigned owner trust, and the second is the calculated trust value. This is always '-/u' ('-' = No owner-trust
assigned or not yet calculated, 'u'=Ultimately trusted).
The first value (assigned owner trust) refers to the level of trust that
you -- the owner of the keyring -- want to associate with the given key
(how much you trust the owner to correctly sign another person's
key). This is what is stored in the trust database. If you don't
change this value, the trust database will not get updated. The second value (calculated trust) is always 'u' and cannot be
changed, though the first can be using the --edit-key option.
This is the value that was calculated or assigned at creation. After all,
why wouldn't the key be ultimately trusted by the user who created it,
Lets suppose, however, that you want to assign a non-default value to
the owner trust for a given key, perhaps one you imported. In this
case, the trust database gets updated. However, when you export the key, it
will be ALWAYS be imported on the other end as '-/q' (q=Undefined).
This is because GnuPG always assumes an initial calculated trust as
being undefined since the key wasn't created on home turf and the
owner trust value, of course, is NEVER carried with the key. GnuPG
requires this to be locally set so by default it's going to be '-'.
Another way of looking at this is that the person on the other end
does *not* have access to your trust database. In a sense, the key and
the trust database are mutually exclusive. Only GnuPG can link the two
and only if they're on the same machine in the same .gnupg directory
(or links from this area). A typical example follows:
<<< Here I'm playing with fictitious users Joe and Susan >>>
1. I import Joe's key (comes in as '-/q') - trust database *not* changed.
2. By whatever means, I verify that this key indeed belongs to Joe
   and is not spurious. I then sign the key. Joe's Key value pair changes to
   '-/f') so the calculated trust is now 'f'. Trust database, however,
   has still *not* changed!!!
3. Since Joe is such a swell guy, and I trust him to the ends of    the earth, I decide to knight him by granting him permission to
   verify other users keys. So, I change the owner trust value for Joe's
   key from '-' to 'f' using --edit-key. The value trust pair for
   Joe's key has now changed to 'f/f'. At this point, the trust
   database gets updated with the new 'owner-trust' information.
   Basically I'm saying that because I trust Joe, I also trust any
   keys that he might sign and hand to me. In this fashion, I don't
   have to sign say Susan's key to verify files signed by Susan if
   Joe had previously signed Susan's key. In essence, I can now
   accomplish this proxy. However, this only works because I changed
   the user trust value on Joe's key. Until I do this, I will not be
   able to "truly" verify files signed by Susan unless I sign her
   key. But, because I now trust Joe (I changed the trust database
   when I did this), and Joe signed Susan's key, Susan's key pair changes to    '-/f'. Optionally, I could have signed her key which would have
   likewise changed it from -/q to -/f, but this wasn't necessary as
   previously explained. In this case, the trust database has been
   changed but *not* for Susan's key, only for Joe's. It now lists the
   owner trust value of '-f'.
I don't see that the trust database is a problem except possibly
allowing other users on your own system to read it. If you're worried
about that, then a `chmod` should suffice while still allowing you to
use it as required. As far as other, more remote users, are concerned,
they won't have access to the information contained in the database
even after receiving an exported key. The key itself SHOULD not
contain this information.
Let me know if this helps.

@_author: George Sinclair 
@_subject: Why is ~/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg readable by all? 
A web of trust really involved two issues. The first is signing keys
and the second is how much trust you place in the owner (original) of
the signed key to sign other keys (for you) - we're *NOT* talking
about calling them up and asking them to sign a key for you; instead,
GnuPG will automatically do it for you if you've place a certain level of trust in that user.
Let's discuss the first issue of signing keys. If you want to build a
web of trust, you have to start at the grass roots level and this
involves adding and signing keys. In other words, start by signing
keys on your keyring that belong to people you know and whose
fingerprints (for the respective key) can be substantiated in the
following manner:    If you directly know the person, confirm the fingerprint (another
   cryptographic checksum, e.g tiger, md5, etc., would also work)    either by phone, FAX, or possibly some type of encrypted channel
   between you and this person.
If, however, you don't directly know the person, and this is GENERALLY the case, (sure, you could e-mail or call them, and introduce
yourself, but how do you know the person you're speaking with isn't
some imposter whose dreamed up some crazy pyramid financial scheme?)
then validating the fingerprint is a bit more involved:
    Confirm the fingerprint as shown above if possible. It's better
    than nothing.
    Next, corroborate the fingerprint. By this, I mean that you should
    contact anyone you directly trust to determine if they know and
    trust this individual. If you trust someone who trusts someone
    else, then it's kind of the "a=b=c" scenario. Get as many
    corroborating witnesses as possible. Maybe if three other people
    you know or trust all swear up and down that the fingerprint for
    this dude is what you show, and he or she isn't currently wanted
    for any crimes against humanity, then I'd say you can now place     considerably more credence in this person's key.
    Often a WEB site or other authoritative location (e.g. FTP server)     might contain a copy of the fingerprint, or the public key
    itself. The reputation of the site is a *reasonable* indication
    that the information located there is valid. In other words, some
    unknown site that gets few visitors and is being run out of some
    back alley pool hall versus a well known and frequently visited
    site like GNU might be suspect. Of course, bigger does *not*
    always mean better, but use common sense. The second aspect of the web of trust involves "trust" itself. Okay,
so you've signed this key BUT how much do you trust this person to
sign other users' keys for you. In order to answer this question, you
must first ask yourself this: Is this individual as mindful and sagacious as
yourself when it comes to adding and signing keys. Do they likewise
carry out the above steps in good faith?!!! Sure, you've established their
authenticity but do you really trust their judgment? Are they
responsible and thoughtful about the procedure. We all have friends
who we don't mind buying something for with our credit card, but do we
trust them to be left alone for the day with our card ---- hmmmm?
Consider the following example in which I indulge myself in an act of
humility: Let's suppose you know me, and you decide to add my public
key (maybe I e-mailed it to you) to your keyring. Next, you
substantiate that this is indeed my key by calling me to confirm the
fingerprint (maybe you check with one of your friends who also has my
key, whatever). You don't do this because you think I'm
malicious. Instead, you do this to ensure that some hacker didn't
intercept the e-mail and change it. Okay, everything makes sense up to this point. The next thing is "trust". Perhaps you don't think I
exercise good judgment when it comes to doing things with
GnuPG. Maybe I add every joker to my keyring, choose weak pass-phrases
and I trust every huckster that comes within a mile of me. In this
case, you certainly would *NOT* want to modify the default trust for
my key. Leave it as is. Signing my key just means that you can now
verify things I send you or things I've encrypted. You haven't let the fox into the hen house just yet. But let's suppose you're not thinking
and you decide to "trust" me, then you create a problem!!! If I send
you a key, signed by me, that someone sent me, and you then decide to
add it to your key ring then the fact that you have "trusted" me means that the
key that you add will now auto-magically be signed. GnuPG will *NOT*
ask you to sign the key. This is because you have "trusted" me to sign other user's keys that I have signed. This makes sense if you trust
the person to do this because then you don't have to confirm "b=c",
just "a=b", so you get "a=c" as the result. In the above example,
however, this would be BAD.
The final thing on trust is this: Add as needed and *only* if needed.
All in all, build you web of trust slowly and never give anyone a
level of trust higher than necessary to do your job. Substantiate
everything within reason.
Hope this helps.

Perhaps I should e-mail the author on this one, but since this

I'd at least start here.
I'm running GnuPG version 1.0.4 on Solaris. I want to verify the

quintuple agent (replaces secret-agent) gzip tarball file
(quintuple-agent-1.0.0.tar.gz) available from:

  gpg: Signature made Mon Feb 12 15:44:19 2001 EST using DSA key ID BC185AB3
  gpg: Can't check signature: public key not found
I found the author's (Robert Bihlmeyer) public key (see below) from:
   I have no way to verify its validity, but I gotta start
somewhere. Anyway, I copied and pasted it to a file named 'robbe.key'
and then imported as:     gpg --import robbe.key
Key imports fine, but the above error is generated. Additionally, just
laughs, I also imported this into my PGP keyring (ver. 5.0), and it
generates the following error when verifying:    pgpv quintuple-agent-1.0.0.tar.gz.sig    This signature applies to another message
   File to check signature against [quintuple-agent-1.0.0.tar.gz]:    Signature by unknown keyid: 0xBC185AB3
1. I realize this is a PGP signature, but can GnuPG 1.0.4 handle this,    and if not, what can I do?
2. If the public key I found is wrong, does anyone have the correct one?
3. If GnuPG can't work with this, and my version of PGP (5.0) won't,
   does anyone have a checksum for the gzipped tarball that    they could provide to me as an additional corroborating piece of
   evidence to ensure I have the right *untainted* file. Yes, I can
   e-mail the author, but I'd like to have tertiary confirmation.
Thanks mucho!!!

I'm running GNUPG version 1.0.4 (patched) on a Sun Solaris box. I'm a

script that at some point needs to be able to sign a file, thus

this is trivial, but how can the user submit the script in batch mode
to run at a later time? Obviously, he or she won't be around to enter
the pass-phrase when it's needed, and I don't want to pass this
pass-phrase as a clear text parameter to the script.

Four questions on entropy:
When creating a new key, GnuPG recommends exercising the disk to create 1. Assuming you're not running this on a linux box where you'd have
the luxury of /dev/random, but instead you're running EGD (entropy
gathering daemon), it's already running, and it's been running for
sometime (mine runs all the time), how necessary is it to exercise the
2. What exactly constitutes exercising the disk? For example, if just
prior to running `gpg --gen-key`, I launch a script which repeatedly
performs a recursive find command against say /usr (I stop the script
when I'm done generating the key), would this be sufficient, or does
exercise imply something more comprehensive?
3. Which disks should be exercised: only the root drive, any
4. Would something like the script referred to in 2. above generate
enough action for EGD to consider an adequate amount of entropy, or
rather would it create a large enough pool of entropy so as not to
reduce the security of the resultant gpg key?

@_subject: Three questions on trustdb.gpg 
I'm running GPG ver 1.0.4 (fully patched) on Solaris 2.5.1. My
question has to do with permissions on trustdb.gpg and encrypting
files. If I change the permissions on said file from 644 (-rw-r--r--)
to say 444 (-r--r--r--), and then I try to encrypt a file as:
      gpg --encrypt -r user filename
I receive the following error:
      gpg: fatal: /export/home/user/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: can't open:
Permission denied secmem usage: 1920/2944 bytes in 5/9 blocks of pool 3296/16384
Likewise, I receive the same error if I attempt to decrypt a
previously encrypted file, unless 'trustdb.gpg' has write mode set
for the owner.
However, if I reset the permissions to allow owner write access, the
encryption works like a champ.
1. Why is write access required on 'trustdb.gpg' in order to encrypt
or decrypt a file? I would have thought only read access would be
necessary? The error message seems misleading as it ostensibly
suggests a problem reading it, not writing? Moreover, there's no
difference between 'trustdb.gpg' before and after the
encryption and no time stamp change, only a time last accessed
change). Therefore, it seems that GPG is certainly not writing to this
file. 2. Why does signing or verifying a signature not complain about
'trustdb.gpg' not being writable? You'd think if encrypting something
required write access then signing something would too - okay, maybe
the first time, but not after.
3. I had my heart set on having ~/.gnupg, excepting the 'random_seed' file,
placed on read-only media for extra protection. This assumes, of
course, that I'm not going to be making any changes to the secret or
public key rings. It would appear, however, that both 'random_seed'
and 'trustdb.gpg' will now BOTH need to be on spinning disk with user write
access. Is there any way around this?

 ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/pub/gcrypt/gnupg/gnupg-1.0.4.tar.gz.sig
1. Shouldn't this instead be a link to the patch file's signature?
2. Where is the patch file's signature, anyway?
3. When I click on the link, I only see a few characters like this:
   ^?
   maybe a few more if accessing from a PC but just as ugly. It
   certainly doesn't look like a signature.
Where can I obtain a signature for the patch? If I have a signature
for the upgrade itself but no signature for the patch, I'm kinda
Any help would be appreciated.

@_subject: Signing files from a script in batch 
Yes, a billionth question on batch jobs!
I'm running GNUPG version 1.0.4 (patched) on a Sun Solaris box. I'm a
newbie on the whole gnupg batch thing. Here's the deal: I have a Perl
script that at some point needs to be able to sign a file, thus
requiring the user's pass-phrase to unlock his/her secret key. Clearly,
this is trivial, but how can the user submit the script in batch mode
to run at a later time? Obviously, he or she won't be around to enter
the pass-phrase when it's needed, and I don't want to pass this
pass-phrase as a clear text parameter to the script.
Is there a way the pass-phrase could be asked for ahead of time and
then held in secure memory, somehow?  Any thoughts on this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Four questions on entropy:
When creating a new key, GnuPG recommends exercising the disk to create 1. Assuming you're not running this on a linux box where you'd have
the luxury of /dev/random, but instead you're running EGD (entropy
gathering daemon), it's already running, and it's been running for
sometime (mine runs all the time), how necessary is it to exercise the
2. What exactly constitutes exercising the disk? For example, if just
prior to running `gpg --gen-key`, I launch a script which repeatedly
performs a recursive find command against say /usr (I stop the script
when I'm done generating the key), would this be sufficient, or does
exercise imply something more comprehensive?
3. Which disks should be exercised: only the root drive, any
4. Would something like the script referred to in 2. above generate
enough action for EGD to consider an adequate amount of entropy, or
rather would it create a large enough pool of entropy so as not to
reduce the security of the resultant gpg key?

@_subject: Three questions on trustdb.gpg 
I'm running GPG ver 1.0.4 (fully patched) on Solaris 2.5.1. My
question has to do with permissions on trustdb.gpg and encrypting
files. If I change the permissions on said file from 644 (-rw-r--r--)
to say 444 (-r--r--r--), and then I try to encrypt a file as:
      gpg --encrypt -r user filename
I receive the following error:
      gpg: fatal: /export/home/user/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: can't open:
Permission denied secmem usage: 1920/2944 bytes in 5/9 blocks of pool 3296/16384
Likewise, I receive the same error if I attempt to decrypt a
previously encrypted file, unless 'trustdb.gpg' has write mode set
for the owner.
However, if I reset the permissions to allow owner write access, the
encryption works like a champ.
1. Why is write access required on 'trustdb.gpg' in order to encrypt
or decrypt a file? I would have thought only read access would be
necessary? The error message seems misleading as it ostensibly
suggests a problem reading it, not writing? Moreover, there's no
difference between 'trustdb.gpg' before and after the
encryption and no time stamp change, only a time last accessed
change). Therefore, it seems that GPG is certainly not writing to this
file. 2. Why does signing or verifying a signature not complain about
'trustdb.gpg' not being writable? You'd think if encrypting something
required write access then signing something would too - okay, maybe
the first time, but not after.
3. I had my heart set on having ~/.gnupg, excepting the 'random_seed' file,
placed on read-only media for extra protection. This assumes, of
course, that I'm not going to be making any changes to the secret or
public key rings. It would appear, however, that both 'random_seed'
and 'trustdb.gpg' will now BOTH need to be on spinning disk with user write
access. Is there any way around this?

@_subject: Signing multiple files 
How can you sign multiple files using gpg? If I don't want to have to
enter the password a zillion times when signing every file in a given
directory, I would be forced to use something like Expect or possibly
write a Perl script using the Expect module, or some such thing. Is
there another easier way?   Also, how can I safely pass the passphrase into the script? There appears to be a dearth of
information surrounding the subject of multiple files, batch mode
etc. in the documentation. For such an important issue, the available
solutions and or available information just seems terse or abstruse.
