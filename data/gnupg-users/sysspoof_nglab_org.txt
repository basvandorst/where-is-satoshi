 Please select the type of key to generate:
    (1) Signature key
    (2) Encryption key
    (3) Authentication key
 Your selection? 3
 gpg: WARNING: such a key has already been stored on the card!
 Replace existing key? (y/N) y
 PIN
 gpg: verify CHV2 failed: invalid passphrase
 gpg: error checking the PIN: invalid passphrase
 And i don't know why. I tried the admin pin and the normal/user pin.
I already once tried to write down some subkeys as you see. But unfortunately, the gpg software broke due a segfault :S
 So may the card is corrupt?
 Is there a way to change the pin (?)... i still have the admin pin, also still the default one, i received with a letter from fsfeurope.
Thanks in advance,
Patrick Grieshaber
