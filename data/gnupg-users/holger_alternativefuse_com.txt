@_subject: Creating a key bearing no user ID 
Hello gnupg-users,
I intend to use gpg only for receiving encrypted e-mail, not signing my outgoing e-mail. Because I don't want my name or e-mail address out there on the keyservers, I want do create a key without a uid. People who want to send me e-mail, get my e-mail address and keyID/fingerprint with my business card.
Will this work or did I miss something?
When trying to create a key with an "empty" uid using '--allow-freeform-uid', I get
gpg: [internal]: no User-ID specified
Do I have to create a regular key first and strip off the uid afterwards?
Thanks a lot!

One reason is spam, though we haven't seen excessive abuse of the keyserver-data or the keyservers themselves yet. Of course I could simply omit the e-mail address. Another one: My full name is rather unique and I don't want to reveal with whom I communicate i.e. who signed my key. On the other hand, public keys can be easily polluted with bogus signatures ... but I guess the average researcher is not aware of that and the versed is able to filter out the bogus ones. So maybe I should refrain from participating in the web of trust and build my personal "star of trust"?!
By keyID/fingerprint from the keyserver-net.

I'm not afraid of being mistaken for s.b. else. Given my name was unique, anybody
could go and see with whom I'm associated.
That's on another level, legally + technically.
Please simply accept that it's an issue for me as well as many others. Harvesting is
supereasy: full keydumps are readily available.
Yes, I intend to receive encrypted mail only from those

I'm not a fan of comparisons at all, but I'd say my e-mail address feels more like
my postal address, thus I tend to handle them similarly.
But wouldn't you replace or enforce the lock on your front door once s.o. made
it in? At least you would still keep locking it, wouldn't you?  ; )
