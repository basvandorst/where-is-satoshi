Thanks!  That seems to have solved the problem, I think.  Although none of
the keys I try are being found on search.keyserver.net ... but they aren't
showing in the web interface, either.  One did come through ok, though.

Does GnuPG actually include zlib itself, or does it just require you have
zlib on your system, and then utilize that?
I just downloaded and compiled zlib 1.1.4 along with GnuPG yesterday,
assuming GnuPG would use the updated zlib... was I mistaken?

be able to import my private keys... but heck, I can't even do that.
Nevermind, just got that working (manually, from the command line, importing
private keys)... things are looking up a bit.
I love this stuff!  :-)
