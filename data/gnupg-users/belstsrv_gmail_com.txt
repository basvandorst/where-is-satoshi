Thanks John, and everyone else for their assistance.
I removed everything and executed the gpg  --version command and it reports:
gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.9
Copyright (C) 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
I did the path command, and it reports:
C:\Program Files\GNU\GnuPG
as the only PGP related entry.
My main use for GunPG is really key storage and creation for some other processes/projects I have.  Not really using it for Thunderbird or any other email, yet.
I am really confounded by this issue.  I have disabled UAC in Vista as well.  It has been disabled this entire time.
I've now removed everything and am going to try to reinstall just the What could I try and do that might simulate the issues I am seeing when using a GUI frontend (without installing the frontend)?  I want to just use the command line a little to see if that works.
Thanks again!

I removed everything and rebooted.  Then went and installed just the command line component.  The version shows as 1.4.9 and the path variable is correct.
I tried this command:
gpg -K
gog.exe crashed and the command line window give this info:
gpg: checking the trustdb
Assertion failed: keyblock->pkt->pkttype == PKT_PUBLIC_KEY, file keyring.c, line
  1387

Hopefully this will help troubleshoot this a little.  If there is anything I can do to debug or produce a log file, just let me know.
Thanks again.

I recently moved to MS Vista and I've installed the gpg4win-1.1.3.exe package from When trying to run GPA or WinPT though, or even gpg from a command line, I always get an error saying gpg.exe has crashed.
Does anyone know how to overcome this?

Thanks for the replies.  Would I be OK to install the package from gpg4win and  then install 1.4.9 effectively overwriting the gpg.exe?
I'd swear I did that at some point during my troubleshooting, but I could be wrong.
Or, should I install things separately like gpg.exe and then WinPT?
Thanks again.

============================== START ==============================
I downloaded 1.4.9 and installed it.  I then grabbed WinPT and when launching WinPT, I get repeated gpg.exe crashes, like I did before.
I also downloaded GnuPT and installed that, which comes with 1.4.9 and running that also causes gpg.exe crashes.
I then took all of the EXEs from w32cli install and copied them over to the GnuPT folder and had the same result.
I am really at a loss as to how to get a GUI interface to work with GnuPG.
What should I try next?
