That's an interesting point, although I was using rich text, I changed
it to plain text, but still no luck :(. Binaries are being corrupted.

Hello Everyone,
I just started to use GnuPG recently under Linux but I have a windows
box that has Outlook 2002+GnuPG+GData+GPGShell installed on it.
I can sign and encrypt messages very successfully, however, when I try
to signed any binary attached file in M$ Outlook, it gets corrupted
This problem does not persist with text attachments.
I have tried to google a bit but couldn't get an answer, so I thought
of contacting the mailing list!
Thanks in advance for your answers
Application Versions:
Outlook: 2002
GnuPG: gpg (GnuPG) 1.2.5
GData: 0.9.1 (not sure)
GPGShell: V.3.30

Thanks Barry,
I tried the update but still didn't fix the problem, however, I
noticed now the attachments are signed with *.png.pgp extension
instead of *.png.gpg. I guess this means the patch is working fine for
me but it didn't fix the problem on binary attachments yet!
What do you think?
