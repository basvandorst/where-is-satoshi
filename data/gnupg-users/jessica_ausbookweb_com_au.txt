@_subject: Shell tools for GnuPG on Win9x? 
Hello all,
I have a shopping mall system designed to work with PGP to encrypt credit card orders before e-mailing to the shop owner. I am trying to switch to using GnuPG.
The problem I will have is enabling shop owners to easily decrypt the e-mails containing the order information. Currently, they are able to use plug-ins to Eudora, etc., to simplify the decryption process.
I have tried importing a GnuPG secret key into PGPKeys to be able to decrypt messages created by GnuPG. It didn't work (I didn't expect it to).
Is there a way to do this, or is there a Win9x interface to GnuPG? (This of course requires that there is even a command line version of GnuPG for Win9x - is there?)
Please cc replies to me if possible.
Many thanks,

Hi Werner,
Thanks for the info. I just found a page at  that explains the process.
A plugin for Eudora would be *very* good. My concern with importing a user's private key created in PGP is that by using it commercially (even though with GnuPG) we *might* be contravening the non-commercial use of PGP.
I'm not sure though - if you create a key using PGP freeware, and then export the key for use with another utility, is it still a violation of PGP licensing if you're not using the patented algorithms to do the actual commercial encryption?
Any lawyers here?

Hi Jarno,
John Goodleaf answered this question recently - I had the same problem and found the answer by looking in the archives. You can find his post at Works fine for me now.
