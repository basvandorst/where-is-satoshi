@_subject: procmail recipe and gpg? 
Does anyone have a good procmail recipe for gpg?
I'd like it so that any email sent to an email account is encrypted
with that users public gpg key.
Don't need to worry about attachments.
An example application of this would be...
Simple perl scripts that send an email to a user on the same server.
This way, anything sent to that end user would be encrypted.  The end
user could then pop the mail off the server and decrypt it with their
local private key.
Many thanks!

I asked this one before...  either no response or no one knows.
Has anyone got a procmail recipe that works so that any email sent to
a particular pop3 account will be encrypted with a public key?
maybe I am on the wrong list?  Recommendations?

Sorry for the initial description... here is why I want it...
What I would like to do is have a regular pop3 mail account on a
private server... any email sent TO that email address will be
encrypted with my public key when it arrives on the server.  Then when
I download it into Mozilla
Thunderbird with EnigMail addon it will decrypt it.   The usefulness
of this ability can be expanded to other perl/php scripts that email
information to that same pop3 but don't have any type of gpg port yet.

To all that responded,
I got it to work...
Here is how...
First, when executed by .procmailrc, the .gnupg directory needed to be
in the same directory as the .procmailrc file.   It had to be
chown:chgrp for that user.
The procmailrc looks like this...
* ^X-ClamAV: clean
! email2 at mydomain.com
The only matching thing in all emails was the X-ClamAV: clean
What this does...
When an email comes into that pop account, it encrypts it and forwards
it to email2 at domain.com
