@_subject: GPG using key ring in D:\Documents and Settings\Default 
I have Gpg4Win installed on a server and imported keys using GPA.  When my
batch job runs via an automated scheduler and calls GPG it is looking for
the key rings in "Default User".  Is there a way to configure GPG to go to a
different directory?

I was able to point to the proper key ring by using "--keyring ..."
