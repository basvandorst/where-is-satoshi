On what platform?  On Linux, I believe, the gpg binary needs to be
setuid root.  On UnixWare, add filepriv -f plock /path/to/gpg

I think there is an option you can set, see the manpage..... or FAQ

6. PROBLEMS and ERROR MESSAGES
6.1) Why do I get "gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!"
    On many systems this program should be installed as
    setuid(root). This is necessary to lock memory pages.  Locking
    memory pages prevents the operating system from writing memory pages
    to disk and thereby keeping your secret keys really secret. If you
    get no warning message about insecure memory your operating system
    supports locking without being root. The program drops root
    privileges as soon as locked memory is allocated.
    If you can't or don't want to install GnuPG setuid(root), you can
    use the option "--no-secmem-warning" or put
    no-secmem-warning  in your ~/.gnupg/options file.

The platform is actually FreeBSD. It's my webhost on which I just have a
little useraccount. and
... I don't really follow what you are trying to say below.
Would going in into the C-source and just commenting out the offending
message out - work?
Just wondering...

No Problem.

YESSSS!!!!! That worked! How embarrassing. I really missed the FAQ. I was
looking through the manual, readme files etc... but that one I missed.
put a  around that FAQ-link please ;-)
That's a HUGE relieve!
Thanx Larry!

but with drastically different TTL's.  keys.nai.com has a 1 day TTL,
but keyserver.pgp.com has a 30minute TTL. Hmmm. Thanks for getting that fixed, though!
