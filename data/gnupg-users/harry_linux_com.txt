Hi everyone,
I appreciate that this may not be the right list, but does anyone know
of a way to decrypt Voltage IBE encrypted messages without having to
use the web interface at the third party server? The ciphertext seems
to be contained in the actual message, as in the following example:
-----BEGIN VOLTAGE SECURE BLOCK V3-----
-----END VOLTAGE SECURE BLOCK V3-----
Anyone interested in helping to try and decrypt blocks like that and
write a Firefox extension?
