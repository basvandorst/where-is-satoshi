There is, yes, but it would help if you would be more specific, as to
that what you exactly want, so a more specific answer would be possible.
If you want to _share_ the same key ring(s) between these two OSs, these
keys might be placed e.g. on an independent/separate partition which
could be read by both OSs. This way both versions of GPG installed on
Linux and XP(ee?) could "ask" (`gimmiekey') for the keys from their
respective OSs. This was the way I was practising for a short while,
wishing to have only one place where I would keep my keys to share them
between several OSs and their respective GnuPG installations. This is
one of examples:
      hda 9                                    hda6 (E:/)
      _____                                    __
      Linux                                    XP (some Win file system)
      *****                                    **
      \GnuPG/                                  \GnuPG win32/
                                               |
                                               |
                hda17                          |

So, you just in your GnuPG configuration files point to the path where
the keys are.
You also might have the keys even on a diskette, or some similar
"removable" "data keeper", setting/sicking the GnuPGs on the floppy, or
other sort of a, drive. This is even better/safer.
Another way is to keep the keys on this XP's GnuPG installation,
configuring Linux's GnuPG installation to "evoke" them from XP
(providing that the Linux's kernel can read NTFileSsystem; if not, you
would have to vamp up a bit the kernel adding the feature to read/seduce
this NTFS too). Etc.
Have I got what you meant, Sean?
                                  ***
  And while we are already on/into it, I myself could ask someone for a
 little help too... Namely, now I keep my keys on a small(er) encrypted
        PGP container, which can fit a 1.44 floppy, for the use with my
  respected Win{d|bl}ows OSs. For my Linuxes (Gentoo and Vector) I keep
   the keys on a diskette with ext2 file system. Now, what I would love
 best is to have an _encrypted_ partition/"container" which I could use
  from both OSs, and to place my keys in there. Is that possible and if
     yes how? I couldn't catch more time to devise/monkey out something
               better than the above said and am thankful for any hints.

at one place...
We have to know...

+ the OS

+ how the Internet/a Network works (TCP/IP, specific software /
"utilities" used...)

"Securing & Optimizing Linux 2.0" (quite interesting book; file name for
the download/Google is "Securing-Optimizing v2.0.pdf"; there is chapter
dedicated to GnuPG too), then "Teach Yourself TCP/IP in 14 Days" at

Well, basically all depends on your personal "model" of "security /
safety" you estimate you need/want. Then according to this you choose
what you will learn and how much.
I personally like to tend to be within some "reasonable" limits, that is
I choose the "middle path" between a "paranoia" and a "boobynoia". It is
because always will be someone around knowing more ("technicalities")
than you do, in general or in particular moment, and all your
_technical_ defence will...well, suck in no time, if you have no some
other ways, for instance to avoid an attack or a pestilent situation
_before_ it becomes actual. It relates, then, to this "anthropologic"
dimension, when our own _personal behavior_ (independently of any
software and technical knowledge) defines the situations we'll be
involved in. Once we are clear as to this behavior, it will define what
software and knowledge we'll (choose to) use.

If the key could be uploaded (it's as for the "key servers") in an

[about the personal web pages for public PGP keys]
Well, the protocols are of a secondary relevance in relation to
_purpose_ they should have to obey/abide to ultimately. The purpose of a
key server is to make possible a public access to the key(s), and very
desirable, in the form/condition the very owner wants them, the keys, to
Now, if the owner is not in the position to maintain the _own_ keys in a
way only s/he is, or should be, allowed to be (once the keys are
uploaded on some server without an authorization mechanism; or if they,
the servers, are limited/dysfunctional in some other way), then is quite
natural and normal to dismiss/revamp such protocols, and to replace them
with more efficient ones, which will serve the very _purpose_ better.
It is so because the protocols (and in the quite same way this what we
call "standards") are here to serve _me_, "the user", not vice versa.
Because, _I_ am the one who designs them, after _my_ needs, and I am the
one who assigns them a purpose. Once this basic fact, the origin of the
purpose, is "forgotten", we get standards and protocols which are
tending to "design" the user, which absolutely puts into disorder the
entire "system"; it becomes dysfunctional.
One of such badly considered attempts (to "design" the user after the
unleashed, `grown wild/mad', "standards/protocols") is the
recommendation, encouragement, and even sort of a pressure(?!) now and
then, addressed to the "users" to upload their keys on those badly
maintained/designed servers.
It actually _ruins_ the standards/protocols, simply because a _habit_ is
presented under the name "standard/protocol", not the real quality.
But this is already a _behavior_ which is much more a matter of a
psychology, a "social engineering", than of a _software design_. We
shouldn't have them mixed (up) overly. One thing are "technicalities" of
a software, and something pretty different is _how_ you'll use them. The
design of the software shouldn't "home" you which "standards" you'll
implement in your usage, but to allow you to _choose_ them yourself.
Well, as I said, once the _purpose_ is "forgotten" the "project" enters
confusion. Like the Earth which would decide someday to leave its orbit,
and to roam across the space on its own. (-:
This is the reason why is good to follow "the seed", the primary motive,
the purpose which defines all the rest, including protocols, "standards"
etc., or otherwise, if you would nurture what is called the seed of
apple, and then would see a banana growing from it, you would find
yourself in a state not very clear to you. (:
The seed of PGP, the Pretty Good Privacy (the Privacy!) is still in the
work of Phil Zimmermann. It's good to read _why_ he had made the PGP,
and to recall his advices and recommendations. Some of that might be
found in the 2nd chapter of "Intro To Crypto", titled "Phil Zimmermann
on PGP", and beginning with "Why I wrote PGP".
And, if we catch the essence, we can see that we can (and sometimes
_have to_) change and modify all sorts of protocols and standards, as
long and much as we are still "on the course", that is following the
This what is made bad, shouldn't be used, absolutely regardless what
"authority" "recommends" it or even insists on.
One of the very first instructions I give to those "beginners" who
"dare" to ask me for a help as to PGP, is "don't upload the key(s) on
any key server around". Except perhaps, if you are willing just to
experiment or similar. The _valuable_ ("serious") key(s) should be
maintained in a _valuable_ fashion. The personal PGP web pages are one
of pretty fine choices, while actually there are plenty others,
depending on the scenario _you_ write.
If you find that burying a public key in the ground, and giving the map
just to one or few other persons is what you find good/handy for you
(and them), then it is a valid protocol. (-: Various keys need various
In one thing just everyone should be absolutely sure: using PGP without
(enough) _thinking_ of it, is not good. Acceptance of unclear, shallow
or otherwise not functional answers/explanations, is not good. All the
things in PGP might and can be quite clear; and hence the explanations.

Every file containing a valid key data can be imported by GnuPG,
regardless the file extension and the file format.
As I know there are only two formats: ascii ("armored"), which is
actually a plain text format, and the binary format (the one not very
readable by a human).
GnuPG (as a genuinely *nix application) reads and recognizes actually
the file format primarily and doesn't pay attention at its "extension"
(as is the case with Windows).
Usually, extensions for these formats are:
ascii                 binary
=====                 ======
.txt                  .gpg
.asc                  .pgp
.sec                  .sig        etc.
.rev      etc.
GnuPG also can read (import) properly even if a file has no any
extension, and/or if a file has _any_ extension, even mangled one or
completely arbitrary one.
It will, for instance, properly import a valid key data even if a file
is with extension key.jpg (mangled extension), key (no extension) and
key.fricassee (arbitrary extension).
(PGP, though, as an exclusively Windows application, will be deluded by
such extensions, and will say it doesn't recognize the file format, even
without reading it, so that will import nothing.)

Since you use XP, then...

The next tab is for the Date format.
Clicking on the Clock (squatting in the tray) makes you able just to
"wind up" the clock and to set the Time Zone.

environment in XP as well, and thus should be accepted by all programs
working in this/such environment.

In Windows 98 SE for instance, the time/date format in DOS is set in a
different way(s). One of them is to define a permanent environment
variable via Config.sys file where you enter the "country code", which
defines time/date format.
It looks like this...
...and this one gives format like this...
yyyy-mm-dd HH:mm:ss
...where the capitalized "HH" gives 24 hours time format while the lower
case "hh" gives 12 hour AM/PM format.
                                  ***
Now, some previous versions of GnuPG are, with the US time format,
displaying verbosely (the local) Time Zone as well, which is a bit
better anyway, whilst the newer 1.4x versions are displaying only the US
format giving no data about Time Zone.
For instance, in version 1.2.3-nr1 it displays this...
gpg: Signature made 04/07/06 11:55:58 Central Europe Daylight Time using
DSA key ID 500B8987
...whilst in versions 1.4x it is like this...
gpg: Signature made 04/07/06 11:55:58 using DSA key ID 500B8987.
                                  ***
The inconsistency in the, for instance, US date format (although it can
be found in some other countries as well), might be elegantly corrected
by using the so called "universal" or "astronomical" (or "military")
date/time format which makes such sort of orientation much clearer,
faster and better. It gives consistent values going from the higher to
lower ones, that is yy|yy, mm, dd, HH, mm, ss (century|year, month, day,
24hour information, minute, second), which makes it excellent for
computing/administration (and with minimum data; no PM, AM and similar).
I don't know how to solve this in GnuPG, or in some programs/parts of
the very OS. Notepad itself in XP for instance gives anyway a messed
format (via F5) displaying firstly time and then date...
14:38 06-04-07
...which makes it useless for the ".LOG" function, whilst EDXOR (and
some other programs like KeyNote, Treepad Lite etc.) gives it exactly as
it is set on the OS level...
06-04-07 14:38:44
...which shows that such a response of a program to the OS is possible.
I am not sure for EDXOR and Treepad Lite, but KeyNote is of open source
so analyzing the related parts of the code maybe might help.

Put it into a TrueCrypt container (it has no "head[er]" nor a "tail" --
which is a good strategy for a possible future GPGDisk by the way, no
matter who will make it) without extension, and you always may tell that
you can't recall the password. It happens indeed now and then, so that
it will not be suspicious much, and besides you may hint discretely that
probably you can't recall it due to the stress they have exposed you to
(whenever they frighten you, you forget a handful of passwords).
Simplest things work best.
Seriously. Acting insanity (or stupidness) in all this similar
environment makes nothing suspicious, and thus the mimicry result shows
as something quite natural and well composed in.
We always should remember and find a resort in the fact that software

Thanks for the response, Werner, anyway. To my knowledge I wouldn't have
more informations, except perhaps the fact I suppose was the reason that
my mailer in the reply routine takes over the name of the sender of the
message I reply to, and puts after his name the address of the list in
the TO field.
Vedaal though does not use his name in address field but only naked/nude
address, so my mailer took over his address, placed it on the place for
the name, and added address of the list after. It made actually a form
thus which is not "standard", namely "address " and it was
probably the syntax which confused the server.
I didn't notice this immediately, but later, after I did and had
corrected it myself and sent to the list again, my reply ahpilly
arrived. So I suppose it was the only reason.

RFCs are not any "standards" nor they are by (their own) definition

They are just collection of less or more recommended routines, and often

I recall now a movie with Eddie Murphy playing a somewhat irregular
priest explaining to the crowd what is evil and what is not. Whatever he
says, now this and then that, the crowd says "Yeah!"
So, it is basically a matter of anthropology (and sometimes more
specifically of neurology, when the psychedel[ir]ic kitsch element is
particularly stressed in an HTML...creation)[1].
But if we put aside the matters of aesthetics (which is not just "a
matter of taste" but indeed of the work of subtle health of undamaged
neurones as well, which is an objective category), we can see that we
have at disposal two main aspects we can observe and analyze the HTML
case in the context (and it is a model for all the other ones of the
same and similar type)...
1) technical characteristics of such a document
2) the ways subjects _react_ on it, the document
...where the first aspect tells us about the essential proprieties (what
it is, does, can etc.) and the other one describes _habits_, as a
conditional behavior conditioned by various and idio...matic ways some
particular group of a given population adopts its models of behavior.[2]
Now, these models of _behavior_ can exist entirely independently of the
real value of the objects/things (in this case HTML mail), and if these
models we take to be criterions for estimation of the real value, then
we get the known mess where just mere habits are taken to be a
It is an evasive finer distinction that seems rarely who is able to
perceive and to keep attention on it enough long to get a clear thought
of it.
Since it is a global/general phenomenon, it encompasses the (human)
mental activities involved in creating something as the RFCs are as
This is generally result of the taking _habits_ to be criterion of
standards, and not the technical facts of the phenomenon that is object
of these habits.
RFCs are anyway good, generally speaking, since they have a basic
intention (to try if nothing else) to introduce an order and thus to
prevent an incredible mess, which would result in ultimate
It means thus that they, RFCs, are not gods nor priests, and that they
should be taken "with a grain of salt", not for granted thus, with a
healthy reason and not by "common sense".[3]
We have thus to think (to a certain needed degree) as well, not just to
merely react, and everything becomes better then, we get much better
solutions, and better solutions bring more enjoyment.
When the organ of pleasure disciplines itself, it produces and gives
much more pleasure.
                                   ***
Generally, HTMLanguage is for instance a pretty powerful language, it is
not naive at all, and with it many actions can be performed and
triggered, everywhere on your hard disk and "peripherals". These codes
you can't see/perceive on the surface, since they are not rendered by a
browser/mailer's HTML reader, although they are performed anyway. Not
good for a mail, definitely. "It's evil." (-: For now.
As for the "horrid look of text only mail", Courier is not only fixed
width font. I myself like it since it resembles the old typewriters
which is quite fine to me. Of others Lucida Console comes to mind, for
Windows, and many other ones for Linux.
[1] But again, might be that those people simply have not enough for a
better weed or simply a hammer/mazzuola, so is not nice to laugh at
someone's poverty.
We also shouldn't forget that Oscar Wild gave his life fighting against
kitschy wallpapers. His last words were: "Or they or me".
[2] See Pavlovian reflexes, how they are created and function.
[3] What is "common sense" in mental hospital for instance, or in some
collective insanity, or in an insanity in two... A "common" is not
enough to make a "standard". It resembles, it resembles it, indeed, but
it is not enough.

Cary, all your questions are already answered in the previous message.
Please read it again.
Otherwise, and apropos of some other things and side effects, and a
possible "collateral damage"...
There is no any whimsicality in it (the previous message and wider) and
the answers/observations are given quite sternly and with a quite fine
necessary precision.
This however that to someone now and then it _looks_ like some
whimsicality is right the effect of exactly the expectations that come
with already developed said habit(s), in the moment when these
expectations are not fulfilled. -- We are surprised and feel as someone
is kidding us then. But is not so.
The following sentence is/was crucial for understanding it...
"It is an evasive finer distinction that seems rarely who is able to
perceive and to keep attention on it enough long to get a clear thought
of it."
...so we need our perception and cognitive processes _disciplined_, and
thus stabilized, or they will not give the needed results.
Gnu Privacy Guard is one of the rare software/conceptions which
absolutely needs disciplined and clear thinking and perception, or
otherwise there is no much use of it.
Some people are able for this, being disciplined and watchful, are
educated, drilled and trained for it, and some are not.
This all defines then the quality of understanding, of ability to follow
the matter/action and to partake in it.
Those who are disciplined (the way described) can follow all my texts
perfectly well, and it is visible and documented. Besides, they are
amused decently much as well, which is good since it is a "hard" matter
and a side sporadic relaxation is quite welcome then. (;
Those though who are not in possession of such noble qualities
constantly fall into the traps scattered (spontaneously and on the fly)
all around. (; For them such texts are like a poison (some even get
angry or even undergo serial nervous breakdowns[1]), while for the other
ones it is a pure nectar.
I personally enjoy in watching the both groups. (:
We _have_ to be patient, disciplined and awake, watchful. Without it we
cannot make anything special, and we'll be just pathetic losers.
Besides, there is no freedom which is possible without these properties
(since any{one|thing} can fool us then quite easily -- hint, hint! --
for the fighters for freedom/FSF on the gallery; (-: Just carefully, and
attentively, and the success is guaranteed; the freedom is sweetest
thingie in this...modality of existence, for no jerk can molest you and
since you are what you are then[2]; it would be pity to lose such a gem

I wish you all well and HTML mail is Evil. Still.

simply handling the matter ineptly.

Just checking environment. (-;
Namely, on an other privacy/security related list, of a more general
nature though, it happens that a purely technical question may trigger
surprisingly emotional responses, and sometimes even in a form of a less
or more serious nervous breakdowns (and I mean it, there is
documentation about that). In a bit slighter cases, you could get just a
rant instead of a precise technical answer / response, which again has
its anthropological (and not rarely entertaining) value, that is quite
interesting to investigate, in somewhat different (although still to a
worthwhile extent related) context. But let's put this aspect aside now
and here.
The last time I posed such a "hot" question there, it was right about a
possible, hypothetical, GPGDisk and its shorter technical specification.
Since I got just few mediocre rants in response, well, as expected, and
from usual sources, I thought it wouldn't be bad to try on a more
serious and emotionally stable list (and lo I discover that few usual
ranters are present here as well (-: ). Here I'll give the exact copy of
the question I posed then there...
I wonder if that would be technically hard, and how much, to make a
GPGDisk, an open source version of for instance the PGPDisk (following
the Zimmermann's open source trail).
How much work it would need, in terms of time, working in a `normal'
(not a feverish and similar, allegro furioso twitchissimo and so) tempo?
Would the number of coworkers lighten such a work?
The part "(following the Zimmermann's open source trail)" relates to
Zimmermann's basic definition of Pretty Good Privacy, as it is given in
his "Why I Wrote PGP", for instance, rather than a literal utilization
of his source codes, of course.

Every work should be paid, after the merits, there is no any question
about it.
Well, commercial interest obviously exists, otherwise the "modern" PGP
wouldn't sell even a piece of their...product, no?
Then, there are many variants of licences of the very same product,
depending, for instance, on the types of users. More serious
corporations, companies, governmental organizations and similar will
surely rather pay for a GnuPG than for a modern PGP, particularly with
the current tendency of elimination of proverbially insecure OSs from
significant areas and replace them by more reliable, "transparent" and
stable ones.
Where would be a problem to have a GnuPG licence for them, and a GnuPG
licence for a say "personal use" (as it is practised for instance by
manufacturers of anti virus software - the entire, global, environment
becomes safer and better, and including all sorts of commercial
activities as well)?
I have myself said on one occasion that if by a chance GnuPG were not
freeware, I would indeed pay for it, some reasonable price of course,
say errrmmm, $30, US ?-) rather than to use any other software in this
category, even if they were not only freware but if they would pay me
for this, seriously, and I meant it. As things stand, right in this
moment, this is most quality software in this category, still, despite
the recent discrete signs of tendency of giving up under the non-FSF
subtle pressure. (-; Its huge advantage is, besides, its "transparency"
and that it can be modified, quite legitimately, to suit user's specific
Therefore, GnuPG has a real and strong potential to be a commercial
software as well. It just depends on how it will be presented (and of
course of its capacity to preserve and maintain its independence).
The very same stands then for a potential GPGDisk.
I doubt that for instance the governments (or any more serious self
respecting company) that switch to safer systems are not aware of the
difference between say GnuPG and modern PGP. No chance. (-; If they
switch to these system then it means that they think. If they think then
they know the difference. They don't ask ranters and twitching faces for
expert opinion. (-:
By the way, is it possible to make this hypothetical GPGDisk in a way
that it could make different file systems in one "container", say one
container with three partitions: minix, ext2, win32/ntfs and so? Or even
each individual container with different file system, with no partitions

Okay; I thank to both of you, Werner and Benjamin. -- Yiiik, it's
already 26th! Well, the submission with the URL to PNGs, design concept
and technical data has been sent (with no obscenities...this time (-, ),
so we'll see what will happen...
Good luck to all. (-:

People who don't know what to do with (donated) money? Appoint me your
treasurer and with a small provision the problem is solved. (:

Hmmm... Axis of Rudeness.

The FSF is charitable organization??[2] If I had kicked my bucket
yesterday I wouldn't know that today.
(I just wonder what Stallman would say on this...)
Now that made my evening and in the same time explained the Salvation
Army melodies, vocabulary and arrangement in announcing the ten bucks
donation at the time of Catholic Christmas. (-:
I don't know if they allow contributions lesser than or equal to ten
bucks to be...err...revoked.
Anyway, to the Orthodox Christians here, if any, merry the nearing
Christmas, and to the husbands, if any, Merry Wives of Theirs.
With or without a ten bucks. (:
