@_subject: Problems with signing 
I am using GnuPG on my Debian 2.2 System and it looks like I just can
not sign any mails. Whenever I try I get the following message:
gpg: skipped `0x5BF89165': secret key not available
gpg: signing failed: secret key not available
But of course the key is where it is supposed to be. I even tried to
generate new keys but it didn't help.
I am using Mutt as MUA, encryption works fine.
I would be grateful if you could give me any advice.
