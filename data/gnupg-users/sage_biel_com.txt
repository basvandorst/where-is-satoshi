I get this error from the keyserver
Key block in add request contained no new                                       keys, userid's, or signatures.                                                  Your key block contained 1 format errors,                                       which were treated as if the erroneous elements                                 hadn't been part of your submission.                                            The errors were outside of any PGP public key;                                  maybe you didn't send a public key block at all.                                Anyway, the last error encountered was:                                         Key block corrupt: signature without key
What did i wrong ? I only wanted to "delete" my old
 key from the server :)
Thanks for your help!
Kind regards Markus
