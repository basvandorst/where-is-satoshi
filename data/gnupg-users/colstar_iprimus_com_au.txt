Hi all,
I was wondering if anyone could explain to me how to use gpgme.
I have compiled it into gpgme.lib, but cannot seem to get it to work =

I am very new to GnuPG and gpgme.
(I am current looking at the source for winpt to get a better idea of =
how to use it)
Any information would be appreciated

@_subject: gpg--verify ouput stderr 
Hi all,
I am in the process (off and on) of writing a front end for gnupg,
I have most of the features I want working at this time but when I was working on sigs "--verify" I was not getting any output through stdout, to find out
if the clearsigned message was ok. through the debugger I found the results
are comming through stderr instead for the good or bad sigs, Is this the way it is meant to be??
I ended up having to add another thread to read stderr (knew I had to do
it eventually but damn lazy) to get around the problem, I also tried to redirect
the error output to stdout but was not happy with doing this.
my other question relates to key information, It was recommended to me to use --list-keys --with-colons to get the output,
this is fine but I am not sure what the format is of the output.
eg the letters included in the colons ::u:::::
i kinda can guess the meaning but would like solid info on the format
can anyone help me with this?
Best Regards

Hi all,
 I am having a bit of trouble with GnuPG and was wondering if anyone can =
I am trying to feed a file into gpg.exe inside a front end I am writing, =
the problem being gpg does not like=20
the full path name for the file=20
eg. C:\Documents and Settings\Person Here\My Documents\Visual Studio =
And seems to fallover,
It is fine when it is just the root dir C:\file.txt
I can *hack* around this by copying the file to the root dir before =
encrypting and then copy it back prefer not to do that.
Any help appreciated

Another way of making the binary smaller is to use an executable compressor
after stipping the debugging symbols
and thus saving you disk space

Hi Moski,
yes it is possilbe,
I have written a C# wrapper for gnuPG, which seems to work a treat.
It is also very easy to pass the passphrase as a command-line argument. I
dont have a code sample in fron of me but can provide one latter.
Best Regards
