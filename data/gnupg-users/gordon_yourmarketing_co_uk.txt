@_subject: clearsign a variable? 
Just wondering how do you clear sign a variable please on the command line?
I'm running this in a php script...
$emailbody = "reg-city:Ely\n";
$emailbody .= "reg-postcode:CB6 1RA\n";
$emailbody .= "reg-country:GB\n";
$cmd = "echo $passphrase | $gpg --passphrase-fd 0 --no-tty -u
$key --force-v3-sigs --no-secmem-warning --clearsign $emailbody" . "" . " &>
$encrypted_message = shell_exec($cmd);
But it's simply not working.
Does anyone know how I can clearsign a variable without all this file
interaction please?
Many thanks,
