@_subject: Help: Encrypting messages to a Public Key with a revoked UID. 
Hi all,
A while ago I switched ISP and therefore needed to sort out my private key. I've
generated a new UID on my GnuPG key and revoked the original UID.
However a quick test show that I can still encrypt to the old UID.
The handbook states that you can't encrypt to a revoked key, shouldn't the same
apply for a revoked UID??
I'm GnuPG 1.0.4 on SuSE 6.2,
thanks in advance,
Simon Wood.

@_subject: problem submiting key with revoked UIDs to keyserver. 
I'm attempting to sort out the revokocation of an old UID on my public key as I
have change ISP and can no longer collect from this email account.
I have used '--edit-key' and 'revsig' to revoke the self signing on the
appropriate UID. This appears to have worked locally and I can '--export'
and '--import' to another account's key ring. Both these accounts show the UID
as revoked.
But when I attempt to pass this change onto a keyserver (via the web
interface) it doesn't recognise the fact that a signature has been revoked and
                   Your submission has been accepted but contained no new keys,                               identifiers (userid's), or certificates.
Using the '--send' option gives the impression that it has worked, but viewing
the key on the server shows that the UID has not been revoked.
How can I force the 'new' key into the system????
I'm using GnuPG 1.0.4 (patched) on SuSE 6.2 and the kerserver on
