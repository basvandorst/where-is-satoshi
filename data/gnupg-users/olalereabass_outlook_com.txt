@_subject: Request for assistance  
Dear sir/ma,
I hereby humbly seek your assistance with respect to the file decryption.
I installed GPG4WIN  version 2.0.4 and the Open PGP certificate was successfully with a 40-charater fingerprint. "My Certificates" were also created. While attempting to use Kleopatra (which showed my certificate) to decrypt/verify a tgz.gpg file, it continually gave me results in the Decrypt/ Verify Files window showing  (1) All operations completed at 100% (2) Decryption failed.
Consequently, kind bail me out to know what has gone wrong and the possible ways out to decrypt  my files.
Thanks for your anticipated response.
