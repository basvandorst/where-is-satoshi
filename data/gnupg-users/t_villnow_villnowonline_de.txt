@_subject: Problem with Encryption of Mails 
I am using GnuPG 1.2.3 with WinPT 0.7.96 under WinXP
and have following problem - two scenarios:
the decryption of a mail, which the sender encrypted with both my public key
AND his own key (*) fails;
the details are:
- the decryption window shows correctly both keys and following correct
text: "you need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for user 'Torsten
....' "       (that's me)
- after having entered the passphrase and pressed "ok" the following error
message pops up: "Encrypted with RSA Key, ID xyz, 'Joe ...' Decryption
failed: secret key not available."     (Joe is my buddy who sent me the
Obviously the program seems to have "forgot" between those key strokes
somehow that the mail is for me, and expects the passphrase from Joe now.
the decryption of a mail, which the sender as encrypted with only my public
key works as expected:
- the decryption window shows only my public key
- the encryption works just fine
Is this a bug or WAD "working as designed"? - or did I do anything wrong?

(*) my buddy has done this in order to be able to decrypt his own mail again
after sending; this has worked perfectly with PGP on both sides

I seem to be getting confused ...
... I can encrypt a file (using the file manager of WinPT) with both my
buddy's public key and my own key. That one single file I can decrypt
afterwards again, after having entered my own passphrase. The same is
possible with mails I generate.
no - at least not ony ma machine ... :-)
I currently encrypt the mail's body via the clip board, so the mail client
(Outlook 2000) does not interfere during the encryption process. So I
manually generate only one physical mail, and that mail I can decrypt
afterwards again. And my buddy can encrypt this mail as well (using PGP).
