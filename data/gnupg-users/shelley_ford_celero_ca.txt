@_subject: How Do I Overwrite Files in GnuPG? 
I'm trying to overwrite existing files that have been encrypted. I've read that adding --yes and --batch --yes is the way to go; however with both I get:
gpg: Note: '--yes' is not considered an option
gpg: Note: '--batch' is not considered an option
What I'm using:
gpg --output e:\temp\test.txt.pgp --encrypt --recipient recipient at org e:\temp\test.txt --batch --yes
I'm using this on Windows 2016. I'm not sure what I'm missing...any ideas?

This is one of gpg?s little UI idiosyncrasies. '?batch', '?yes' etc. must come before actions such as '?encrypt' on the command line.
