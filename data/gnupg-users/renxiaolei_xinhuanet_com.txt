@_subject: I don't the meaning of this option 
Hi,David Shaw,
=09So, I want to know:
=091, If I use --default-key once, why won't GnuPG remember the=
 last default key I choose?
=092, If I use the two option together, what will happen? It uses=
 the Key indicated by --local-user to sign, and encrypted to the=
 Key indicated by --default-key. It seems that=
 --default-recipient-self option tell me the difference.
Best Regards.
