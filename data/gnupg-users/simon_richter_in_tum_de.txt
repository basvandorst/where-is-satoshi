@_subject: SmartCard as subkey? 
I just got a PPC-Card OpenPGP smart card, and am wondering how to use the
keys on the card as subkeys to my regular DSA key. As an added complication,
I don't have a smartcard reader in the boxen I consider trustworthy enough
to hold my master key. Is there a way I can generate a key in the uni, get
the private key stub that references the card to my other box and import it
as a public/secret subkey?
