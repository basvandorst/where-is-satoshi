@_subject: GnuPG 1.0.5: FAIL: multisig.test 
On OpenBSD 2.8 make check fails in multisig.test for this entry:
-----BEGIN PGP ARMORED FILE-----
-----END PGP ARMORED FILE-----
Question: is the test broken or is gpg 1.0.5 broken?
Putting just this test in a script and removing the
output redirection gives:
gpg: can't handle these multiple signatures

Why do you want that? What's wrong with STARTTLS?
If you want to give the private keys to the MTA then you should use
TLS instead. Either you want end-to-end security (then the MUAs
have to take care of that) or you're happy with MTA-to-MTA security
(then you can use the standard STARTTLS).
If you would just use it for encryption (sender side) or signature
verification (receiver side) then it might have a bit of value over
STARTTLS. But then at least one side has to use *PG in the MUA.

@_subject: GnuPG between Sendmail servers 
Why do you want to use gpg when there is a standard for SMTP,
that is already implemented in sendmail?
STARTTLS is implemented by sendmail (since version 8.11).  You don't
need to write any extra software for this.  You can enforce that
all mails between those two hosts are encrypted (and authenticated).

On OpenBSD 5.3 i386 one test fails:
t-timestuff.c:118: test 17 failed
FAIL: t-timestuff
This patch (hack?) fixes it for me (local timezone is PDT).
