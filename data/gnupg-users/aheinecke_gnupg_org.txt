@_subject: how to use WKD with python3? 
I'll try to answer this even though I don't completely know how to do it in python, but I know how it's done in C / C++.
you can do a keylist with KEYLIST_MODE_LOCATE for a single mbox. If python does not have that (it was added later this mode is KEYLIST_MODE_EXTERNAL | So I think it would be:
ctx.keylist(some_uid, mode=(gpg.constants.keylist.mode.LOCAL | ctx.keylist(some_uid, mode=gpg.constants.keylist.mode.LOCATE)
You can force that only WKD is used in the keylist if you set the auto-key-
locate context flag (gpgme_set_ctx_flag) to "clear,nodefault,wkd".
Good starting points are usually our "run-foo" test tools under gpgme/tests. I usually use them as a starting point and example.
We maintain these tools because we usually use them when developing new features. ;-)
Best regards,
