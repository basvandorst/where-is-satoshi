@_subject: Card fails to decrypt using 4096-bit key 
[sorry, I'm replying from an old mail and as I'm not subscribed I can't

Yes, I can confirm this. I have a recently bought OpenPGPv2 smartcard.
Signing using a 4096R key works just fine, but decryption using an 4096R
encryption key doesn't, with the same error. This is using GnuPG v2.0.19
on Debian sid, with pcscd 1.8.6 (in case that matters).
I don't know if the issue is in GnuPG (wether gpg, gpg-agent or
scdaemon) or in the smartcard, but I can do some debugging if needed.
