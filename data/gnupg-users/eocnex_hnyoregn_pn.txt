I believe default-recipient-self will make gpg encrypt something to
yourself, ONLY if it is not encrypted to anybody else (in other words,
it is a _default_ that is overridden by the --recipient option). This
seems to be consistent with what the manpage says:
          Use the default key as default recipient if option  --recipi-
          ent  is  not  used  and don't ask if this is a valid one. The
          default key is the first one from the secret keyring  or  the
          one set with --default-key.
If you want to have gpg encrypt to you *and* the person you're sending th=
email to, add 'encrypt-to YOURKEYID' to your gpg config file. Be aware th=
at if
you encrypt anything with gpg, it will then be encrypted to yourself and
whoever else you specify. That's nice for emails, but sometimes it's not =
you want to do ;)
It's probably better to configure your mail client to call gpg with the
option '--encrypt-to YOURKEYID' instead. That way, all your outgoing
mail will be encrypted to you and your recipient, so you can both read
the mail, but when you use gpg outside of your mail client, the files
you encrypt will only be encrypted to whoever you want them encrypted

Don't put off for tomorrow what you can do today because if you enjoy it =
you can do it again tomorrow.

@_subject: Getting rid of old uids from my key... 
============================== START ==============================
My key has a lot of old email addresses attached to it, addresses that I
no longer have access to. I know that I can edit the key and delete
them, but if I update the key from the keyservers, all the deleted uids
come back, even if I send the trimmed key to the keyservers first (so
the keyservers are consolidating all the UIDs).
Is it possible to remove these extra uids permanently? Or do I just have
to create a new key?
