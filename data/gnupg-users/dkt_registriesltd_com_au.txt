I believe the system call under Linux to allocated non-swappable
("locked") memory can only be executed by a user with root privileges.
This is probably true on most other Unixes, too, because of the scope
for DoS attacks.
Sorry, I didn't see the original post, but if the user is running
Windows, it won't be possible to "chmod" it. There is an option to
stop this message being displayed. Put the following line in the GnuPG
"options" file:
or use --no-secmem-warning as a command line option to gpg.
The "options" file is generally in the "~/.gnupg" directory or the
"c:\gnupg" directory.

I am attempting to set up interoperability with PGP 2.6.x, but am having no luck finding IDEA.c for IDEA support. In the FTP archive
there is a link to  which
doesn't exist.
Note that I am not in Europe and the European patent on IDEA does not apply here.
Can anyone point me in the right direction for getting this to work?

The patent is apparently valid in Europe (as much as software patents
can be valid, which in my opinion is not at all in regard to mathematical algorithms). I read on a Spanish language page (so I may have
misunderstood) that there is a patent also pending in Japan. I don't
believe the patent is valid anywhere outside of Europe, including the
Has that look about it. (Although, I can't even access the site, for
some reason. Perhaps it doesn't do passive FTP, I don't know.)
Did indeed. :-)
Perhaps someone would be kind enough to email a copy of idea.c and
idea.c.sig (make sure you don't live in a country with dumb export
restrictions, though).

Hi, thanks for that. It would have been obvious in retrospect had I
realised that "dk" was a country code. (I assume it's for Denmark...)

No problem. I've got the files now. I'll let you know how I go with
it (well, at least if I have any further problems!).
By the way, I'd like to thank you personally for all the work you have put into GnuPG. You've made an important contribution to the world.
All the best.

@_subject: Changing preferences 
Content-Disposition: inline
Hi all,
I'm trying to change the preferences for my RSA key to make it use
IDEA encryption. The instructions in the FAQ seem to be incorrect
(they refer to using the "edit" menu, and there doesn't appear to
be any such thing -- perhaps there used to be).
As a work-around, I've put
cipher-algo idea
in my options file, but that will change the cipher for all keys.
Does anyone have any pointers on this (there's nothing in the
handbook on it, either).
David Trudgett
When I use "--edit-key" and "showprefs" on a standard Diffie Hellman
key, it lists Rijndael, Twofish*, etc, but when I use it on the RSA
key, no preferences are shown. There doesn't appear to be any way to
change preferences in either case.
Oddly enough, encrypting with the RSA key used the 3DES cipher by
default, which is the least preferred option for the DH key, and
obviously PGP 2.6.x can't deal with 3DES.
*Should have been the AES!

Content-Disposition: inline
I just tested sending IDEA encrypted email to a PGP 2.6.3i receiver.
At sending time, everything went OK, if you ignore the "deprecated
cipher" warning*, but at the receiving end, the output is (including
the caret G):
Bad of missing CTB_CKE byte
It seems to me that the idea.c file obtained from the site has been corrupted (it was even in DOS text file format! so I
should have taken that as a priori proof of corruption ;-))
If someone has a good copy of idea.c, perhaps they could email it to
me. Werner? I know you have it! :-) Come on, be a sport!

@_subject: attachments 
You must have missed the lengthy discussion about that just today.
The reason is that they are not "attachments" actually, but multi-part
MIME messages with a disposition of "inline", which means they are
part of the message body and are not attachments. Your MUA (Eudora) is
disregarding the "inline" status of the MIME parts, probably because
it is not recognising the "multipart/signed" and/or
"application/pgp-signature" MIME types. This is not very clever of
Eudora, especially since we are not dealing with new standards.
Here is an example from a recently posted message on this list:
Notice the "inline" disposition. The message text followed. Then the
signature followed in another MIME part:
The disposition here is also "inline".
So, I think that the answer here is that your version of Eudora (which
is not the latest one) does not handle multi-part inline MIME parts
correctly (or at least if they happen to be of type "multipart/signed"
or "application/pgp-signature"). Perhaps you could upgrade to the
latest version and/or get Qualcomm to fix their product.

@_subject: Mutt and old-style encrypted and signed messages 
Many of you who use Mutt will no doubt be aware that it takes the OpenPGP/MIME route to message encryption. Fine. I have no problem with
that, since that is the way it should be. But how do I configure Mutt
so that it will also automatically invoke GnuPG to decrypt/verify
old-style messages received? At the present time, if I receive such a
message, I have to save the message to a file and manually run "gpg"
to be able to read the contents.
A related question is: if I know my recipient requires the old-style
format, how do I tell Mutt to encrypt using the old-style and not use
multi-part MIME?

@_subject: Mutt and old-style encrypted and signed messages 
Well, I've found a slightly easier way: when viewing the message, just
press "|" and pipe it into "gpg --decrypt | less". That, together with
the fact that after pressing "|" I can press the UP arrow to re-use
the previously entered command, makes it not too inconvenient. This
still doesn't help me if I want to quote the message in reply, though.
I'm looking for a feature that can trigger a filter based on the
contents of the message, but if it exists I haven't seen it yet.
I've now RTFM and put a "set pgp_create_traditional=ask-no" into my
".muttrc" file. Now I have an extra ENTER to press whenever I send
encrypted email. It would be nice if it could choose based on a
"send-hook" or something. Is that possible?

@_subject: Mutt/GnuPG doc initial release 
This is not strictly true. Let me point out why, because it is a point
that is often overlooked, although someone else on this list did bring
it up just recently.
If I have two messages signed with the same key, I can be reasonably
confident that the same person signed both messages. If I have ten
messages over a period of time signed with the same key, then I can be
even more confident that the same person signed all of those messages.
The point that is often overlooked is that "real-life" identity and
"online" identity are two separate things, and a link does not
necessarily have to be made between them. I know a lot of people online, but with whom I have never met, nor
spoken to, nor seen. This does not mean I don't know them. It simply
means I know the online identity and not the "real-life" persona. The
"real-life" persona is very often irrelevant.
You will now see, I hope, why that statement is wrong. You are
assuming that it is necessary to know the "real-life" persona, whereas
in fact, that is a false assumption.
Indeed, I would, as explained above. However, you may still consider
it not useful to have a high level of confidence that certain messages
are from a particular "online" identity. I would suggest that if this
is the case, it is probably only because email tampering and
falsification is something that happens only very rarely in most
people's experience. If it were ever to become the case that these
things became much more common, then I would suggest your opinion would
quickly change.
