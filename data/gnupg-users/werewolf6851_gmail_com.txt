Just an email to say hello to the list
Been using Linux since 2002, but never
found any my email folks interested in PGP
or GPG.  So finally thought join the email

Oh Aye, have Enigmail plugged in as well.  Before I was using mutt with
gpg,  but moved over to Thunderbird Portable so my email not tied to
just one 'puter or OS.  Though not had lot luck with the Portable run
from wine. (more learning curve) And running it from inside a Truecrypt
file container.
I have gotten signature faults between messages from Firefox/firegpg and
Thunderbird/enigmail with clear signing.  Guess cause I was using inline
PGP and not mime.

I don't know about you but this raises all kinds of red flags...
If using enigmail check that it pointed to the keyrings
You can verify it's on your secret keyring with gpg -K command
There's way to split public key out of the secretkey I think with gpgsplit

Another Pondering as every year need bigger bit sized keys to be secure
Benefits and Cons
Wondering if adding a bigger encryption/signing sub keys to current key
on keyserver leaves the benefit keeping the same finger print? So don't
have inform all your corresondences to get a new key from you?  They
just have --refresh their public keyrings

Just setting old key to expire and Generate a new set, collect

Thanks for the informative Web site (wget a wonderful tool)
But never got a signature myself.  After made my first key, later I
generated a second pair for signing RPM packages on my system. so used
one to sign the other, etc.  So have key with interesting email
addresses. like one use for this list, then another more -business
casual- type contacts.  End of the month Moving to Wisconsin, and hope
find a active LUG, then might actually acquire sigs.
Using that methode kinda like having a keywallet that folks say is you,
and can change out the inside keys as need be, and the outer ID with a
Notarized Signature.  Hmms, that be cool, if A Notary had a key signing
service as well for pgp/gpg keys

I was just wandering, as I did use the 'default' settings for the key

The info at the time if I remember right went on 1024 was more on the
'higher' side of the processor abilities etc lol

*Feeling like a newbie*  You know, I never knew or noticed that the key
ID was the last digits of the fingerprint.  And I use to fit the key id
 on one line, and fingerprint right beneath it on the business cards I
print out at home, like the notation on bottom of my signature.  Guess
with professional printing could set the last 8 digits BOLD or slightly
bigger font.

Hash: SHA1
Myself, use apg or wapg depending on what OS I'm on at the moment. wapg
is a windows version of apg that'll run from a ubs drive, also run
portable version of gpg from same usb drive, then just encrypt info to
myself about password, url, username, etc.  Down side, the secring.gpg
ring stored on it as well.  Will have invistigate making a secring only
for decrypting, (sub keys) with the primary sec key stored else where.
And Rockbox.org if your mp3 player supports it's replacement firmware
has a 'keybox' to store usernames;passwords.

Hash: SHA1
Been trying find references on net etc
Is there way to set which digest mode gpg uses for clear signed messages
 depending on which uid is set as the primary??  Tried edited the uid
with setpref S9 S8 S7 S3 S2 H8 H3 H9 H10 Z2 Z3 Z1 but it still adds sha1
and messages are set with sha1 even while h8 (sha256) first in the list.

Hash: SHA1
That brings up query for using Engimail with ThunderbirdPortable.  It
want the gpg binaries in Apps/gpg dir and the keyrings in Data/gpg.  Am
I to assume the gpg.conf should be with the keyrings (Data/gpg)?
Secondly I wonder if since my key is 1024 bit DSA that limits the algo
usable to say sha1, md5, etc?  Saw a note about "--enable-dsa2" option,
not all applications support this yet. Given latency of the net; is this
note still very relevant or just slight relevant?

Hash: SHA512
That the beauty of Linux usually more than one way to do something
Since I keep my keyrings on a usb drive, I use the command
ln -s /path/to/keyrings .gnupg
cavent that there's no current .gnupg dir.  You could rename current
.gnupg to .gnupg-old then anytime you wanted to point to it
ln -sf .gnupg-old .gnupg
this makes a symbiloc link between the two directories and gpg will see
all /path/to/keyrings as .gnupg

Hash: SHA512
Don't know where to start after looking via google, and thought ask here
asking for a simple CLI instruction in windows I can use to mount my
encrypted volumes
in Linux, use "gpg -d key.gpg | cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/loop0 mystuff
or even key=$(gpg -d key.gpg) | echo $key | cryptsetup luksOpen
there way I can do either these with FreeOTFE in cmd/dos window XP ?
why? cause I use passwords with non-printable characters then encrypted
to gpg file
dd if=/dev/random bs=1 count=100 | tr -d '[\000\012]' | dd bs=1 count=32

Hash: SHA512
Try either putting the line
in your gpg.conf file or on the commandline add the command
gpg --enable-dsa2 --gen-key
Or instead of DSA key, choose to make a RSA key.
All three those options will then open a key size query dialog for you.

@_subject: Recommended key size for life long key 
I carried a 1024 bit key for 5 years (2004-2009). For me it was easy to change over to newer size in 2009 because never been able to get my key signed.  Next set made use of sub keys, in hopes of futur getting them signed, and just using bigger/better sub keys as need arose.  Alas, 5 years later and still not found any other gpg uses so no signatures.

Cheers Martin.
You will have to find your old keys on one of your machines.  Otherwise make a new pair.  hint if make new pair, make a revoke cert for it, but saved in a safe place.  So you can revoke it if you lose the secret key/passphrase.
And for more paraniod leaning about key stubs (secret key without main key, just the sub keys)

With a new key, wouldn't be that bad.  There's a 3k difference between my public key export and public key export with ascii armor.  Part of that is because it has 6 subkeys. (4 of which have expired)
