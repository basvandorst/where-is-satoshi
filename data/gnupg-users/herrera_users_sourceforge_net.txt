@_subject: Beginners question: How to transfer my keys at work 
Dear List,
A beginners question:
What is the best method to transfer my keys (pub/priv) to another
computer, so I would use the same GPG signatures and encryptions at home
and at work?
I'm sorry, this question has probably been asked many times. I just
signed up with the list, and I'm not very adept in manipulating gnupg.
Thank you.
