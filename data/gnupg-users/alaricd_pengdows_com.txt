Correct me if I am wrong but the PDF spec doesn't support internal PGP

considering this
why would you bother with anything less than 2048 bit keys.

No, this is an S/MIME signature, basically SSL technology for emails. as it appears much cleaner in modern email clients than PGP.  But it appears MUCH cleaner than PGP, and and modern email clients validate the signatures automatically, and without additional software.  Also using an S/MIME to sign emails means that I can sign ALL my emails  and they won't scare the unwashed masses, not to mention I get the additional benefit of using the CA as a "Trusted Introducer".

Smartcards are not out of vogue for people who need them.  Those who
don't will be better served by avoiding them.  Do you have a need for
one?  If so, the kernelconcepts card works well, as do Yubikeys.
