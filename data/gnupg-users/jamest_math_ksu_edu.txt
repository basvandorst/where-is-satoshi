I've got a form on a web page that I'd like mailed to myself when someone
submits a filled in copy.  I'm attempting to encrypt the data via gnupg
prior to being mailed
Setup:  Apache 1.3.6/php3.0.11/gpg 0.9.8
As a test I did the following in PHP to send an encrypted file via a
passthru("echo BYE | /usr/local/bin/gpg --batch -ear _MTE_ | mail which shows me an error message from the mail program No message, no subject; hope that's ok replacing /usr/local/bin/gpg --batch -ear _MTE_
with cat | sort results in BYE being e-mailed to me
replacing /usr/local/bin/gpg --batch -ear _MTE_
with /usr/local/bin/gpg --help
results in the help text being e-mailed to me simply opening a shell on the webserver as the user the webserver runs as
and issueing echo BYE | /usr/local/bin/gpg --batch -ear _MTE_ | mail jamest
results in the message BYE being properly encrypted and sent to me
I do not understand why I can sucessfully send the gpg --help command via
the web server but I can't encrypt info.  Any ideas?

Thanks everyone.  Someone on the list sent me a copy of a perl program they used to do the
same thing.  Using it I ended up with the following php line which works
passthru("echo \" $reginfo \" | /usr/local/bin/gpg --textmode --quiet
--home /home/path/.gnupg --batch -ear _MTE_ | mail jamest

What I did was create a private/public key combination for a mythical
user.  I then place the public key to that user in the public keyring of
the user the web server runs as.  Then when the form is submitted I
encrypt the form using the public key of that user like this (in php)
passthru("echo \" $reginfo \" | /usr/local/bin/gpg --textmode --quiet
--home /someones/home/.gnupg --batch -ear _MTE_ | mail -s \"$timestamp \"
Which works fine.  The person that needs to decrypt the messages keeps the
secret key in a secure(? ;-) location and uses it to decrypt.  This way I
was able to keep the private key unavailable to the web server user.
This seems like a pretty decent, secure method to me.  What do you think?
