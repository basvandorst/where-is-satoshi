That I think was the very point of the original post.
The post was not about pro or anti war, it was about the inappropriateness of making such statements on a website about privacy and encryption.  If the discussion doesn't belong on the list, then the same conclusion must be drawn about the image on the site right?  As soon as the image was added, it became a reasonable topic for this

Assuming of course that everyone who has contributed to the development feels the same way, were all contributors consulted on their opinion and taken into consideration?  (since I am not one I don't know, but then again am I since I watch the list and use the software?  or because in the future I might have a bug to report or contribute code?)  If even one contributor feels the opposite way shouldn't their view be expressed in equal intensity in the same manner? ... In which case we hit a point where what the original intentions of the site/development are no longer being fulfilled.... a rather slippery slope to be climbing...

To further my point, I will start worrying when it reads:
Version: GnuPG v1.2.1 Pro-War (GNU/Linux) ...

But possibly if you had loved ones in Iraq living under the conditions put in place by the current regime you might be praying the war continued, or that it started sooner.
In its truest meaning you are correct, but the statement wasn't made before the current events, and if the war was over, it would not be there any longer (granted this is an assumption as well, but a fairly safe one).  There are plenty of ethical statements that could have been made before the war started, or should be made all the time, but the fact that they weren't being made (because that isn't what the site is for) is an indication that now that this one is being made, it is political rather than ethical.  Where was the ethical statement before the war about how the regime was treating the people of iraq?
