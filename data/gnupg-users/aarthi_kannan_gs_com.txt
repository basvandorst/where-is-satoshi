I am using gpg1.2.1.
I created a key using gen-key.
When I do a -list-keys, it lists my public key fine.
When I do a -list-secret-key, I get the following error:
gpg: keyring_get_keyblock: read error: invalid packet
gpg: keydb_get_keyblock failed: invalid keyring
I have read & write access to pubring.gpg, secring.gpg, trustdb.gpg & random_seed.
Am I missing something here? Can you please help, it's urgent - am stuck on this for a while now!

Here is the command I use:
gpg --home /home/gpgfiles --keyring /home/gpgfiles/pubring.gpg --list-secret-keys

I do have a backup. When I run on a particular directory, the secret key gets listed. I had to cvs it to the server and then I try listing secret keys on the server folder - it fails with the invalid packet error message!
I see the file there in the directory, with the same size. It also has read/write permissions on all the files and also the dir. Is there any other permission that I need?

Based on the error, it looks like your secret keyring is corrupt.  Do you have a backup of it?
