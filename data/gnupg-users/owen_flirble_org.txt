Not sure about your earlier questions, I'm afraid, but I'd guess that

GPG also has "assume yes" and "assume no" options.  If you take a look

This whole thread is completely irrelevant to GPG.
As Werner mentioned earlier, there are more appopriate places to discuss
whether closed-source software is free or not.
I do think, as my two penn'eth, that a list for users of GPG should be
able to receive messages about plugins for GPG on Windows, even if these
are closed source.  I also think that simple announcements about
paid-for products would not be out of place on such a list, so long as
it's not several over-the-top adverts for such a product.
I appreciate that GPG is GPL'd, plugins for using GPG on other systems
might not be and, whilst people might like to debate the philosophy and
ethics of that, could they please do it somewhere else?  :)

Additional Decryption Key.  It was a corporate-requested feature in NAI
PGP that has never been (and, at a guess, is very unlikely ever to be)
implemented in GPG.
Basically, it allows to keyholder (to be forced) to nominate an
additional secretkey that can be used to decrypt any information
encrypted to their secretkey.
The stereotypical usage would be for a
company to ensure that all business comms from their staff were
encrypted with keys that nominated the Company Key as an ADK so that, if
the need arose, the company could decrypt those comms (if the staff
member left / died / whatever).
Obviously, it could also be used to grant law enforcement access, for
example, but I think it would be ridiculously futile to attempt to
legislate that this be mandatory.  Governments just don't seem to grasp
that Bad People won't bother following the law on crypto use and will
just use un-broken crypto.

I can empathise, gpg on FreeBSD 4.4-PRERELEASE can take quite a while to

Frankly, no I don't.  Let me restate, I firmly believe that all mail

irrespective of how secret people want to keep the contents.  I
militantly believe that ~all~ communications should be encrypted.  Then
messages that are won't look out of place.  The only problem is that

I disagree that it is like those at all.  And, tbh, I'm not sure that
I'd find a small vCard attachment an annoyance, or Ascii art, for that

of the reason I sign almost every mail I send is to avail myself of that
Again, you're verging on the inflammatory.  I made two points here,
firstly that I think it's an unfair comparison and secondly that, as it
happens, I don't find the things you mentioned an annoyance.  THe first
was more objective than the second, which was intended to be subjective

Of course.  Thought surely you must also recognise our right to ignore
your complaints and decide that you're complaining about nothing.
I'm sure there will be other people who agree with you but haven't
bothered saying so, but I feel I must point out that I have signed
almost every email I have sent in the last three years and you are the
~only~ person to have complained.  Ever.
Does that make me selfish or you oversensitive?  :o)
But you could, surely, set your client not to verify signatures unless
you decided you actually wanted to.  pine has a pipe command -- I would
be stunned if mutt didn't too -- it would allow me, if I chose to do it
this way, to authenticate only the messages I chose to do so.
That sounds like exactly what you seem to want.  That way, you don't
need to request that it check the signature, unless it's a message you
deem important enough actually to have merited signing.
Indeed.  Life would be very boring, if we didn't have contrary opinions
to discuss...  :)

It is much more likely that they are just trying to prevent virus
The software that was mentioned is MIMEsweeper.  It is a mailserver
antivirus application that quarantines infected mails, or dubious
attachments, such as VBScripts.  Presumably this one is set to
quarantine encrypted messagews (or PGP/MIME attachments, maybe).  I
would guess that the IT manager responsible doesn't even necessarily
realise that this is the case, or at least does not realise the
consequences of this policy.
The company I work for installed a similar application some time ago and
it also was set, by default, to quarantine encrypted emails -- simply
because it could not scan them to see if they were dangerous VBScripts,
for example.  As soon as I explained the folly of this policy -- and
that I needed to be able to send encrypted emails in order to be able to
do my job -- the policy was changed.
Yes, that Deutche Post is doing this is very poor -- and users should
complain to Deutsche Post about this policy -- however I seriously doubt
that the policy is deliberately malicious.
Just my two penn'eth,

I am so not the best person to be asking this, but I believe this is to
do with your file permissions on the GnuPG executable.  As well as the
regular (755) perms, you can set a higher digit.  If you chmod 4755 and
the executable is owned by root, then the executable should always be
run using the permissions of root.
I'm sure I'll rapidly be corrected, should I be wrong...  :o)

I very much agree.
There is?  Would someone mind sending me the URI?  I keep failing to get
round to installing the IDEA plugin and I don't have a busy weekend
planned this weekend  :)
Am I right in thinking it's solely a patents / IP issue that prevents
IDEA being in there by default?  I know someone's answered this for me
before (prolly more than once), I just forget.  Sorry all  :o)
All the best,

I think (as I mentioned earlier) that would be a great idea.  Newbie's
aren't likely to think of looking in an FAQ, they're more likely just to
read it, go "Huh?" and then worry why it's not worked right (when, in
fact, it has).
Imho, the best suggestion was from Ricardo Signes in
Whether or not other messages, warnings and errors need explaining, is
another matter entirely.  I'd say that, on the whole, they don't.

I'd say that's probably the case for most people on this list, tbh...

No, I'm not sure that's the issue.  I've seen something very similar.
I've a feeling what is being complained about is that the signature is
1348 older than the key it signs.  Iirc, I have exactly that problem on
one of mine own keys, but I've never bothered investigating why...

Sorry, off topic, I know, but possibly of interest and I haven't seen it
commented on here.  There's a healthy couple of threads about this on
the UK Crypto list, which is definitely a more appropriate place for
further discussion (though check the archives first, eh?  :o)  See
 for more
info on that list.
 and  are good sites for
further information on this.  The proposed law affects traffic data
~not~ content (so email headers but not Subject: lines or bodies; web
domain accesses but not individual pages; who you've called but not what
was said), but traffic data do include the position information sent by
cellphones every few minutes, so they ~do~ include a complete record of
your movements, if you keep your phone with you.
What is being proposed, in brief, is to open up the list of who can
request access to these data ~without a warrant or judicial oversight~
from being law enforcement, intelligence services, Inland Revenue and
Customs and Excise to include just about every organ of state in the UK.
This really is a big deal, guys.
I've waxed lyrical enough.  I'll leave y'all to it (and apologise again
for the off-topic-ness), and point you all to and  again, and suggest that any UK residents here
communicate with their elected representatives.  I'd recommend
 , but then I would, as I'm one of the
volunteers behind the site.
Thanks for bothering to read this far, now go do something about it!

Have you set up a display-filter ?
One of the lines in my .pinerc reads:
   display-filters=_LEADING("-----BEGIN PGP ")_ /usr/local/bin/gpg --decrypt
, and it processes everything quite nicely.
Can you decrypt on the command line ok in that OS?  It's not a problem
with having ported your secret key from Windows to a unix, is it?  (I
think that one's in the FAQs, but you need to set your passphrase to be
an empty string whilst you port it)
