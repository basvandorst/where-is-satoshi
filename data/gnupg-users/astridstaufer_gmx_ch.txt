@_subject: Encrypted large files cant decrypt 
I encrypt with the folowing command on a server a backup and send it on an
other server over FTP:
"tar -czf - $mysql_backup_file $directory_to_backup | gpg --no-tty --batch
--always-trust --recipient $id_number --encrypt | curl --netrc-optional
--silent --show-error --ftp-create-dirs --retry 10 -u $ftp_user:$ftp_pwd
ftp://$ftp_host/$ftp_dir$full_backup_file -T -"
This works with some Backups around 35Mbytes. But I've tested it also with
an 2.79Gbyte large Backup-File. It runs to the end, but the final encrypted
File is corrupt. When I try to decrypt it, it says, "no encrypted data
Has, someone an idear, where the problem could be?
Thanks a lot!

Hm, I dont think, that it has something to do with the pipeline, because this
was only the last step in my testings. Firstly, I executed each step
separatly and generated with each step a new file. Because I thought the problem is somewhere withe the size of the files that
I generated on the server, I changed to the pipeline-methode, so that I
never have on server 1. a complete file (streaming). The Support of the server said also, that there are no limitations in
filesize or execution time.
So I came to the conclusion, that the problem can be only in the
GnuPG-funktion. Maybe some configurations of GnuPG I haven't taken into
account or a bug in GnuPG?
Thanks for more ideas!

I have also noticed, that the GnuPG-function runs throught the complete file
and just at the end it interrupts. So the resulting file is as large as the
original or even a litle bit larger.
Thanks for more ideas!

So, problem solved!!
For everyone, who have the same problems:
I've solved my problem, by spliting the 2.7Gbyte archive-file in pieces of
1Gbytes. So it sems, that GnuPG has a problem with files larger than
2Gbytes, or there is a setting by my host, whitch caused in this problem, in
spite, that they said, that they have no limitations in time or filesize.
Thanks anyway for your posted help!

Thanks for your help. I've ran the script, as I've posted above. And I cant find a failer. So it
must have something to do with my hoster.
