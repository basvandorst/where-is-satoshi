@_subject: nested verification? 
Is there a built-in way to reverse the double-dash mangling for nested
clearsigned messages?
This is a somewhat contrived example:

Thank you for your suggestion, I tried it with the version of gnupg
that came with Ubuntu, then again with the latest version, but I don't
seem to be getting any output.
What am I doing wrong?

@_subject: crypto games 
Hi. This is perhaps a bit off-topic, but I'm not sure whether there's a
better forum.
1. Are there any video games which are educational about public key crypto?
I mean the best practices around use of modern crypto, not games focusing
on break-classical-encryption puzzles.
2. Are there any moderately-expert crypto users who would enjoy chatting
about public-key-crypto-educational video game design?
(e.g. via IRC or instant messenger)

The question is how to distinguish yourself from a nation-state's covert
agency purporting to be an individual interested in anonymity; you need to
do something that the agency would find difficult to do.
Getting your name and key into difficult-to-corrupt archives will start a
timer - eventually you can point to the archives as evidence that you are
not a newcomer. Even an agency would find it difficult to change history.
Spending money or effort forces a covert agency to also spend money or
effort to replicate your behavior. For example, if you sent someone a
bitcoin, they would have to spend some dollars to establish themselves as
comparably credible. Unfortunately, they have deep pockets. Effort might be
preferable to money, since leaves more ways that a covert agency might make
a mistake, behaving in some characteristic way (e.g. some sort of automatic
authorship attribution software might become available that revealed them
to be a team rather than an individual). Steady effort at releasing patches
over a decade might be moderately credible.
