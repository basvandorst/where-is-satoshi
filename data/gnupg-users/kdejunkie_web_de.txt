Hi there,
when creating new keys with GnuPG 1.2.2 I saw that both Twofish and=20
Blowfish are not part of the available ciphers of those keys.
None of the 2 has been broken and newer versions of PGP support both of=20
them, so what happened ? I'd like to know if there are security=20
concerns, since I've always been a fan of both ciphers.
Thanx in advance.

Oh, I didn't know that, you're right:
Can the users be confident that GnuPG never drops those ciphers which=20
may never be supported by PGP (in the case of Blowfish), but have=20
(almost) always been a part of GnuPG ?
