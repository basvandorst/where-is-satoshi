In this case passphrase is needed to decrypt private key from keyring.
Becuase of passphrase is not provided gpg-agent can't give gpg the
private key. Private key exports in cleartext.

Yes, I confused it with OpenSSH key output, sorry.

I'm sorry, reason is I replied only to mailing list without sending
message directly to your address.

@_subject: use gpg-agent for ssh login 
gpg-agent will list identity only if key has Authenticate capability
and it's keygrip is listed in ${HOME}/.gnupg/sshcontrol
To get key's keygrip you can use "gpg -K --with-keygrip". You want to
list keygrip of the specific subkey with the Authenticate capability,
not it's primary key.

@_subject: A postmortem on Efail 
Thank you for the postmortem.
I don't know any users of GnuPG who still have to work with non-MDC
OpenPGP messages (frankly, don't know any GnuPG users IRL, but working
on it). But it seems to me that GnuPG is so widely widespread because
it was so stable and there was no breaking upgrades, so users didn't
expect any breaking change at all.
I, as a user, don't need support for non-MDC messages and surely PGP
2.6, but I can imagine how challenging it can be to upgrade a system,
which was state-of-the-art years ago, but right now is obsolete. Really
it's not an upgrade, but rebuild from the scratch. And some parts of
the system are probably proprietary, so cooperation from vendors is
required. And the fact that obsolete features weren't dropped due to
users feedback means that GnuPG upstream understands this too. But
something has to change, it can't go like this forever, we do need
breaking changes to remove outdated parts. I trust upstream's judgement.
