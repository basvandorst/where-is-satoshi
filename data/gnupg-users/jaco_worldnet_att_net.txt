@_subject: How do I do "wipe" in WinNT 
Well, as far as I can ascertain from the man page, only the c,u,A
attributes are not supported by the Linux kernel code -- as of 10/99,
anyway.    BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
          As of ext2 fs 0.5a, the `c' and `u' attribute are not hon­
          oured by the kernel code.  As of the Linux 2.0 kernel, the
          'A' attribute is not yet supported  by  the  kernel  code.
          (The noatime code is still in testing.)
          These  attributes  will be implemented in a future ext2 fs
          version.
   E2fsprogs version 1.17     October 1999 However, if so, I'm not sure how it would be automagically incorporated
with GnuPG?
