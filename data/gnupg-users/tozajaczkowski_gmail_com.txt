@_subject: gnupgp basics - using same keys with multiple local accounts 
Hi All,
I have installed gnupgp on Solaris 10 and created a pair of keys for
myself and imported key from my client. I need use same set for
different local account - unfortunately whenever I try to change the
folder with --homedir option I am ending up with:
gpg --homedir /my-folder
gpg: WARNING: using insecure memory!
gpg: please see  for more information
gpg: Go ahead and type your message ...
Is there an easy way how to share the keys between different OS local accounts?
