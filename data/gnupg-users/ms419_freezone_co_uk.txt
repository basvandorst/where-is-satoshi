I don't get how to receive keys using using the "http" & "finger" keyserver schemes.
I tried some variations on -
- but nothing I tried worked. Receiving keys from "ldap" or "hkp" keyservers is no problem -
Frustratingly, I couldn't find examples on the web or in the documentation of using "http" or "finger" keyserver schemes. Can anyone

IC - thanks for the excellent information, David & Nicolas!
I added a "sig-keyserver-url" & "keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve" to
my gpg.conf, & sure enough! verifying data signatures retrieves my
key from my preferred keyserver, if it's absent -
I also tried signing a friend's key, but either key signing doesn't
include my "sig-keyserver-url", or I'm not correctly verifying the
signature - "gpg --keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve --list-options
show-keyserver-urls --check-sigs" doesn't retrieve the key with which I
signed my friend's key, if it's absent.
More insight?
