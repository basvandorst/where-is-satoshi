I've tried to encrypt a message for a friend who's using PGPfreeware 6.5.1 Int.
gng (1.0.1) just segfaulted. I fetched his key at:
and imported it in my keyring.
my gnupg options file looks like this:
my mutt configuration (pgp related part):
set pgp_default_version=gpg
set pgp_key_version=default
set pgp_gpg=/usr/local/bin/gpg
I'm using mutt 0.95.3i (which was included in my distro, Debian GNU/Linux (slink))
1. question:
Is it just not possible to use PGPfreeware and GnuPG together, or have configured
anything wrong?
2. question:
when he sends me a signed message, it is not recognized as such by mutt. is this
because of a PGPfreeware<->GnuPG incompatibily, a incorrect mutt configuration or
something else?
such a messege looks like this:
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
blah blah blah
gpg should handle the SHA1 algorythm, shouln't it?
ps: if you reply to this message, can you cc me (i'm not subsc. on the list) please?
