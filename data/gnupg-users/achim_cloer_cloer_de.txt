@_subject: restoring SmartCard key with off-card copy 
Hash: SHA1
Dear Users on this list,
we are planing to deploy PGP in our team with Smartcards.
Currently we are testing and learning...
We found the following problem:
During generating the keys, the pgp card is also generating a off-card
copy. But we fail to import this backup into OpenPGP. The error
message is "User-ID is missing". But the User-ID was given during
generating the key. I can not find any documentation how to handle
this off-card-copy. How to import or how to write it back to a card
Is there anybody who can help me?
Unfortunately I am using PGP with WinXP,
luckily with Thunderbird and Enigmail.
I also tried the command line interface under windows but also without
any success.
  Kim
