@_subject: OpenPGP card usage 
I admit this is a bit odd, but I'm having some elementary problems
using my OpenPGP card.
I got an OpenPGP v2 card and a Gemalto usb reader. Followed the howto
on to initialize the card using the generate command. Everything seems
fine on my personal computer.
Now when I take the card to another computer, with an empty keyring,
shouldn't I be able to make use of my private key stored on the card?
If I run gpg --list-keys I get an empty output, gpg --card-status
correctly shows my card info and if I try to sign an email with
thunderbird/enigmail I get an error saying "Clearsign faild: No secret
What am I doing wrong?
Using gpg4win 2.0.1 (GnuPG 2.0.12) on Windows 7.

@_subject: USB card readers 
I'm looking for a usb card reader to use with gnupg instead of the
OpenPGP SmartCard. I've read about the SCM SCR3320 on this list and I
think it will work.
Does anyone recommends other similar products? It must work on windows
and linux, and should be small enough to be on a keychain.
