@_subject: How to remove a key from keyserver? 
Hi all,
I, mistakenly, generated several keys, sent them to 'subkeys.pgp.net'
and deleted the ~/.gnupg directory while I _had not_ generated a
revocation certificate for any of those keys except one.
Now my question is:
Since all of the keys are for the same email address, how can I remove
redundant keys and leave out only one?

Looks like that's the only way left; an ugly one but better than
nothing.  Thank you,
