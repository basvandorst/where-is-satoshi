for me the question is different, how many person will have to deal
with the keys ? The better is one pair of key per person ! so only one
person know the secret...
if you have five person, one for each bank, the better will be 5 key.
because if you change the person in the future, you'll have some
problem (change the key in each bank)
if you have one person for all bank, so one pair of key seems good...
It is not a good idea that different person know the secret...
The best is to have one pair for each person, even if there are 100
persons that will participate... for the bank, encrypt for one or 100
is the same job, and it wil be easier for you to change one person in
teh organisation (only ask the bank not to encrypt with his key
I don't know if I answer to you... but in security, you have to deal
with copromise between user-friendly and security level
Have a nice day

I hope that the others bank do have such security consideration and
don't send clear message with their consultant !

You may give a try to FireGPG (an extension to Firefox) that allow to
use gpg in the Gmail interface... it's really easy
It will show if the mail are signed even if it's not your mail is not
configured for gpg so you will be able to see if gpp is well
configured, then we can try to find out other solution

2008/6/3 gabrix :
with this error, I suppose that your system don't know our signature.
You have to retrieve them from keyserver.
 I guess that you have imported your friend's signature, don't you ?
Is your mail client configured to retrieve automatically key on
keyserver ? I don't know for Kmail but I think that this kind of
feature existe on other mail client...

@_subject: Encrypting files for many users.. 
Hash: SHA1
OpenPGP is a protocol essentially oriented to the exchange of
information. But can also be used to protect file on your own
You can encrpyt one file for many users, it is usually the case when
you encrypt one message:
Alice want to send a message 'm' to Bob
Alice encrypt his message 'm' with both her key and Bob's key E_{a, b}(m)
By doing this Alice can read her own message later.
Bod will decrypt it with his private key D_b(E{a, b}
So to come back to your problem, do you want to exchange data ? if so,
you can encrypt this data to all the person you want with their public
And when an user is added or remove, you simply encrypt the new
message with or without his public key...
But if you plan to share some space with encrypted files, and you want
people to be added or removed to this sharing, you must re-encrypt the
files with all the current keys wich I thing is a bit annoying if you
have a lot of persons who can access the sharing and a lot of files...
Another important point is that each accessing person must have a
public/privat key...
Your big problem is 'remove' people, cannot those people access data
there were allowed in the past an only be restricted to the new files
? it could considerably simplify thing !

Hash: SHA1
The idea is that gpg allow to encrypt the file for several persons, so
it ask you all the receivers... simply hit the  key to end and it will
encrypt to message.
(user id is everything that can differentiate the key you want to use
amongst every key you own (can be the id, email, name, ...)
note if you encrypt the file with your public key, you will be the
only one to be able to decrypt it.

OpenPGP is a protocol that is used on the end user machine, BY the end
user. It allow them to encrypt the message so that only some selected
person are allowed to read the mail, and it permit to the sender to
sign the mail so the receiver can be sure that the content of the mail
was not altered and is really from the sender.
So, as the administrator, you don't have to install anything on the
mail server. But if you're also in charge with the end user machine,
you have to install GPG on these machine (it is already installed on
most linux distribution).
I don't enter the detail but you really should understand the concept
of public key encryption to explain it to the end users.

First of all, I don't think it's a good thing to have a key that never
expire especially for the first one (when we don't really understand
every aspect of OpenPGP)
Secondly, It seems good, you now have a public private key. You can
export your public key to give it to other person so they would be
able to crypt mail they want to sent to you.
Enigmail allow the generation of the key it's maybe easier than the
terminal for new users, you can therefore use enigmail to export and
send your public key to other people.
You can have a try with me if you want and send me your public key
(it's useless to do those test on the list).
ps: In thunderbird, when you look at this mail, you can clic on the
little pen in the down right of the screen and import my public key
from any keyserver.
