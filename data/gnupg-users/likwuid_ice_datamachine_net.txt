@_subject: GPG Key Photo Removal 
Hash: SHA1
I've just started toying with GPG, and added a small picture to my
key.  It seems though that this is preventing the keyservers from
accepting my key as valid.  I was hoping that there is a way to remove
this photo from my key without having to revoke it alltogether.
Thanks in advance!
