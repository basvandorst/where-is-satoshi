Will anyone offer assistance in providing for automatic passphrase entry during decryption?
It seems that the ' --passphase-fd n'  option was meant for this purpose, however, i have not been successful in its implementation.
Thanks in advance!

Hello group!
The documentation indicates using '--passphrase-fd n' will read the passphrase from stdin.
Does anyone know how to make this work on a Windows system?
I keep asking this in hopes that eventually someone who knows the answer may help.
Thanks in advance
