I am configuring a crypto-stick for use with 4096 bit RSA keys and have run into two problems that look as if they are related to gpg-agent.
The first is that gpg2 somehow fails to ask for the PIN when decrypting a formerly encrypted test file, so I have to use gpg 1.4.x to decrypt.
The other is that after enabling ssh support even gpg1 fails until I kill gpg-agent, then it asks for a pin again but ssh key authentication fails again...
I have described the setup process in
I am not sure what debug data I could provide to get to the bottom of this, so
if someone wants to take a look and needs more info, please CC: to my address...

Ah. It does not seem to get easier... ;-)
I recently got some requests from interested people who wanted to
start using gnupg regularly, but a few first experimental steps showed that it was not quite that easy compiling a set of best practices for a layman to follow. So I thought I check out how it works with a USB crypto token, and so I just followed the claim that the card is capable of 4096 bit RSA encryption using gpg 2.0.19 - not that I needed maximum security keys that Basically, it seems to work now somehow with a combination of gpg2 and gpg1,
but the tutorial might as well be suitable as a scary campfire story ;-)
So if I do interpret this correctly, should it work without any hassle with 3072 bit RSA keys with either gpg1 or gpg2? Or what type of keys would you recommend if I wanted to give someone with basic linux experience and a need for a reasonable level of communication privacy an USB token and a few pages with instructions how to configure and use it, so they would not
be in danger of tripping over their own feet sooner or later?
