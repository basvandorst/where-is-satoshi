Good Day Folks,
I am a retired doc 65 and a scrunch,a Master Bard & Priest to the
Sanctuary of the Healers' Heart, and due to necessity I am becoming
involved in signing and encryption I am somewhere in the mid range of
computer skills better with Linux than Winblow$. I am a total noobe with
both the signing & Encryption. I use T-bird with Enigmail and will have
questions about it's use and some more on the workings of GNuPG . If I
ask something that is common knowledge to you I ask your forbearance and
ask for basic explanations initially. I'm sure that as I learn my
questions will indicate that. I am also a musician, artisan, and writer
as well. I am willing to help others as I learn. Be Well, Be at Peace
and spend loving time with your families as we never know how long we'll
be graced with their presence.
In Service & In Health,
Dr. C.

@_subject: Gnupg-users Digest, Vol 106, Issue 5 
Good day Hauke,
look at the digests. As I look at Digest, Vol 106, Issue 5 I note the
varied issues with SHA 1. I would like the advantage of the SHA 256,
however I was not able to find the conf file. All I found was the
gnupconf.exe file with no practical way to view it. For now I will
assume I've erred and just ask, where do I find the appropriate file?
Sorry if it's a dumb question but I'm new both to this list and
cryptography, so your assistance would be of help. If it's too noob a
question just say so and I'll not bother you folks again. Thanks in advance.
Dr. C.
