Apparently I just now figured out how to use Google ;) Found two flash
drives with built-in encryption & pinpad:
Do you guys have any experience with one of these?

so, it happened again. Since I have neither a scanner nor printer at
home, I had to scan and print some important documents (CV, copies of
some certificates) at my workplace. Scanned them right onto a USB key,
which of course had to be unencrypted and formatted with a FAT file system.
When I got back home, the key with all its sensitive data was gone.
Probably left it somewhere on the train, I don't know.
This is not the first time this has happened to me. I usually encrypt
every mass storage device in my possession; but I cannot use full disk
encryption software at my workplace because of access restrictions.
Also, the standalone scanners require plain FAT, as mentioned earlier.
I was wondering whether there are USB flash memory devices available
that support some kind of hardware encryption, i.e. maybe some USB key
with a keypad, which only exposes a (transparently) decrypted filesystem
to the host computer.
I am using Linux, OS X, and Windows.
Do you have any thoughts and recommendations on this issue?

I never had to install any additional libraries, at least not until
10.7.4. Don't know about ML though :)

Hello everyone,
On Sat, Oct 3, 2015 at 8:23 PM, Crissy Lynn so for whatever reason, this user is obviously unable to successfully
unsubscribe from this mailing list. Will not any of the list
admins/moderators have mercy and remove her email address from the list? I
find the repeated explanations of how to unsubscribe extremely unhelpful,
bordering to disrespect, since it does not provide the kind of help this
users needs. You told her "601 times", she somehow failed equally often, is
unable to comply, so please HELP her already and remove that email address!

Hello Peter,
On Sun, Oct 4, 2015 at 9:55 PM, Peter Lebbing you certainly got a point there. My apologies to anyone who may have felt
insulted. Nevertheless, it can be extremely hard for a not-so-tech-savvy
person to provide a good description of the exact problems they are
encountering. A possible explanation for her weak responsiveness could be
that she was simply overwhelmed by the amount of (undesired) email flooding
her inbox. Who knows. And while I usually always prefer helping people to
help themselves (as you and others did), this approach was undoubtedly
unfruitful here over the course of several weeks. Remote support can be a
very tricky and time-consuming endeavor :) At any rate, thanks to all who
were trying to help. Still, I'm hoping some moderator or admin could simply
remove her address from the list.

we've been using Schleuder2 for many years now, and it has always
worked flawlessly on a medium-traffic mailing list as long as everyone
used OpenPGP/MIME. Inline PGP will cause trouble from time to time.

@_subject: Terminology - certificate or key ? 
Growing up in (East) Germany myself, I've never, ever, heard or read
this word before. I always assumed all padlocks would lock without a
key, hence be "Schnappschl?sser". Never seen or handled anything else.
:) But maybe I'm simply too young, the padlock-without-Schnappschloss
type appears to be kind of ancient?
