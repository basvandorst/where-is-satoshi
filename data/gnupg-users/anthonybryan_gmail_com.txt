@_subject: Automated signature verification for downloads 
Metalink Checker (Python) now supports automated signature
verification for downloads with .metalink files.
.metalink files are XML and list mirrors, checksums, signatures, and
other information, used for improving downloads and automating
advanced features. There are about 20 metalink download clients, from
CLI to GUI, on all platforms, from download managers to Web browsers.
Currently, only the cURL project includes signatures in their
.metalinks and only Metalink Checker supports verifying them.
To try it out, download Metalink Checker [1]. You need gnupg or
gpg4win installed for signature verification.
Go to the cURL download page [2] and get a .metalink [3]
If you don't already have it, import the cURL GPG key (you can find it
at the upper right of [2]) or put it in a key.asc file in the same
At the command line type:
python metalink.py -d -f metalink.cgi
(In most situations, the file would be called
curl-7.18.1.tar.gz.metalink instead of metalink.cgi).
You'll then see:
Downloading to curl-7.18.1.tar.gz

Hi Werner, thanks for replying.
The metalink specification is at
I agree, it's not easy enough to find. That will be fixed.
In case it wasn't clear, the file is downloaded using the mirrors and
checksum listed in the metalink. Then the file is verified using the
signature in the metalink.
The headers are produced by GnuPG when it verifies the signature
(AFAIK). Is there a problem with this?
The metalink is XML and can be viewed in a text editor. The metalink
used in the example is at - I think if you view it, it will be clear what's going on.
Here is the portion of the metalink you would probably be most interested in:
