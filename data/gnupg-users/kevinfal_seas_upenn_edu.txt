@_subject: trouble importing rsa key 
I am having some trouble importing a key to use for verifying security
announcements by my school.
I have compiled and installed the rsa extension
$ gpg --version

Home: ~/.gnupg
Supported algorithms:
Cipher: IDEA, 3DES, CAST5, BLOWFISH, TWOFISH
Pubkey: RSA, RSA-E, RSA-S, ELG-E, DSA, ELG
Hash: MD5, SHA1, RIPEMD160
but, whenever I try to import the attached public key, it doesn't make
it into my key ring.  $ gpg --import security.rsa gpg: public key is 10373 seconds newer than the signature
gpg: key 030FA80D: invalid self-signature
gpg: key 030FA80D: no valid user IDs
gpg: this may be caused by a missing self-signature
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:           w/o user IDs: 1
$ gpg --list-keys | grep 030FA80D
pgp2.6 and pgp5.0 were able to use this key to verify a signed
message, but gpg refuses to accept it.  Any thoughts?

ah, thanks, that fixed it.
Now I just need to convince mailcrypt to use it.
