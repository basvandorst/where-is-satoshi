@_subject: Generating keys for several email addresses. 
I have three email addresses and I would like to use a single secret keyring associated to all of them. What would you say would be the best approach to accomplish this goal? A single key with no email address references? A single key with all my email addresses associated to it (is it possible?)? A key per email address? Any other approach?
Thanks in advance,

Thanks Ben! The manual you told me to look at was very helpful.

Certainly.  You can have multiple "uid" records on a single key, and
this is the recommended way to show multiple identifiers for the same
person on the key.
