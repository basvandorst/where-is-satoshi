@_subject: problem using encryption 
We installed gnupg 1.4.7 on Sun Solaris SPARC 8.
Generated the keys also.
But when we try to encrypt a file-it asks for the UID-how to provide it?
I tried providing the user ID as "xpress (comment)
But no success...
What's the problem-where we are going wrong?
To create the keys again....i deleted .gnupg directory also-is it wrong?.
This is the output of key generation:
bash-2.03$ gpg --gen-key --verbose

RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (2048) 4096
Requested keysize is 4096 bits
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire

Key is valid for? (0) 0
Key does not expire at all
Is this correct? (y/N) y
You need a user ID to identify your key; the software constructs the user ID
from the Real Name, Comment and Email Address in this form:
    "Heinrich Heine (Der Dichter) "
Real name: xpress
Email address: ashutosh.n.sharma at aexp.com
Comment: "GPG Testing....
You selected this USER-ID:

Real name: credit secure
You selected this USER-ID:
    "credit secure ("GPG Testing....) "
Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? 0
Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? o
You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.
We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

Note that this key cannot be used for encryption.  You may want to use
the command "--edit-key" to generate a subkey for this purpose.

what to do with this error-i cannot do a basic encryption of a file.
I have generated a 2048 or 4096 bytes RSA keys successfully but i m not able to
use the keys for encryting some very basic files.

key. But anyway...
gpg --expert --gen-key
Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) DSA and Elgamal (default)
   (2) DSA (sign only)
   (3) DSA (set your own capabilities)
   (5) RSA (sign only)
   (7) RSA (set your own capabilities)
Your selection?
You need Certify, Sign, and Encrypt capabilities which is the default
configuration. Enter Q to continue the process. Be nice, use your real name as
part of the UserID creation.
When you go to encrypt, provide the keyID you wish to encrypt to, eg
The key generation process will tell you the key ID; ie, in the email you sent,
the key ID was 2D64B2BE.
