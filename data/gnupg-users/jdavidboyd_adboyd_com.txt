You _can_ do that.  I have several email addresses associated with my gpg
key.   The problem is that all the 'users' will have to know the pass phrase
to the secret key to be able to crypt/decrypt, which means that any of them
can make changes to your keys.

Wow, that would be a lot of work.  Actually, I didn't even know you could do
that.  GPG is versatile, to say the least.
