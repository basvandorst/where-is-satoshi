@_subject: chrooting gnupg 
Hi list,
does anyone here know by chance, what I have to provide to gnupg in order to run in a chrooted environment? Providing the libs obviously is not enough. I'm suspecting /dev/random or /dev/urandom or sth. the like, but in my tests it did not work properly (hangs) - due to entropy, I'd assume? Got no clue, how entropy is handled in a chroot, nor if this IS the problem. I'd appreciate any hints.
