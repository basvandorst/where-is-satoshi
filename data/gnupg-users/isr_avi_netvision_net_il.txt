@_subject: Identify GPG file 
Hi there,
I just started with PGP and GPG.
My question is: how can I identify GPG files not by their name (e.g. extension) but by their first bytes or file header.
For example ? zip file starts with 'PK' (ASCII).
Although searching the web and reading the GPG documentation couldn't find anything.
