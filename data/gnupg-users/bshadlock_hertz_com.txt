@_subject: GnuGP Error 
Hi there,
We are using GnuGP 1.1.3 on a few PCs, all able to decrypt using 1 public
key.  I can use it on my PC, but a new user on a new PC is getting constant
errors.  I've installed the SW, imported the correct and only key, but
still get the error.  If I log in to the new PC, I get the same error.
I've uninstalled the SW, removed all associated folders and files,
installed the SW again, and still the same error.  Any suggestions?
