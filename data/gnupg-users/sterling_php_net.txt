@_subject: GnuPG in other applications? 
I'd like to integrate GnuPG support into PHP (  Adding an
extension to PHP that would allow PHP to have built-in functions for common GPG
needs (such as sign a document or checking a documents signature).  Does anyone
on this list know how I can access GnuPG (C level, I know how to fork a process
and access the results) functions that accomplish this (I've done some poking
around the g10 directory, I see the functions are at least somewhat abstracted
from g10.c, but I'm no expert processes)??
Many Thanks,
Sterling Hughes

Thanks, but I'm more looking for information on how to integrate GPG support
with another application, like a shared library...
