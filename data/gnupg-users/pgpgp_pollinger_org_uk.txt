@_subject: Using GnuPG within CGI 
Hello all,
I have a formmail set up at:
It uses the more secure (spam-resistant) version of formmail.pl from:
I finally got it working but would like to use GnuPG to encrypt the output
from this form, before it is emailed to me. (I realise this only protects
data between the server and me, but this is OK for my purposes)
Can this be done within a CGI environment? I can use perl, php4, pyton etc.

PGP'd email welcome

@_subject: Bridging the OpenPGP, Thawte and CA Cert webs of trust 
Forwarding this to the list on behalf of Michael Daigle
 - - - - - - - -
I have set up a semi-formal PGP web of trust which attempts to bridge
together CA Cert and Thawte web of trust notaries to provide users
with a web of enthusiastic and sincere individuals who they might
trust [marginally] as introducers.
The project has been getting positive feedback and there are now two
additional notaries beside myself (in the two weeks before launch).
The project assumes a "marginals needed" as three, as so equates to
around 50 trust points - the same CA Cert and Thawte require to embed
your name in your certificate. [Realizing of course that some users
may grant full trust to notaries]
If you are a Thawte notary and use OpenPGP, and would be interested in
joining this organized web of introducers, please contact me directly
or visit  for more information.

@_subject: WASTE - new 'secure' collaboration software 
Hash: SHA1
Hello all,
An interesting new project by Nullsoft[1], the WinAmp developers.
"WASTE is a software product and protocol that enables secure
distributed communication for small (on the order of 10-50 nodes)
trusted groups of users. WASTE is designed to enable small companies and small teams within
larger companies to easily communicate and collaborate in a secure
and efficient fashion, independent of physical network topology."
It's a GPL'd project that combines IM, chat, file browsing/searching
and transfer (upload and download). It uses RSA and Blowfish, and I
thought some folk on this list might be interested.
I found out about this from Need To Know[2] who report that Nullsoft
have withdrawn the source. But it's out there[3], and it's hoped that
others will take it forward, as they did with Gnutella[4].

@_subject: CA Cert (cacert.org) - a new, non-profit CA 
Hash: SHA1
Dear list folk,
[apologies for cross-posting]
Just wanted to mention a new, free CA at It's based on Thawte's CA model, issuing signed X.509 certificates
for email and servers. Some interesting differences though:
 - server certificates are free (or very cheap)
 - any charges are small, and one-off (cf. Verisign, Thawte etc.)
 - they sign PGP keys (as Thawte used to) *
 - it's a non-profit organisation
 - they're piloting a time-stamping service
(* - some problems with RSA v4 keys recently, which should be
resolved soon-ish)
The root CA is not included in browsers, but they're working on it.
One route is via a request for enhancement at Mozilla -  see
  (257 votes as of
For more info, please visit  , and maybe sign up to the
mailman list at I have no connection with CA Cert, other than being signed up as an
assurer (much like Thawte's notary system). Just thought some folk
would be interested in it.
