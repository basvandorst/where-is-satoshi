You say that like encryption related laws are usually sensible.

I can kinda see how it follows from existing rules, but it's still
a bit odd.

@_subject: Setting up gpg on an IRIX web server 
The mlock(3) man page on OpenBSD suggests that regular users can lock
memory, but only up to a preset quota:
-cut-- Since physical memory is a potentially scarce resource, processes are
limited in how much they can lock down.  A single process can mlock
the minimum of a system-wide ``wired pages'' limit and the per-process
RLIMIT_MEMLOCK resource limit.

@_subject: gpg with current pgp keys 
I've been looking into this. IDEA is perfectly legit for commercial
use, but you will need to buy a license to do this.
I can point anyone interested at what (as far as I can tell) are the
right people.
