Try "host -l pgp.net auth01.ns.uu.net".  Could someone tell nac.no to enable zone transfers?  For most of scandinavia (where the closest server is nac.no) pgp.net doesn't work as advertised in the man page.

Yet another problem: Forwarding a signed multipart message inside
message/rfc822 usually changes the MIME delimiters used within the signed
part as well, thus rendering the signature invalid.  RFC 3156 doesn't say
anything about this, RFC 2480 touches on a related topic but is silent on
MUA forwarding.  One solution would be to require MUAs to not modify MIME
delimiters inside signed parts -- does anyone know if any MUA takes this
If you are on ietf-openpgp, you can take the position that these programs
are "broken", but if you want to get something done in the real world, it
isn't as simple IMHO.

Because noone forbids it? :-)
It does make sure you're sending correctly formatted messages, even though the incoming one wasn't.
When you forward a message in Gnus, the message is decoded and put into the message editing buffer.  When it is recoded it will get new MIME delimiters.  It is possible to forward it in a way that preserves the MIME delimiters, but this is not the default.  Maybe it should be though.  Probably.
