As the  message of GnuPG are  really cool, the public  key for keyID
  0xBDDF997A is missing from your public key ring".  Have you migrated
  your secring,  pubring and trustdb  ?  check in your  home directory
  for the directory .gnupg
  Hope this helps.   adulau

No, I don't think so. Open/Free  Hardware is a way for the future to
  remove the plan for DRM (Digital Restriction(-Right) Management) and
  to guarantee  the access  to hardware that  can continue to  run and
  execute Free Software without asking permission to an "authority". Ed Suominen write :   This  signature could  generate  a flame  war.  Forget the  Patents,
  forget IDEA (as GnuPG does) and build Free Software.   just my .2 EUR.   adulau

You should remove the 1.0.6 with rpm (rpm -e). rpm -e gnupg-1.0.6 (Before that make a backup of your keyring)
Hope this helps.
