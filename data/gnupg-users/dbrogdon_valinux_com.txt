@_subject: Error verifying signature 
Pardon me if this has been posted and answered but I've searched the
list archives and have been unable to find a solution.
Whenever I sign and encrypt (or just sign for that matter) a file, and
then try to verify the signature, I get the following error:
  gpg: verify signatures failed: unexpected data
What might be causing this error?  I'm using GPG version 1.0.2 on Red
Hat 6.2.
