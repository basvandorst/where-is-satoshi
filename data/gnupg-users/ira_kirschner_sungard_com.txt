@_subject: encrypting multiple files into a single output file 
We are converting from using PGP to using GnuPG and we are trying to make it seamless to our customers. Using PGP, when we had multiple files to  deliver, we could have each file encrypted and placed into a PGP archive. The client could then decipher the archive to extract al the encrypted files.
Is there a similar function using GnuPG? If I use tar or zip then our conversion to GnuPG is not going to be seamless to the client.

@_subject: encrypting multiple files into a single output file 
With PGP you can do something like:
This will create a single "output file name" with the entire "filelist" each individually encrypted.

what is the format of the archive you were used to creating with PGP?
Are you talking about PGP's "self-decrypting archive" format?
Or some other format?  If you're not sure about the details, can you
send a small example archive (containing non-sensitive material,
obviously) to the list, or to me privately?

Perfectly simple explanation of what I was doing wrong. Works fine now. Much appreciated.

Ok, so the catch here is that the first command in the line is being
run as user wsc_gpg, but not the subsequent ones. You want want to put
a sudo -u wsc_gpg in front of the second gpg command in the pipeline as
well (otherwise it'll still run as root, and gpg will complain
about .gnupg directory not being owned by root).
Best regards

@_subject: using --multifile to create multiple ".pgp" files from source files 
I have a list of files that I want to encrypt to files with ".pgp" extension because my clients are incapable of changing to ".gpg".
The following creates multiple files "IBK*.gpg" from the source files "IBK*.txt":
gpg --homedir /home/wsc_gpg/.gnupg --always-trust --force-mdc --batch --yes -r  -e "IBK*.txt"
I know that I can force it do one file at a time by specify the -option, but I would really like to do something like:
gpg --homedir /home/wsc_gpg/.gnupg --always-trust --force-mdc --batch --yes -r --output *.pgp  -e "IBK*.txt"
Is this doable?

@_subject: --textmode not retaining the originating EOR 
I am in the midst of changing my RedHat Linux environment from using PGP to
GPG (1.4.5). When I previously deciphered a client provided ".pgp" file, the
resultant file was CRLF terminated. No matter what I have tried using gpg to
decipher the same file, the resultant file is always LF terminated.
I have tried:
o  gpg --batch --yes --no-mdc-warning --skip-verify --passphrase $PHRASE -o
outfile.txt --textmode -d infile.pgp
o  gpg --batch --yes --no-mdc-warning --skip-verify --passphrase $PHRASE -o
outfile.txt --no-textmode -d infile.pgp
o  gpg --batch --yes --no-mdc-warning --skip-verify --passphrase $PHRASE -o
outfile.txt -t -d infile.pgp
All three of the above resulted in identical files with LF as the EOR. PGP
results in the same file but CRLF as the EOR.
What should I be doing to create a resultant file in the same manner that
the client created it?

@_subject: --textmode not retaining the originating EOR 
I don't understand your answer. The original encrypted (.pgp) is provided by
a client that transmits the file to me using a binary transmission. On my
Linux server when I previously deciphered the file, it resulted in a file
with CRLF as the EOR. When I use gpg, the result is LF as EOR.
Is there any control over the gpg decipher process that says don't default
to the local EOR but use what was stored in the file?
