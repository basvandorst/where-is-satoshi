@_subject: inline problem 
I figured it out. It turns out to be a bug in HP's C compiler. Following are the details of my discovery.
First, when I ran configure, the only option I gave it was Make then dies on the first file, ./intl/intl-compat.c. Below is the transcript from "make".
Making all in intl
         cc -c -DLOCALEDIR=\"/opt/gnu/share/locale\" -DLOCALE_ALIAS_PATH=\"/opt/gnu/share/locale\"  -DLIBDIR=\"/opt/gnu/lib\" -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I.. -I. -I../intl  -g -Ae -D_HPUX_SOURCE  intl-compat.c
*** Error exit code 1
Searching through config.h for references to "inline" turns up the     if it is not supported. */
Nothing more.
Looking through config.log shows this:
configure:5264: checking for inline
configure:5281: cc -c -g -Ae -D_HPUX_SOURCE  conftest.c >&5
configure:5284: $? = 0
configure:5287: test -s conftest.o
configure:5290: $? = 0
configure:5301: result: inline
configure:8008: checking for inline
configure:8045: result: inline
I then boiled this down to a test case to find out why autoconf senses a working "inline" keyword, but having it die when you try to use it. Suppose you try to compile this:
static inline unsigned foo(unsigned bar)
This will compile just fine. However, if you try to compile this:
typedef unsigned UINT;
static inline UINT foo(UINT bar)
You get this:
If you remove the "inline" keyword, it compiles just fine. So, we have a choice. We can either remove the inline keyword, or remove the typedef. I tell you, there is nothing I hate worse than bugs in one's tools. I'll need to report this to HP. In the meantime, perhaps some of the GnuPG programmers can add a work-around for HP's broken compiler. ;)

@_subject: Removing passphrases and setting output file? 
Decrypting a file will require either a secret key with no passphrase or a passphrase supplied via a file descriptor specified on the --passphrase-fd option. If the file containing the passphrase is as readable as your secret ring, you might as well not have a passphrase and save yourself some work.
Encrypting a file should not require a passphrase unless you want to sign it too. --output should work in order to set the name of the output file. What is the command line you are using for encrypting?

I ran into this when importing my keys from PGP. I had originally created my keys in 1997, and apparently the IDEA algorithm was in vogue those days. Somewhere along the line the default algo changed, and had I ever changed my passphrase during the next five years, the algo would have been automatically changed for me. Because of this, I had assumed that PGP and GPG were not interoperable. Silly me...

Another solution would be to make sure that you encrypt the file to all the users who should be able to decrypt that file. You can have multiple "--recipient" entries on the command line. Check out the "group" functions as well to simplify this process.

@_subject: Query on GPG - should I install GPG in every system? 
Hash: SHA256
GPG is primarily used to secure communications between individual users. To that end, the private key is just that -- private and would be trustworthy only if it is available to its owner exclusively. Using a server-based solution would require all users' private keys residing on the server. The fun part is then how to allow users to decrypt their private keys in a secure manner over a network -- not possible. Therefore, GPG should be installed on each user's workstation and have each user create their own keys.

Not likely. To do so would require uploading your private key to the various services assuming that they have built the necessary web pages to prompt you for your encryption passphrase, etc. This would make your private key accessible to anyone on the service (an administrator) and would nullify any security benefit.
Indeed, the only way you can ensure security using public-key cryptography is to ensure your exclusive access to the private key itself. There is probably a way to use public-key cryptography using webmail but would be really cumbersome to use.
Barring the use of digital signatures, it is conceivable to design a webmail system whereby you could send encrypted emails if the public keys of the recipients could be loaded onto the webmail servers. But does that really solve the problem? Without the private key to digitally sign the email, anyone could forge an email as if from you.

@_subject: Importing my keys fails 
The keys themselves are similar at a basic level. But the packaging  and data file formats are not interoperable. An SSH key file is not  much more than the key, but an OpenPGP key also contains elements of  identity such as email addresses, etc. as well as signatures from  other users.
With some work, you could probably extract the RSA key data from the  PGP key and convert it to the format used for OpenSSH, but honestly  it isn't work the trouble.
There is also some effort to make OpenPGP and X.509 certificates  somewhat interoperable since they have more in common in both content  and purpose.
Someday there might be a grand unification of all things PKI, but I'm  not holding my breath.

I would like to set up a keyserver at my business for a small number of users (c. 100). I've tried to build the latest versions of PKS, CKS, and SKS, but these projects haven't been updated in a long time and no longer build because of old library dependencies.
Does anyone on this list manage a keyserver and if so, what are you using?

@_subject: keyserver 
I considered the use of LDAP since I just recently built an OpenLDAP  server for us to use for centralized user authentication and it would  fit right in. But, from what I understand about using LDAP as a  keyserver, one would lack the key-data merging capability since LDAP  servers don't know about OpenPGP-specific data.
When GnuPG submits key data to an LDAP server, does it perform  merging (read-modify-write) or does it just submit the local copy of  the key, overwriting the previous key?
I was able to get PKS to compile on Linux and it works. My problem  was initially with trying to build on OS X since the db2 configure  script is so old that it doesn't recognize Darwin. I pulled the pks- current code which uses the DB4.1 database and got it working on  Linux. But it doesn't support some of the more recent OpenPGP  features (attributes). (I'm not sure that that is a show-stopper,  I was intrigued by CKS but it's dependency on the defunct RpSQL was a  show-stopper, and using PostgreSQL as a back-end is some serious over- kill for an access pattern that never changes.
SKS seems good but the use of yet another oddball language (ocaml) is  annoying and I ran into problems with it trying to compile on SuSE  Linux -- I'll bring those issues up on the SKS list if anyone there  is still participating.
I noticed, David, that your name is one of the contributers to the  PKS project. I was hoping that the GnuPG project might "adopt" the  idea of a keyserver and run with it, keeping it up to date. Has the  idea of public keyservers run out of steam?

Do you get the same result when using the current version of GnuPG  (i.e. 1.4.5)? Is the file sent ASCII armored? When you say "sends"  what is the method (FTP, email, etc.)? If using FTP, is the transfer  method text or binary? Is one of the computers in question using  Windows? What is your customer using for encryption (PGP, GnuPG)?
You say that "they" asked you to research the error message. Who is  "they"? Are they receiving the error message when encrypting or are  you when decrypting? Or are they receiving an error message when you  encrypt a response file to them?

I was thinking: OpenLDAP supports external modules. Perhaps an  approach to supporting signature merging in LDAP would be to write a  module that could perform this activity. Just a thought. That might  be taking the LDAP server beyond what an LDAP server should be though...

You need to import the key in order for gpg to use it. Use the "gpg -- import" command. You will then need to sign the key so that gpg  considers it "valid" using the "--sign-key" command or using the  "sign" sub-command from inside the "--edit-key" menu.

@_subject: how to create a symmetric cipher  
When you encrypt to a person's public key you are not using the  public key to encrypt the data. First, a random session key is  generated and used to encrypt the data using a symmetric cipher. Then  only the session key is encrypted using the public key and appended  to the file. The recipient uses his private key to decrypt the  session key which is then used to decrypt the data via the symmetric  cipher. This way you avoid passing symmetric keys in the clear.
If you are looking to build a custom solution, you might be better  off looking at the OpenSSL crypto API.
