@_subject: GnuPH with PHP / install 
Been searching the web for the last 3 hours inconclusively and hope someone here can advise how-do-to:
Trying to access Gnupg on new server with Centos5 and cPanel and  PHP5.
GnuPG is available in the server's root directory which is not accessible with PHP from domain/accounts on the server.
I need access to gpg with PHP through accounts on my server such as:
through cPanel I can also install(& have) public keys for each domain/account, but cannot access gpg in the server's root directory.
Any advice will be greatly appreciated,
