but, if i sign your key, and you add a sub-key, that carries my signature,
just the same as your original key that i signed... my understanding of
PGP/GPG is that it's easy to "go back in time" and add a sub-key, so it
would appear that the sub-key was also signed.
in one case (based on a signed email) one might (or might not) explicitly
sign a new key... in the other case (a new sub-key is generated) one has
implicitly (and unknowingly) signed the new sub-key.
anyway, it does kinda make sense that a trust model should devalue
signatures as they get older....

@_subject: Signing or Encrypting to the Full Extent... Is It All About Key 
Hash: SHA256
heh... whatever you do, don't do what i do  ;)
i have a habit of pushing the limits of pgp.
signatures of SHA-256 hashes can not be generated in 1.2.x branch of GnuPG... the development branch is not recommended for general i noticed that you signed your message with a 4096-RSA key 0xD60DAC97. when 1.3.x development becomes 1.4.x stable, then you'll be able to sign messages with SHA-256 (keep reading for reasons *not* to do that)... most people, however, use DSS primary keys and will be unable to use that with any hash larger than SHA-1 (not that there'd be any point in doing that, since the key is limited to 1024).
of course, i would recommend adding 1024-2048 subkeys (to your 4096 key) for signing and encryption. that should be sufficient for the near term future, and you can always revoke a subkey that's too small or compromised, and replace it with a bigger subkey. and if that happens, you can still keep the same primary key and all signatures you collect on it... i suspect that in the not-too-distant future DSS will be abandoned, and with it a lot of signed keys.
i was asking some SHA-256 questions on the development list, not long ago, and one fact that was pointed out to me is that SHA-256 isn't ~necessarily~ stronger than SHA-1... it's not the same thing, only bigger; it's a different algorithm that hasn't been around as long, hasn't been studied as much, etc. history might prove that it's actually weaker than SHA-1... and support for SHA-256 isn't nearly as widespread as support for SHA-1, so if you send a message to someone using PGP-x, they may or may not be able to verify your signature.
OTOH, if one assumes that SHA-256 really is stronger than SHA-1, then it would be arguably more secure to sign messages with it... remember, you're not signing _the_message_, you're signing a _hash_ of the message... so, if someone wants to forge a signature they can do it by attacking the hash function... a larger hash (assumed to be more secure) would thus be harder to attack.

Hash: SHA256
that will still produce different output using the same input, because the user supplied passphrase is salted... try this a few times with the same passphrase, and you'll see different output:
 	echo test | gpg -ac
that's also salted, but you can use it for password verification by specifying the salt.
understanding that this is insecure for several reasons (mostly the use of a 4 digit PIN), the easiest way to do this without making it *instantly* obvious (but it would be obvious within minutes) to an attacker, is to add a row to the database and store:
 		md5($pin)
an attacker can't use "81dc9bdb52d04dc20036dbd8313ed055" as a PIN, but you can use that to verify that a user's PIN is "1234".
of course, any system you use to hash a four digit pin can't be any stronger than searching the key-space of a four digit PIN... which is about a 13 bit key-space (will you advertise that this application uses 13 bit security?). it's impractical to think you're safe from a dictionary attack, if the hashed passwords are lost or stolen... how long would it take to run:
 	for n in {0000..9999}
 	do
 		md5 -s $n
 	done
(that syntax works for zsh/freebsd; bash/linux will be slightly different)
on my modest desktop, it takes under a minute to search the entire even if you could encrypt PINs with a public key, without a salt, the 13 bit key-space makes it trivial to find a collision... one would have to assume that an attacker has the public key. if making it more complicated doesn't make it more secure, then keep it simple. using a crypt() function in the database, instead of the md5 method described above, forces an attacker to spend 30 seconds on each PIN, instead of finding all PINs within 30 seconds... i'm not sure if that's a real advantage...

is that the behavior of PGP(tm)? i once helped someone use PGP(tm) and in the 30-60 seconds that i was using it, it seemed to require a signature before it would recognize an imported key... i helped the user to make a non-exportable signature, but i don't recall that being the default.

i don't recall PGP(tm) having the option of "are you sure" for an unsigned key, but i didn't spend much time with it. i was left with the impression that the key couldn't be used unless it had a signature.
one can also use edit-key and assign ultimate trust to a key, which will make it trusted without a signature.

i (or anyone) can generate a key that's identified as "PGP Global Directory Verification Key" and sign any number of keys with it. one can even get a list of keys that have exchanged signatures with the real key and sign all of them. that doesn't make it the real thing, but it sure would cause a lot of confusion.
if i sign your key, and you sign bob's key, that doesn't mean that i should go and sign bob's key (unless i first verify it with bob). sure, i can trace a path from me to bob, but that's very different than signing bob's key because of that path.
signing a key is a statement that one has checked and verified that the key really belongs to the person or group identified by the key. unless that verification is actually done, the only statement being made is that someone is issuing bad signatures.

it seems to be nearly all about personal preferences. personally, i think
1024 is a limiting factor of DSS and that it's usable lifetime is coming
too close to an end; so i use a 4096 RSA primary key, with a DSA subkey
that can be revoked and replaced when the time comes.
some people will say that different algorithms are more secure, faster,
better, etc... or that some algorithms can be broken... in reality, all of
the algorithms used by gpg are good, and on any reasonably recent computer
you won't notice any differences in speed when using reasonably sized
the preferences of the picture, AFAIK, aren't used by anything. there's
nothing wrong with old default prefs, and you can update them whenever you
like... just be aware that anytime you update prefs you generate a new
self-sig; if a bunch of those find their way to the keyservers, you'll
wind up with a bunch of self-sigs on your key... nothing to be concerned
about, except for aesthetic reasons since all but the most recent
self-sigs are ignored.
there are a lot of people with tin-foil hats who argue both for and
against the algorithms used by gpg... no two tin-foil hats are the same.
put a copy of "applied cryptography" under your pillow... if you have a
dream about the NSA breaking a cipher, don't use it.
for now, most everything uses SHA1. if/when you update your prefs, i'd
suggest adding the larger SHA variants... eventually they should come into
common use.

Seems like cryptographers are being questioned when they enter the U.S. these days. Recently I received this (anonymous) comment: "It seems that the U.S. State Department has a keen interest in foreign cryptographers: Yesterday I tried to renew my visa to the States, and after standing in line and getting fingerprinted, my interviewer, upon hearing that my company sells [a cryptography product], informed me that "due to new regulations," Washington needs to approve my visa application, and that to do so, they need to know exactly which companies I plan to visit in the States, points of contact, etc. etc. Quite a change from my last visa application, for which I didn't even have to show up."
I'm curious if any of my foreign readers have similar stories. There are international cryptography conferences held in the United States all the time. It would be a shame if they lost much of their value because of visa

you got that part working?
make another set of keys as user 'xyz'.
you can use "--export-secret-key {key-id}" to export secret keys, and a secret key be in more than one keyring. this is probably the best way for you to use both IDs with both users. in each users ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf just add a line like this:
default-key	0xD9F57808
to determine the key that that account will use as a default. if you're using the ~other~ key, use "-u user".
most things, esp checking mail, should NOT be done as root when it can be avoided. you don't have to move the directory or it's contents in order to copy the keys.
if i'm moving files between machines and i just want to make sure that they didn't get borked in transit, i'll check the hash on both machines.
another option is to use your linux box for email.
i don't know anything about windoze, but if you're using gpg regularly, look into an MUA that can work with it. cut-n-paste is not reliable.
ssh is encrypted, so you don't need gpg to protect the connection between two machines. if you're concern is the file after it gets to the other machine, then encrypt the file and scp the encrypted file... of course, if you don't trust the integrity of that machine, then you shouldn't be entering passphrases into it.

there doesn't seem to be any harm in having a valid (non-expired)

i just don't understand what's special about the key's expiration date

until the end of the fiscal year? or the end of the mayan calender? or

my own intent in using a key with an expiration is:
  1) if i lose the secret key, password, and revocation certificate, the
  2) any update to my key (preferences, UIDs, subkeys, revocation) *will*
as things are, i can't debate your logic: it's solid.
the problem is that the protocol can't distinguish between different
*intentions* when using a self-sig with an expiration. maybe if a self-sig
0x13 could mean that "i have every intention of maintaining and renewing
this key after the expiration date", while a 'lessor' self-sig could mean
that "after the expiration date, i don't even trust this key myself."
since different levels of signing exist for signing other peoples' keys,
it wouldn't seem to big of a stretch for a self signature to make use of
those levels (0x10 - 0x13) but define them differently for self-sigs.
of course, that would require a change to the way that self-sigs are
generated and checked... maybe there would be less problems declaring such
intentions using notation data? that might be a useful start for the (as
yet unused) IETF/OpenPGP notation namespace.
*if* something like that were adopted into the OpenPGP protocol, would it
be reasonable for a key that declares "i have every intention of
maintaining and renewing this key after the expiration date" to cause
key-signatures to ~default~ to not expire?
until then, what if signing a key with an expiration didn't default to
anything, but *required* a manual selection of whether or not to expire
the signature with the key?

only the session key is encrypted asymmetrically, the bulk data (aka the
message) encryption is done symmetrically in pgp/gpg (ok, there are a few
bits aside from the session key that are encrypted asymmetrically, but
it's still going to be a tiny bit of data that's handled that way).
since the asymmetrically encrypted part is small, you won't notice any
difference in speed between using gpg in the "normal" public/private key
way vs symmetric encryption (except for the compression, which can run
in real life tests, it might ~seem~ like it's taking longer using
asymmetric crypto, but that's probably because of the compression (which
is usually on by default for asymmetric encryption)... if you set
'--compress-algo 0' (which turns off compression) then symmetric and
asymmetric encryption will both take about the same time.

@_subject: RSA keys for encryption and in general DSA/RSA/ElGamal-keypairs 
Hash: SHA1
DSA is the "digital signature algorithm", DSS is the "digital signature standard" (both specified in FIPS-186). the ~algorithm~ can be used with any size hash or key, but the ~standard~ uses a 160 bit hash (SHA1) with a maximum key size of 1024. it's generally believed that a key larger than 1024 bits used to sign a 160 bit hash would be a waste of bits.
there are some arguments against this logic, but it's already past my bedtime ;)
as i understand it, this is largely a historical artifact. RSA performs reasonably well for both signing and encryption, but until recently (2000) it was not in the public domain. public domain algorithms (such as DSA and ElGamal) allowed public key crypto to be used in "free" applications before the RSA patent expired, and they're still with us today.
the ~other~ algorithms mostly tend to be better suited either for encryption or signing.
you ~can~ use a single RSA key for both encryption and signing, but there are advantages to having a "primary" key for signing, and one or more "subkeys" for encryption and/or signing.
if you use this:
 	$ gpg --expert --gen-key
you will have an option to create an RSA key that can be used for both signing and encryption:
 	(6) RSA (sign and encrypt)
you can use that all by itself as a key, but i'd recommend against it. that's what i use as my ~primary~ key: i have a DSA signing subkey and an ElGamal encryption subkey.
out of date documentation.... ElGamal is no longer used for signatures.
768 is the smallest DSA key you can create now, but there hardly any reason to use anything less than 1024.
you don't ~need~ to have a separate signing and encryption key, but it's a good idea. you can have an RSA key that does both encryption and signing (with no subkeys) or you can have a sign-only key (with no encryption and yes, the "key fingerprint" is that of the primary key.
a subkey is "bound", or associated with, a particular primary key. if i tell you my "key fingerprint" is "1234", then my subkey(s) must be signed by the primary key (1234).
that implies (but doesn't actually prove) ownership of the subkey(s).
if you feel the need, you can check subkey fingerprints using this:
 	$ gpg --fingerprint --fingerprint {key id}

pgpdump will let you look into the heart and soul of OpenPGP data, including keys. if you want to see the exponent, modulus and other fun math stuff do something like this:
 	$ gpg --export {key id} | pgpdump -i
and pipe that into a pager (more, less, most).
in order for an RSA key to work for both signing and encryption, you have to create it as a "sign and encrypt" RSA key, as described above.
using pgpdump, a sign-only RSA key will say:
                 Flag - This key may be used to certify other keys
                 Flag - This key may be used to sign data
a sign and encrypt RSA key will _also_ say:
                 Flag - This key may be used to encrypt communications
                 Flag - This key may be used to encrypt storage
i know how it is... i'm new to pgp/gpg myself. i've only been using it for less than a year, but i started out by reading EVERYTHING i could find on the topic, twice (and asking some pretty stupid questions).
after playing and experimenting with it, i've become very comfortable with it's inner workings.
this is a good list for asking questions...

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
you want to keep the (primary) signing key, and replace an encryption subkey with something bigger?
you can create a new encryption (sub)key using "--edit-key", "addkey".
you have three options for what to do with the old key:
   1) leave it. the default gpg behavior is to use the newest key it can find. this means that your new key will be used when a gpg user encrypts a message to you, and the old key will be ignored. i have no idea which encryption subkey would be used by other pgp applications: if someone is sending you an encrypted message, and they use MIT-PGP or PGPi, it ~might~ use the old encryption subkey... i don't know...
   2) revoke it. in the edit-key menu, select the old key and "revkey". that subkey still exists, and can be used to decrypt previously encrypted messages, but anyone with a current copy of the key will not be able to use that subkey for encryption.
   3) delete it. in the edit-key menu, select the old key and "delkey". that subkey no longer exists and can not be used to encrypt (or decrypt!!) option  could be dangerous: you will not be able to read messages encrypted with that subkey. if someone has on older copy of your key (before you delete that subkey), they can encrypt a message to that subkey and you will have no way to decrypt it. if your key has *NOT* been circulated, then deleting the key might be a nice option; if/when you do put your key into circulation, it won't have an unnecessary subkey in it.
i would recommended options  or  if your key is in circulation. anyone could have an old copy of your key, and encrypt a message to a subkey that is no longer current (but they might not know it). in either case, you *will* be able to decrypt the message.
if you don't have any signatures on your key, and it's not widely used in public, you might consider just creating a new key from scratch... make it as big as you want.

 	Seth Hardy
 	It's a surprising fact that a large number of attendees at this
 	very conference, even those who call themselves hackers and/or
 	security professionals, probably don't use any sort of encryption
 	- or don't use it properly. One reason may be because people think
 	nobody else uses it. So until it has a stronger presence, it won't
 	be as widespread as it really should be. In order to help fight
 	this, Seth will be hosting a key signing session. There will be a
 	rundown of why people should be using strong crypto, how the web
 	of trust works, and moderation to public verification of identity
 	and key fingerprints.
is anyone here attending HOPE this year? should we organize a sub-set of keysignings, amongst those of us on this list?

one way to do it is this:

if it says "0" the key can be used for encryption. anything else means the key can't be used for encryption... maybe because there's no encryption key, maybe because it's expired, revoked, not found ...

the script is *crude* and lacking comments, but attached. it writes each key-pair to it's own public/private files, using the current date/time as a prefix: if it generates keys faster than 1/second, files will get clobbered, using the current naming convention.
as is, it generates a sign+encrypt RSA primary key with NO subkeys, and a finite life. read the docs and you'll see how to generate a more common DSA/ElGamal key.
if you want to generate 20 keys (all with the same UID) just run:
 	$ ./gen-key-batch 20
there a section (Unattended key generation) in doc/gnupg/DETAILS that goes into the the options and how to set them.

seems like he's describing robot-ca. another suggestion is just widely
publishing the fingerprint, such as in an email header.
i agree with him on one level... but on another level it's precisely that
"excessive analness" that makes the WOT so respected. if keysignings were
routinely done in a casual and haphazard way, then the distributed trust
model would quickly fall apart, or at least lose credibility.
i consider the WOT to be a great thing, but maybe it's just not for
everyone... there are certainly groups of users that exist outside of the
WOT and probably have no need for keysigning. there are also people who
can just publish their fingerprint (or just key IDs) prominently and
that's "good enough"....
if someone wants to use pgp without becoming part of the WOT, they can...
which achieves a goal of "setting novice users free from the burden of
understanding certification and trust models".
i don't think phil's comments will have too big an impact on my
key-signing policy, which is still being drafted and may or may not be a
formal (written) policy.

Hash: SHA1
with the recent discussion about attacks against keys and irresponsible
signing protocols, i'd like to enter this observation...
make sure that the signed secret can't be "recycled" and used in an attack
by including a note in the signed material:
if step 2 isn't observed... mallory offers to exchange key signatures with
alice. mallory offers alice a string, and asks her to prove her possession
of the secret signing key by signing that string. alice signs the string,
without including any comments about what that string signifies, and sends
that signed string back to mallory. mallory can now use that signed string
to "prove" his possession of the signing key, by offering the same secret
to multiple people.
mallory's job is easiest if people don't check the date that "his"
signature was generated, but even that can be overcome by offering to
exchange key signatures with many people at ~about~ the same time.
moral of the story: never sign (just) an arbitrary string offered by

mallory has to use the same challenge and present it _as_if_ it is unique
for each person he's exchanging key signatures with. if the string appears

i think mallory could trick someone into using his challenge. mallory is
adept at the fine art of social engineering.
~you~ know better than to accept a cooked challenge; alice does not.
mallory agrees to a challenge with you and expects you to sign it send it
to him. at the same keysigning party, mallory offers the same challenge to
alice, who is new to pgp and accepts mallory's non-random challenge.
mallory can present your signing key to alice and/or alice's signing key
to you, and he can "prove" to both of you that he has the corresponding
secret keys. both you and alice could be fooled into signing a bogus
key... if the only thing that's signed is the challenge. this attack can
be defeated by not accepting (or generating) a signed challenge unless it
explains what that challenge is being used for, and by whom.

dave, your key (like my new key) is an RSA primary key with DSA and
ElGamal subkeys.
if someone wanted to sign such a key, should they ask that a challenge be
signed with the primary key? or the signing subkey? or should one
challenge per each signing key be used?

i wouldn't expect ~you~ to fall for this trick... but someone who is new
to pgp and doesn't fully understand public key crypto can be tricked into
using this broken keysigning protocol:
let's say mallory wants to sign your key... mallory issues you a
challenge... you prove your ownership of the your key by signing ONLY THE
CHALLENGE. mallory then gives that same challenge to alice (who doesn't
know better), and offers to "prove" his ownership of ~your~ key by sending
alice that signed 'challenge' (it's not a proper challenge, but alice
doesn't know that!).
by not including a note in the signed material, and only signing the
challenge, you'd be making it easy for mallory to "prove" that your key is
his... and if he collects signatures on it it can create FUD.
the attack depends on finding a key signer who doesn't know how to
properly validate a key... but that's really not hard to find.

it's easy for everyone to use the same key, and let everyone use their own passphrase for it.
1) "edit-key" and reset the password to something impossible. this ensures that everyone will change it.
2) export the secret key and give copies to everyone who needs it.
3) tell them that the passphrase is "pbrtavzHc0ZSRjEKsSIAdutLL6" (or something comparable) and tell them how to change it... they *will* change 4) you still have your copy, just reset your own passphrase after you export a copy with the impossible passphrase.
although it will work just the same, i would recommend that the UID identify it as a group (Customer Service), not an individual (Bob), but that's really for ideological reasons.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256
with all this talk of (allegedly!) weak and broken hashes, i'd like to throw out a construct to combine 2 or more hashes and (it seems) make the construct more secure than either one of the hashes independently: take two or more hashes and XOR them.
if i XOR the output of an SHA-1 and RIPEMD-160 hash, the only way to "break" the resulting hash would require breaking *both* SHA-1 and the same mechanism can apply to more than two hashes as input, but i'm not enough of a math guy to figure out where is the point of diminishing return (or if there is such a point). intuitively, it seems (to me) that if N hashes are used as input, the protocol is secure as long as any one of the input hashes can not be broken. i'm also not enough of a math guy to figure out (quantifiably) what would be gained (or lost) by combining hashes of different sizes, and maybe even truncating the output.
and no, the little voices in my head are not suggesting that this ~should~ be done because the sky is falling... they're just saying that this ~could~ be done, if the general consensus is that the sky will fall. OTOH, what if some secret agency known by three letters could break some hashes, but not others....

in the case above, if we assume that the sysadmin is doing his job of keeping the computer secure, then the sysadmin is the only one who could compromise your key: this can be done with a trojan binary or just reading physical memory. with windoze, any half-wit script-kiddie or international data crook can get your key.

i have several passphrases that are 20+ characters. 22 characters of uppercase, lowercase, numbers and spaces is *stronger* than 128 bit.
that's not counting the full range of characters that can be used... assuming that 95 characters are generally suitable (read: safe) for use in passphrases, it only takes a theoretical 19.5 characters to equal 128 bits and 39 characters to hit 256 bits. such passphrases may not be suitable for all applications, but they're not entirely ridiculous. IMHO it's posible to come up with passwords that are that long, easy to remember and AFAIK, the session key used for symmetric encryption is derived from the user supplied passphrase, then salted and iterated (this may have changed recently). if symmetric and asymmetric encryption is used then the session key is derived in the usual random way.

it's unfortunate that this thread is "Weaknesses in SHA-1". it really should be "rumored Weaknesses in SHA-1".
(never mind that i sign with SHA-256) SHA-1 has been subject to much more critical analysis than the larger SHA variants, and for that reason it can be considered more secure.
since most people are using DSA (really DSS) signatures, most people are stuck with a 160 bit hash for signatures. the only common 160 bit hash that's generally considered to be comparable to SHA-1's security is RIPEMD-160. gpg 1.2 fully supports RIPEMD-160 and i don't think it's going away anytime soon... and it works with DSA (DSS) signatures. if you're concerned about SHA-1, just add this to your gpg.Cong:

if i'm making an encrypted backup of my HD i use a symmetric passphrase (in addition to my public key), because if i lose my HD it will be inconvenient to recover my secret key from the backup, if the backup is only encrypted with my secret key.

first step in troubleshooting is UPGRADE to a current version. you're using gpg 1.0.6?!?! why?
when you upgrade, check out the "--rebuild-keydb-caches" option.
give ez-pine-gpg v0.4f a try - see what happens...

how about RIPEMD-160?
100% compatible with DSS (DSA), already part of GnuPG and it's neither SHA nor MD5 based.
even without a weakness in any flavors of SHA i'd like to see DSA (the scalable algorithm) formally adopted into larger varieties of DSS (the current standard) to allow larger hashes and larger keys. i guess if/when that happens DSS will become DSS-0 and larger variants will become DSS-1, DSS-2, etc.

history also shows that a weakness in an encryption primitive is more likely to be discovered ~after~ it becomes popular and widely used.
unless it's discovered earlier  ;)
