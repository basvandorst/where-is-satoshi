Thank you John, Barry and Zuki for your help guys.
Initially, I was able to install on one windows box
running XP and got it to work with v 1.2.5, then did
an upgrade to v. 1.3.91 and it worked.
Now, when I started to work on my other desktop
machine running windows xp, wherein I installed first
v. 1.2.5 binary then upgrade to v. 1.3.92, then it
showed this error.
Anyways, I will try out your suggestion solution and
will let you know what happens, next.
BTW, does v. 1.3.92 tar ball for linux has the same
problem when I compile this for my FC2 just like what
happened with my windoze box?
Thank you very much gnupg gurus who always help out.
Appreciate your kindness and generosity.

@_subject: Of Public Key Servers, Revocation and Key ID's 
Hash: SHA1
Hi gnupg gurus,
I need to shed some light on how Public Key Servers
Certificate and Key ID's play hand in hand.
Based from my understanding, after we create our key
pair we are
supposed to create a revocation certificate right away
so that
in the event that our key pair in particular private
key has
been compromised or regarded as useless we can revoke
Now, if we would like our public keys to be readily
available to
everyone for verification purposes, public keyserver
available to us so we could upload these.
Is this correct? Based on the following situation, please kindly advise
what, or
is there anything I could do here:
1. I created 2 key pairs, one for my public web mail
account and
one for my work (private use), with Key ID's 0xKeyID
0xKeyID for example;
2. I have uploaded both Key IDs to a public keyserver
of choice,
random.sks.keyserver.penguin.de which was somehow
3. I did create a revocation certificate for both keys
issuing this command in a command prompt: gpg --output
revcert.asc --gen-revoke 0xKeyID and gpg --output

Hi folks,
I have a small home network comprising of mixed

Hi Mr. Raven,
Thank you very much on your reply. Appreciate your
kind help.
Actually, I am a little bit worried on my win32
installation. As per previous post of Mr.Zuki Meng, I
was told to look for the answers to this post on the
list which I did. Now, I have downloaded, gnupg-1.3.91w32.tar.bz2 to my windows machine and was
able to extract the files.
Since, this is a bz2 file and not a zip file. How do I
make upgrade to 1.3.91? With this,
gnupg-w32cli-1.2.5.zip which I got from gnupg.org I
was able to enable it by following the instructions on
mozilla howto on gpg.conf which works fine.
I just don't know where to go from here??? Would you
think it would be a good idea for me to follow the
instructions on
(Building GnuPG for Win32 using MinGW? I could do this
procedure and I don't mind going through the process
further. My only hesitation, is it might conflict my
previous installation, 1.2.5. Any thoughts on this?
Thanks again and hope to hear from you soon.

However, I still have another problem. Is there a way
to automatically sign all outgoing email messages with

thunderbird or yahoo to open that file whenever you

Hi folks,
I got an error message as shown above after I issued
the command make install at my home directory
As far as I can remember, Mr. Werner Koch posted a
howto on the gnupg site but could not find the URL.
Someone from this list, gave me the URL for the answer
but I must have misplaced the email. I should have
printed the document when I had the chance but I
forgot to. Sorry about this folks.
I have a running gnupg 1.2.4 on a FC2 and I would like
to test the gnupg 1.3.91 for my FC2 desktop systems.
I have already tested gnupg 1.3.91 for my other win32
boxes and thus far, it didn't give me any problems.
Any thoughts on this would be highly appreciated.

Hi Mr. Koch,
Sorry if I just replied now. Anyways, I dug a little
bit further by doing make install as root or shall I
say did a su at the console and everything turned out
For the most part, if one is logged in as ordinary
user and not root, we are almost certain that this
error would come up or unless otherwise? This could be
due to directory permissions which are in place that
simply disallows me to write on it.
Anyways, appreciate the the reply by gnupg gurus
willing to help. I now, have a running development
version 1.3.91 of gnupg.... Thanks again....

Hi folks,
My apologies if this scenario may have been asked
before. I'm not sure though whether I should just
revoke my key or just delete them and create a new
I have gnupg-1.2.4-2.1 pre-installed with my FC2. I
printed a copy of the Gnu Privacy Handbook which comes
in very handy and used the instructions here to
generate a DSA/ElGamal 2048 bit key which turned out
Since the GNU Privacy Handbook has instructions on how
to compile gnupg from source, I thought why not give
it a try and compile gnupg from source and do an
upgrade. Now, I compiled gnupg-1.2.6 source and was
successful. And I generated another set of keys, this
time RSA sign only which didn't give me problem.
I issued the command gpg --list-keys and my terminal
gave me a listing of the generated public keys, I
copied the preferred public key hexadecimal value to
my MUA (Ximian Evolution) so that everytime I compose
a new mail message, the email gets automatically
The problem is this, after creating a new mail message
 and after I click the send button on evolution, it
asks me for the pass phrase. I type in the passpharse
for that particular key but evolution does not accept.
I tried using the other key's pass phrase and not much
use either.
Here are my questions:
1. Do I have to download and install a plugin for
evolution to work with gnupg? Or would you say the
reason for this error is I have two public keys with
the same name (my name and email address), so it
doesn't know which one to use?
2. I wanted to remove all keys and start from the very
beginning by deleting both private and public keys and
create another one, would this be alright?
3. What is the most ideal setup or conf that I should
do for my laptop? Compile the latest source first,
then gen a key and sign or encryp as required and
finally create a revocation key?
Slowly but surely, I am trying to switch from windows
to linux for desktop environment using Gnome or KDE
and gnupg is just one of the things that I should
straighten out first before I migrate totally to FC2.

Hi folks,
Just to give an update on the issue of idea.c. I am
happy that by following the instructions of Johan
below made my gnupg signing work. Thanks a lot Johan
and Aleksandar on your help guys.
BTW, I have some follow-up questions to you folks.
Since I created, 2 or 3 public key signatures which
shouldn't be the case. I wanted to get rid of the
other two public keys that I won't use? Would it be appropriate to just delete the files
straight up or simply revoke the keys first then
delete both private and public keys?
And final question, since I can now automatically sign
 using gnupg for my private email address. Would it be
possible for me to do this too on my yahoo account? I
have a notion since this is a public email or webmail,
one can only do as much by editing yahoo's account and
manually copying your pub id to it? Is there a way
that we can train, firefox or mozilla to do that

Thank you so much Johan for the reply.
1. Yes, I have created a several key signatures in the
process and testing gnupg and following the
instructions on the manual. I'm not sure though if
simply deleting them off from my home directory would
solve the problem.
2. How do I put my key on a keyserver like that of
verisign or other key servers out there? 3. This is somewhat related to number 2, from school,
our instructor mentioned that we can setup to be our
own private key server, hosting our own public keys,
just like what you have right now. But we never got to
do this exercise in the first place. Is this true? If so, can I safely do this setup and
coincide with my apache server project of mine which
is for hosting my personal/family site? The thing is,
we were strongly told from school that limiting
services running on your host box would definitely
limit the chances of getting compromised.
Do I have to allocate one box for this purpose or just
simply pasting my public keys on a public key server
would do the job? Or just sign up for one?
4. And finally, I tried doing this command from the
$ gpg -armor --export servie_tech Then I
copy paste on this email message which gave me a
public key block.
Is this the right way to do this? Or is there another
way to do this?
Thanks again to all of you guys in this group. You
definitely have been very helpful and have made my
intended transition to linux a lot easier.
My worries now would be how to enable my created labs
web cam on linux which is of course not part of the
groups topic. Nevertheless, again thanks a lot guys!
