@_subject: AIM Encryption? 
Is it possible to use gpg to encrypt AOL Instant Messenger communications?
We're interested in using AIM in our corporate environment, but are very
concerned about the lack of encryption of these messages as they travel over
the internet to AOL & back.
Alternatively, is there another product available that would offer the buddy
list & chat features of AIM, in a secure message transport?  We're less
interested in the ftp, chat room, and other AIM features.  It's the IM
portion that is of most interest to us.
