@_subject: Key from smartcard to disk 
i have a problem with the g10 OpenPGP card. I have key on the Card, but
not on harddisk. I don't have the secret key and don't have the pubic
key. How do i import keys from the card? And how can i encrypt or decrypt
files  with the card now? I don't want to generate new keys.
Thank you for help,

First, thank you for the fast reply. I read your mail more than twice. And I try to understand why there is no instant way of doing this. Please tell me if my presumption is correct. The public key will be generated with the aid of the secret key and the secret key never leave the card, the card must generate the pk. So it's not a missing feature in GnuPG instead of the OpenPGP card. Correct?
I didn't send the Key to the Server :(
Thank you,
