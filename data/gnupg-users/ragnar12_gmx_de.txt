@_subject: Fetch smartcard key from disk 
I'm a new user of the GnuPG Smartcard, and everything is working fine at my home :-)
Now, I have the problem at my working place to fetch the public smartcard key from a webserver, because of the proxy settings at my office.
So, i wonder if it possible to fetch a public smartcard key from the harddisk/stick. e.g. set the url to "file://C:\smartkey.asc"
Or asking more generell, which protocolls are supported from "fetch" method?
Thanks in advance,
