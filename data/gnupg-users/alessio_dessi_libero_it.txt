@_subject: Q. about difference between -sign and -clearsign 
Hi all,
I've cut & paste this from the gpg man page
 -s, --sign      Make   a   signature.  This  command  may  be combined with --encrypt.
 --clearsign    Make a clear text signature.
Isn't clear for me the difference between this 2 options
anyone can explain me that ?
for me seems the same things but I'm quite sure I'm loosing something
thanks in advance
