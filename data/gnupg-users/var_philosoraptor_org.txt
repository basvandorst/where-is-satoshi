Hash: SHA1
I'm trying to run Seahorse, but get the error message:
seahorse: error while loading shared libraries: libgpgme.so.6: cannot open
shared object file: No such file or directory
I'm running SuSE 8.2; I have (repeatedly) re-installed the gpgme 0.3.15=20
package from the SuSE CDs.
I can run gpg from the command line, and KGpg and GPA from the GUI,
without problems.
Where is libgpgme.so?
