@_subject: Error generating new keys on Windows with gnupg 1.4.3 
Whenever I try to generate a new secret key on Windows with gnupg
1.4.3, I get the following output immediately following the second
request for my passphrase:
gpg: NOTE: you should run 'diskperf -y' to enable the disk statistics
A few seconds after that, a Windows error box pops up with this message:
Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library
Runtime Error!
Program: z:\gnupg\gpg.exe
This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an
unusual way. Please contact the application's support team for more
Has anyone seen anything like this or know where to start debugging
it? I don't know if it makes any difference, but I have
HKLU\Software\GNU\gpgProgram set to z:\gnupg\gnupg.exe and HomeDir is
set to z:\gnupg.
Please keep me in CC on any replies as I am not subscribed.
Thanks in advance,

@_subject: Multiple Email address for private key 
Hi All,
My email program takes sender's email address and use appropriate
private key to sign the message. same way it takes email address from
"To" and use public key to encrypt the message.
I want to know if it is possible to have multiple email addresses in
single public/private key so that I have to use only one private key
to sign outgoing messages and I have to distribute only one public key
to get encrypted message for my 4 different email accounts.

Thanks, could make it work. Actually I was using GPA and while doing
edit key, it did not give me many options.
Then I tried using WinPT and found the commands you mentioned. Also
tried with command line.
Issue solved. thanks for your help :-)

Hi All,
while sending signed message through enigmail/thunderbird, message
appends -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE---- -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED
Hash: SHA1
Is there anyway to avoid that?

In that case, I will need to obtain private key with openssl package
and send my pub key to CA to obtain certificate. However, if i go with
that procedure, my friends who uses GNUPg or PGP will not be able to
verify my signature.
I guess I am running into cross platform issues. in fact, I need to
sign the message using a. GNUPg private key for those who uses GNUPg
and b. S/MIME for those who uses GPG/MIME or S/MIME. is that correct

But i am not encrypting message. I am simply signing it.
