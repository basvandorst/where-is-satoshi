@_subject: Trust signatures with unbounded regular expressions 
given a key, I would like to create a trust signature with a specific
regular expression, say "-mail[12]\.example\.com$" in this exact form.
That expression, and thus the signature, would match any domain name
ending with -mail1.example.com or -mail2.example.com, including all
email addresses attached to them. This is exactly what I want, but gnupg
mangles the regular expression to match mail addresses or domains at or
beneath the verbatim domain name -mail[12].example.com.
Is there any way to create a trust signature with that exact regular
expression with gnupg?

That is unfortunate. I'll probably default to signature notations and
some more application logic then.
Thank your for your time.

And *only* those two, not "mail3.example.com", which would match too, as
you mentioned. There are a number of other, similar cases that are not
easily solved without more signatures or more separate code in my
I use gpg via gpgme, only little of the actual gpg workings are exposed
to the user. Right now I'm thiking of using annotations on trust
signatures with the actual regex, and the "main" domain as the regex for
gpg to match on.
