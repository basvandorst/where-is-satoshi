Hello Dear List!
To give you an impression of my experience - I have just read the The GNU Privacy Handbook (from  and played around with my first keypair. But there are still some questions and my curiosity pushes me so much. I dont know where to find the answers. Hopefully you'll do :)
- - DSA/RSA + ElGamal
In the beginning there was only a keypair - divided into public and private part. Like two puzzle pieces, none works without the other part. Private is my very secret and the public key is for the public to send me encrypted messages. OK so far. But creating a new key (--gen-key) I see there is more. In the Handbook there is also a little mention that there is the DSA/RSA Keypair is for signing and the ElGamal Part for encryption. But do I have then two keypairs? How does this work together? Why two keypairs?
- - _Why_ the DSA/RSA Part cannot be bigger than 1024 Bit key length?
- - What is the fingerprint of a public key? What does it tell me? What do I need it for? Is it a signature?
- - I have generated a revoke certificate - How to use it? How to tell the keyservers? It'll only work as revoked if my keymates regularly check the keyserver if my pub key is still valid, right?
- - Net of Trust: I download a pub key of my friend. Sign it with my private key (DSA/RSA?). Than upload it to the keyserver where I got it from and everything is fine. Now the public key of my friend has two signatures - his own and mine. Does this process add or overwrite the public key? I mean could I taint a public key of someone by uploading his pub key with no or less signatures or uploading a pub key with his key ID and different pub key? I mean how secure is this key server stuff?
- - what is the great difference between gpg and pgp? License?
Great thx in advance for your answers!
Ben :)
