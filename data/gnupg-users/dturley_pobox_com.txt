@_subject: GnuPG altering text when signing 
GnuPG 1.02
When I clearsign a text file, any lines in the text that start with a dash "-"
get prepended with another dash and a space.
So "-hello" gets changed to "- -hello"
Why is this?

Thank you.

@_subject: Text wrapping in email 
I'm using the GnuPG.pm Perl module to clearsign email as it gets sent out to a
mailing list. We're sending 85,000 'generated-on-the-fly' messages per mailing.
Subscribers pick a combination of topics and their email is customized and
mailed, so we cache each message and if we find a topic combo we've seen, use
it from memory, if not we create and sign a new message. Works well, out of
85,000, about 25,000 are unique combos. The problem arises in that some of the
text contains very long URL messages that the receiver's email client wraps. If
the message signature is verified by GnuPG all is well. Anyone who uses other
PGP software, gets a bad signature message.
So obviously GnuPG is smart enough to deal with lines that get wrapped by the
email client, but NAI PGP isn't. Other than fixing the long URLs in the input
text, is there anything I can tell GnuPG to do to help the lessor software
along?

Our organization recently started signing it's email using GnuPG. A win2000 PGP
6.5.2 user is getting this message when verifying the GnuPG signed email.
*** PGP Signature Status: good

The message verifies as good, but what's the (Invalid) message?

Hopefully this qualifies as a "pgp users" question. After a couple of years of
false starta with PGP, I'm finally using GnuPG regulary. I have several old
invalid keys out there for my email address so I assume I should provide my key
id in my signature. Is the ID# sufficient, shoudl the fingerprint be there?
I know GPG has the option to automatically retreive a key for a signed mail,
I've done that (with xfmail client) but is that a feature any PGP user would
What's the "usual" way of doing this?

@_subject: GPG clearsigned message lose line breaks when sent to PGP 7.0.3 users. 
I'm sure this is a problem with PGP, but surely someone on this list has
experienced it and can help. When I send a clearsigned email to PGP 7.0.3
user, the signature will not validate because there are no line breaks
left in the message. If the recipient tunrs off  PGP verification in their
email client, the message views fine.
Any ideas?
