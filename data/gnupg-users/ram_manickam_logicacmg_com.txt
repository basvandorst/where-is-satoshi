I'm working on GPG on Windows. I have installed and created keys
successfully. Whenever my recepient tries to decrypt the message he gets the
following error message : The recipient has got the public keys.
Can anyone help me where i'm doing wrong ? Couldn't find this error messages
in FAQ. So i think i've got something wrong . This e-mail and any attachment is for authorised use by the intended recipient(s) only.
