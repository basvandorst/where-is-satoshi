It looks like a problem with the keyserver. Try wwwkeys.pgp.net instead.
That address is an alias for several machines so if it fails, try again
a couple of times.
I have used gnupg through a masquerading firewall with no problems.
Good luck,

@_subject: Warning messages. 
This is a serious warning that your secret keys could end up in a disk
swapfile or whatever. If you're happy to live with that risk (e.g. on a
standalone private workstation) then you can put
  no-secmem-warning
in .gnupg/options to make it go away.
(I think) this means there was no signature path from your key to your
friend's key. If you are sure the key is legit, sign it, and the warning
message will go away.

gcc receiving signal 11 can sometimes be a warning of hardware
failure. See Which Debian package? I have 2.7.2.3-7. If I comment out those two
lines in rsa.c I get a clean compilation.

I believe the Debian gnupg package includes a wrapper script which
loads those modules if it can find them. It also tries to find your
PGP keyring and pass its location to gpg.

There's your answer. That key appears to be an RSA key; I'll bet you
don't have the RSA/IDEA extensions installed.
By the way, it's funny that you obscured his name and address, but
left the key ID in ;-) Otherwise I couldn't have answered your

This is ludicrous (as well as off-topic :-( )
I have just successfully subscribed and unsubscribed to the list
(using a different email address). If it works for me I wonder why it
doesn't work for you?
Are you following the unsubscription instructions closely?
