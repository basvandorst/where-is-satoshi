@_subject: Subkey revocation means losing signatures? 
I am a bit confused about the gnupg behaviour in case of revoking a
subkey or uid. Since uids are actually signed by others in combination
my public key. Does it mean revoking a subkey or uid rsults in loss of signatures I
have collected over the time? How to proceed in such a case?
