Greetings All,
I have encrypted message with gnupg 1.2.3 (Slackware 9.1 build) and
it fails to decrypt under 1.2.4 (FreeBSD port) with such an error:
gpg: Ohhhh jeeee: no decrypt() for 17
secmem usage: 2016/2784 bytes in 4/7 blocks of pool 2784/32768
zsh: abort      gpg Mail/djb-crypt
Any suggestions?

Greetings again,
It has turned out that i haven't had proper private key on this
machine. But neverthrless the messages were quite cryptic :-(
And now for somenthing completely diferent. I couldnt import
secret key with one new subkey I have generated on a different
machine. Does --merge-only work only for public ones?

Greetings All.
I haven't follwed this list lately but google claims that my question
hasn't been asked yet ;)
What do you think about using gnome-keyring to store GnuPG passwords?
As far as I know it allows one either store a password permanently
in an ecrupted file or in a temporary "session" keyring, which is
the same what gnupg-agent-does.

I don't mean gnome-keyring as a replacement for GPA but rather
an option for it. I mean, why run two password caching daemons if you
can have just one and you already use gnome-keyring.
