@_subject: gpg2 missing 
am I missing something? gpg2.exe is not installed on installation of
gpg4win 3.0.0. I am well aware that it is supposed to be the same binary as
gpg.exe, however the behaviour (namely whether to run agent / GUI pinentry
on password prompt) changes depending on how it is called. My git was
configured tu utilize gpg2. Simply creating a symlink works, changing git
configuration to gpg.exe does not work in TortoiseGit (as expected) as
password is read from STDIN, not pinentry(-32).exe.
