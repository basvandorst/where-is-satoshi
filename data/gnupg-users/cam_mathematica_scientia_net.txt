Ah,.. too bad :-/
I've read some emails from a guy here that currently seems to do some hacking with gpg, perhaps he can help me ( plz contact me directly as I'm not subscribed to the list).
btw: It's pretty bad that one can't change the preferrence settings for his subkeys (or is this possible?). I'm havin a key with one email (UID) for different roles. But each role is using a different encryption subkey. Now in the office my machine is very slow and if someone sent me a big encrypted file (for the office subkey),... it takes very long. So it would be nice if one could specify these things for the keys to (perhaps in the selfsigs of the subkeys?)

This is not desirable at all.
- First of all you may encounter compatibility problems (although I haven't found any limit on the key size in the standard).
- And even from a cryptographic point of view this wouldn't make sense (as far as I know), as currently hashfunctions are the weak point of the whole system.

Yes and no,...
(btw: The strongest has should have 512 (SHA512), or am I wrong?)
It is true that you don't directly use hash functions when encrypting data.
But you need it indirectly too.
If you encrypt to another key,.. your implementation is going to check the validity of that key (either you've signed/certified it yourself or via some trust-path). And these certificates are "bound" to the hash...
Ok,.. you could argue that one use its key for local encryption only,.. but perhaps one should use other tools for that task...

Thanks :-) .... these helped me a lot in understanding :-)
I've also read the thread and nearly the same question is asked there againm but,.. just to be sure:
So if I sign someone with a tsign and level 1:
-He is a trusted introducer for me, meaning that UIDs he sign are automatically valid for me. (using sign)
-If he tsigns someone,... with any level, that UID is vaild for me too BUT can't introduce new UIDs or introducers for me.
If I sign someone with level 2:
He is a metaintroducer meaning that,...
-normal normal sign he makes to UIDs are autom. vaild for me too.
-If he tsigns someone that someone is introducer for me too
=>root_ca and president is valid to me
=>sub_CA is vaild too but nothing that sub_CA signs/tsigns is vaild for me
=>root_CA, president, sub_CA_A, sub_CA_B are vaild to me
=>bill is vaild too as root_CA makes sub_CA_A to an trusted introducer for me (with the level 1 tsign)
=>sub_sub_CA_B_A itself is valid too for me
=>joe is NOT vaild for me, even sub_sub_CA_B_A got an level-1-tsign from sub_CA_B which got an (!!) level-2-tsign from root_CA which would be ok => BUT I gave root_CA only a level-2-sign so third and higher level introducers (like sub_sub_CA_B_A is one) do not count for me
=>mike is not vaild for me, too. even the levels for him would have been ok,.. BUT president hasn't an tsign-x signature from the root
Everything correct so far?
What is the difference if I use FULLY or MARGINAL with tsigns?

@_subject: Keytypes and changing them 
Hi folks!
Ok,.. I know that you can set at least the following flags to specify the purpose of a key:
A - authorsation
C - certification
E - encryption
S - signation
Ok,.. as far as I understood, if a key is C-only that this indicates that it is used solely for signing other keys, but not for signing normal data, correct?
Ok,.. I thought about that and came to the result - correct me if I'm wrong - that it would be more secure to use the primary key only for certificating other keys (and of course for self-sigs).
Ok my current key looks like the following:
primary: CS, RSA-S, 4096 bit
secondary: E, ElGamal, 4096 bit
So I think it would be better to have the following:
primary: C, RSA-S, 4096 bit
secondary: S, RSA-S, 4096 bit
secondary: E, ElGamal, 4096 bit
1) Is it advisable at all?
2) Can I change this with GPG (without having to create a new key, of 3) If not: Is this function going to be intruduced in GPG the next time?
4) If not: How could I do that else?
5) Would it change my primary key in such a way, that it renders the signatures that I've already received from other users invalid?

Why not? *g* Of course I could just don't use my primary key for signing plain data,.. but I think it would be better to indicate that with the flag, too.
What would be the disadvantages?
Of course...
Ah,.. hm ok,.. is this the only reason for not using a C-only primary key?
And again,.. is it posible to change the flag on an existing key? And how is it done? Via a selfsignature? If so, I could change the flag to C, indicating everybody that I'm using the primary key for signing-other-keys-only and if someone should insist on challenge-response I could use the --expert flag or store a local-only version of the key (e.g. in an seperate .gnupg dir) that contains the key with CS.
Good,.. so I could change this as often as I'd like to, correct?

It means that the key can be used for authentication,... e.g. for ssh or so.

@_date: 2005-11-09 00:00:47
@_author: Christoph Anton Mitterer 
@_subject: Keytypes and changing them 
Uhm,.. I rethought the whole thing,... and I came to the reason that I gave up too fast ;-)
Ok,.. you told me that the disadvantage of C-only keys would be that you can't response to challenges. Is this the only reason?
As far as I know a challenge/response is used by some users to verify the email of an UID before they sign it. But lots of people do not validate this, because they think it wouldn make sense at all. E.g. if someone uses some freemail address he could lose the address after validation because the provider stops his service. So signing the eMail as part of an UID does not really secure that the address is under the controll of the keyholder, does it?
The only solution (in my opinion) are services like PGP Global Directory Key or so,...
But I think it is not so important to secure if the email is under controll of the keyowner. The worst thing that could happen is, that an encrypted message isn't received by the (private)-key owner, because the email is wrong. But this can even happen when the email is correct (e.g. if someone controlls part of the network).
What it all comes down to is: In my opinion - and correct me if I'm wrong - validating the email once does not make much sense. The only good alternative is some service like PGP Global Directory Key.
What are the advantages of using C-only keys?
Uhm,.. inm y opinion the stanard intends using C-only keys, if not they would have created only the S-flag, that stands for both, signing and But they created the following flags:
0x01 - This key may be used to certify other keys.
0x02 - This key may be used to sign data.
0x04 - This key may be used to encrypt communications.
0x08 - This key may be used to encrypt storage.
0x10 - The private component of this key may have been split by a secret-sharing mechanism.
0x80 - The private component of this key may be in the possession of more than one person.
Another advantage is perhaps, that a C-only key shows other users that the key is perhaps used in a more secure way (because it's not used for signing plain data).
=> I think GPG shoud offer an option (like setprefs) to switch the key-usage flags of primary and secondary keys.
I spent the last three or four hours browsing through the GPG code, but I had to resign because it probably takes to long to become familiar with it.
1) Is this feature going to be introduced in upcoming versions, or is there some kind of wishlist where I could ask for it :-D ?
2) Or can someone here help me and point me to the right places and funtions that I have to use for implementing such a feature?

Or is there perhaps another software that I could use for chaging the key usage flags (without damaging my key or changing the format or so). Of course I'd prefer using GnuPG because I trust this the most :-)
Once again,.. I'm only going to do this,.. if it wouldn't have disadvantages for the security. But if the only disadvantage is that I have more work when someone asks me to response to a challenge I would live with that ;-)

Ah,.. well I'm not completely sure if I understood RFC2440 correct, but as far as I can see,... the key usage flag IS part of the selfsignautre and thus it should be possible to change it,.. and keyservers should have no big problems with it, at least modern keyservers.
For them it should be similar to changing algorithm preferences.
btw: I haven't uploaded my current key yet, so this is (in my case) not such a big problem, I think.
Do you now of an application that allows me to change the usage flag? Without damaging my key or changing its format? Or an description how I can do it manually?

@_subject: back signatures 
Ah,... I see,.. but is this problem only limited to signing subkeys? It should be, right? Because the primary is protected by the selfsigned user id? Or is there another reason? (just want to check if I'm slowly understand how all these things work :-D )
btw: You remember my C-only thread (I'll answer you lastest posts soon),... I played around a bit and read some parts of rfc2440.
Ok when I split a key using gpgsplit I get about the following:
selfsig on uid (Sig type - Positive certification of a User ID and Public Key packet(0x13))
selfsig on subkey (Sig type - Subkey Binding Signature(0x18))
Ok,.. the 0x18 signature ist the one that binds the sub to the primary.
=>so nobody can add his own subkey to my primary because he wouldn't be able to make a subkey binding sig, correct?
=>but he is able do take my subkey and remove my 0x18 and add his one (that is where your back sig come into the game, correct?)
Is it correct that the primary has not directly a single self sig packet, but rather 0x13s are used therefor? If so,.. what is 0x1F (signature direct on key) used for? I thought this is used for primary Ah,.. ok,.. than backsignatures are VERY IMPORTANT, aren't they? And everybody should add them to existing keys....
Will gnupg and other clients autmatically indicate if an signing subkey has no backsig?

@_subject: Expiring UID 
Ok,.. my answer to this is a little bit late but here it is ... ;-)
Ok,.. you're right that there is probably not much need for this feature.
First of all in most cases you wouldn't know the exact date when an UID will become invalid (e.g. you cannot predict when you'll lose your job or so ;-) ).
The only similar thing is the following: You have some role X for an limited time (which is known in advance) e.g. President of Germany (5 year term, maximum of two terms). So you could add an UID "President of the Federal Republic of Germany " or so. But even in such a case,.. it would be better to create a key that signs the key of somebody who is in role X for a limited time.
I'm going too (with support of some professors) introduce such a system on my university. There will be a key which signs the keys of enrolled sutdents (but the signature is valid only for one term and had to be renewed at the end) thus certifing that someone is enrolled student of the university.
However, I think,.... if the standard supports expiring UIDs they should be supported by gnupg :)
Just my 2 cents....

@_subject: back signatures 
Took a while but now I've time to answer.
How is a signature bound to the key that made the signature? Just by the encrypted hash (by encrypting with the private key of the signer) or does it contain information like fingerprint (of the signing key) or which UID was used, too?
I thougt it is like the following:
"key XXXX made this signature"
than I look at my pubring and see:
"i have a key XXXX" and "an UID YYYY is attached to it"
Or not?
Same as above, I thought it would work the following:
"(sub)key WWWW made this signature"
than I look at my pubring and see:
"i have a subkey WWWW" and "an subkey is is bound by 0x18 to primary key than I look at my pubring and see:
"i have a key XXXX" and "an UID YYYY is attached to it"
Or not?
Yes,.. that was clear,.. btw: is there a special tag for backsignatures Ok,.. in principle it was clear,.. I just thought, that 0x10-13 are used only for signing other user's keys.
Can you give me an example where someone would do this? I mean what this is useful for?
I suggest that gpg should behave the following:
- suggest adding backsigs if it finds a private/public keypair without backsigs (most users won't notice the backsin command)
- of course warn a user if it finds signed data by a signing subkey which don't have backsigs. I'd even go so far to say that gpg should tell that the sig is invalid at all.
Take care,

... as you can see, MDC is set. Referring to  and RFC2440 I assume that MDC is still not part of the standard. Why is it activated in my key? (Of course this is a good thing, but I just wonder that if "openpgp" did not work for MDC, other things might be "incompatible", too)
2) What other things does GPG that are beyond RFC2440?
a) I've had that discussion with David about backsignatures which use 0x19 sigs or so (he didn't answer yet, so I'm not sure if this is RFC2440 compliant).
b) rfc 2440 seems to specify values only for MD5 and SHA1 but not for SHAxxx, RIPEMD160, etc. same thing with AESxxx and other modern symmetric algorithms. Same thing with bzip2.
=> Are these things standardized or not? If not yet, is the working groupt on OpenPGP going to use the same values as GPG uses? What if not?
If some have been already standardized: Where? *G*
=> Any other things like this, where GPG goes beyond rfc2440?
(btw: can PGP (the commercial one) open signatures/messages using AESxxx as cipher and SHAxxx as hash?)
3) Are there any other flags like MDC? I know about keyserver-no-modify but that is documented in RFC2440.
4) Does GnuPG support 0x10 (private key split) and 0x80 (group key) for the key usage flag?

Hi :-)
Ok,.. it took some time,.. but now I came back to that issue ...
Well,... "insist" ... *g* ... let me explain:
If you look at professional CAs (e.g. DFN-PCA) they clearly state in their Policies that e.g. they'll NEVER use their root keys for signing data but only for signing keys (DFN does this with its root-PGP-keys for I think the advantage is,... that other users can at least think that the key is more likely not used in daily-bussines (with potentially insecure applications,.. Thunderbird,.. etc.) but only when the owner signs a key.
But of course this is only a personal opinion ;-)
=> It is defenitely sure that with a C-only primary key (and a S-subkey - of course WITH backsigs) I would NOT loose any security or cryptography strength, at all, right? The only problem is that issue with challenge-response, right?
*g* You make me insecure...
But you mean "bad idea" only because of the issues with backsigning, right?
btw: Wouldn't it just work to answer the challenge by signing with the signing subkey? If someone would trust my primary key he should also trust my secondary (because it is bound to the primary by the 0x18-sig), or am I wrong?
Best wishes,

@_date: 2005-11-29 04:08:03

@_subject: Keytypes and changing them 
Yes,.. the person who made the signature would not notice that if the key-owner does not revoke the uid OR if the person writes an email to the owner, right?
If so:
-If the owner is evil, stupid, lazy, etc. he would not revoke the invalid UID....
-and someone who makes a signature CAN NOT verify that email periodically... of course he could,.. but most people wouldn't like it if they'd have to answer challenges over and over again.
So the only solutions would be:
-Make challenges periodically (e.g. with something like PGP Global Directory or a personal script or so)
-make only expiring signatures...
Yes... but this IS the problem about the whole thing with verify-email-address-when-signing, I think.
Please see my "weak" reason in the other email ;)
Eh? I thought GPG wouldn't support signing with ElGamal as that is very complex? There was an issue with such key, as far as I can remember, wasn't it?
(also: see other email)
You are right,.. it doesn't _prove_ it,.. but I think it indicates it.
Refer to my example with the DFN-PCA (other email).
They say: "We don't use our root ca key for signing plain data." Neither a key flag (C-only) nor their policy could proof this. Someone who works there could just take the key and sign his personal mp3 collection,... nobody would ever know ;-)
Yes,.. as above,... a C-only flag proves nothing,... but indicates a little bit,...
btw: If the key owner (who can change the flags as he like) is good,.. he'd upload the modified key to the servers,... the server would save the selfsigs and other users could trace the changes to the usage flags, Ok,... I hope I can end that thread with the following:
-I think the developers are not going to introduce such a feature in the next time, correct?
=> I'm not very familiar with the GPG code, but if a developer would tell me that such a feature wouldn't be too difficult to implement, I'd try to do it... (if I find the time,... have to write my diploma.... :-( )
Unfortunately, now one here could tell me an tool that let me change the deep internals of OpenPGP keys (including key usage of course ;-) ) so I tried to do it manually:
-As I told you in some other thread (think the backsig-thread) I've already read most parts of rfc2440,.. and played a bit with some testkeys and with gpgsplit and a hexeditor....
I've already managed to find the correct bits (for example for the usage flags) for various things...
When I tried to change the usage flag it worked,.. but of course... gpg complained due to the invalid signature...
So: When I change settings (shouldn't matter which ones) in my selfsigs,.. how can I recreate the signaturedata itself?
And what is the right way to reassemble the parts that I receive from gpgsplit? Simply a cat * > key ?

@_subject: Lots of questions 
Hi everybody.
(First of all sorry for crossposting to *devel and *users,.. I supposed users list would be the appropriate,.. but Werner supposed *devel,.. so I took both)
I have lots of general and specific questions about OpenPGP/GnuPG.
First of all I'd like to say that I've already read most of the available material on the GnuPG website and even other resources on the Internet. I've also searced the GnuPG mailing list, so if I ask a question that had been asked before, I do this because I think the status might have changed in the meantime.
Until now I've always used a plain DSA/ElG key... for about some years now, but recently I've revoked it and I'm going to set up a new key and create new keyrings and a new personal web of trust.
Ok,.. for all questions: I want the most possible security and it wouldn't matter if an algorithm is patented or if computation takes very long or so ;-)
I also assume that my system itself is perfectly secure,... so please don't tell me that this or that security consideration or key size is stupid because everyone could much easier break in my house and steal my harddisk (btw: the disc is encryptet with AES ;-) ).
(btw: I'm using solely Linux so I don't have those fancy GUIs f?r GnuPG)
Of I think I'm going to have three kinds of questions:
I) Questions about GnuPG itself
II) Questions about the OpenPGP standard, i.e. the key format, weboftrust, etc
III Questions about the used algorithms
I'd be glad if you could give me exact answers, but also answers that I understand,... ok I study computer science but my last cryptography lecture is some years ago ;-)

Hi again.
First of all: Sorry for those many writing mistakes I've made in my initial post,... my English is better indeed, but it was pretty late when I wrote that mail ;-)
In the meantime I've received several replys,... most of them haven't been posted to the list. I'll do that as soon as I got permission from the authors.
I'll also post everything to "gnupg-users" only. Everybody at gnupg-devel who wants to follow that topics and/or continue in helping me should have look there. But it could take some time until I'll continue that topics,.. because first of all I think I should read RFC2440, and I'm also planning a Keysigning party at my university; so I've a lot to do next week.
Still, if anybody has good answers to my questions from my initial post,... do not hesitate to help me.

@_subject: ECC 
I think that should be implemented despite of the way goverments are Goverments are often trying to restrict cryptography (see US) and also here in Germany (using X.509 only which is in my opinion less secure than OpenPGP as its using a hierarchical certificate system).
So why not just implementing ECC for GnuPG and making the first step for a (new) OpenPGP standard?

@_subject: OpenPG/X.509 interoperability 
This is perhaps a stupid question but how far are these two standards I've seen a document that proposes some things in that area My question now:
Can X.509 certificates be used to sign/certificate OpenPGP UIDs?
Or can I import the keys as subkeys?
Or are there any other interoperability issues?
What about the two big "free" X.509" suppliers (CACert and Thawte) do they sign OpenPGP keys?

@_subject: ECC 
I know that, of course, but I think that perhaps we'll have no ECC the next 10 years or so,.. if noone makes the step,...
btw: If GnuPG would implement ECC and add it unofficially to OpenPGP it could be done in such a way, that it is compatible with the ideas and conventions of RFC2440.... thus it would not "break" the standard.
After that,.. it could be even added to it...
As you can see, lots of todays standards startet as one-man-application, e.g. OpenPGP (from PGP/RSA Inc.), JavaScript->ECMAScript (from Netscape), et cetera.
And in my opinion,... the algorithm/system of ECC is fixed,... of course each standard may define things like headers or other small details differently but that could be adopted easily, couldn't it?
So if GnuPG would (pseudo-officially) implement that now,.. it could be the first compliant application later :-)
Just my two (Euro) cents,

@_subject: the best signature type someone can give me 
This is just a short question,... (I'll ask a lot of other things regarding signatures as part of "my" "Lots of questions" thread :-) )..
What is the "best type of signautre someone can give to my UIDs?
Ok,.. I think there are the following types:
local, non-revocable, trust, normal
So I he/she gave me a non-revocable signature he/she can't revoke the signature later (thus take it away from me ;) ).
Is it suggested using NR signatures? Why should one do so, or why not? (I mean what are the advanteages/disadvantages)?
Than the signature level (0, 1, 2 ,3) => of course 3 is the best,.. he/she checkt my UID very carefully or so
Trust signatures,...
What is the difference between a normal and a trust signature. I don't understand that concept *g*
Best wishes,

@_subject: OpenPG/X.509 interoperability 
Uhm,.. but that way I create a NEW key,... correct?
I was looking for a signature for my EXISTING key.
I do so ;-)
Is there a comparable thing in Thawte?

@_subject: the best signature type someone can give me 
Can you tell me one of these circumstances, I can't imagine one *g*
Of course, but I have a printed revokation certificate below my bed,.... uhm ah,.. no it's not under my bed,.. but,.. uhm somewhere else ;-)
Ah, yes :-)
Same as above,.. what would be an example where someone could use this? How does it work at all, I mean what does a trust signature tell the WoT? And what does the level of it mean?
Best wishes,

@_subject: the best signature type someone can give me 
Ah,.. an I forgot the following:
I know you can change the has-alorithm that is used for making signatures. Does this applay for UID-signatures, too?
If so,... should I (for security/cryptography reasons) ask users to sign my key only with SHA512 (or whatever is considered as the currently strongest hash)? And/or should I sign others UIDs only with SHA512 (..) ?
Best wishes,
Christoph Anton Mitterer.

@_subject: ECC 
Uhm,.. I probably have not that detailed knowlegde as you,... but when I've read the comparisions of cryptographical strength it seemed that ECC with very smaller key sizes is as strong as RSA/ElGamal with bigger key sizes,... doesn't this lead to the conclusion that ECC is an superior algorithm and should be used in favour?
Uhm,... yes patents are always a big problem,...
Do you remember when, I think it was BBC, claimed they had a patent in the US which would cover hyperlinks? Should the the world stop using knowledge just because someone in the US patented it?
Yes,.. I've read about that. And my new key is a RSA-S/ElGamal key,.. so I probably won't have that DSA/DSS problem :-) .
Yes of course, I indeed love standards,.. but I meant the OpenSource community around GnuPG could _create_ such a standard.
Look at XMPP (jabber),.. it works... :-)
Uhm sorry,.. *g* I meant PKCS 1 to somewhere.
It was in "my" city?? I didn't know that :-)
What about using that uhm,.. libecc (

No I don't but that shouldn't be a reason to forget about it,...
Same thing,.. that shouldn't be a reason for others to reuse the code and continue its development, should it? :)

@_subject: ECC 
Ah,.. ok *g*
But you see my point? Well,.. I indeed have nothing agains Americans,... some of my very best friends are Americans,... and I love the countrey,...
But should the OS community ignore the the knowledge of the world because of stupid patents?
If it would go after the US Patent Office,.. nearly each trivial thing would be patented,.. like cliking on a button to finish shopping in an online store or so.
In my opinion the time of patents (no only software) should be over at all (but that's another discussion) as the historical reason why patents were introduced is no longer given....
But for our issues here:
Of course the US is a big "market" and of course it would be sad to develop software that our friends in the US (or similar countries) could not use (due to patent issues)...
BUT should the people in other nations renounce such things? In my opinion not,....
And keep in mind,.. with these statements I DON'T want to offend anyone neither being rude or so :-)

@_subject: Random seed for symetric encryption 
As far as I know, even for symmetric encryption gnupg uses a session key
package, which is than encrypted via s2k-algorithms (your passphrase and
salt and so).
See section 5.3 of the standard
The reason for doing so is mainly that you can specify more than one
The standard would also allow to directly use the s2k-generated key, but
I don't know wheter or not gpg support this.

@_subject: gemplus GEMPC430 reader 
I cannot tell you definitely if it works, but at least in Debian there
are lib packages provided for the PC430 for pcscd.
So it should work with gnupg, too.

@_subject: Does a secret key need to be signed? 
Correct me if I'm wrong, but _secret_ keys are never selfsigned, at
least not under normal circumstances...
Perhaps it is allowed to sign it with a 0x1F but I'd have to look this
up in the standard,...
It wouldn't even make sense,...

Is this only gpg behaviour or does the standard specify to only consider
the most recent sig?

--delete-key name
                 Remove key from the public keyring.   In  batch  mode                  --yes  is  required  or  the key must be specified by
                 print.  This is a safeguard against  accidental deletion  of
                 multiple keys.
(where name is a valid name for your old key; note however, that this
doesn't revoke your old key)

@_subject: Problem removing a public key whose private key is gone 
If you'd read the other parts of the manpage you'd see that name is not
only limited to your name or the UIDs email adress but you can also
specify one of the key IDs.
You'll get the key IDs of you keys with gpg --list-keys. They (should)
key ID should be different for both of your keys, if not, you'll have to
use the long key ID, but that is pretty unlikely.
If even the long key IDs would be equal - that should be even posted to
the list because it is an rarety - you'd have to use the fingerprint of
the key as name (if even those would be equal,.. this would be nearly a
sensation ;) ).
So take the key ID of you old unwanted key (something like 0x23459837)
and make gpg --delete-key .
