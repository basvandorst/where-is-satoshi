@_subject: GnuPG main site down 
I'm sure I'm not the first or only person who's noticed this, but I've only just subscribed to the list --
the gnupg.org site is down, has been since at least yesterday evening, and I'm worried. I had a look at one of the mirrors and the information on that mirror is nearly two years old, so I'm starting to wonder if Gnupg still exists. Can anybody fill me in?
