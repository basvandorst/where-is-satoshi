@_subject: 8-bit message encrypted by gnupg appears as 7-bit after 
Hash: SHA1
base64 use 7-bit safe characters.
gnupg uses 7-bit safe characters.
Is the base64 encoding being encrypted, or the original 8bit data?  I'd
guess the original 8bit data.
It doesn't know or care.  It gets the 7bit encrypted data and passes it
on to gnupg.
gnupg decrypts the original contents - probably the 8bit data.
Test by getting a free webmail account and emailing something there?
