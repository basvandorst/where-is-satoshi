@_subject: Save signature in mail headers 
I would like to sign all my mail, but I do not want to annoy people that have incompatible e-mail clients with extra attachment file or signature in the text of the message.
Is it possible to send the signature in mail headers?

@_subject: Automaticaly import public keys by e-mails 
I have a long list of emails. I want to look them up on a keyserver and automatically import any matches.
I tried
gpg --search-keys mail < input.txt
where input.txt is "1,2,3,4,5\n"
but it did not work.
Thanks for help.

@_subject: Extra information in public key 
I want to provide as much information about me as possible when I send mails. I am amazed that you can save a photo as a part of you public key. How can I save more information? (telephone, address, age, etc...)

Please continue... how?
"User Attribute" comes to mind, but I can not find the specification.
The points are:
  - Provide some information about me - Why do people provide extensive info at ICQ? This is the same.
  - I do not want to annoy people and I do not want people to annoy me. Telling someone whether you like signed/encrypted messages helps.
  - The same holds for your preference of format.
  - Keyservers are not-profit - every bit of bandwidth we can save them I already have Biglumber account, but I just can not enter all the suff above. And even if there was a giant site where I could enter all I wanted, I would still prefer to have everything saved on one place, in one public key. (But if there is such site, let me know !!! :-) )

The site would have to be:
  - standard site used by many users - not personal site.
  - easy to parse - not the fancy HTML yahoo stuff
    (to ensure data can be automatically fetched to MUA)
Let's take a look at your signature: :-)
Your website - if it was in your public key, MUA could automatically add it to your card in address book
Your PGP key URL - if it was in your public key, GnuPG could use it to update your key without wasting keyserver bandwidth.
Your encryption preference - if it was in your public key, MUA could use it to automatically decide whether to encrypt mail to you.
Just imagine that: My mom installs Thunderbird (in my dream with Enigmail integrated) and *just* sends you mail. Thunderbird looks up your e-mail on keyserver, downloads your public key, finds that you like encrypted mail and therefore encrypts the mail before sending. Wow!, my mom just send you an encrypted mail and does not have a clue what encryption is!
... that's my dream

Sorry for the late reply - I had to download, install and learn Cygwin, but it works now! Thanks!

@_subject: Extra information in public key 
I just found up-to-date RFC 2440:
Here is 5.12:
 >
The important sentence is the last one: there are 11 types to play with.
I suggest to take pick one type between 100 and 110 and use it to store extra information. Since we may want to add various data, I suggest to store them as a series of named proprieties.
The attribute format could look like this:
  - Magic number identifying this experimental attribute
  - UTF-8 Name of property 1
  - Data length for property 1
  - Data of property 1
  - UTF-8 Name of property 2
  - Data length for property 2
  - Data of property 2
  - etc...
And the content might look like this:
First name=David
Last name=Srbecky
Country=Czech Republic
City=Usti nad Labem
Telephone=+65 536 1024
Homepage url=
Prefers encrypted mail=true
Prefers signed mail=true
Preferred encapsulation=MIME
PGP key url=
As this attribute will contain a lot of text, it should be encapsulated in Compressed Data Packet (Tag 8).
So, what do you think?

@_subject: Arguments for inline PGP 
Sorry for that. I do not know that happened. (Could it be some misuse of "Edit as New..."?)
I do not use inline because I find the extra stuff annoying. However, MIME can look really nasty too. That's I would prefer to save the signature in the mail headers.

I can not agree more. I accidentally deleted my secret, that would not happen if it asked me to confirm it by passphrase.

@_subject: Access experimental subpackets of 'User Attribute Packet' 
I have payed with the idea of using experimental subpackets of 'User Attribute Packet' and here is what I came up with:
Named Attribute Subpacket (type 100)
Subpacket specific data:
    magic identification number
    id - identifier - eg. 1
    data - depends on id - eg. true
There are a lot of little attributes which we may want to store in this subpacket. For example:
1 - public key url
2 - prefers signed mail
3 - prefers encrypted mail
4 - preferred format
5 - supports MIME format
6 - supports inline format
'Property Subpacket' does not really describe the purpose of the subpacket, but I could not find any better name. Any suggestions?
It there any way I can use GnuPG to store and load this information?

That's the point of the first packet - to be able to express anything the user can think of. However, the other two packets are there to save space by not using string identifier. They are also easier to implement.
Unfortunately I am not asking for problem, the problem is already here. Users already can upload their photo albums to keyserver and no-one can stop them. One vCard and a few preferences really won't make it any worse, these are small compared to images.
I have already contacted the openpgp working group, but they are in last call and so it is unlikely that they will implement similar mechanism.
This solves only just one little bit.
Not considering the feasibility, is it possible to achieve this with GnuPG?

It seems to me that if I call "gpg.exe --status-fd 1 --attribute-fd 1
--list-keys " I can read the experimental subpackets.
Is there any way I can write them?
