@_subject: GnuPG and PHP 
I'm using a php script to sign mail with GPG.
I succeed in sending an encrypted mail, but no way to send a -only- signed
( it works when i do it directly on the computer ).
I need your help...
(PHP execute gpg --encrypt.. but not working for --sign or --clearsign ).
The script:
Thank You, $sender_name
