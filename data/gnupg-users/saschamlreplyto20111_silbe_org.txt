Excerpts from Werner Koch's message of Fri Jan 14 21:01:45 +0100 2011:
Sounds nice for some users. But please don't forget about users who
don't want their pass phrase to be forgotten during suspend:
1. Users on systems that aggressively auto-suspend during regular
   operation (e.g. on the OLPC XO).
2. Users with a threat model that doesn't consider "stolen during
   suspend-to-RAM" to be different from "stolen while powered on".
So please make it easy to opt out from, preferably both on a system-wide
(to deactivate it for all applications that might make use of it) and a
per-user basis (i.e. without requiring root access).
