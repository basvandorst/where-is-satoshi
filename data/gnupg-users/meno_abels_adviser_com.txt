gpgsm: about to sign the certificate for key: &sjfwdfdkjafdkfsd
gpgsm: certificate created
gpgsm: ksba_cms_parse failed: No CMS object
I did not have any success with any filetype which i send to gpgsm ?verify
I tried the:
 - bin (without -a)
 - pem (with -a)
 - pem?s other sources
i checked all the pem?s with openssl x509 -in?. all good.
I tried to understand, the documentation without any success.
I tried to read the source and i don?t understand why ?ksba_cms_parse? could fail on these filetypes.
Is there somebody out who knows how ?verify should work?
thx in advance
