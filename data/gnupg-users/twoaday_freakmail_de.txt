With it you can do encryption/decryption, signing/verifying and

@_subject: --passphrase-fd with a pipe handle under Win32 
Hi Maxim,
Another solution would be to use the 'command-fd' switch. Then
all input from the keyboard is redirected to the file descriptor
you specify for the command. For example:
gpg --status-fd=2 --command-fd=23 -c foo
Then all input would be read from fd 23 which was created by
a pipe call. You've to watch for the 'status-fd' messages to
send the correct strings.
[GNUPG:] GET_HIDDEN passphrase.enter
This is the string GnuPG will output if a passphrase is needed.
If you want a more elegant solution you should use GPGME.

Hmm, the last time I checked this it worked perfectly. Did you
miss anything?
No, MingW32 is only a cross compiler. It doesn't add any additional
wrappers. Cygwin is a W32 compiler that put a simple POSIX layer onto
the W32 API functions. (IIRC)
AFAIK there is no API reference yet. But you can use the files from
the tests directory to see how it works. GPGME is useful for any
application that uses GPG calls, I use it for WinPT which isn't a MUA.

Hi August,
There should be a script to generate a DLL for Windoze instead of a
static library. But I'm not sure if it's in the current CVS.
But now the problem, AFAIK libgcrypt doesn't support any low level
RFC2440 (OpenPGP) operations. So you need GPGME or you can port the
GPG code to Windoze.
FYI, the problem with the static library and VC++ is that there are
some unresolved dependencies. But with the DLL it works.

@_subject: Problems with Line breaks under Windows 
Hi Brian,
That's not a GnuPG/Mailer related problem. Both OS's have different
ways to mark their line endings. Linux uses a simple linefeed '\n'
and W32 uses a carriage return '\r' and a linefeed'.
When you open a W32 message with a Linux editor, the '\r\n' combination
will be shown as ^M.
The '\r\n' system is the standard network method to mark line endings.
That's why Eudora and any other Mailer could handle it.

Here are the most important features:
- Key generation support
- The program doesn't use any environment variables any longer
- Basic key management (delete,trust,sign)
- Key caching for both keyrings (no loading time between the dialogs)
- Native language support (currently DE, IT, FR)
And last but not least I add a more advanced key listing
element for all dialogs. The version is still beta, but
I got back many positive test results from the users.
You can download it from (Note, you'll need the GnuPG windoze EXE from the site)

@_subject: using --status-fd 
I don't know what kind of program it is, but in any case you need to
send the message to another FD (or stdin). Then it's easy, you write
the entire message to this FD and then you watch for status messages
on the other FD (the one for the status). In the case the status needs
an answer, you send it to the FD you've chosen for command-fd.
I understand your problem, but when you work with pipes it should
be easy. First you send the message and the other pipes are only status
pipes for GPG messages/answers. In the case an answer is needed, GPG
blocks until you send the data. Here is another example:
gpg -a -r foo --status-fd=2 --command-fd=0 --output - --
Now gpg reads from stdin and writes to stdout the used FD's
are (stdin=0, stdout=1, stderr=2)
[GNUPG:] BEGIN_ENCRYPTION
<< armored ciphertext
[GNUPG:] END_ENCRYPTION
BTW, GPGME might be a good solution for your problem.

@_date: 2002-01-21 17:45:02

@_subject: using --status-fd 
No, you can write the message whenever you want. Like I said, GPG blocks
whenever it awaits data from the 'user'.
I'm not sure what programming language you use, but with the pipe()
call in C you can use the returned FD for the command handler (or any
other handler).
When you use it with the new CVS version of GPG, it should run much faster because of the new key signature cache.

Did you really use the '"' as the part of the string in registry or
did you only use them to make sure it's a string? In the first case,
you need to remove them otherwise, this is IMO the error, GPG thinks
the '"' is also part of the filename!

Maybe a "gpg --list-secret-keys" would help to find out if you

"gpg --allow-secret-key-import --import my_seckey.pgp" to import it.
Then GPG should be able to decrypt it.

@_subject: Announcement for OpenCDK 
I decided to create a library which implements basic parts
of the RFC2440 (OpenPGP) message format. This library will
be no replacement for any real OpenPGP application like PGP
or GPG. The goals of the library are to provide an API for
parsing packets and to work with OpenPGP keys.
There is also some code for signing, verification, encrypt
and decrypt, but this is only partly done.
Some of the code based on GPG and for all crypto functions
we referring to the libgcrypt library. This library is responsible
for secure memory, random generation and other sentensive parts.
Currently the library is work on progress, but for the people
who want to take a look at it can find the source on this webpage:

@_subject: [Announce]OpenCDK 0.3.3 
Current Version: 0.3.3 (latest devel 0.3.4-cvs)
License: GPL
Author: Timo Schulz Available from: this is the first public announcement for OpenCDK. It is a library to
provide some basic parts of the OpenPGP Message Format (RFC2440).
First the library was planned for key conversation in GnuTLS and other
applications which support OpenPGP keys but after a while, I decided to
include some low-level functions for file handling.
Now the library basically consists of two parts. First, the key database
code which can be used for reading, writing, export, import and key
conversation and secondly file routines.
It is *not* planned to add full OpenPGP support or to replace any of
the existing OpenPGP versions. But it some cases, it might be handy to
have OpenPGP natively without a detour over pipes.
The library itself does *not* contain any cryptographic code. For this,
Libgcrypt is used which bases on GPG code which was tested a lot. Other parts
of the lib also contain GPG code to reduce the time for testing new code.
For a good introduction, the MinPG example might be a good start. It shows
how to use the API and how things work.
If you use Debian, you can also use the precompiled package from Debian.org
(unstable) but it's not up-to-date and might have more problems (it is 0.3.2).
If you are interested to get the latest version, use anonymous CVS.
Here is short overview about the recently added features:
Noteworthy changes in version 0.3.3 (2002-11-16)
* Keyserver support (HKP only).
* Fixed problem with v3 signatures.
* Fixed problem with searching packets in KBNODEs.
* API documentation for the external interface.

[IMHO this is a question for gnupg-devel or gpa-dev...]
If you verify a cleartext signature, you need to set the text parameter

The cleartext signature itself contains the sig so there is no need
to separate it before you can check the signature (with GPGME).

@_subject: Announcement for WinGEAM 0.9.0 
I'm pleased to announce the Windows port of the GEAM project.
For the people who don't know GEAM, here is a short summary:
GEAM is a specialized mail transport agent (MTA) which takes
care of encrypting all messages leaving your company.
Encryption can be configured using flexible configuration
files (similar to the email aliases file). Incoming mail can
optionally be decrypted when the decryption key has been
installed. The software uses the PGP/MIME standard (RFC3156)
for handling the mail
GEAM is transparent for a user and can be used to make email
communication much more secure without the need for training
all users. Migration to desktop based encryption can easily
be done on a per user base.
Additional features for the Windows port:
Due to the fact that most Windows users have no static IP addresses,
I decided to add POP3 support into the program.
In contrast to other available 'secure proxies' GEAM is a truly
daemon without any user interaction. All stuff is configured via
the config files.
The dist tarball contains example config files and a german HTML
manual. The README file describes an example installation (in English!)
to help the non-German speaker.
The version was tested on Win9X but it should also work on all
other Windows versions (XP, NT, 2K, ME) too.
Currently there is no website available, but you can download the
zip archive here:
Please remember to contact me when you've a problem with the Windows
version and not the original author of Geam (Werner Koch) [when your
question/problem is a Windows related problem].
Any feedback is welcome. Even if I found no problems during my tests,
please except some strange behaviours and some bugs in this version.

The hash algorithm is used to calculate the message digest over the

You have several choices because some algorithms MUST use a special
hash algorithm. For example the DSS prescribes SHA-1 as the message
digest algorithm.
But if you use RSA you are free to chose RMD-160 or SHA-1 or even MD5.
It's up to you to select one. RMD-160 and SHA-1 do not have any known
weaknesses so it's a personal preference.

If both keys are listed in the dialog, it should work. Maybe you can
use the File Manager and "List Packets" to check that the msg is really
encrypted with both pubkeys.
Usually WinPT only shows the dialog with the information from GPG. It
does not decide what key to use. This is a GPG thing.
Please make sure you use GPG 1.2.3 or better.

WinPT includes a modified version, crafted for the Windows use. It
is called MyGPGME. The new WinPt source provides the code as a
static lib. Maybe this is useful for you. I plan to release a 0.9.x
version (binary+code) very soon.

As the author of WinPT I'm of course not ingenuous. But let me say some
WinPT is _not_ unmaintained. I work on it whenever it's possible and
I also fixed a lot of bugs recently. The problem is that the SourceForge
website is a little outdated.
I recommend to use 0.9.x whenver it is possible (last version is 0.9.14)
and this website which always has up-to-date files:
For the people who still use 0.7.x and have problems I would suggest
to download 0.9.14 which contains a lot of features and bug fixes. _But of course the user has the freedom to decide what front-end to use_.

You can find it on ftp.gnupg.org. Any _official_ version should work. The minimum required version is GPG 1.2.6 (but you can also use 1.3.x!).
On SF.net WinPT means "Windows Privacy Tools". And WinPT Tray is part of
the project and _my_ application so it is called "Tray".
Ralf Kreutzmann maintains an installer for WinPT and other GPG tools. But
it would be useful to have some folks to maintain the SF.net files and the
homepage there.
This would be very kind.

Weird. I need to modify the header so I know if it is an official
release or a self-compiled version.
Yes, I'm familiar with the basics of the HTTP protocol. I need to test
the entire code and I will try to implement bug fixes for the described
problems. As long is it won't break compatibility with other keyservers so
the code cannot be used in general.
This is really a nice idea but I don't think that keys are requested too
often. But for the 'refresh all keys' it could be very useful because
of its speed.

Noteworthy changes in version 0.93
==================================  - New interface which is more generic and tries to be a
  complete wrapper around the GPG binary.
- Logging support to make it easier to track down errors
  and to allow remote debugging.
- Keylisting now supports keys which only consist of one
  primary key (RSA Sign-Encrypt, old v3 Keys, ElGamal).
- The users email address is used to identify the recipient.
  This way GPG automatically decides what subkey to use.
- The plaintext is used for replying mails.
- Show some information about the GPG data as part of the message.
  For example the a 'gpg -k' like output if the message contain
  one or more public keys.
  Or if there was a problem with decryption use the GPG output message.
- New GPG I/O subsystem to fix some hanging processes.
- Store all user ID's to improve the searching system.
That's it.

[no CC is needed, since I'm subscribed on the list]
I should have say that this is mainly an update for people who have
already installed it. Of course it can be also used by somebody who
did it install a prior version but then the procedure is a little
uncomfortable (but not impossible!).
And of course it would be possible to use an installer with the
G-DATA plugin and then simply override the files. Then the step
with the manual registry modifications can be avoided.
At the moment, I cannot answer this question.

What I wanted to say is, that I will disable the CAST5 cipher force

And for WinPT this is only a problem when you use symmetric encryption.
I guess most of the time, people use public-key encryption.

Yes, this could work. You could access the W32 API but it would be
easier to use a GPG COM+ object or something similar. Then you would
just need some lines (if the object implements the needed functions).
I wrote a GPG COM+ object but it's still not finished. But you could
use the G-DATA plugin to do this. You could download a OLE32-Viewer to
see what functions are available.

Hmm, it works with 98 (no SE).
That's the problem. You need 4.32 (or anything close to it or newer).
WinPT supports all Windows versions (95 limited). The problem is that some
OS components are too old. This is also a problem for other programs and
not just WinPT. If you update the Internet Explorer, you will get a newer
version of the needed components. You can also use the MS update site to
get a recent version.

@_subject: potentially serious problem (was Re: WinPT on Windows NT 
Then I guess the easiest way is that I remove the 'supports 95/NT'
string because I expect at least an average PC system. And this means
at least ME and a recent Explorer version.
I see your point but the requirement is over 8 years old. And If somebody
uses such an old system, I would call this an exception and not ordinary.
As I said, it's propably the best to remove 95/NT.
I agree that it is annoying for people with older systems that it won't
work, but 4.32 is pretty old and I don't think I really need to mention it.
When WinPT would depend on the XP version of the DLL, it's worth to mention
because XP is pretty new compared to 98. I will either remove 95/NT or I
will put a notice there that some OS components need to be refreshed.

In all prior versions to 0.9.90 (final) it is possible that
WinPT indicated the PIN was successfully changed but actually
the old PIN is still in use. If a mailer caches the PIN and sent
the (invalid) PIN to GPG multiple times, the card will block.
The problem does not occur if WinPT is used to sign or decrypt
data protected with a key that is located on a smart card!
