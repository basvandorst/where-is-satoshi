I'd rather advocate an open solution like GNUPG, but is this possible
commercially ? Can we re-compile it to indicate a commercial use from a server
or would this violate the GNU license ? We will not be redistributing GNUPG,
but instead giving access to it to users on that server.
Thanks for any information on this. I am interested in both developer/user

Hi Rick,
A good document to start with is
This speaks in general of open source apps, and could help you.
Remember opensource does not always mean freeware. Also read the license (not
all open source is GNU based).
There's no "lack of support" in GNUPG, maybe only "less support" since it is
mostly voluntary (from what I see generally this applies to open source). But
maybe throw in the U$1500/yr. that NAI charges for support of PGP and you
might just get better support altogether. It is an act of faith, and as
explained in the document, other considerations apply.
By all means let us know what this results in.
Take care,

I am trying to get GPG approved for use in our corporate network.  However the
general reluctance to use free-ware open source has come up.  I have been
asked to provide a white-paper or some other document showing that for the
features implemented GPG is true and faithful to the openPGP standard.
I have a document from our PGP rep which highlights the lack of support
inherent in open source.  The only functionality missing (according to the PGP
document) is stuff PGP added above and beyond the openPGP spec.
Can anyone point to anything written by someone I can take to my management?

After much trying, I came up with 2 hints:
- The options file name should be "options" without extension, and contain at
least 1 blank line, and be located in the path specified for "GnuPG home
directory" (when and if using WinPT)
- Any options entered there should not be prefixed by "--" as they are in
command line mode
BTW, this is the place to put the allow-secret-key-import option, so that you
can import existing private keys to your GNUPG installation.
Other file types are described at the end of the man page (man or gpg file,
without extension, depending on distributions)...

Network Solutions' PGP guardian method does not work with GnuPG generated
I am enclosing the original response (less my message), as reference. Please
note that I used GnuPG v1.0.6 (MingW32) and WinPT 0.4.0a. Then with PGP 7.03
it was completed fine, with the exact same text, using the same key, same
software (Outlook), etc. Only the encryption software was different.
BTW, on their site they mention: "Our PGP keyserver will accept PGP Version
2.6 to 6.5.2.", however I sent my key generated with GnuPG/WinPT by email
and their server accepted it. And the message I sent after that (resulting
in the error reply), was signed with PGP 7.03. Also note it took 18 days for
the key to be added (instead of 24h).
I thought it would be more appropiate to send it here than to risk it being
lost in their support system.

@_subject: not-dash-escaped option ? 
While using WinPT to sign texts, I noticed it doubles dashes in the text. So
if I was to sign this message:
- this is one item
- this is another
it will come out like this:
- - this is one item
- - this is another
Timo Schulz, currently working on WinPT, advised to use
the --not-dash-escaped option.
Can anybody explain this (from the MAN page) in other words ("for dummies")
? :
"This option changes the behavior of cleartext signatures so that they can
be used for patch files. You should not send such an armored file via email
because all spaces and line endings are hashed too. You can not use this
option for data which has 5 dashes at the beginning of a line, patch files
don't have this. A special armor header line tells GnuPG about this
cleartext signature option."
In other words, if I am not signing a "patch file", I can use this option
safely. Is that true ?
What exactly is a "patch file" ?
I also noticed the same happens to line with 5 dashes or more. The why the
reference to it in the Man entry ?

I was recently asking this in view of the explanation I found for the option
"not-dash-escaped" in the GnuPG man file.
(note: the Man page I refer to is the one at
Thank you, Werner, Lionel, for the answers. I suspected that but found
curious that a programmer's reference would've replaced the RFC description.
In asking this question directly to the list I admit I passed my right to
"RTFM" :)
The RFC 2440 mentions:
"7.1. Dash-Escaped Text
[...] This prevents the parser from recognizing armor headers of the
cleartext  itself."
The Man page explanation mentions one of the "advantages" of having dashes
escaped, not the real reason. And if you use the option in GPG, then the
"NotDashEscaped: You need GnuPG to verify this message" is included in the
signed message, hardly a better explanation.
Another rather disturbing remark, in the FAQ (6.8):
"Good mail clients remove those extra dashes when displaying such a message.
Why should they ?
Although it's a detail, it is rather unlogical to expect regular users to
put up with this kind of modification of an original message, and
particularly contrary to the principle of a signature's role to guarantee
integrity of a message. Is OpenPGP capable of evolving towards a version
that would better suit "everyday users" of this technology ? How can OpenPGP
advocate for a standard where a single "-" will break the parser ?
Would it be possible for the MAN page of GPG to be updated to reflect this,
instead of the (unix/patch files)-centric view of its usage ?
I'd like to submit this as a comment to the RFC. Does anyone here know how
to go about this ? I took a look at rfc-editor.org but didn't find any
obvious way to send this.

No need to be rude. Why didn't you simply mention OpenPGP/MIME in the first
place ? I hope you're not in that workgroup too, rejecting end-users
comments on behalf of all involved.
The MUA or patch files have nothing to do with this option, the fact is that
GPG produces signed data that differs from the original and I thought it
useful to report it. The RFC could also mention OpenPGP/MIME (an addendum?).
I think I've made my point, and I'll understand if you want to simply ignore
my remarks.
The man page is simply not accurate in respect to the RFC, which you also
ignore. Can't this be updated in the man page but also FAQ/other docs ?

Hi Michael,
Thanks for your comments. An important detail, I am not the author of

mostly the same text as the original page, with permission of the
* WOW * I didn't know there had been a new look-and-feel site
GnuPG is *only* a command line implementation of OpenPGP. GnuPG's
project goal is not to provide a GUI installer for each platform (or
even only one).
If you look at the Related Software section of gnupg.org, in
"FrontEnds", you will find WinPT:
 But WinPT also requires unpacking and setting up the files and
environment manually.
The reason is that WinPT's project is not to provide the graphical
installer. The WinPT installer is pretty recent (2 weeks I think!),
and has not been tested a lot. I think the current download at
WinPT.org can be more stable, but I agree it's not very clear what
software this installs. You may want to subcribe/write in the list
WinPT-users abouth this:
It's up to you to decide, but at least you have the choice :) From my
understanding, Nullify's builds were offered faster than GnuPG.org's
official ones, so they became popular for testing purposes. In a
production environment, it's clear I'd rather use GnuPG's version,
and I'll ask Gustavo (the installer's creator) about this. Thanks for
the reminder :)
Where do you update your keyring to/from ? Personally I only sign
keys that I get requests from and that I can verify on different
levels, including how long I've known someone, met personally, seen
participating in different forums, etc. I don't ask for signatures
unles I know other people can do the same kind of verification on me.
I have not asked them to sign my keys yet, but I eventually may.
However you can check my trust by making a quick search on Google,
for example, for fabian.rodriguez Other verifications can
include checking business directories or corporation indexes (for
example, looking for Toxik in the Canadian corporations database at
Strategis will show our record at
). Trust in my OpenPGP setup for now is very low, partly because I
spent too much time building trust on Thawte's WOT sometime ago ;) -
of which I am still a notary.
I doubt very much that there ever will, as GnuPG.org has its own
(official) gnupg binaries.
It depends, most hard-core unix users view them as useless (some of
my closest friends think that). Some of the business users or
end-users that don't know/don't have the time to go through all the
manual steps to properly install and use it appreciate them the most.
Ultimately, those that need them create them, which you can't  do
with most closed-source/commercial licensed software.
And very good questions, which we tend to forget as we go on on our
exploration and tests... thanks for reminding me of some important
things (like requesting more signatures ;).

I have no idea what German identity cards look like so I can't use

I think I will do something similar for OpenPGP signatures, inluding
PGP fingerprint/phone verification. The beauty of OpenPGP is the
several levels of trust you can give, instead of points.
Ultimately evryone decides on its own how they give trust.
Not 100%. It only makes your decision easier, actually if you search
for Fabian *and* 0x5AF2A4D5, you will find many public references and
messages signed with that key. The same can be done with Altavista,
etc. The more I use my public key in public archives, the more
difficult it will be for someone to make up a new one and pretend to
be me. And it has a picture.
;) -
Actually, Thawte originally emitted signatures to PGP keys for its
users that had both x509 and OpenPGP. It appears my public key was
not updated on other servers with the same information, but on your
keyserver there was a trust path through Thawte's signature of one of
my ID's:
Of those 200, all those with their real name instead of Thawte
Freemail Member in their ID were "notarized" members of the WOT.
Yours is a very interesting and easy way of finding trust paths, I

@_subject: Semi-automated trust, policy (was: Robot CA...) 
Hash: SHA1
It's interesting to see all the discussion the robot CA generates. I
think I would use that kind of tool to spread trust and better
educate users about signatures, procedures to check trust, etc.
For example, I see this in a semi-automated environment, where
*customers* are signed after manual verification by a business, but
via a web interface tied to the CA-robot - for free. Thawte's certs
are generated in a similar context/process. Our policy page would
explain that we only sign our customers keys with our business key.
When somebody / an organization becomes our customer, there's a
certain level of verification done (credit card, address, phone,
personal meetings, etc.). Why not add OpenPGP "notarization" for free
? We could also sign individuals keys on a personal basis, but the
policy URLs would always explain under what conditions. At Toxik we
already do that in a limited way, our site will reflect it in the
next few weeks.
Encouraging other sites to *copy* the content and reproduce a
signature/verification setup would then help spread use of personal
crypto, but only if it's used in every single business message. For
example, CIRA ( the Canadian organization responsible
for .CA domains signs each and every message with PGP.
A job we can all start doing already is writing to all
companies/organizations that have PGP information on their site to
also link to GnuPG's front-ends page, and update their terminology to
use "OpenPGP" instead. Some examples to start:
I think business use is only an extension of OpenPGP use, but
ultimately it has a great influence on personal use. Of course there
are other ways. ;)

Hash: SHA1
You mean OpenPGP of course... or GnuPG... ;)
The only "problem" I see in implementing signature + encyption as
encrpyt(sign(content)) is that it would require 2 operations on the
recipient's end: one for decrypting, and *then* one for verification. The
same with sign(encrypt(content)).
What if I forward an email signed by somebody else ? "From:" headers are the easiest to fake, if you plan to include this, IMHO,
it should be optional, not obligatory.
Seomthing nice would be to use the email to lookup/retrieve public keys
directly (right-clicking on the email ?).

@_subject: Bad signature - SOLVED 
Hash: SHA1
First of all congrats to Ingl=F6 for pointing out this (new) problem.
Thanks to Gustavo for reminding us of Outlook "features" - he was
right. This time it's my fault -entirely :) In your case, Gustavo, I
think you use extended chars in your messages but they seem encoded
OK... I also have bad signatures on your messages to the list,
I compared the offending message still sitting in my sent-mail and
the one I got via the list and the only small but important
difference is that the accents in my name at the end of each recent
message had been stripped.
After comparing the headers of a message that verified OK on the
WinPT list a few days ago and those more recent on this list, I
hadn't paid much attention to my setup and my messages where being
encoded as US-ASCII. I also noticed every window title has the
indication USA-ASCII if it's encoded like that! The offending header
is :
As a result, any accents or special characters in my name where being
changed to normal ASCII and the original message changed, causing the
signature to fail. To change this in outlook 2000:
At Tools | Options | Mail Format , in the "Message Format" section:
- - In the "Settings... " extended dialog, choose "MIME" , Encode tex=
using: "None", and check the box for "Allow 8-bit characters  in
headers". Also make sure the wrapping is *superior* to that set in
any plugin for GPG/PGP you're using.
- - In the "International optios..." extended dialog, make sure bot
"Use English for ..." boxes are checked and both "Use this encoding"
are set to the correct char set you're using. For"iso-8859-1", choose
"Western European (ISO)"
This message should verify OK and future messages too... and the
accents should be there.
I had two questions:
 - The FAQ has a mention about iso-8859-1 beingthe default charset,
but if I used another, I should use the charset option, right ?
Thanks for any confirmation on this.
 - Is there/should there be a gnupg-test mailing list ?
Many thanks to all for your assistance,

Hash: SHA1
Last week I reported this to webmaster but so far no
reaction or answer.
Maybe someone else can help ? Just wanted to share some problems I
found on the site.
1. I previously reported a problem with the mailing lists section of
the gnupg.org site. It appears a similar problem exists at:
All urls end up in a message similar to:
The resource requested /cgi-bin/bugs.guug.de/db/si/pendingnormal
cannot be found.
If you feel that this is a configuration error, please contact the
administrators or the author of the referring referring page."
2. At  , the
news for GnuPG 1.0.7 appears twice
3. Not really web related, but I noticed the last 4 announcements
were not posted gnupg-announce, only to gnupg-devel and gpa-dev:
gpgme 0.3.14,
cryptplug 0.3.14, newpg 0.9.4 and cryptplug 0.3.15
4. Older pages for french, german and spanish are unavailable. Now
there's even some german in the front page. In general, any pages
removed from the older site now only display an error message! This
is also true for important sections of the old site like the
frontends! Maybe a standard redirect to the new home of GnuPG would
better server people
accessing from other existing site linking to older content. Search
in Google with this for an example :
5. At  , Robert
Guerra's link is dead
6. At  , the link at
"The latest HTML version is available _here_" is dead. There is also
a reference to RFC 2440 and the link is dead too. In 3.1, the
 link is dead too.
7.  has a different (the older) design, making
it look as if it's an external site

Hash: SHA1
Hello Gustavo,
Maybe this could be also an option in the "full installer"... Just
like when you install some applications, there's an option to create
a "rescue disk". The "rescue disk" could be the minimal files to run
WinPT + GnuPG + a backup of your current keyrings. If you are
installing for the first time, the rescue disk is created and then in
WinPT one can use the "backup keyrings" to add the keyrings to the
"rescue disk" ?
Part of this is the job of the installer (creating the disk itself)
and part of it the job of WinPT (the backup keyrings option). The
"Backup keyrings" could be a button right along the GnuPG options
dialog, after the field to specify keyring paths.
Making this a separate package also means you have to manage it
separately.. ;)
What do you think ?

Hash: SHA1
I recently updated my keys, which, combined with some signature

"isolation" of some keyservers.
There is a nice graphic from RedIris.es describing (all?) keyservers
relationships at:
Legend (thanks to [francisco.monserrat
Gray: No information on server type
Blue: Servers that have forwarded information to RedIris, pkcd
Red: LDAP servers at NAI/PGP Inc.
I'd like to know what would be the minimal list of keyservers I would
have to upload a public key to so it is available to the most people
I've also compiled a summary list with my personal reasons to update
at each keyserver, mostly www since I only keep one or two in WinPT's
keyserver file. Should I update to any other(s) ? What general
principles should I keep in mind ?
 -  - If you want your key to be
considered into the Keyanalyze reports, measuring Mean Shortest
Distance (MSD) to another key - not anabsolute measure of trust but
an interesting one
 - hell.on.earth.li:11371 - If you want your key to be visible in
Pathfinder searches (see  -  - To make yourself available for
keysigning, Pathfinder and KeyAnalyze reports available too
 -  - Still a site/server linked from many older
PGP resources
 - ldap://keyserver.pgp.com - The only place I know accepts keys with
Photo IDs, but not synchronized with others (?)
Jason Harris also has very interesting information on Photo IDs
support and other keyserver information, at:

@_subject: Verifying signatures via WWW interface 
Hi Bernd, all,
I am changing this to gnupg-users, I think it's more on-topic there. What I
am trying to do is create a minimal installation to verify messages via WWW,
using gpg. Somebody mentioned trusting the server... this would happen over
SSL, but the goal is not to keep the information secret/private, but to
verify a signature (date, author, integrity of content).
Bernd, I understand what you say and I still get the same warnings.
I am storing 2 public keys in a key ring, and both are fully trusted:
- Key A, signed by B and C
- Key B, signed by A and C
Note these were signed on another system, before importing to this one. If I
use gpg --verify and input a signed text from A, I would expect this to be
OK since I set trust to full on Key B.
However, gpg tells me:
gpg: Signature made Mon 13 May 2002 06:33:47 PM EDT using DSA key ID
gpg: Good signature from "Fabian Rodriguez "
gpg:                 aka "Fabian Rodriguez "
gpg:                 aka "Fabian Rodriguez "
Could not find a valid trust path to the key.  Let's see whether we
can assign some missing owner trust values.
No path leading to one of our keys found.
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the
gpg: Fingerprint: CBEA CB12 43B7 1CC9 711E  49CD 7D47 135C 5AF2 A4D5

Correct. This is what the press releases at pgp.com say. See:
To my knowledge, there hasn't been an official statement about this,
but one could presume that as GnuPG and other OpenPGP tools evolve,
so will NAI's (BTW, McAfee is a NAI company, or should I say NAT ->
Network Associates Technology). For a brief history of OpenPGP:
They don't have to, command-line is not theirs anyways. They are
strictly working on client products and admin tools for those
products, as I see it.
The fact it costs U$15K (lifetime licence) is another reason. But
price is not an issue for big organizations (*in their own words*).
BTW, which "high-profile" organizations use GnuPG as part of their
daily operations ? I'd love to have some examples to support our

Hi Thomas,
Language information is defined by RFC 1766. This will let you know
how the letters identifying a language are chosen:  RFC1766 - Tags for the Identification of Languages  -  For a list of languages currently defined by ISO, look at:
 ISO639: "Code for the representation of names of languages"  -  You can _localize_ based on language but also country. This way there
can be a Canadian french (fr_CA) or a more general french file (fr),
for example. In GnuPG those speaking portuguese have 2 choices with
GnuPG! : pt (portuguese) and brazilian portuguese (pt_BR). The
letters for country definitions come from:
 ISO3166-1: "English country names and code elements"  -  BTW, I believe this is where country-code level domains extensions
(for example google.ca in Canada) come from. WinPT (see winpt.org)
uses a similar way of naming the language files for the same purpose.
I think this may be a standard for developers of Gnu projects.
Last time I downloaded GnuPG, these files were available. I put the
languages with each one:
ca.mo - Catalan
cs.mo - Czech
da.mo - Danish
de.mo - German
el.mo - Greek, Modern (1453-)
eo.mo - Esperanto
es.mo - Spanish
et.mo - Estonian
fr.mo - French
gl.mo - Gallegan
id.mo - Indonesian
it.mo - Italian
ja.mo - Japanese
nl.mo - Dutch
pl.mo - Polish
pt.mo - Portuguese
pt_BR.mo - Portuguese / Brazil
sv.mo - Swedish
tr.mo - Turkish
The list is impressive! I wish the documentation would have so many
translators too. I'm interested in collaborating in the spanish and
french versions in general of any software, I first found abouth this
while using PHP (see
 - notice the "en"
in the path). The default language file for GnuPG is in english I
think, but you could also present it as en.mo ;)
BTW, a .mo is the binary version of a .po (source ?) equivalent file.
So one has to edit a .po source file and then compile it to .mo to
produce a new language.

Hi Paul,
What archive are you using ? THere are two, and the one at
marc.theaimsgroup.com has a search engine:
I believe this was answered in another reply.
If you are looking for just GnuPG binaries (command line, no
graphical interface), you can get them at gnupg.org. Otherwise I'd
invite you to take a look at WinPT (see   or
winpt.sf.net). WinPT uses GnuPG and provides a graphical interface to
it. We have recently re-organized the whole project and lots of
improvements have been done to the documentation and web site - an to
the applicationS :)

Hi Paul, all,
An important clarification: GPGRelay and Enigmail are email tools,
but WinPT is for general use with all types of content: email, files,
clipboard, etc.
It may help us suggest the appropriate tools if you tell us what will
be your primary use of GnuPG.

Thanks Werner!
How can this be prevented in the future ?
I suspect this is the result of having this in my gpg.conf:

I'd like to know if there are any open source IM clients supporting
OpenPGP via GnuPG or else, for Windows ?
I'd prefer something jabber-based, I currently use Trillian for ICQ

not OpenPGP compliant.
The closest thing I found is SpyShield:
However it's for MSN Messenger only and I'd rather use something less
intrusive/resource hungry.
Any suggestions ?

Maybe try this:

  gpg --keyserver keyserver.kjsl.com --recv-keys F661F608
Strangely, the web interface at finds the mentioned key, but the command line always returns gpg: key "F661F608" not found on keyserver
I tried different public keys with the same results.
However, the recv-keys command imports Ingo Kloeckers's public key!

Hash: SHA1
I've had this problem myself. I've found that one of the easiest
interfaces to get/publish my public key(s) is Biglumber.com, for the
following reasons:
 - The www link is short
 - It includes links to KeyAnalyze reports (to verify signature paths
=66rom/to you)
 - It supports (and displays!) image IDs without additional software
 - Its authentication nicely incorporates encryption for password
delivery (a nice example of OpenPGP use)
 - last but not least... it lists keysigning events, as well as
people who are interested in keysignings.
The maintainer is very receptive to suggestions, too.
BTW, since I have several keys, I'll be giving out one URL with
various biglumber.com links and maybe the preferred keyservers I use.
One of my biglumber.com entries is:
Of course, this does not eliminate the propagation problem you
mentioned. I actually upload my keys to several different keyservers,
which was discussed (well, at least replied to) in this thread:

Just an update on this...
I finally opted to bring with me the incorporation/registration
papers, which list me and my personal address, which establishes a
link with my "employer" (using my IDs where my address is). Also
brought a company invoice with my name on it.
During the keysigning that I attended, most people were surprised to
see a request for signing a "corporate" key. Most agreed that I sould
sign it, and that my web of trust would extend to this corporate key,
but that I did not need to have both signed. Some people also
suggested to put the fingerprint on letterhead and other places. It's
on our WHOIS record now, as someone else suggested.

more or less the same, only better explained:
