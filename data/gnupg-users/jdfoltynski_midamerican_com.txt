I tried to import pgp key (attached) created by Network Associates PGP
version 4 (I guess).
The following error occurred:
gpg: key A13350AD: no valid user IDs
gpg: this may be caused by a missing self-signature
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:           w/o user IDs: 1
I imported it to the latest NA PGP version, exported and tried import again
to gpg but it is still the same.
Is it possible to do anything with this?
Please help,
Is there anywhere archive of that list? Perhaps that problem was already

Thanks a lot!!! I imported it successfully.
But now I have another problem. I can encrypt a file manually, but gpg asks me always to confirm the operation (even if I signed imported public key with local private key and set trust mode to full: --edit -> trust -> 4).
I would like to create automated process.
I tried use option --yes, but did not work.
Is there any way to do that?

Jarek, this is an RSA key created with some old version of pgp,
which lacks a self-signature.
Adding the '--allow-non-selfsigned-uid' option to your command will tell
gnupg to accept the key.
 $ gpg --allow-non-selfsigned-uid --import ANRPL.asc
(You must be using version 1.0.3 in order to be able to use RSA keys)

Thanks a lot!!!
I appreciate your help.
If you don't mind I have one more question (the last one). I want to run
automated decryption process invoked from Java. And I do need to do that for private key protected with password (I understand that this doesn't
protects enough, since private key ring is accessible, but for business
people, to remove password from private key sounds really bad! :-)).
I could do this with option --passphrase-fd 0, and write to stdin. It works.
But is there any option that allow the same from command line?
BTW: I did not find options: --always-trust nor --allow-non-selfsigned-uid
on any man page ( nor man file attached with
install package). Perhaps there is more detailed man somewhere else.
Also I think the archive of questions and answers (not only FAQ) could be
placed somewhere on Web.
Thanks again

Just add the '--always-trust' option.
(Why don't you read the man page a bit more carefully?)
