@_subject: Help! I can't revoke my public Key! 
Hello to everyone.
I have just started using gpg in Ubuntu and I did some tests, creating keys
I uploaded one of them (ID is 134FE86D) in
with the username "Georgios N. Tzanakis" and then I tried to revoke it. I did what I have to do and got
the revoke key in the form below:
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: GnuPG v1.4.6 (GNU/Linux)
Comment: A revocation certificate should follow
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
 But when I try to submit it (that is, pasting all that to the
"Enter ASCII-armored PGP key here:" field, I get the message:
"Public Key Server -- Add
Key block in add request contained no new
keys, userid's, or signatures.
Your key block contained 1 format errors,
which were treated as if the erroneous elements
hadn't been part of your submission.
The last error was on key 0xffbfb3a8:
Key block corrupt: signature without key"
...and my unwanted key is always there.
Why the revoke key doesn't work?
Am I doing something wrong? (The passphrase and all that are correct).
       Thank you very much for your time.
                             George
