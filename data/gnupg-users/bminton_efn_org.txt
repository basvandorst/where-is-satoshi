They can be used, but almost certainly the only way you are going
to be able to do it is to generate the key with pgp and then
import it into gpg.  You will have to download and compile the
idea plugin, which may not be legal if you are using this for a
company.  For more information, see

I checked into this, I was able to successfully encrypt with pgp
2.6 and decrypt with gnupg and vice-versa.  When encrypting with
gnupg, the --pgp2 option is required.  I did have to get the
idea plugin, which has changed locations.  It is currently
available at ftp://ftp.gnupg.dk/pub/contrib-dk/idea.c.gz but I
don't know if it is legal to use.

Which doesn't address the original question, why is the public key
required for decryption, if the secret key is available, and has all
the necessary info?  (btw, I guess I was mistaken about the public key
not being recoverable from the secret key)

@_subject: adding and updating to keyservers 
Hash: SHA1
You mean added to the keyserver?  yes, just do: gpg --keyserver some.key.server --send-keys 0xYOURKEYID
(if you don't have internet connectivity, you can do the following:
gpg -a --export 0xYOURKEYID > mypubkey.ask
then copy that file to one of the keyserver web interfaces.
when you make a revocation with gnupg, it is just a signature.  You have
to import it, which will add the revocation certificate to your public
key.  You can then repeat the steps to send the key to the keyservers
They receive the key from the keyserver, then call you up (or meet in
person is even better) and verify the fingerprint of the public key that
they have is the same as the one that you have.  (extra signatures,
userids, etc do not affect the fingerprint) then they will do gpg

@_subject: delete ID 
Hash: SHA1
You can't just delete them, because the keyservers (almost) never
delete anything, only add.  What you need to do is revoke them,
and gpg won't show them.  To revoke the id, first edit the key:
(of course, use your own key id)
Then select the id you wish to revoke.  A * will show the userid
currently being edited.  Then, revoke your selfsig on that id:
gpg will ask if you are sure, etc.  You may repeat this process
for every userid you wish to revoke.  Finally, save the key:
N.B. I am not sure if the RFC explicitly defines revoking
userids, but certainly revoking the selfsig on a particular user
achieves the same effect.

Hash: SHA1
I think you need to be more specific with what you want, when you say you
don't want to change directory structure.  --prefix doesn't change the
directory structure, it just relocates the entire hierarchy.  For instance, if
I run configure with --prefix=/foo/bar the binaries will be in /foo/bar/bin
the man pages will be in /foo/bar/man etc.  If you want everything to go
to /usr/local (the default prefix) but want the binaries to go somewhere else,
you can use the --bindir option  For more info, call configure with --help

@_subject: Fw: encrypting and signing a file without a passphrase 
Hash: SHA1
In this case, "foo" is just a generic name for the id of the key
you want to edit.  In other words, if your keyid was 0x12345678,
you would do:
    gpg --edit 0x123345678
However, removing your passphrase is not generally considered a
good idea.  A better idea is to use a program such as
quintuple-agent to store your passphrase temporarily, in a
reasonably secure manner.  It is available here:     Hope this helps,

Indirectly it does.  When you sign a message, the keyid of the
signing key is included in the signature. As for advertising it, many people put it in their email sig, on

Yes, but this is not completely true.  For instance, without spaces,
some passphrases are equivalent: consider the following extremely insecure
two-word passphrases
the mice
them ice
now, if an attacker tries one of these, w/o spaces, the other one is free.
This decreases the potential number of passphrases.  It is therefore
reccomended to use spaces.
