@_subject: gnupg-1.0.4 won't create ~/.gnupg 
(Please Cc: me on the reply as I'm not subscribed)
Env: Solaris 2.5.1 with egd running.
I have noticed that gnupg-1.0.4 behaves differently from 1.0.2 in that it
does not try to create the ~/.gnupg directory.  $HOME is set so I should not have to set  "--homedir somedir"
% gpg --list-keys
gpg: keyblock resource `/home/csession/.gnupg': file open error
gpg: keyblock resource `/home/csession/.gnupg': file open error
Under 1.0.2 it would create the ~/.gnupg directory first, then prompt to
run gpg again.  What changed?
