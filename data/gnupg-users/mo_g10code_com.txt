We are pleased to announce version 1.1.42 of Libgcrypt, a general
purpose cryptography library based on the code used in GnuPG. It may
be downloaded from the following locations:

PLEASE NOTE: This is still marked as an unstable development version.
This release of Libgcrypt contains several important API changes,
please see below for details.
Noteworthy changes since version 1.1.12
 All types have been renamed to conform to the GNU coding standards,
 most of the time by keeping the whole name in lowercase and inserting
 underscores between words.
 The concept of a Libgcrypt specific `errno' variable has been dropped
 entirely.  Functions that used to set this errno variable, return an
 appropriate error code directly.
 Libgcrypt depends on libgpg-error, a library that provides error codes
 and according functions for all GnuPG components.  Functions that used
 to return error codes asa `int' have been changed to return a code of
 type `gcry_error_t'.
 A new interface for the use of asymmetric cryptography is included.
 Backward compatibility is provided where it was possible without too
 much effort and did not collide with the overall sanitization effort.
 However, this is only for ease of transition.  NO DEPRECATED FUNCTION
 OR DATA TYPE IS CONSIDERED A PART OF THE API OR ABI AND WILL BE
 DROPPED IN THE FUTURE WITHOUT CHANGING THE SONAME OF THE LIBRARY.
 Recommendations how to replace deprecated or removed functionality can
 be found within the description of each change.
 What follows are all changes to the interface and behaviour of
 Libgcrypt in detail.
 * If gcrypt.h is included in sources compiled by GCC 3.1 or later,
   deprecated attributes will warn about use of obsolete functions and
   type definitions.  You can suppress these warnings by passing
   -Wno-deprecated-declarations to the gcc command.
 * gcry_check_version must be called from now on to initialize the
   library, it is not longer optional.
 * The following types have been renamed.  The old types are still
   available as aliases, but they are deprecated now:
   Old name:		New name:
   GCRY_MPI		gcry_mpi_t
   GcryMPI		gcry_mpi_t
   GCRY_SEXP            gcry_sexp_t
   GcrySexp             gcry_sexp_t
   GCRY_CIPHER_HD       gcry_cipher_hd_t
   GcryCipherHd		gcry_cipher_hd_t
   GCRY_MD_HD		gcry_md_hd_t
   GcryMDHd		gcry_md_hd_t
 * All GCRYERR_* error symbols have been removed, since they are now
   contained in libgpg-error (GPG_ERR_*).
 * All functions and types in libgpg-error have been wrapped in
   Libgcrypt. The new types are gcry_err_code_t and gcry_err_source_t.
   The new functions are gcry_err_code, gcry_err_source, gcry_error,
   gcry_err_make, gcry_error_from_errno, gcry_err_make_from_errno,
   gcry_err_code_from_errno, gcry_err_code_to_errno,
   gcry_strsource.
 * New cipher: Twofish128; New cipher modes: CTR, CBC-MAC.
 * New message digests: SHA384, SHA512, CRC-32, CRC32-RFC1510,
   CRC-24-RFC2440.
 * For RSA decrypt operations, RSA blinding is used automatically to
   prevent the leaking of timing informationen, that can be used to
   compute the secret key, in case the operations can be measured
   precisely.  This mode of operation can be disabled with a special
   flag.
 * gcry_sexp_canon_len does not use a `historically encoded' error
   code anymore.

@_subject: USB vs Smart Card? 
Without further context this question does not make too much sense.  USB
sticks (i guess that is what you mean) are completely different from
smartcards when it comes to security solutions.
Surely it is possible to e.g. store secret keys on a USB stick and thus
enforce the use of that device for secret operations.  But what USB
sticks do not provide you with is encapsulation of secret operations.
Means: while it is possible to copy the secret key from your USB stick
to the computer to which the device is connected, crypto smartcards
(e.g. the OpenPGP smartcard) do never give out the secret key.  The
decrypt/sign operations are implemented in the card itself, access is
protected with PINs.

Poldi 0.4 has been released. Poldi is our PAM module, which implements
authentication through the OpenPGP smartcard.
It can be fetched from:
Changes since version 0.3 are:
* Many parts have been rewritten and/or reorganized
* GPLv3+
  Changed License to GPL v3 or later.
* SCdaemon support
  Poldi uses the scdaemon from now on instead of talking to the
  smartcard directly.
* Authentication methods
  Implemented abstraction layer for "authentication methods".  The
  previous authentication process is now encapsulated in an
  authentication method named "localdb".
* X509
  Added another authentication method named "x509", which interacts
  with Dirmngr in order to provide authentication through a X509 PKI.
* i18n
  Added support for internationalization.
  Added german translation.
Please note that Poldi is still marked as experimental.

More or less.  But it requires some hacking.  SCDaemon allows for
signalling in case of certain events, including card removal.  One
approach would be: write a small daemon, which connects to SCDaemon and
waits for the card-removal event.  Let that daemon execute a
user-defined script when the cards removed and make sure the daemon is
started on session start.
When i think about it... I guess that daemon could be implemented as a
GNOME panel applet.  Sitting in the panel and displaying certain card

Keep in mind that we are talking about a hybrid crypto system. Your
hidden assumption seems to be that the session key which is generated
during encryption to a public key is not worth attacking. Then, nothing
prevents you from using that session key together with a symmetric
crypto system directly.
In a way, the public-key crypto system is a layer on top of a symmetric
crypto system, which tries to solve the key distribution problem. When
you don't want to distribute keys -- and that's how I understand you --
it doesn't make much sense to use it.

@_subject: future proof file encryption 
Not quite. In general: you shouldn't base the security on the secrecy of
the methods used (algorithm, implementation, ...).  Besides, when using
a program which implements a documented standard, it doesn't matter what
actual implementation of the standard you (or the attacker) use(s). The
security should depend on the secrecy of your key.

Actually, the graphical pinentry should capture the keyboard focus and
