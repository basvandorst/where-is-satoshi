@_subject: can gnupg symmetrically encrypt in a pgp-2 compatible way? 
Hi all,
After reading the docs and loading the necessary 'idea' module, it is
unclear to me whether gnupg can do conventional symmetric encryption,
in a way that is pgp-2 compatible.
Doing the obvious
      gpg --verbose --rfc1991 --digest-algo=md5 --compress-algo 1 \
              --cipher-algo=idea -c -a -o encrypted.asc plaintext
doesn't seem to work, as
      pgp encrypted.asc
complains with
      Error:  Bad pass phrase.
Going the other way works and gnupg (given the right options) has no
problem decoding pgp-2 symmetrically encrypted messages.
Any ideas, or pointers for further reading ?
Thanks in advance.

Thanks for your reply. Even after adding these options
        echo -n "test" >key
        gpg \
        --verbose --rfc1991 \
        --digest-algo=md5 --compress-algo 1 --cipher-algo=idea \
        -c --armor  -o encrypted.asc \
        --s2k-mode 0 --s2k-digest-algo MD5 --s2k-cipher IDEA \
        --passphrase-fd 4  \
        plaintext 4<key
        pgp -z`cat key` encrypted.asc
pgp cannot decrypt the file.
If it matters the program versions are
        gpg (GnuPG) 1.0.1	(1.0.0 shows same behavior also)

@_subject: symmetric encryption in a PGP-2 compatible way? 
I attempted to conventionally encrypt a message in a PGP-2 compatible
way (usimg the idea extension), but it doesn't seem to work.
The file that gpg produces, with a command like:
seems to contain a packet of unknown length, as found with:
Then pgp2 fails to decrypt the produced file, while gpg succeeds in doing so.
Interestingly enough, pgp2 creates symmetrically encrypted messages
which are properly read by gpg:
It seems that the unknown length packet is giving pgp2 a hickup...
Is this a known bug or what ? After reading all the docs
I could lay my hands (actually my browser) on, I 'm still puzzled.
Any ideas ?  Thanks in advance for any help,

PS. This is gpg 1.0.1c running on a linux box
