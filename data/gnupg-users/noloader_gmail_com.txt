Hi All,
I recently installed GPA. I'm trying to locate a friend's public key
by either name or email address. GPA appears to only offer Key ID
(which I don't have).
Does anyone have tricks for locating a key by name or email?

Search for Security Levels and then take a look at NIST SP 800-57
(Table 2, Comparable Strengths), SP 800-131, or ECRYPT2's "Yearly
Report on Algorithms and Keysizes"
It depends on whom you ask. NIST say yes under most situations, others
say no. Lenstra, et al feel 1024 RSA/P-160 ECC will hold until 2020
with an acceptable amount of risk. See "On the Security of 1024-bit
RSA and 160-bit Elliptic Curve Cryptography"
The bad guy can recover your secrets because the "work" to break the
key is too easy.
See above.
A 1024 bit key has a security level of about 80 bits. The 2048 bit key
holds about 112 bits of security.
The bad guy has two choices: break the 1024 signing key (80 bits of
security), or allow you to send an ephemeral key comparable to a 2048
bit modulu (112 bits of security) and break the 2048 ephemeral key. He
either attacks the 1024 bit key, or the 2048 bit key. He choice is
simple: break your signing key (1024 bits), then step in the middle
and sign an ephemeral key of his choosing (pretending to be you).
As a side note, most SSL certificates I have looked at mismatch
security levels also. GeoTrust just issued me two certificates signed
with SHA-1. Yet my keys were RSA 2048/SHA-224. The bad guy should
attack GeoTrust's weaker signature rather than my authentication keys

offences used encryption techniques that pre-date the birth of
Jesus.... Woolwich Crown Court was told that Bangladeshi Islamic

modern systems such as PGP or TrueCrypt in favour of a system which
used Excel transposition tables, which they had invented themselves.

Not politically feasible. In the US, corporations ensures that
legislation favors corporate via bribes (err, PAC contributions). The
first step to remediate the problem is disgorging politicians from
their money, which probably will not happen in our lifetime.

If you run your mail server, you should be able to set up a secure
channel by having your MTA issue a STARTTLS command. The communication
from the originating MTA to your MTA will be secure (some hand
waiving). If the sender connects to his/her mail server securely (and
MTA's use TLS), then most opportunities for message inspection and
tampering should be remediated.

@_subject: Storing secrets on other people's computers 
I was somewhat surprised at the article.
I think a typical user expects that a file is encrypted locally and
then securely transmitted to DropBox for storage. (I don't use
DropBox, but its what I expected). I don't believe anyone would expect
that DropBox transmits a plain text file and then encrypts the file at
its leisure and pleasure.
OT: I was just getting ready to audit DropBox via their public API for
another project. The article saved me a lot of time.
