I am hoping to use GnuPG to encrypt some database flat file backups.  My
initial testing worked great, no issues.  However I have started testing
with some slightly larger files - currently 5.7GB in size.  I have tried
it with the default compression on and with a '-z 0'.  The gpg file gets
created with no issues in either case.  When I try to decrypt it though
I get the following error:
gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit ELG-E key, ID C8D07746, created 2005-09-02
      "System Administrator "
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=00)
gpg: WARNING: encrypted message has been manipulated!
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=06)
This happens at the 1.5GB mark every time.
I saw this from the archives:
Has this been fixed in the newer releases?  Or am I missing something
obvious? Additional Details:
Running on Windows 2000 SP4
Using GnuPG 1.4.2 (installed via the installer package to c:\GnuPG)
To encrypt I am using this command line:
'gpg --encrypt-files -r "System Administrator" -z 0
To decrypt I am using this command line:
'gpg --decrypt0files '
Any assistance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!  Just let me
know if I left a piece of information out that you may need.

First apologies for whatever mangling Outlook Web Access does to this email.
I tried the command line above on a smaller file (which has been encrypting and decrypting with no issues) and received the following error:
gpg: input line 1 too long or missing LF
Am I typing something wrong?  Here is what I typed:
gpg --encrypt-files -r "System Administrator" -z 0 < sql-db.bak > sql-db.gpg
The files I am trying to encrypt/decrypt are Microsoft SQL Backup flat files (DB dumps).
Thanks again!
