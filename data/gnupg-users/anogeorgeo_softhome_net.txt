@_subject: Option file setting of cipher and hash not global? 
Hi,  --I hope this is not a double post, forgive me if it is-- My system:
Windows XP Home SP2
GnuPG 1.4.5 I wish to have GnuPG automatically use the cipher algo TWOFISH and hash algo RIPEMD-160 for all keys that are created. I have these settings in my "gpg.conf":
cipher-algo TWOFISH
digest-algo RIPEMD160
s2k-cipher-algo TWOFISH
s2k-digest-algo RIPEMD160 But when I create a new key and use "showpref" I find the key is using the cipher AES256 and the hash SHA1. Is it possible to make all keys use TWOFISH and RIPEMD-160 by default? Also, is there a batch command that will automatically process the "setpref" command after "gpg --edit-key {key is processed?  I tried using the following batch file but it prompts to "Command>" after processing "gpg  --edit-key {key  ---
cd "C:\Program Files\GnuPG" gpg --edit-key {key setpref S10 S9 S3 H3 H10 H9 Z2 Z1
 --- Thank you,
Anothony

@_subject: Compatability option question (pgp2) 
Hi, I am cuirous about the available compatability options for PGP used within gpg.conf. If I add "pgp2" to my gpg.conf will GnuPG only use the settings associated with "pgp2" when I am encrypting to a key made with PGP 2.x, 6.x, etc?  Or, would "pgp2" over-ride other settings I have in gpg.conf? Thank you,
Anothony
