@_subject: ksba_crl_parse failed: Invalid CRL object 
When dirmngr tries to load  I get "ksba_crl_parse failed: Invalid CRL object" in the logfile and verification failes. Other CRLs are binary, this one starts with "-----BEGIN X509 CRL-----".
Is this expected behavior or what can I do to fix it?

Sorry, that didn't work. Is there a way to unarmor the file?
Other ideas?
I'm surprised at rsasecurity doing something unusual.

And what do they want to do with the recieved emails? The only possibility I see is to put everyone's private keys and passowrds into a safe - then you can decrypt sent and received mail later.

Do you have the current libassuan-config in your PATH?
More than one version of libassunan installed and both in lib-dirs that are used to compile/link?
