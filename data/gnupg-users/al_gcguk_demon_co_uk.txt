Hi folks,
This is my first post here, I still have much reading to do to get fully
up to speed with GnuPG.
I just wanted to point out that the List-Archive header doesn't point to
a URL.  It simply shows:
List-Archive: Not a biggy I know, but thought I should let you know.
Toodle pip,

I didn't know a bug had already been filed.
Sorry for the noise!
