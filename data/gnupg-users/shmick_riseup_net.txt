@_subject: Libgcrypt 1.6.0 released and gunpg 2.x 
this looks like a significant upgrade
if i have already compiled gnupg 2.x with libgcrypt 1.5.3, and i want to
use the new 1.6.0, do i need to uninstall gnupg & libcrypt and then
compile both again together, and re-install ?
gnupg 2.x would not work with the new libgcrypt if i just install it
alone, would it ? (im sure i have to do it all again...)

if i alter preferences to a public key after i uploaded it to
keyservers, do i need to upload it a 2nd time in order for people to
contact me without my public key ?

@_subject: what is "correct" for users' Preferred keyserver ? 
i've seen a multitude of ways people input data into this pref
for example, some people put a link to their public key .asc or .txt file
some others put a link to an actual keyserver
from the name of the actual pref, it states a keyserver, so shouldn't
users input a link to their Preferred keyserver and not a link to
download a public key or txt file ?

i recently saw [2] listed as the last cipher in somebody's public key
the key didn't specify 3DES neither - that goes against the RFC but how
is that possible ?

@_subject: gpg --verify email.eml 
lately some recipients have not been able to decrypt some emails
ie. some can decrypt them; some can't
every time i send a signed+encrypted email, enigmail reports signature
verification failed but the status bar is green !
but when i send just signed emails, no problem with sig verification
(status bar is still green)
if thunderbird and enigmail were used to construct emails, and  enigmail
debug output reports everything ok:
[GNUPG:] GOODSIG
[GNUPG:] VALIDSIG
[GNUPG:] TRUST_ULTIMATE
[GNUPG:] DECRYPTION_OKAY
[GNUPG:] GOODMDC
[GNUPG:] END_DECRYPTION
gpg --verify -vv email.eml
gpg: armor: BEGIN PGP MESSAGE
gpg: armor header: Charset: utf-8
:pubkey enc packet: version 3, algo 1, keyid 0000000000000000
gpg: verify signatures failed: unexpected data
how should i proceed to debug this ?
i downgraded enigmail to enigmail 1.6 because i couldn't sign or encrypt
at all with the recent update

actually you chose to step out of the front door today i assume ?
you took the bus to work or maybe you drove ?
i don't know, maybe a tractors more your thing, but you took it to the

how many times were you photographed by the big bad social network
before your first coffee break?
how can you as an individual be in control of this ?
how is it a choice ?
do you honestly believe you're in control of what information you share?
no prob, phone[sic] up FB or dr G and have a word to the secretary:
"yes sir, we just had a looksy & can confirm all your bits are 100%
accounted for, your datas are currently residing on 3,521 servers in 59
countries and if you like, we can press this red button and have it all

includes free removal of your NSA vacuum trail, we can delete that too
with the same red button because your data that we were forced to share

which privacy policy thesis have you read cover-to-cover ?

which CV of yours have you parted ways with to prospective employers is

where is your CV from 15 years ago - you know precisely how many people

used to be fun getting prints back from the lab of you and your partner
having fun times; there was a certain nativity before high-speed data

are kids confident that they know their snapchats will be deleted just

where are these snap chats now - do they know lest do they care ?
to err is human, but to forgive divine - how do you tell hard disks this ?
geer's point about moving to a new town also relevant about not

if you truly wanna be in control of your data, your gonna have to
regulate and restrain yourself until your testicles are drawn over the
back of your neck *or* accept it aint possible now, it may never be, and
when you accept that you'll keep out of the loony bin & fruit cake parlour
or, don't have any data, go to the amazon

why it was, who did it and what the content was, right ?

@_subject: his public key is 5 monitors high, and her same key is 1 ? 
what are the factors involved in creating such discrepancies with folks'
public key lengths ?
i mean, some people's are 5 monitors high where as the other joe has
seemingly created a similar key and that key is one half a monitor in
'monitor' height
what does all this mean ?
how have people such varying public key 'sizes' ?
and how is this achieved ?
are public, private, and key pairs in general stronger/safer (what ever
that may mean) if observing their public keys are many monitors high or
have they gone to extreme measures in something in particular ?

@_subject: list packets output & other misc 
in a test key i have 4 subkeys; 2 for sign and 2 for encrypt
gnupg automatically chooses the most recently created 's' and 'e'
subkeys to sign and encrypt a file
how can i mandatorily specify using other subkeys for the same primary
key for 's' or 'e' either on command line or in an email client for
example ?
when i list packets, it tells me which key was used for 's' (in long
format) but for 'e' (in short format) it says gpg: encrypted with ELG
key, ID 0x00000000
how do i determine which key was used for encrypt ?
do i assume it used the most recently created 'e' subkey ?
is there a reference for the numerical values of version, hash, cipher,
algo, sk2, etc ?

Robert J. Hansen:
i think the point daniel is making is that there is freely available
software which is actively maintained and receives security updates and
is not a decade old
any modern OS can utilise thunderbird + enigmail as an example
there's great work done to bring gnupg to windows with gpg4win
why *wouldn't* you use it ?
is it really a case of obdurateness, "if it ain't broke don't fix it,"
or an unwillingness to use and get accustomed to something new and/or
different, perhaps a new gui - look, i completely sympathise with the
latter especially for older people if i may generalise
if you're a windows user you'll have to upgrade after 10 years if you
want to keep safe or pay ($) for it; ok, now i sympathise with people
not wanting a new gui with windows 8
see above
the don't *have* to but, sure, they *can*
