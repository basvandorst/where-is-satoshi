@_subject: Possible Bug in GnuPG? 
I've got to agree with Pierre-Henri on this -- I've tried unsubscribing
from this list as well to no avail.  The only thing that remains an option
to me is setting up sendmail rules to 550 the mail -- something I _don't_
want to do, because it's absurd.
Who is managing the list?  Why can't this get solved?  Mailing lists are
_not_ that difficult to administrate.

Yes, I've sent email to gnupg-users-request with the body of
unsubscribe.  It claims it can't find my email address (yes, I subscribed
with the same email address).

Never ye mind.  Seems Werner fixed the problem in the last two weeks since
my last unsubscription attempt.
(Flame away, I'm unsubscribed *chuckle*)

@_subject: GNUpg v1.01/FreeBSD-20000214-CURRENT 
Don't know if this is an isolated problem, and I'm relatively new to GPG
(been using PGP2.6.2 and PGP5 for some time now).. I scanned the mailing
list, read the bug list, to no avail.
gpg --gen-key runs somewhat fine on the aforementioned FreeBSD system, but
when it goes to generate the random bytes, it says "Not enough random
bytes available.  Please do some other work to give
the OS a chance to collect more entropy! (Need 20 more bytes)"
I've updated the locatedb, done make clean in /usr/ports, compiled XFree,
etc during this process, but it says this none-the-less every time.
Am I doing something wrong, and if not, what can I do to help track down
the issue at hand?

I gave it 30 minutes last night while doing lots of things.  No change,
except it started regenerating data and then requested 128 more bytes of
(Celeron 500.. Would hope gpg keygen wouldn't take 30 mins)

@_subject: gpg with current pgp keys 
IIRC there's something on the gpg webpages about doing this -- seems the
secret key algorithm is stored differently.  The workaround is to change
your secret key password to NULL using pgp, export it, import it into
gpg, and then change your password there.

@_subject: gpg --recv-key option 
Put  into your webbrowser, and from there you can search
by email to recieve Hex ID's.

@_subject: gpg --recv-key option 
Searching by {email,lastname,firstname,anything but the keyid} is very
susceptible to security issues, IMHO.  I think taking the extra step to
getting the KeyID is a "good thing"(tm).

@_subject: gpg --recv-key option 
Imagine if your name is "Bob Smith", a very common name I'm sure.  gpg
--recv-key --keyserver whatever Bob Smith would download a HUGE chunk of
keys.  That just wouldn't be right.
I think it is good to go the the pgp.mit.edu key search, search for your
friend Bob Smith, then snag his key by HexID.

@_subject: Collecting entropy? 
BSD machine:
in /etc/defaults/rc.conf, set rand_irqs=""
It defaults to keyboard controller, IIRC, which is not helpful on a
headless terminal.
I use the IRQ of my disk controller, then run a find / creates wonderful
entropy. =]

That should be fine, but you should tell the ISP to change it -- random
number entropy is a "good thing"(tm) to have, and they don't have it
unless someone's there banging at their console.
