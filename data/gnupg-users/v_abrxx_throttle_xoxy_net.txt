@_subject: Show that an encrypted message was signed, without decrypting it 
Stefan Claas :
As far as I know this is impossible, because messages are first signed and then encrypted, i.?e.?the signature is encrypted, too.? Therefore there is no access to the signature unless the message is decrypted.?
Yes, but why should she want to be able to do that?? She could decrypt the message and, if it turns out that the message is not signed, discard the message.?
As far as I know the order ?first sign, then encrypt? is mandatory, so there is no way for GnuPG to deviate from it.?
And this is a good thing, as it thwarts Eve eavesdropping on the originator's identity (i.?e.?Bob) of a message sent to Alice.?
