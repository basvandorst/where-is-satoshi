@_subject: Smartcards - using them over multiple computers and deleting their 
I bought a GPG smartcard, but, I'm having issues using it. I first
tested it out on my desktop and messed around with it a little
generating a few keys, now I've populated my keyring with a bunch of
keys I have no idea how to delete, any help?
The second issue is when I was happy with how the GPG key worked, I went
over to an offline compuer I launched up a live CD, I generated the key,
imported it to the card, backed up the private key and transferred the
public key a webserver that allowed raw viewing, I then went into my
card (`gpg2 --card-edit`) and allocated it the url (`admin` `url`
` On my desktop I can now do:-
But if I then go to decrypt a file encrypted for that public key, it
doesn't attempt to use the smartcard, it just errors out:-
How do I get gpg to link the public key and my smartcard together? It
works fine if the GPG key was generated and imported _on the current
computer_, but, I can't get it to link with the card otherwise (And
running `gpg2 --card-status` doesn't help).
Thanks in advance.

Sorry, both issues were solved by downgrading from 2.1.0 to 2.0.26 (Both
Arch Linux repo packages), after looking at the bug tracker it seems a
very similar (Although not identical) issue has been reported, so, I'm
going to wait for that to be resolved before I start opening issues of
my own.
See:- Thanks, sorry for not reading the bugtracker first.

@_subject: Mainkey with many subkeys?? 
Stupid question inbound:- If you make a bunch of subkeys, say, one for
your phone, one for your desktop and one for your laptop, how does that
work? I would assume if I send a piece of encrypted data to your
laptop's subkey's public key and you were on your desktop, you'd have to
go to your laptop to decrypt it, wouldn't you? Or am I missing something?

If you just wish to encrypt, not sign, to the user, use:-
Or the shorter version:-
It will dump supersecret.txt.gpg, that's your encrypted file. This isn't
signed (I.E. the receiver won't be able to verify _you_ sent it, and can
be replaced (Although not read) in transit). If you wish to sign it,
you'll also need a GPG key in your keyring, then run:-
Or the shorter version:-
Where FFEEDDCC is your key identifier and AABBCCDD is the recipient's
key identifier. When they decrypt the file, they will see something
along the lines of:-
the command you're using, --symmetric, is for using a passphrase for
encryption/decrypt (I.E. symmetric encryption, not asymmetric).
--hidden-recipient should work too, and is used if you don't wish to
include information about the recipient in the gpg file, you probably
don't want to use this option (As oppose to --recipient) unless you
really do wish to use the features it provides.
As for the failed public key, may I ask the exact command you're
running? I get the same error message when I specify a recipient that
doesn't exist:-

.gpg is the extension of encrypted files, .asc is normally ASCII armored
files (Signatures and the like), if you'd like to generate one of those,
look into the -a option (for Ascii). A complete command would look
something like `gpg2 -u AABBCCDD -as supersecret.txt`. The generated
supersecret.txt.asc will only verify to someone who already has the .txt
that it hasn't been touched/modified and that the key AABBCCDD did
verify it as being legitimate, they won't be able to extrapolate
supersecret.txt out of it. It's _only_ for signing, _not_ for
encrypting/transportation of data, which is why you often see them on
this mailing list and downloads (You want to verify that the user sent
the data, but not encrypt it (Since it's public)).
If you try to run:-
It should tell you it's encrypted and the destination public key, then
error out (As it's not destined for you). As for the "There is no
assurance this key belongs to thhe named user", this is because you
haven't trusted them yet. If you do trust the key as being the key they
claim to be, and have verified the key through out-of-bands means (I.E.
Not over the internet, or using an already secure channel over the
internet, this is *not* emails, this is *not* Skype, this is *not* text
messages), then you can take a look at this:-
P.S. I'm replying to you on-list for the reasons:-
1. People are able to verify if I say anything stupid
2. In the case I haven't said anything stupid, someone else could also
learn from this (I.E. Location this thread in the future via a search
I recommend you do the same.

Ignore all of this. I made a huge mistake, apparently you can encrypt
data and store it in the ASCII files, I have no idea why I thought you
couldn't, it's so logical that you can, all it is doing is storing bytes
as ASCII, it's just I've never seen it in use so I never connected the
dots until I read vedaal's message.
What I'm trying to say is:-
.asc can be used for encrypted connect, albeit probably not recommending
if you're sending large files, just as much as it can be used for
signatures. Signatures are to verify the content hasn't been modified,
encryption is to verify that only the recipient can read the data, and
encrypt+sign is to verify the data hasn't been modified and the
recipient is the only one who can read it.
There we go, sorry for the mistake, I feel very stupid right about now.

What version was your card? It should work fine on a 2.0 smart card,
but, it's by design made to brick 1.X cards. Pete probably should have
warned you about this first.
Also, if it was a 2.0 smart card, what key was it?
