Hi Everyone,
I'm new to GnuPG (and PGP).
I've been through the key generation, import, export, encrypt, decrypt,
sign steps, but I have one question:
I primarily plan to use GnuPG to decrypt files sent to me, encrypted
with my public key.  Everytime I decrypt I get prompted for my
passphrase to use my secret key.  Is there a way to enter than on the
command-line?  I'm using Microsoft Win32 binaries.

Hi Graham,
oops.  I should probably add this important factoid.  Sorry for not saying
it earlier:
I'm trying to setup a batch system - so a GUI shell doesn't work unless it
can be controlled via some sort of automation process.
I read the FAQ that recommended dispensing with passphrases altogether, but
I'm not sure I understand the full implications of that.  It seems better to
have the management program send the password on the command line that to
have no password at all.  I'm guessing that stealing the keyring file is all
someone would need if there were no passphrases.  I'd rather make them have
to steal the keyring AND find AND steal the passphrase before they could use
the keys.
I've used the --password-fd 0 option to send the pwd on STDIN, but in
Windows that means using an input pipe from a file written to disk.  Is
there another way?
I just realized something though -- these other shells must have a mechanism
for getting the passphrase from themselves to GPG -- does anyone know how
they do it?

Hi Johan,
That works.  However, the space before the pipe must be removed:
Echo pass|...
Thank you!

@_subject: GnuPG main site down 
I was on the site a week ago and downloaded GPG with no troubles, so it
existed that recently (unlike the mirrors), so I assume GPG is still
actively supported (?).  I cannot access the site either though.
I'm also curious as to what this implies.
