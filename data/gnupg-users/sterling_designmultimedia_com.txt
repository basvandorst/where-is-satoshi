@_subject: AW: GnuPG with PHP 
PHP is Free software.  Its not FSF free (GPL or LGPL, but it is free
software (its under an Apache Style license).
Well, actually if GPG is under the GPL (and no other license, if its LGPL
than it would be ok), it would not be allowed for PHP to link against GPG
(exec'ing and picking up the results from a PHP script, is to my knowledge, perfectly
legal).  This is because the current PHP license is not compatible with
It is written in C.
