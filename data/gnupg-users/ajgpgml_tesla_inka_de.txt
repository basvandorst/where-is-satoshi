@_subject: Strange behaviour with --edit-key/uid (GPG1.1.92, Win32) 
I wonder if this is really correct behaviour of GPG:
If I start GPG with the following command:=20
C:\BIN>gpg --status-fd 1 --command-fd 0 --edit-key xxx>1.txt
The UserIDs are not printed into the redirected File of StdOut (FD 1); =
they're still listed in the DOS-Box on the screen.
(And yes, they're also not going into StdErr (FD 2) -- at least on my =
machine (Win98))
Why I would need this: I want to parse the UserID-Lists to allow =
Delete-UserID via my very own little Frontend. And I also cannot rely on =
the order given by
    gpg --list-keys --with-colons --fixed-list-mode xxx
as I have at least one key where the UID-Numbers are different than the =
printed order.
Any solutions to this problem?

@_subject: Using multiple subkeys in GPG 
I have read the "Using multiple subkeys in GPG"-Article =
( and tried it just out of curiosity.
Although I don't want to use this "trick", but I believe someone out =
there might and I want my program to be prepared...
My question is: How can I tell that a secret primary-key is really =
present and not just unusable when invoking GPG with "!".
I mean how to tell programmatically.=20
The article mentions=20
    gpg --export-secret-keys | gpg --list-packets
where "primary secret key should be marked with 'gnu-dummy S2K'."
Is this the only way? Shouldn't the "sc"-Flags be missing in the =
"--list-secret-keys --with-colons" too?

@_subject: OK, here goes trouble... re c:\gnupg 
As Walter said: It's no problem to "mkdir .gnupg" under Win98. It's then renamed to "gnupg~1" for the old FAT 8.3-Naming.
But nevertheless I'd opt for the "special Name" because Explorer bitches around.
It's actually %APPDATA%, which is also present in Win98, it's introduced with InternetExplorer 4 (so Win95+MSIE4 should also work), just have a look at:
SHGetSpecialFolderPath(...) using CSIDL_APPDATA.
But ExpandEnvironmentStrings(...) should do as well (and without further investigation looks easier to check for "isPresent").
About the "AppPath": I think the idea was to go for:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths
After you entered the full path as default-string for eg.
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths\gpg.exe
you can go for "start gpg" (of course if "gpg" will be found in %PATH% this preceeds the App Paths-Entry).
Optionally you can add a "path"-string below the entry, which should give the path DLLs located somewhere else.

@_subject: Encrypting / decrypting without importing keys? 
Actually you also have to add "--no-options" as there might be a multi-keyring-setup (one or more "--keyring file" in the gpg.conf).
Unfortunately there is no "--no-keyrings-from-options" (or similar) which seems to bother no one :)

@_subject: Ignore use of "--keyring" in options-file 
I have a setup with multiple keyrings, all added automatically by my standard options-file "gpg.conf".
Now I've looked for something similar to "--no-default-keyring" which also ignores the other "default"-Keyrings of my options-file, but there seems to be nothing like this. Any chance this will be implemented? (Or have I overseen it? And no, I'd dislike to use a modified gpg.conf in parallel, or remember what was important and use --no-options).

@_subject: Problem: Charsets in 1.4.1rc2 
The charsets are handled very good (thanks to iconv.dll), but unfortunately it seems like copepage-issues with system-strings aren't taken into account:
In the win98-console (CP850) I'll type "gpg test.txt.asc" to verify a test-signature:
gpg: NOTE: THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT VERSION!
gpg: It is only intended for test purposes and should NOT be
gpg: used in a production environment or with production keys!
Datei 'x.txt' existiert bereits. Overwrite? (y/N) y
gpg: Signature made 02/19/05 19:25:15 (MEZ) Mitteleurop?ische Zeit using RSA key ID A5FF6560
gpg: Good signature from "test ?????? "
Note the time-string: It should read "Mitteleurop?ische Zeit" (the UserID displays the right umlauts as expected).
