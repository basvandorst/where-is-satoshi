@_subject: Decryption problems using php 
Currenlty I am having problem with the decryption of the file my code is like this
     echo shell_exec("echo $passphrase | $gpg --passphrase-fd 0 -o $unencrypted_file -d $encrypted_file");
when I checked using echo beforer executing it will shown as below
passphrase|gpg --output --passphrase-fd 0 --decrypt above command is executed correctly using putty but when I tried to use this command using php it is not working.
I have set permission to the directory . But it seems it not working
$gpg = '/usr/bin/gpg';
  $passphrase = 'passphrase';
  //$encrypted_file = 'foo.gpg';
   //$unencrypted_file = 'foo.txt';
    echo shell_exec("echo $passphrase | $gpg --passphrase-fd 0  $unencrypted_file -d $encrypted_file");
Please assist me to work it correctly. I am facing such problems last 2 weeks. We are using ubuntu 12.04 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.2.0-24-generic i686).
