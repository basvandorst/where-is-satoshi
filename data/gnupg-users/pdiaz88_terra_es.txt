MacOS X has nothing to do with Linux. It's kernel is neither the linux one or the *BSD ones. MacOSX has a *BSD compatibility layer arround the kernel that provides the POSIX api and all the things commonly found on a Unix system. Again, MacOSX is not linux or BSD with a pretty UI
Just wanna make it clear :-)

The kernel is mainly Match, which is not FreeBSD. MacOSX has a BSD layer, but the kernel itself is Match (microkernel). This has nothing to do with the fact that MOX can be considered a unix/unix clone/unix alike  system

Hash: SHA1
Hi all,
Sorry for this offtopic post, but I'm looking for a valuable mailing list about cryptography/cryptology. What I'm looking for is:
a) English languaje spoken
b) With relative traffic
c) With valuable content. Nothing like "Hey, check out this super-secure crypto algo I've just invented". Thats an example, but I guess you get the point. I've been looking for a while and found nothing that met the previous requirements. Please, confirm my lack of google-searcher skills and suggest me one :-)

If you are using linux, you will probably want loop-AES, which does what you want, faster and trasparently. You can use AES 128, 192 or 256, depending on the speed/security tradeoff you wish.

Thanks all,
I've just wondering if there was a way of knowing the recipients without
having to decrypt the (possibly very large) encrypted file
I've been using gpg -d file > /dev/null
but david's solution works faster of course (although it list keys twice,

Didn't know about list-only . Doesn't appear on gpg --help neither. (maybe in the doc, huh?)

Hash: SHA1
I think you missed the point. He wants to make his code work *both* with pgp
and gnupg because the user may actually use pgp instead of gnupg. I'll be
concerned about that 3 issues if I were writting the kmail pgp/gpg code too
Compatibility is an issue. I'm a gnupg user. My friends are gnupg users. All
works ok for me. But I'm a little worried about compatibilities between
pgg-gnupg (or even gnupg-gnupg dif versions). I like the idea of not using
any pattented algoritms in gnupg, but lets face it. Sometimes, some of us
have to use them (one of my teachers uses pgp 2.x). and patching gnupg
sources doesn't seem clear to me. Does gnupg support any kind of plugin
mechanism?. If not, I think it would be a good idea (installing a plugin is
easier than patching the sources for the average joe user)

No I don't!. I just wanna let the user do this trade if he/she wants/needs. I agree. Software patents are evil
Thats a little drastic, don't your think?. Take a look out there. There's a whole bunch of GPL'd programs that support propietary software. Abiword opens .doc files (more or less). xmms plays .mp3 files. Gimp edits .gif files.  The linux kernel supports a wide variety of propietary filesystems
and so on...
the reason that abiword can open .doc files is not because they think its the better format out there. They do it because they are flexible. More or less occurs with the other examples. They say: ''hey, we don't like it, but we can also do that.". Anyway, I understand your point of view. As the gnupg user base grows, it will become more and more the 'de facto' standard, implicity promoting the use of non-pattented algoritms. thats good

@_subject: Possible to encrypt disk? 
Hash: SHA1
If you use linux, I'd recommend using loop-AES, which adds encryption capabilities to the loop device (a.k.a: you can encrypt your home partition, for example)
I use it for my home partition on my laptop and works great. And is pretty fast: Using AES-256 (slowest) on my Pentium III laptop (850Mhz) I rarely note the diference. If you have a slower machine, probably AES 128 will be enough Hope this helps
P.S: I dont have loop-AES patch URL here, but sure google has it :-)
