@_subject: Bug: --encrpyt-files: too many open files 
there is a bug in 2.0.4:
find -type f | LANG=C gpg -r someid --homedir ~/... --encrypt-files
gpg: encryption of `/home/a/.../myfileN' failed: Too many open files
You can look at the stale open files under Linux (The encryption
process must be still running):
ls -l /proc/PID/fd
lr-x------ 1 a a 64 16. Jun 10:14 97 -> /home/a/.../myfile1
lr-x------ 1 a a 64 16. Jun 10:14 98 -> /home/a/.../myfile2
gpg (GnuPG) 2.0.4-svn0 (SuSE 10.3)
Can someone check if this happens in the latest release, too?
Please CC to me, I am not on the list.
