@_subject: encrypt linux backup folder using gpg 
I am using CentOS 7.5 Linux OS in my setup. I have compressed a folder
using tar utility tar czvf backupfolder.tar.gz backupfolder. Is there a way
to encrypt backupfolder.tar.gz using gpg? Are there any best practices to
use gpg application to encrypt the data. Any help will be highly
appreciated and i look forward to hearing from you.
 czvf backupfolder.tar.gz backupfolder
Thanks in Advance.

Hi Francesco,
Thanks for the reply. I did the below
[centos]# ls helloworld/
check_cpu_perf.sh  check_mem.pl  jdk-8u162-linux-x64.rpm
[centos]# gpg-zip --encrypt --output hellogpg --gpg-args  -r kaushal
gpg: missing argument for option "-r"
Am i missing something?
Thanks Wiktor, I'll check it out.

Hi Francesco,
Thanks Francesco for the email. I have encrypted the file using my gpg key. How
do i share the encrypted helloworld.gpg file to the recipients. For example
john at example.com.  Do I need to encrypt the file to the recipients id using
gpg pub key? Any examples to understand it better. Please comment.
This works for me.
 --encrypt --output helloworld.gpg -r kaushal helloworld
Thanks in Advance and i look forward to hearing from you.
Best Regards,
