@_subject: Using GPG for encrypting directories 
Hi all,
I'm rather new to GPG (and to Linux as well) and would appreciate your I want to use GPG for local encryption only, and after reading the man file, I'm doing the following in order to encrypt a whole directory:
I zip the directory with a password "zip -r -e foo foo", then I encrypt it with "gpg -c foo.zip" using a passphrase.
Is this an elegant and secure way of encrypting directories? Am I using GPG's full cryptographic power? Are there better alternatives?
