@_subject: using gpgsm 
I've downloaded GnuPG 1.9.20, just to do some testing with S/MIME, considering
it as replacement for openssl tools once stable version is out.
However, have some trouble with using it.
I was able to import CA certificate, and importing other certificates seems to
work too (almost).
I wasn't able to import my private key (with certificate) from PKCS file. I've generated the PKCS file using:
openssl pkcs12 -export -in file.crt -inkey file.key -out file.p12
This is what I get when running gpgsm:
$ gpgsm --import file.p12
Secure memory is not locked into core
gpgsm: NOTE: THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT VERSION!
gpgsm: It is only intended for test purposes and should NOT be
gpgsm: used in a production environment or with production keys!
gpgsm: gpgsm: GPG_TTY has not been set - using maybe bogus default
gpgsm: gpg-protect-tool: Secure memory is not locked into core
gpgsm: gpg-protect-tool: gpg-agent is not available in this session
gpgsm: gpg-protect-tool: error while asking for the passphrase: Invalid digest
gpgsm: error running `/srv/test/libexec/gpg-protect-tool': exit status 2
gpgsm: total number processed: 0
I've also attempted to use -keypbe and -certpbe options to openssl to specify
different algorithms to use (for example PBE-SHA1-3DES), but no luck.  Gpgsm
simply fails to process those file.
I was able to import the certificate separately from the PEM encoded file
(file.crt from openssl example above).  So I know that certificate is good. But not really usefull if I can't get gpgsm to import the private key too.
Attempting to generate new private key using --gen-key hasn't worked eiter (this
function is not yet available from the commandline).
Another question is about support for non US-ASCII characters in certificates
(something tells me you might be getting lot of these questions).  I've
received one certificate that has some accented letters in CN and OU.  After
importing it, and then doing "gpgsm --list-keys", the output shows the Subject
without CN and OU (only O, L, ST and C are displayed).  Is this certificate
unusable with gpgsm, or is this just displaying issue (gpgsm simply not
displaying attributes that have accented characters in them).

@_subject: Create key's over 4096 bit ???? 
My previous message somehow didn't made it to the list.  Anyhow, I can only confirm what you wrote.  If you want to play with 16k RSA key, one way to do it is to use "openssl genrsa -des3 -out long.key 16384".  You can then create self signed certificate to play with.  It takes somewhere around 13-14 minutes to generate 16k RSA key on 2.8GHz Pentium D.  On slower machine, it can take hours to generate 16k RSA key.  So have lots of patience when experimenting.  Very soon you'll realize why nobody uses such long keys.  The 4k limit is there for your own protection ;-)  If you really have tons of time to waste, openssl will allow you to create even longer keys (why not try 262144 bit long key, and let us know how long it took to generate).
 From the security standpoint, more bits do not buy you more security. Having 16k key or 2k key will buy you about the same security.  It is not all in the key lenght.  My opinion is, just use 2k key.  It will serve you well.  I generated one 4k key some time ago, and have almost never used it.  Looking back, that was really pointless thing to do.

Quoting Holger Schuettel :
Your friend probably used some hacked code that has limit removed.  Anyhow,
generating such a long key isn't going to buy you anything (other than people
making jokes about you).  The 2048 bit keys are more than sufficiently long. If you *really* want long key, use 4096 (you are not going to be any more
secure, but if it will make you feel better go for it).  I've one 4096 bit key
that I almost never used (the ones that I did use we all at most 2048 bits
long).  This includes both PGP and S/MIME keys.
It would take *very* long time to generate 16k key.  On my 2.8GHz Pentium D it
is very slow.  All operations on such a long key would also take a lot of CPU
cycles.  See for yourself:
$ openssl genrsa -out looong.key 16384

It was two things.  The gpg-agent was the first one.  The second one was the
pinentry program (I didn't have one).  After downloading and installing it, I
was able to import PKCS file.  Might be good idea if configure script was
checking if pinentry is installed and complaining if it wasn't, like for other
The thing is, it wasn't displaying them at all.  As if they were not there.
Example (removed non-relevant lines from output):
$ echo $LANG
$ openssl x509 -noout -text -in test.crt
        Subject: C=CA, ST=Quebec, L=Montreal,
$ gpgsm --import test.crt
$ gpgsm --list-keys
      Subject: /L=Montreal/ST=Quebec/C=CA
As you can see, the CN, O and OU attributes are missing in output.  Only the
"clean US-ASCII" C, ST and L are present.  Openssl displayed them all using hex
notation (they look weir, but they are there).  I know that gpgsm imported the
certificate correctly (if I export it into a file, and then run openssl x509
-text on it, it displays correct Subject).  If I import that same certificate
into Windows machine, it is also displayed correctly (this time no weir BTW, the certificate in this example is almost unselectable using gpgsm.  The CN
is in UTF-8, but when I looked closer into it, it doesn't really contain any
non-US-ASCII characters.  It just reads "Test_Imprimeur" (just remove all those
"\x00").  However if I do 'gpgsm --list-keys CN=Test_Imprimeur', nothing is

OK, I see...  makes sense.  However, maybe a warning message should be given. Something like that paragraph from README file that references pinentry (after
all, most folks will simply fire up "./configure" without reading README file).
Hmmm...  I've installed dumpasn1.  Got:
271   37:       SET {
273   35:         SEQUENCE {
275    3:           OBJECT IDENTIFIER organizationName (2 5 4 10)
280   28:           BMPString ''
         :           }
         :         }
I've attempted playing with the tool, but couldn't get any more usefull output
from it, other than this hex dump output (using -ahht options).

I don't know much about internal format of certificates.  Does above means that
O was simply defined as some kind of binary data and value placed inside in raw
format, without any encoding information?

After some Googling around and reading (mostly
 and other docs
overthere)...  The above string was BMPString, which means it was really UCS-2
(10646/Unicode), as you indicated.

@_subject: Compiling for sparcv8 and above 
There's a small typo in mpi/config.links that prevents usage of optimized assembler code for v8 and later sparc processors (assembler code for v7 gets selected).  The config.links expects strings "sparc8" or "sparc9", while main configure accepts sparcv8 and sparcv9 (it bails out with error if passed --build=sparc8-sun-solaris2.9 (or sparc9)).  There's some other "dead" CPU strings in config.links that are rejected by main configure (such as ultrasparc).
The attached patch fixes this.  However, it also exposes another bug.  When links are setup to use sparc32v8 assembler routines, compilation fails with following error:
