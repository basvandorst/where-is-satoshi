@_subject: Empty keyring after upgrade to Ubuntu 18.04 :/ 
Hi folks,
I upgraded from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS to Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and restored my `.gnupg` directory from a backup disk.
Now gpg doesn't see any keys... `gpg --list-keys` just exists with no output.
I've attached the strace output of `strace gpg --list-keys`, and here's the output of `tree .gnupg/`:
??? crls.d
??? ??? DIR.txt
??? gpg-agent.conf
??? gpg-agent-info-xps
??? gpg.conf
??? hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net.pem
??? openpgp-revocs.d
??? ??? [REDACTED x2].rev
??? private-keys-v1.d
??? ??? [REDACTED x8].key
??? pubring.gpg
??? pubring.kbx
??? random_seed
??? S.dirmngr
??? secring.gpg
??? S.gpg-agent
??? sshcontrol
??? trustdb.gpg
3 directories, 23 files
Is there anything else I can provide to help debug this?
[unsigned... obviously ;) ]
