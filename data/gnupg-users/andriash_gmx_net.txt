Werner, I trust the above "binaty" was a simple spelling mistake? The
URL's above are identical, but were they supposed to be? When I unzip the
archive, gpg.exe is identical in size and date to the original 1.0.6
release. How can we tell whether we have the one that contains the bug

I think you would be well advised to use a Front-End Program like WinPT or
GnuPGShell to generate your Key Pair. BTW, what exactly do you mean by the
term "segfaults"?

In your Firewall, you have to set a rule to allow "gpg.exe" outgoing TCP
access to the Keyserver through port 11370.

Funny you should mention that Brian, because that is exactly what happened
to me today. I could find no way to delete that secret key, and I was
puzzled why the delete function didn't delete it in the first place when I
was deleting the Key Pair.
I ended up having to delete my Secring.gpg :o(

Hash: SHA1
I have a friend who is using 1.0.6 with Win 2K, and each time GPG attempts
to access a KeyServer to find a Key, GPG returns these error messages:
gpg: Signature made 06/02/01 08:43:41  using DSA key ID 8232434C
gpg: requesting key 8232434C from keys.pgp.com ...
gpg: write failed: ec=87
gpg: can't get key from keyserver: No such file or directory
gpg: Can't check signature: public key not found
Does anyone know the significance of "ec=87"? From the above, does it
appear the Key has been found, but GPG cannot write to the Key File, or is
GPG having a problem with the Key Server itself?
Thanks for your help. There are quite a few people using Win 2K that are
having problems with GPG, despite using Front-End Programs or Plugins
designed by MUA Developers. Would that have something to do with the fact
Win 2K has no underlying DOS?

Rob, I noticed that your message does not have an "In-Reply-To" header,
and as such breaks up the threading mechanism on my MUA. Is there any
specific reason you don't have that header?

I notice that you also don't have an "In-Reply-To" header. I wonder who
may be stripping them off, because without them, your Reply is not
included in the Thread.

Export your PGP Key Pair from PGP, then enter the following:
gpg --allow-secret-key-import --import file.asc

It's disturbing to get spammed on a security related List such as GnuPG.

@_subject: How To Indicate Primary UID? 
Hash: SHA1
When I import Public Keys from PGP to GPG, GPG never seems to show the
correct Primary UID, choosing instead to show the 1st on the list. Is
there some command to tell GPG to use UID  as the Primary for example?
The Keys that are exported from PGP correctly indicate the Primary UID the
Key Owner wishes to use. Why doesn't GPG honour that choice? BTW, I am
using GnuPGShell 1.60 to access my Key Rings if that makes any difference.

Hash: SHA1
The only thing I can think of is to attach a revoked signature as an
indication you no longer want that Key used. Others may come with a better
solution, but without the Private Key/Passphrase, there isn't much you can
to. :o(
As for your other problem, you may as well upload revocation certificates
if you do not want those Keys used.

@_subject: Strange Message? 
Hash: SHA1
A friend of mine is trying to use "The Bat's" GnuPG Plugin to encrypt a
message, and is greeted with the following message:
"usage: gpg [options] [filename]"
It almost appears as if the Plugin is not conveying the right command to
GnuPG, and GnuPG is responding with something like "This is how you should
word that command". He is using Win 2K SP1. No such problem exists using
Win 98SE. Could a problem such as that be specific to Win 2K?
