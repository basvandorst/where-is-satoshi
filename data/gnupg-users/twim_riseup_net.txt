@_subject: GnuPG modern can't genereate keys on my Windows 
I'm also not able to generate keys in 2.1.7 on my Gentoo machine. It
generates Ed25519 without errors (a typo: GnuPG says that it would use
Curve25519 for signature not Ed25519). Because there is no option to
create Curve25519 at the beginning with Ed25519 one I'm trying to
`addkey` later. Error seems to have same origins as Windows one:

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

Werner Koch:
Sounds almost reasonable. But why then GnuPG shows Ed25519 keys as eg.
'ed25519/52275F7A'? When someone trying to generate 'Curve25519-signing
key' they'll get ed25519 key. "Maybe I've done something wrong? I should
regenerate my signature key...". In my opinion it's a little bit confusing.
The fact that both Ed25519 and Curve25519 are based on the same curve
one can easily note from '25519' in their names.
Actually Ed25519 is a birational equivalent to Curve25519; it's not a
Curve25519. So I think that GnuPG should use exact naming for what it uses.
