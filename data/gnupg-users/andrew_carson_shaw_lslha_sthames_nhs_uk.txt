I have a problem in using php and gnupg.  Basically i am encrypting  mail from a web server . I created a directory for the apache user and generated a key for it,  and i can send encrypted mails no problems using the key i generated for the apache user . However i need to use more than one public key but as soon as i add another key and try to encrypt with it, it does not work . Does anybody have any ideas ?
Thank you
