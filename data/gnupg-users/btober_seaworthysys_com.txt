@_subject: Multiple signatures on a single file 
Is it possible to have multiple persons sign a single file? If so, how is this done?
The particular scenario is currently this: Employees submit expense reports for business travel using a spread sheet. Current practise is the the employee fills out spread sheet via computer (or optionally prints blank spread sheet template and writes by hand with a pen), physically signs using pen and ink, physically delivers signed hardcopy to supervisor for supervisor pen-and-ink signature prior to payment Desired practise is to eliminate both producing hard copy and pen-and-ink signatures, and then re-work the process using gpg electronic signatures. Thus, employee would enter data into expense report spread sheet, save, gpg sign, mail to supervisor, supervisor would (presumably) open and review spread sheet, close without changing, gpg sign, and then return to employee or forward to accounting dept.
Sounds straightforward, but I didn't spot in the various manuals/guides/how-to's for gnupg how a second individual could add their signature after me.

@_subject: Signing MS-Excel spread sheets 
I hate to admit that I still use MS-Excel rather than an open source spread sheet tool, but workplace requirements constrain my fate...
Anyway, the problem with MS-Excel that I'm finding is that if I sign (detached signature) an MS-Excel XLS file, then me or someone else opens the file and then closes it even without making any changes, the signature no longer verifies successfully.  A binary comparison of the "after" file with a "before" copy confirms that the four or five bytes are changed by the simple fact of opening and closing the file. I figure it must be some kind of time stamp Excel records.
Has anyone else managed a work-around for this flaw? (Aside from the obvious -- "Stop using MS-Excel!" -- because that is a failure I cannot

What I don't like about doing that explicitly is that every additional signature, at least in the default operational mode, appends an additional ".sig" file extension. Further more, the signatures are wrapped withing one another, so that to verification would require serial verification of each preceding outer layer signature. What I've been refining during the last couple days uses a command line script to append additional detached signatures into a single signature file. This approach models more directly the co-signature concept of legacy contracts, i.e., think of buying a house -- you and you spouse are co-signators rather than having one sign the contract and the other sign the others signature. What you suggested models the concept of a notary public witnessing a signature, but that we already have by signing public keys in the trust model.

The sounds like it would work, but I don't like the idea of imposing the extra layer of the separate zip application like this between the document and the signing step -- although it could be the approach we have to take if we bring this to the next level and scan the supporting documents (i.e., receipts) to jpeg files for inclusion along with the spread sheet -- which would be pretty cool. However, I still have the issue being discussed in a separate-but-related thread concerning The comand script I'm refining seems to do all that I need, even if it has some rough edges:
gpg --sign.cmd:
 off
if .%1. == .. exit
attrib +r %1
gpg  --detach-sign --armor --comment "Signature of %USERNAME%" --local-user %USERNAME% -o - %1>>%1.asc
along with
gpg --verify.cmd:
 off
gpg --verify %1
to list the co-signators. Lastly, I make short cuts in the Windows "Send To" folder, putting these two features in the Explorer context menu. Seems to work o.k.

@_subject: How to run a key server 
This may be a very silly question, but I want to know what is involved with running a key server?
A manager has asked about whether we can somehow use "electronic signatures" on internal documents to reduce paper and printer costs as well as the problem of occasionally losing a printed piece of documentation that needs to get approved or signed by more than one person. Seems to me like gnupg is made for this kind of situation. Since this will be an internal infrastructure, I"m not concerned with providing a PKI to the *public*, but just to company employees. I'm thinking that there must be a server software package that handle this available somewhere, but my googling turns up mostly info on using gpg individually, more or less. There is a sourceforge project that seems to be the right tool, but it was listed as inactive.
