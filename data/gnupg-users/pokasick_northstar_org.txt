@_subject: What creates the Windows Registry key that points to the keyring 
I'm setting up to use gnupg, and I want to change the location of the
keyrings.  The machine that I've been using to get familiar with gnupg had
the registry entry.  I don't know how the entry was created on my machine.
I just recently learned of its existence.  I've created and exported our key
on the production machine, but there was no registry entry created.
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\GNU\GnuPG... was located on my machine.
Unfortunately, I deleted it in the attempt to figure out what action creates
Is there some action using gpg that I can take to create the entry, or do I
need to create this myself.  Thanks for any help you can provide.
