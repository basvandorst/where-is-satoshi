@_subject: passphrase recovery 
Hello, I am contacting you because I need help recovering my passphrase. is
there any way to accomplish this? Basically my laptop screen broke now and
I need to decrypt my word file that has my product keys but I cannot
remember for the life of me what it is and have spent countless tries on
the two phrases i think it is, and I am unable to change my passphrase due
to the fact I no longer know it. here are my details.
