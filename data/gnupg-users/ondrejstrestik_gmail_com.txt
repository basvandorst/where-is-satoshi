@_subject: How restore backuped /.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d 
i have reall big problem because i accydently deleted /.gnupg, but still i have backuped /.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d so i have 4 ?hashfile" name files with suffix .key
 I was really scared, because i thought i lost my private keys but  i read here The file secring.gpg is not anymore used to store the secret keys. Merging of secret keys is now supported
So i dont have any file from /.gnupg like secring.gpg, etc. (i saw private-keys-v1.d and i thoug backup this folder is enought - yes i am moron)
- i deleted folder because i had problems with gpg configuration
- i thought i will copy private-keys-v1.d back to the ./gnupg and everything will be ok (like ssh)
Now i am i situation where i can not import ?raw? keys and everytime when i try to import private key i will get message like: No valid OpenGPG data found in file.
Please can you help me how can i restore my pivate keys please? I google it around 12 hours and still nothing.
Thank you very much for yours help,
Ondrej Strestik

I thought it is permission problem, but as i wrote i am able import other
pub keys.
Dokumenty/key.asc have 766
.gnupg have 700 and files inside the folder have 600 and owner of all files
is my account and i am running gpg import from my regular account (not like
a root).

Ok i understand, but is there some switch or parameter how can i force
import? Because on macos with gpgtools i am able to import this key.
