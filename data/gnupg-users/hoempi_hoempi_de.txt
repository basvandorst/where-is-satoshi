Hi folks,
some days ago I migrated my laptop to OpenSuSe 10.3 and installed Thunderbird. I was pleased to find that GnuPG and Enigmail were already part of the installation.
So today I created signatures for both my private and work mail addresses. Then I exported the keys (public and secret) and transferred them to my windows-powered desktop computer, installed GPG4Win and Enigmail there. Using Enigmail once more I imported both key pairs and everything seemed fine. I send signed, unencrypted test messages from one mail address to another and my Windows machine stated good signatures both ways.
But when I checked on my laptop, where I created the key pairs I get an "Error - signature verification failed".
Did anyone ever encounter something like this or has any idea how to fix it?
Kind Regards,
Thomas Hempen
