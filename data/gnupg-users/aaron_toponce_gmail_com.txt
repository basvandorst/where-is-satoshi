@_subject: Mutt not showing signature flag 
This really is a post for the mutt-users mailing list, but I'm not
getting the response there that I think is accurate, so I'm posting
here, hoping mapbe another user on this list has experinced the same
issue and what they did to fix it.
As the subject says, the signature flag is not showing in the index.
Well, that's not entirely true. It will show after I view the signed
message in the pager then go back to the index tree. This is entirely
inconsistent with the rest of the mailboxes I subscribe to. With every
other mailbox, the 's', 'S' or 'P' flags show, as expected when a
message is signed. Not for the gnupg-users list.
Anyone else who's a mutt user experience this inconsistency? I'm
familiar with both inline and PGP/MIME signatures. I've been signing my
personal mail since 2004 when I created my key.
Why do I not see the signature flags for this mailbox until after
viewing the message in mutt?

I want to believe that, but it's not the case, at least not for me. On
say the debian-devel mailing list, I can see the signature flag on the
message before I fetch it (I only cache the headers).
... now that I think about it, is the gnupg-users mailing list modifying
mail headers and stripping/modifying PGP info? As you mentioned,
changing from multipart/signed to multipart/mixed, which would prevent
the signature flags from showing until after you view the message in the

First, there is _ZERO_ documentation for this binary. No manual, no info
page, nothing under /usr/share/doc/, segfaults pasing "-h" or "--help".
Short of digging through the source, this is unacceptable.
Second, and probably as a result, I can't get this working for the life
of me. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I should be able to add this
identity to the running SSH agent through "ssh-add", no? Here's the
steps I've taken thus far, and still failing (SSH agent is already running):
$ echo $SSH_AUTH_SOCK
$ gpgkey2ssh 8086060F > /tmp/gpg-ssh-key.txt
$ gpg --armor --export-secret-keys 8086060F > /tmp/gpg-private-ssh.txt
$ ssh-add /tmp/gpg-private-ssh.txt
Enter passphrase for /tmp/gpg-private-ssh.txt
At this point, I would expect the passphrase to be the private
passphrase that is protecting my private GPG key, no? Yet, it doesn't
take. At least, this is the way you would do it for OpenSSH keys. You
would add the private key to your running SSH agent.
However, let's go a different direction. Rather than dealing with my GPG
private key, let's just add the /tmp/gpg-ssh-key.txt (the public key) to
the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the remote server, and see what happens:
$ ssh-copy-id -i /tmp/gpg-ssh-key.txt user at server.tld
Of course it's not found, "ssh-add -l" doesn't show it listed, because
it hasn't been added to the agent. So, I get to copy it manually. So, I
do that.
Now, instead of using the SSH agent, what if I used the GPG agent
instead? So, I add "enable-ssh-support" to my ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf,
and launch the agent:
$ gpg-agent --daemon
$ ssh user at server.tld
Nope, didn't add the key to the running agent. Now, I don't see a
"gpg-add", so I'm not entirely sure how to add my GPG identity to the
GPG agent, and I'm not entirely sure how the OpenSSH client will know
that it needs to find the identity in the GPG agent rather than the SSH

enough entropy to secure your account against brute force attacks,

@_subject: Signing a key (meaning) 
Yes you can, and that's the whole point. You need to verify that the key
they claim is theirs, is actually indeed their key.
When verifying that the key belongs to the owner, you should be
establishing identity. This means if you don't know the person, you should
verify the name, fingerprint in the key, and verify some sort of
identification from the owner. So, if Peter Hansen stole Anna's key, it
should be obvious that the name in the key doesn't match the name on the
presented identification.
Further, if Anna setup her key, then her name and email are in the public
key. Signing the key doesn't automatically change her name to "Peter
Hansen", just because Peter has the key, so I'm not exactly sure what
you're saying here.
No, she won't, which is where I'm confused. Marie will see Anna's name in
the key, not Peter's. Further, the encrypted message will go to Anna's
email account, not Peter's. And, even if Peter did some how intercept the
encrypted message, if he doesn't have Anna's private key, what good is it?
What? How? By sniffing the packets sent between MTAs? If Peter has access
to Anna's mail, then fine. But if he doesn't, his only way to the mail in
transit is to sniff packets or break into Marie's account.
The point of key signing is to build a decentralized web of trust. For
every signature you apply to a public key, you are indeed saying that you
have done careful checking to ensure that the key does in fact belong to
the owner it claims. The more the signatures on the key, the stronger this
statement becomes.
Sure, you can't be 110% sure that the owner didn't steal a laptop, create
fake credentials, and steal the identity of the key owner, collecting
signatures. However, the key owner should have been smart enough, that when
he/she generated the key, that they also generated, and printed, the
revocation certificate, so should his laptop get stolen, he can revoke the
key, publish it to the servers, and start over. And you're a good citizen,
because you refresh your public keyring from the keyservers regularly, and
would have caught the revocation before signing the key.
100% sure? Probably not. 98% sure? Most likely.

For spam to be truly effective, there needs to be a reward. Littering the

provide the desired result. Spamming email has shown to be an effective way
to make money. Where is the monetary reward here?
I guess Anonymous or LULZ Security, or the like, could do it out of sheer
entertainment, but it would die quickly, as the effort in maintaining the

I'll pose the scenario differently: How can you trust that the photo
identification presented at a human-to-human keysigning party is
legitimate? It's not too terribly difficult to forge even government photo
identification, and pass it off as legitimate to the average user. I could
create a key, call myself "Bruce Schneier", forge a photo identification
card that "proves" this is the case, and claim there are two of us in the
world- the famous cryptographer, and a lonely sysadmin from North Dakota.
After collecting enough signatures, I've created enough noise to cast doubt
on which key belongs to the famous security expert, and which doesn't. At
least to the casual eye, which we must admit, most of us don't scrutinize
our keys at all (when was the last time you did a key refresh, and paid
attention to expirations or revocations?).
More threatening, than just littering the keyservers with tens of thousands
of keys and signatures, are individual attacks, like the one I just
mentioned above. Again, there needs to be some good benefit to the cost of
doing something like this, other than just "for the lulz", or it will die
off quickly. And to be honest, the only reasonable benefit I can conceive
of, is hoping to create enough confusion, as to intercept valuable data in
some sort of transaction from the person or organization you're attacking.

@_subject: maximum passphrase for symmetric encryption ? 
There may be some errors in my reply, so if so, please notify me.
Yes, but each word in the diceware list contains about 12.9 bits of
entropy, due to the random nature of rolling a fair D6. So, for a
passphrase that is 20 diceware words, it contains roughly 258-bits of
entropy, as he identified.
It's easy to calculate entropy in a truly random environment:
    H = L*log2(N)
where 'H' is the entropy value in binary bits, 'L' is the length of the
message, 'log2()' is the log base-2 function, and 'N' is the possible
number of characters the system can have. The only time when this equation
becomes more complicated, is when predictable patterns, such as can be
found in human language, are found.
And this is the point, right here. A passphrase that has more binary bits
of entropy, than the containing system, won't provide you with any
additional benefit, or security. So, in the case with a 20 word, diceware
passphrase, provided that the RNG building the AES 256-bit environment is
truly random data, any additional entropy in the passphrase, won't buy you
any additional security in the encrypted data.

Yeah. I'm not one that tends to break from default much, so if GnuPG has
a good sane default set of cipher, signing and compression preferences,
then who am I to argue? However, I did generate an RSA subkey, so I
could get those SHA2 signing algos, and I want to use them.
So, with that said, here's what I came up with for my own personal
Cipher: TWOFISH, CAMELLIA256, AES256, CAMELLIA192, AES192, CAMELLIA128,
AES, BLOWFISH, CAST5, 3DES
Digest: SHA512, SHA384, SHA256, SHA224, RIPEMD160, SHA1, MD5
Compression: BZIP2, ZLIB, ZIP, Uncompressed
I chose Twofish as my first 256-bit cipher, as I support Bruce Schneier
and it's shown to be a very robust and capable cipher, both in terms of
speed and memory usage. I then put Camellia over AES due to the low
power consumption. I don't trust 3DES, and I don't know much about CAST5
other than what Wikipedia has.
Also, my understanding on how the preferences are chosen by GnuPG is the
1. User wishes to encrypt mail to me, so my cipher preferences in my
public key are pulled.
2. My first preference, Twofish, is used, only if the sender supports
the Twofish algorithm.
3. If not, the next cipher in my preference list, Camellia256, is then
chosen, so long as the sender also supports Camellia256.
4. Proceed inductively, until a matching cipher that can be agreed on
between the two parties is chosen.
5. Message is encrypted using the agreed algorithm.
6. The same is used for signatures and compression.
Is this accurate? Thoughts on the order of my prefs?

the cryptographic signature is viewable, sometimes not.
So, that brings up the question- what mail app are you using on your

I know that he's recommended AES-128 over AES-256, but I've not read
where he's recommended AES over TWOFISH.
Again, [citation needed]. 3DES has an effective security of only 80 bits
due to the meet-in-the-middle attack and known- or chosen-plaintext
attacks, and NIST is only willing to back the algo through 2030. The
cryptanalysis seems pretty strong, and it is a slow algo. To each their
own, but I'll pass.
Okay, "support" might have been the wrong word. twofish performance is
fast, and his new Skein algorithm, based off threefish, is crazy fast.
That said, AES is comparable. twofish is implemented in a crazy amount
of crypto software as well. Cryptanalysis is minimal, and the open
license of the algorithm is commendable.
Ah. Okay. That works.
Well, I wanted the defaults, but then I couldn't use the SHA2 signing
algorithms, now could I? :)

I'm using Google. I'm not seeing it. I'll keep digging. Best I can find
is in 2008, he recommends Twofish over Blowfish: Heh. I don't believe in aliens. So, good luck with that.
I'm not saying 3DES isn't practical, I just said I'm not interested in
using it, and I stated why. I'm also not interested in using SHA1 for my
signing hash, but for all _practical_ purposes, it fits the bill just fine.
Did you know OpenSSH uses SHA1 by default for their hash, and for the
MAC it's MD5 or SHA1! Then again, what's the _practicality_ of your
OpenSSH connection being broken by the baddies?
The fact of the matter is, GnuPG supports these stronger algorithms, so
why not use them? If you have the hardware that can do the math in
trivial time, I don't see why you shouldn't use 256-bit or 512-bit
crypto. I understand just looking at just key length for security is
retarded, but GnuPG ships solid, well researched, highly available,
strong crypto.
Great! If it has that sort of security, then maybe I'll give it a second
thought. I was always under the impression that due to DES being cracked
by the EFF in what, 9 months?, that 3DES, just using 3 of the same
56-bit key, wasn't long before we had the hardware to break it in 9
months also. I'll give reconsideration.

No. First, all that metadata is in your public key, not your private

secure, and by secure, I mean containing a decent amount of entropy
(like 120-bits), then you can at least sleep at night. No hacker in the
immediate future will be able to use your key until the passphrase is
With that said, if I knew that my private key had fallen into _anyone's_
hands other than my own, I would publish the revocation certificate
immediately, push it to every public keyserver, and make an announcement
of such to all my contacts. I would then go through the actions of
generating a new key, getting new signatures, etc.

Yes. Understood. I should have mentioned that. However, as you mentioned
in a previous subthread, it isn't difficult to parse the dates of the
signatures, identify where they've been held, and grab other metadata.
If a key has falsified signatures, it should be easy enough to find out.
At least the recursion of grabbing keys from keyservers will be rather
short for false sigs.
At any event, I digress.

Because all the signatures on the key will be falsified, that can be
verified by recursively extracing the signature keys from the

Of course. I was looking more for a resource that might be able to explain
it to me better.
The reason for asking (which actually isn't realted to GnuPG) was I wanted
to know the amount of data transferred over the wire with SCP. Knowing that
SCP and GPG use similar algs, I thought I would ask here (there are other
applications where GnuPG fits). From my limited testing, trying each of the
various ciphers, I found that at most, 1.2x the amount of data was
transferred, which surprised me, really.
So, I figured this might get a good discussion going, and I can certainly
learn more about encryption in the meantime.

Not true. If the drive is an untrusted drive, then you must assume others
have access to the data. Because all that is needed is your public key to
encrypt data to you, the encrypted file could be replaced by another
encrypted file, and you would be none the wiser until you decrypted it.
Signing the file requires access to your private key, something you should
only have access to.
However, even if the file is signed, that still doesn't prevent someone
from replacing the file. After all, it is an untrusted drive. But,
the signature could be a preventative measure you could take before
decryption, to ensure that the file is indeed the one you encrypted

Are you familiar with the DH key exchange? It doesn't seem that you are.
There is no risk in sharing the private key between the two parties. It
basically goes like this:
Step 1: A generates the private key.
Step 2: A encrypts the private key with a one-time session key.
Step 3: A sends the encrypted private key to B.
Step 4: B encrypts the encrypted private key with his 1-time key.
Step 5: B sends the doubly-encrypted private key to A.
Step 6: A decrypts what he can with his one-time session key.
Step 7: A sends the resulting encrypted key to B.
Step 8: B decrypts the private key with his 1-time key.
B now has the private key.
The one-time session keys are never shared, but stored locally on the
machine. Once the DH key exchange finished, the session keys are destroyed.
No where in the exchange is there any risk of the private key being
compromised. A MITM can grab all the packets he likes. Unless he has one or
both session keys, he's not getting the private key.

You should now be in the "Passphrase settings" part of the "Basic" tab
of the "OpenPGP Preferences". Your cursor is focused on a number for
remembering your passphrase for a certain length of time. The default is
5 minutes of idle time. You can change this to anything you want, up to
9999 minutes.
1 more TAB key press will allow you to select a checkbox for "Never ask

to the "OK" button, to apply the settings.

On a side note, you may wish to re-evaluate your email signature.
Confidentiality notices are usually annoying to most recipients,

If sensitive information must be sent over email, it should be
encrypted, with a note in the encrypted mail notifying the user of the

Without signing the message, and only encrypting it to your public key, you
have no way to verify who really sent you the message.
Now switch sides. Suppose you're sending an encrypted mail to a collegue.
You're encrypting it for his eyes only. If you don't sign the message, he

he can verify the signature, see if he trusts that key, and make a more

@_subject: Is there a way to browse the GPG web of trust? 
Yes, and no. The Web of Trust is just a web centered around a specific
keyring. If you have a specific keyring, you can view that key's Web of
Trust. All you're looking at are signatures. It becomes a bit troublesome
after a while, because you look not only at that key's signatures, but the
signatures of those who signed the key as well.
If you want a graphical view of a Web of Trust, here is a quick shell
script you can run that ends up with a GIF you can view an any image
editor. You'll need GnuPG, of course, as well as signing-party (which
provides sig2dot), graphviz (which provides neato) and imagemagik (which
provides convert):
    gpg --list-sigs --keyring ~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg | sig2dot > ~/.gnupg/pubring.dot 2> ~/.gnupg/pubring.error.txt
    neato -Tps ~/.gnupg/pubring.dot > ~/.gnupg/pubring.neato.ps
    convert ~/.gnupg/pubring.neato.ps ~/.gnupg/pubring.gif
The more signatures and keys in that keyring, the more complex the Web of
Trust could be, and the longer it may take to generate that GIF. On my
Intel dualcore laptop, I rendered a keyring for a friend, and it took over
30 minutes. So, be patient. Here's mine (using the script above):
    Further, there is also the "Strong Set", which is said to be the largest
Web of Trust on the Internet. You can view that web here:
    As an interesting sidenote, the top 25 keys, and all but 15 of the top 50
keys in that web belong to contributors of the Debian project (or so I've
been told).

No problem. It's pretty crazy stuff.
Possible? Yes. Probable? Maybe. I once setup my own public keyserver, just
because, and found it to chew through 20GB or so, iirc. It's been about 5
years since setting it up, so I'm guessing it's grown since then.
If you want all the keys from a keyserver, you'll probably have the best
luck building your own keyserver, taking all the public keys, building a
keyring, and examining the Web of Trust on that. With that said, I would be
willing to bet that something of that magnitude would be rather CPU and RAM
intensive. You would probably want to take advantage of some pretty serious
hardware to make it practical.
If someone has better advice, you'll likely get it here. :)

For the uninitiated,  explains the

additional research on whether or not this was something Mutt was planning
on adding led me to I've added it with "my_hdr OpenPGP id=${pgp_sign_as}\;url=...". The only
question remaining, for me, is whether or not it should be "X-OpenPGP" or
"OpenPGP" as the header field name. I've heard various positions on this,
but nothing definitive.
At any rate, I would love to see more client-to-client encryption in email.
I've always wondered if there could be an "OTR" approach to mail, somehow,
so people don't need to generate and manage their own sets of keys, as that
seems to be the largest hinderence to widespread adoption. The only thing
the user should do, is compose the mail, hit send, and everything is
handled with very minimal user interaction.

The idea is only to casually trust that a key belongs to a person. If the

signed by that cert, it seems to follow that the key is indeed owned by the
person who claims to own it.
Yes. That's all I'm after. I think the militant "I _absolutely_ won't sign
any keys unless I verify their identification, face-to-face" attitude is
hindering adoption. There must be a way to build the WOT, while still
allowing people to sign keys without meeting. Thus, the reasons for 0x10,
0x11, 0x12 and 0x13 in GnuPG for identifying how carefully you've verified
the owner of a key.

taking advantage of various means to establish trust of key ownership. This

I don't understand this. Mutt verifies the signature correctly, but Mutt is
calling GnuPG externally. If the message was signed with a space, and if
the space is being replaced by a tab character, then the signature should
fail. Because it is not failing, is telling me that it was initially a tab
when you signed the mail, and something either mangled it to be a space, or
your diff(1) is reading a text that mangled the tab to a space. I don't see
how this is the failure of the MUA, but GnuPG says the signature verifies.

We use GPG at work for internal passwords. There are 3 XML files based on

takes a few seconds to complete. Not too terribly inconvenient, and it's
fully automated, but enough to be annoying when the XML files get updated a
There are other purposes I use GPG for, where the work that needs to be

being considered, or has already been discussed.

These files are about 200KB in size. We have a Perl script that handles the

It is also client/server encrypted and decrypted. Thus, an administrator with

I don't know if this is a bug, or if I am doing something wrong, so I might as
well ask here. I ran the following command from my terminal, and cannot
retrieve the fingerprint from the file:
    $ gpg --output 0xBB065B251FF4945B.gpg --export 0xBB065B251FF4945B
    $ gpg --with-colons --with-fingerprint 0xBB065B251FF4945B.gpg     pub:-:2048:1:BB065B251FF4945B:2008-07-27:::f:
    uid:::::::::Daniel T. Hagan :

    sub:-:2048:1:16C018D9B89B420A:2008-07-27::::
There should exist an "^fpr" line in the output. Compare to:
    $ gpg --output 0x4713D527ECE16009.gpg --export 0x4713D527ECE16009
    $ gpg --with-colons --with-fingerprint 0x4713D527ECE16009.gpg     pub:-:1024:17:4713D527ECE16009:2005-06-06:::f:George Hacker (GLS) :

Of the 453 keys in my public keyring, this happens on 8 of them (about 2%):
    0x072DC7442B89BD45
    0x14774C7B9958256C
    0x4B2A4897D39DA0E3
    0x63E42BD8C58C753A
    0x677A7DE8CC9A6F67
    0x6FA1B04BB6724E04
    0x9710B89BCA57AD7C
    0xBB065B251FF4945B
Any ideas what is going on?

Yeah, I'm not interesting in running it from the keyring, as I am assuming that
the key is not imported, but only the file is available.

Ah. Interesting. Should I file a proper bug against GnuPG then?

If there is still need for this, I don't mind stepping in. Most of my personal
tweets belong in the crypto topic. So long as guidelines and expectations are
established on what should be tweeted and when, I could probably fill this

I think there will be great interest on the list for it. I am also very
interested. Maybe it's time for me to refresh my RSA export-a-crypto-system

@_subject: Why would I want S/MIME? 
Are you comparing S/MIME to PGP/MIME and PGP/Inline? I assume so, with your
question regarding GnuPG. As such, S/MIME provides some advantages over
PGP/MIME, IMO:
    * S/MIME ships the entire public key as part of the email.
    * S/MIME certificates are usually created and managed by the organization.
    * There as wide-spread MUA support for S/MIME (EG: Outlook).
PGP/MIME and PGP/Inline generally mean getting the public key separately.
Because PGP and OpenPGP are decentralized, trust is manual (versus CAs with SSL
certificates in S/MIME). There is not widespread support for OpenPGP public
keys in MUAs, such as Outlook and most web-based MUAs. OpenPGP keys must be
managed independently, and this has shown to be more work than most people are
willing to put in.
