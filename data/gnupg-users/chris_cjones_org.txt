@_subject: exporting my private key 
I've searched the online docs, but I can't find an answer to this
I have a GPG key at home, and a different one at work.  As I
frequently read personal email from work, it would be nice if I could
respond to personal email at work with a GPG signature that
corresponds to that address.
The problem is that I can't figure out how to copy my private key from
one computer to another, without clobbering the private key that's
already on the destination machine.  Any help?
