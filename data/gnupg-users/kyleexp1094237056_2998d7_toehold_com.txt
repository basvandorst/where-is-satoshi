Yes, but only if you plan ahead.  To designate a revoker requires the
secret key.  When you create the key (or after), you designate some Other,
who you trust to revoke your key at the right time.  If your secret key is
lost, you can contact this Other and request revocation.  That way, it's a
nice alternative to a fixed expiration date.
It can also be useful if you want one of your keys to be able to revoke
another.  For instance, if you have a separate key for work or a laptop,
you can make your more secure key the designated revoker for when the job
or laptop is lost.
