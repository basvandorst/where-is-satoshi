@_subject: CR-LF on OpenVMS ? 
The financial aid industry in the US uses OpenPGP to secure file
transmissions and we've built our systems around GPG.  Everything has
worked great so far, but we just encountered a problem with one of our
schools who is using GPG on VMS.  If they encrypt a text file that contains
CR-LF's the decryption fails.  Has any else encountered this ?

@_subject: Is ZIP compress-algo 1 or 2 ? 
I've been told that  I want to use ZIP compression to be
interoperable with PGP 7.x,  but I'm not sure if my options file should
contain compress-algo 1 or compress-algo 2.
The gpg.man file that came with GnuPG 1.2.1-1 for Windows  says this :
       --compress-algo n
                 Use compression algorithm n. Default is 2  which
                 is RFC1950 compression. You may use 1 to use the
                 old zlib version (RFC1951) which is used by PGP.
                 0  disables  compression.  The default algorithm
                 may give better results because the window  size
                 is  not  limited  to 8K. If this is not used the
                 OpenPGP behavior is used, i.e.  the  compression
                 algorithm  is  selected  from  the  preferences;
                 note, that this can't be  done  if  you  do  not
                 encrypt the data.
   I think the RFC references are transposed and it conflicts
with the output from the exe itself...
 is ZLIB

So which is correct ?    And is Zip=1 ?

@_subject: Will GPG use Dual Processors under Windows ? 
We're designing the next iteration of our encrypted file transmission
systems and we're anticipating the need to encrypt and decrypt files that
could be as large as 10 gigabytes in size using GnuPG.  Our tests indicate
that it could take an hour to process a file that size on some of our
slower hardware (Single P3 600Mhz).  It seems to be bound by processor
speed.  (Our tests on smaller files so that disk speeds and even ramdisks
don't make any difference.)  Does the official exe for Windows take
advantage of multiple processors ?  Would spec'ing out a dual cpu server
help me any ?
                                    Thanks,

@_subject: PGP 7.1.1 reports "bad signature" on messages from GnuPG ? 
I've read some older posts that say that older versions of PGP might be
looking for v3 sigs and not handle v4 sigs from GnuPG.  Anyone know if
that's still the case for PGP 7.1.1 ?  Also, I've noticed the --pgp7 switch
in the docs, if I use that, will it cause problems with recipients that use
GnuPG ?
                  Thanks,

Yep, Thansk : )  --force-v3-sigs seems to do the trick.  I want to do some
testing to see if that will mess up things for my trading partners usign
GnuPG before I do this in production though.

Try using --pgp7 or --force-v3-sigs and see if it makes
a difference.  --pgp7 includes --force-v3-sigs so you don't need to
set them both (no harm if you do though).

@_subject: CR-LF on OpenVMS ? 
Just sharing what I learned:
A very helpful person suggested using --textmode when encrypting
 the file on VMS using GPG.
It took some time to set this up with the school, but that did the trick.
Now the file decrypts properly on NT using GPG.
Thanks to everyone's suggestions and efforts the kids at this school
will get their college loans and scholarships much more quickly : )

@_subject: Can --textmode break things ? 
I've just come across an interoperability issue and I'm hoping
someone else has some
experience that'll help me out.
      We're using GnuPG 1.2.x on Windows NT 4.0.  The trading partner in
question is
using PGP E-biz Server 7.5x on a mainframe (390, I think.)  They are unable
to decrypt files from
my production system and can only decrypt files that I've manually
with an additional -textmode argument.  All of the files that go through
these systems are
DOS-ASCII text files.  There's no reason it should ever need to handle
un-encoded binary data
and the industry specs require RFC-2440 compliant encryption packages be
      Here's my real question :  Considering the above, can I safely add
--textmode to my
gpg options file and use this for all my trading partners that are using
PGP, or could that break things ?
                  TIA,

Ok, I've googled this without success.  The man page mentions the count,
but it doesn't explain what the quality level 0|1|2 argument that precedes
it actually means.  I've played with this a bit using all three and It's
emitting random bytes for me, but I'm wonder what value I should be using

@_subject: GnuPG Return Value 
I found that it was easier to turn on --verbose --verbose (yep twice = even
more verbose) and parse the stdout.
If it says something like "Good Signature from blah" then you not only know
the message was signed,
but you can make sure it was signed with the key you expected ...
