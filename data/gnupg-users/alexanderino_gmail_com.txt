What can't be controlled is when people who know you give out your
personal details on social networks.
It could happen because they may not see anything wrong with it, they
may be tricked into it [games/surveys], or they wish to harm you.

But many have succeeded in it. Add myself to the list of people who
have successfully backed up and re-used my GPG data files for over ten
years, across various operating systems.
It would be best to re-visit the problem when you're in a clear, calm
frame of mind.
All the best,

The solution may be to re-install pinentry, as described here:

You are squandering the goodwill of those trying to help you with such
responses, of which you have sent many more. No one has an obligation
to assist you, especially when their requests for terminal output are
ignored, instead met with childish tantrums and hissy fits.
If you want results, learn to behave in a mature manner. Be polite,
and work with us. Else, feel free to leave the list. We do not need
belligerent ingrates.

Try Keepass2 (official). It worked fine for me when I last used Linux,
and requires the Mono runtime. Fonts are adjustable, and the auto-type
(requires the xdotool package for Linux) will fulfil the wishes you
had stated earlier.
All the best,

It can be done for Fedora. You'll need to download the portable
version of Keepass2 from the official website, and install the Mono
runtimes and xdotool.
After extracting the keepass2 archive, cd to the directory, then run:
mono KeePass.exe

More proof that this David  is almost certainly a troll, with
an agenda to make inflammatory, misleading statements that are
designed to get a rise out of us, while presenting an almost-plausible
case to gain credibility.
The best course of action is to ignore him (directed in general to all
of us).

have you considered signing up for commercial support as Werner indicated
earlier? Here is the link again for your convenience:

It would be rather na?ve to do so, indeed.
This is exactly what I have done in this instance -- a Facebook-only key
was created and uploaded. I do not feel too comfortable associating my
general key with my Facebook account in such a manner.
I would love to hear others' take on this matter.
