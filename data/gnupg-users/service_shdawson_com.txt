@_subject: Passphrase 
Dire need, hoping for help.
I have my private and public keys, but you have neither the passphrase nor a revocation certificate.  I need to revoke my published key.  Can they recommend a bash script to discover the passphrase using brute force on the private key?
Please advise.
Thank You,
Stephen H. Dawson
