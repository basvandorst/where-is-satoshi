@_subject: retrieving key from server... 
A few days ago i revoked my old pgp-key (it was expired anyway), and created myself a new one using gpg1.2.1. Then i submitted my new key to the server wwwkeys.uk.pgp.net, but for some reason it can't be fetched from the server.
When i use the key-id that is shown with gpg --list-keys it says:
aquaruler:~$ gpg --keyserver wwwkeys.uk.pgp.net --recv-keys 0x245B4E48
gpg: geen geldige OpenPGP gegevens gevonden.
gpg: Totaal aantal behandeld: 0
(sorry it's in dutch, it says:
  gpg: no valid openpgp data found
  gpg: total number treated: 0
so, next i searched the key using my email-adress:
aquaruler:~$ gpg --keyserver wwwkeys.uk.pgp.net --search-keys gpg: searching for "tom.wouters1 from HKP server Keys 1-2 of 2 for "tom.wouters1
(1)     Tom Wouters            1792 bit RSA key 689578B0, created 2004-01-17
(2)     Tom Wouters  (revoked)
           1024 bit DSA key A9A4985D, created 2002-06-14
Enter number(s), N)ext, or Q)uit > 1
gpg: geen geldige OpenPGP gegevens gevonden.
gpg: Totaal aantal behandeld: 0
it finds the old revoked key(nr 2) and my new one, bit it lists another id with the new key...
so i try fetching it with the new id, but that also fails (same message as with the original id)
So it seems that it's impossible to fetch the key from te server, has anyone got an idea what i did wrong? Perhaps a faulty-key (but importing it from an ascii-armored version works fine, and encrypting/decription works fine too) or maybe a bug in the server-software?

yes, thank you, Thomas already explained me that it's a problem with the pgk-servers i was using, when i tried to fetch it from another server it worked just fine...
Thx all
