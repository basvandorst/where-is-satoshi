@_subject: Moving the GPG keys from 1 machine to another 
Hi ,
     We have just completed the migration of the application from 1  AIX box to another and have changed the encryption from PGP to GPG.
Since there are many external vendors involved the process is bit  tedious following up with vendor to change keys.
     JUst wanted to confirm in case if we move the application from 1  AIX box to another :
1.  Do we have to create a new GPG keys on new machine and send it   to vendor and repeat the tedious process again everytime we move to  new machine?
2. Is there any way we can migrate GPG keys from old box to new box  without following up with vendors to change key at their end?
         If anyone has done before please let me know.

Hi ,
     I want to decrypt a gpg encrypted document using a GPG. Is there  any way i can decrypt it in a non -interactive mode so that it  doesn't ask for passphrase.I want to execute the command in shell  Any pointer to this would be of great help.

Hi ,
     Is there any way i can validate that decryption process has been  successful base on error code? Do you have any document which list  down possible error code and cause of failure.

@_subject: Migrating from PGP TO GPG 
Hi ,
         We are migrating from PGP to GPG mechanism . We download  encrypted report from external vendors and decrypt them. However  external vendors are still using PGP mechanism to encrypt the file .
To explain further :-
1. We are generating a public private key on HOST system using GPG .
2. This keys are exported to external vendor system. Vendor will be  encrypting the file using PGP (not sure about compatibilty)
3. Files are then decrypted on host system using GPG mechanism.
         I am not sure whether this is feasible . If any of you have  implemented this before ,please let me know.
