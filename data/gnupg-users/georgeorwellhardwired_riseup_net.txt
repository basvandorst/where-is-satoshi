Every time I use GPA in ubuntu it says, when I start GPA: "GnuPG is rebuilding the trust database.
This might take a few seconds." And I can wait for hours, while nothing And If I try to close the window and try to generate a GPG key, it will say: "The GPGME library returned an unexpected error. The error was:"General error." This is probably a bug in GPA. GPA will now try to recover from this error.
Is there anyone that seen these errors before?

Dear GPG devs and users.
Like I've posted before, I have had problems with GPA. On Thu 2015-01-15      Every time I use GPA in ubuntu it says, when I start GPA: "GnuPG is rebuilding the trust database. This might take a few seconds." And I can wait for hours, while nothing happens.
But it is not only the GPA client for GPG that isn't working in ubuntu, it's all GnuGpgg clients.
Here is what the other clients is showing me, when opening and trying to generate pgp clients:
The Kleopatra GPG UI Server Module could not be initialized.
The error given was: Could not bind to socket: Permission denied
You can use Kleopatra as a certificate manager, but cryptographic plugins that rely on a GPG UI Server being present might not work correctly, or at all.
Gnupg failed to start. You must fix the GnuPG error first before running Kgpg.  Error in Kgpg.
Couldn't generate PGP key. General error. In seahorse GPG manager password and keys.
And I know I'm not the only one that have had these problems.
