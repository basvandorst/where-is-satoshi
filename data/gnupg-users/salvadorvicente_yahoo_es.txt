@_subject: GPG in Windows 2000/NT 
I have working in Windows 2000 Profesional with
permisions of write only in temp directory.
My problem is that to execute gpg, the program say:
"gpg:fatal: c:/gnupg: can't create directory:
Permission denied".
I have the keyrings in a diskette in a:, indicated in
the options file.
The problem is that I don't have permisions in other
directory that temp. How I can indicated to gpg that it find in temp

@_subject: PGP can't decript messages encripted with GPG 
Doing test for verify "how to take" the GPG and PGP, I have happened me the
I Importe correctly the keyring of GPG 1.0.3 in PGP 6.5.8.
I  encripted a message with GPG 1.0.3. Once, I trated of decrypt this with
PGP, saaying the program:
"An error has ocurr: Encripted sesion key is bad"
Why is this? Exist a way of correct this?

OK. I created the key in GPG and import in PGP. The problem, is that I
encripted with PGP and the key imported, and works well in PGP and GPG. The
problem is when encripted with GPG, due to only I can decrypt with GPG.
Thanks for your reply.
