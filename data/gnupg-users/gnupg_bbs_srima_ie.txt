@_subject: Installing new version of gpg 
A few more questions:
I imagine I need to create these symbolic links:
ln -s /opt/app/gnupg-1.4.11/bin/gpg       /usr/local/bin/gpg
ln -s /opt/app/gnupg-1.4.11/bin/gpg-zip   /usr/local/bin/gpg-zip
ln -s /opt/app/gnupg-1.4.11/bin/gpgsplit  /usr/local/bin/gpgsplit
ln -s /opt/app/gnupg-1.4.11/bin/gpgv      /usr/local/bin/gpgv
But should I also create these?
ln -s /opt/app/gnupg-1.4.11/libexec/gnupg /usr/local/libexec/gnupg
ln -s /opt/app/gnupg-1.4.11/share/gnupg   /usr/local/share/gnupg
And what about these existing files (copies of which are in /usr/local today):
And finally, what about these (which do not exist in /usr/local/share today):
I appreciate the help!
BTW - Although I have rarely posted to this list, it is one of the most
interesting discussion groups I follow.  I've been reading it for about five
years (since I first installed gpg) and although most of the conversation is
way over my head, I learn something new almost every day.

No forgiveness necessary.  Simple, straightforward questions are always
nice.  :)
It's hard to say definitively without looking at your particular system.
That said, speaking generally this will work fine.
