@_subject: Configuration for offline usage - best practice tips? 
Hi folks,
I'm looking for best practice tips for offline usage of GnuPG. What Do I
mean by offline usage? I plan to encrypt backups or files on my machines
with GnuPG and generate weekly or monthly keys for that purpose so backups
for example can run unattended and simply encrypt with today's public key.
As the backups need to be compatible with my software only, I could
possibly choose different configuration options than for my "online" usage.
While I can find a number of configuration hints for compatibility between
implementations and standards or strong encryption in general, I expect
that a configuration for offline usage might be different from one for
general purpose encrypted communication.
Regards, JC

Thanks for the feedback and sorry for the delayed answer, I've been on a
business trip.
Yes, that's what I plan to do, generate a subkey for each month in advance
and use this to encrypt my backups.
And it seems that I shouldn't have used the term "offline usage" without a
better spec what I ment. So: GnuPG tips for communications use state that I
should do this or don't configure that in order to keep my keys compatible
with potential recipients. That's what I consider "online" use, while I use
"offline" to say that I don't intend to share encrypted stuff with external
parties, so I have no need for potential limitations
Backups are done from a rented root server to a rented storage server in
"the cloud" and I want to lessen the impact of a potential compromise of
these keys. That is, if I have to restore certain files from a backup, and
the machine where the decryption happens might be compromised, I don't want
all backups to be compromised in a single step. The backup plan is in place and uses rotating backups, so older backups
expire anyway after some time.
Thanks for your detailed suggestions, I'll rethink my plans with them in
Regards, JC

@_subject: Feature proposal - image encryption 
As Dirk already said, you can encrypt image files with GnuPG already ;-)
And why should I trust people less who maintain complicated software like
(the fantastic) ImageMagick?
I beg to differ. Given the classic Unix philosophy of chaining small tools
which do their job well, GnuPG is already way too complex, especially for
casual users. I generally prefer the ImageMagick concept of small tools
(convert, identify, mogrify, ...).
So using ImageMagick for image encryption (in the way you want to use it)
is fine, as using GnuPG for general file encryption is fine too. Creating
the "eierlegende Wollmilchsau"[*] (what next: steganography in GnuPG? Or
add audio encryption?) rarely does something good in the software world.
[*] For reader's who don't know the "concept" take a look at
 ;-)

@_subject: Android 
am afraid of security reason.
Hi Daniel,
I'm using gnupg with Termux (Linux as app) on Android. And ssh for file
transfers too. Works for me, as I'm comfortable with commandline
interfaces, even on mobiles.
Cheers, JC

@_subject: How to create an authinfo.gpg encrypted file with a GitHub token 
Recent versions of Emacs (>= 23.x) offer EasyPG ("epa-mode") which handles
GnuPG encrypted files easily. That might be a good place to start looking
for what you might need. Just try to create /tmp/foo.gpg and save it. You
should be asked for a recipient and/or a key.
Or, if you're using org-mode, you could handle encrypted data there as it
offers to encrypt/decrypt certain regions of .org files:

Looks like an over-engineered idea to me: why use NFC tags when simple QR
codes printed on paper would be sufficient? And probably less prone to
detection or damage, I expect.

We are moving a bit far away from GnuPG issues, but ... ;-)
a) you'll neither need stickers nor postcards, just a standard sheet of
plain paper.
b) you can generate QR codes without using a smartphone (e.g. qrencode
on Linux systems) but easly on smartphones without NFC hardware too.
c) NFC capable smartphones still are less common than smartphones with
cameras to scan QR codes, so if you want to expand the set of possible
recipients and senders, you should think about the least common denominator
instead. d) NFC tags have their uses, but weren't invented to replace or augment QR
codes. And besides being cheaper to produce, QR codes are much more
Finally: using password protected NFC tags to carry encrypted content seems
a bit of overkill or over engineering too. But one could read a tag without
opening the letter that would be used to ship it, which obviously would be
a bit harder with QR codes ...
P.S. Last but not least, we could send QR codes via email! ;-0
