@_subject: caching of passphrase is not working in windows , 
Hi folks,
I am kind of stuck on this, hence reaching out to you guyz.
GPG is prompting for passphrase even though passphrase cached in gpg-agent
(windows)  Following steps I did.
1.      installed gpg on windows from  (version
- 2.2.23)
2.      imported the key   : - > gpg --import 3.      in home dir set the allow-preset-passphrase in gpg-agent.conf.
4.      from powershell started agent
"$gpgPath\bin\gpg-connect-agent.exe" reloadagent /bye
5.      powershell set passphrase
"$gpgPath\bin\gpg-preset-passphrase.exe" -v -c -P "$pgpPassphrase"
6.      mvn sign and deploy
mvn gpg:sign-and-deploy-file -B
"-Drevision=1.0.12-test" "-DrepositoryId=ossrh"
"-Dversion=1.0.12-test" "-DgroupId=datamodel" "-DartifactId=files"
"-Dpackaging=jar" "-DpomFile=E:\Publish\pom.xml"
it prompted the passphrase, I already cached it at step 5.
Not sure what is going wrong here .Is it a bug ? Few questions, really
appreciate if any one can help or i
1.      I don't see any option in windows, to verify if passphrase has been
cached . Does anyone know how to do that ?
2.      Are there any steps I am missing causing the passphrase prompt?
3. Any other direction , I should investigate.
I am kind of stuck here. Any help is very much appreciated.
 Thanks

Thanks for quick reply i did the following command only to put
passphrase in cache  ( missed id while writing mail )  got id from gpg
 gpg-preset-passphrase -vcP "$pgpPassphrase"
*00112233445566778898aabvccddeeff  *
How can I confirm if a passphrase set in the cache ?  is there any debug
log which I can see to confirm it.
Can you share .if possible, any steps how to build windows gpg agent using
source code.? Most docs are for linux.
