Try this:
gpg --decrypt filename.gpg --passphrase-fd 0 1> filename.txt < filename.key
This means that you are piping stdout (1) to (>) filename.txt and
also piping to 0 from (<) filename.key
That should do the trick for you!

@_subject: public key data output to a file? 
Is it possible to output the data of a public key to a file?
These parameters:
gpg --batch --yes --output [File]--edit-key [ID] pref quit Do not do it.

Oh, sorry, if you misunderstood. I don't want to export the key, I know the
commands for this.
What I'd like to do is to redirect the display of --edit-key [ID] to a file,
things like expiration date, trusts, sub keys.
That's all. Therefore I included the sniplet (see original posting).
No need to be angry

Sorry, but could you please (no RTFM please :-))= ) tell me how to use the
list-packets command?
And for this list, why can't I simply redirect the output to a file:
gpg --batch --edit-key [ID] pref quit 1> c:\test.txt
This would do it for me!

Can anyone please tell me what I can do with the list-packets command? The
description on the manpage is rather short!

@_subject: AS/ 400 version? 
Hi there!
Since I've been asked by a customer and didn't know an answer, I'll try to
ask the community: Is there an AS/ 400 version of GnuPG or did anyone ever
try to compile/ release a version for this platform?

@_subject: --with-colons, key type construction 
I took a deeper look into the output of the --with-colons command.
For key type, My public key says, it is '17' and the sub key says it is
Does 16 equal DSA Full (not only Encryption) and 17 El Gamal Encryption
If yes, what codes do
El Gamal Full (En/ Decryption)
RSA Full
RSA Encryption only
Thanks in advance,

@_subject: announcement: GPG Delphi component 
Hi there!
Since Werner seems not to want to put a link on the gnupg.org site, I hereby
announce my gpg delphi components. Using these components, you can encrypt/
decrypt files/ stringlists within Delphi, manage your keyring etc. pp.
If you should be interested, take a look at the component's homepage:
If you should have any comments or problems, don't hesitate to contact me!

@_subject: Key generation: Batch mode 
Dear developers of GnuPG!
I tried the batched key generation which works really fine (win32) apart
from an error message that the last+1 line is too long (it is actually an
empty line). What I would like to know is whether this feature can be used
"safely" in custom-programs interfacing gnupg. In 'details' it is mentioned
that this feature is experimental.
The second question/ suggestion I have is: Could you introduce a new status
output? I only get GOOD_PASSPHRASE (4 times). Is it possible to state a
KEYRING_CREATED or something like this to better control the batch
processing? This would be really nice!

@_subject: Key generation: Batch mode 
This is the file I'm using:
 snip ------------------
The output I get is:
gpg: key.txt:11: line too long (for line 11, see sentence below)
btw: On my system, the key will not really be created (zero byte file size)
until I include a "%echo End" at the end of the text file.
Thanks :-))= Do you already now the corresponding integer value so that I
can integrate it into the component?

are there differences between the various windows versions? Under W2k, it is
possible to cipher files piping passphrases:
test.txt - test message
pass.txt - passphrase file (should be deleted after processing :-))= )
gpg --passphrase-fd 1 --symmetric test.txt 1<pass.txt
