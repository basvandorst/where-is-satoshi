@_subject: One alternative to SMTP for email: Confidant Mail 
There has been some discussion on gnupg-users about replacing SMTP for secure email, and how BitMessage does not scale.
There is an open source non-SMTP email system called Confidant Mail, which is based on GnuPG and hash table storage. The protocol conceals metadata (headers like From and Subject are inside the envelope) and uses TLS. The client has built-in support for Tor and I2P anonymity. The system supports unlimited length attachments (over 4GB) using a torrent-like blocking protocol. Messages are GPG encrypted and signed, and all messages are acknowledged. Key distribution is built into the It's designed to scale using either DNS or a Kademlia DHT to look up keys. Servers are paired for high availability. The client can automatically configure itself from the server.
The client is available for Windows, Linux and MacOS. You can run your own server, or get an account on the test environment to try it out immediately. More information and downloads at: Mike Ingle  d2b89e6f95e72e26e0c917d02d1847dfecfcd0c2

@_subject: One alternative to SMTP for email: Confidant Mail 
The user interface has to do a lot of things differently from SMTP MUAs - display signatures,
check for keys, detect key collisions, display hash IDs, support gigabyte attachments...
so it's never going to be a layer under SMTP. The UI can definitely be improved to have features
people like from their existing mail clients. It needs automatic filing and a preview pane, for example.
At the moment it's a parallel system for when you need security and big files. It's as much an
alternative to file drop services as to email. File drops are not secure. Confidant Mail sends the
email and attachments in a GPG encrypted ZIP file, which is broken into blocks for transmission.
The question I am working on is mobile support. I don't really want to carry my GPG key on my
phone, so it might make sense to make a web UI that can run on a PC and present itself to a
phone or tablet over a VPN. That way the GPG key stays at home, and if the remote user fails
to login a few times, the web UI shuts down.
Confidant Mail can sync itself across multiple clients already, so one of those clients could be a
mobile web UI and the other a PC GUI.

@_subject: Enabling and using ECC keys (any reason not to?) 
The current version of Confidant Mail for Windows includes GPG 1.4.19. However, the code is written to support version 2.1 and ECC keys. If you point it to GPG 2.1, it will let GPG handle passphrases, and will let you create and rotate ECC keys.
Is there any reason not to start using them? I have been reluctant to bundle version 2.1, because once people start using ECC keys, using version 2.1 becomes mandatory. GPG makes you ask very nicely (--full-gen-key --expert) to get an ECC key. Is this just a backward compatibility thing, or is the security of ECC keys not fully trusted yet?
I want to enable them, but not until it's safe.

Yes, the email address is just an identifier. The address is used in two
ways. One, it is hashed with SHA1 and used to look up the user's key id.
Two, you can search for a key using DNS, which means take the part of
the email address after  prepend "cmsvr.", look up the corresponding
TXT record, and use that to find the CM server with the key.
At present, there is no key verification built in and you have to check
the key fingerprint (which is always shown to the right of the address)
or check a signature chain on your key using a GPG key manager.
If you get two keys with the same address, messages will show a key
collision and the automatic lookup will refuse to match. This reduces
the problem of someone making a key matching someone you know and
sending you an email that would otherwise look correct.
In the future, what I want to do is have some basic level of trust
assigned when (a) the key is fetched from a server which is listed in
the TXT record for the domain in the email address of that key and (b)
the server has a commercial SSL certificate for cmsvr.DOMAIN. That would
give some small amount of trust, roughly equivalent to SSL website
trust, to strangers using the system. It should provide
better-than-nothing security to careless people (at least stop passive
monitoring, but not active attacks), and good security to people who
exercise some caution.

They very well might, if I was the one making such claims. The claim is
made by whoever created the key, and it is just a claim. It's much like
using a gmail address as your username on a website - purely a shortcut
identifier. Not to be trusted.

No. There is no authority in a position to do that. CM can run in a
purely peer-to-peer mode, and bogus keys are currently the biggest
threat to CM security (and to any encrypted email system that does not
have a central authority.) Check the fingerprint. Hopefully CM users
will put their address plus fingerprint on social media profiles,
email sig block, etc. Any hacking would therefore be public.

That's more or less what it does. When you get an email from joe at somewhere.com, it fetches that key id and adds it to your keyring. If you get an email from a different key claiming joe at somewhere.com, it also fetches that key id and adds it, but now messages from both users show a key collision until you go delete one of those keys. Likewise, while you have a key collision, you cannot email that user by typing his email address. You have to type or click the key id. In that way it forces you to deal with it when and if you get a collision.
Think I should rephrase that like, "SMTP-style addresses can be used to look up keys"?
It is true that people can always keep and use their existing address, but others can potentially
generate fake keys for that address.
The celebrity will not be blocked because there is no central key directory. It's possible some impostor will start using a celebrity's email address on CM. Then when the real celebrity wants to use it, he will tweet "My real CM key id is (some hash), please ignore those impostors" and hopefully that will resolve it. It's similar to regular PGP keyservers in that it will accept any key someone wants to post. The main difference is keys expire after a month or so if they are not The only person who will see a key collision is one who previously received a message from the impostor.
Yes I am worried about the bogus keys problem. Just not sure how to handle it in a peer to peer system. For business use I like the SSL That is a good idea and if I build a commercial provider I will probably implement that. Anyone can run a provider and I expect them to range from strictly business to the dodgy darknet variety.

With GPG 2.1, the gpg-agent handles all the passphrase prompting. I don't see
why it would not work with a smartcard. Which one do you think I should get to

There should not be two or more keys advertised for one email address. That
creates confusion, requires the recipient to have two CM accounts, and
increases the risk of bogus keys being used. Since CM keys disappear from the
key search results about a month after the key owner stops advertising them,
people should delete old or bogus keys from their keyrings.

Once the owner stops advertising the key (by using it in a CM account), a month or so the STORUTIL will remove it from the servers. That depends on
how often server operators run STORUTIL to prune their server directories.

Not at the moment. There is no place to put a gatekeeper in this system. It is
a Kademlia peer to peer network with signature and integrity checking done
before the key is accepted. Any gatekeeping will have to be done by the In general it's a server dumb/client smart system.

No offense to the darknet intended. I'm in favor of more widespread Tor and I2P
usage, that's why I built in support for it. Using CM over hidden services is a good
way to avoid social graph building.
An example of a "dodgy darknet provider" would be if one of the darknet decided to run a couple of covert CM servers (having only Tor hidden service
addresses) to facilitate vendor to customer communication. That would solve
the problem of some users not encrypting their messages, and would allow to communicate even if the hidden website server is down.
Suppose a reporter on a "strictly business" CM provider wanted to interview
vendors of that darknet market. She could do so using CM without needing a
technical expert to handle the encryption, and without either party being
exposed to any risks. In the past that has been difficult.
It is also possible to run mailing lists and file servers over CM. I am
currently running a CM users' mailing list.

GPG version 2.1.12 added support for Curve25519 sign and encrypt. I am trying to support such keys in Confidant Mail.
Installed from gnupg-w32-2.1.12_20160504.exe
If I create a key manually I get:
pub   ed25519/C850D9A5 2016-05-05 [SC]
uid         [ultimate] test 3 sub   cv25519/22967908 2016-05-05 [E]
which works, as the roles are properly assigned to the main and sub key.
If I create one in batch mode I get:
pub   ed25519/3CC6C1EC 2016-05-05 [SCA]
uid         [ultimate] t 3 sub   cv25519/154B8241 2016-05-05 []
which cannot do anything because the roles are assigned wrong.
The batch creation string I am using was initially:
Key-Type: ecdsa
Name-Real: t 4
Subkey-Curve: Curve25519
Subkey-Type: ecdh
Name-Email: t at 4
Key-Curve: Ed25519
Key-Length: 255
I also tried manually setting the roles, with no effect:
Key-Type: ecdsa
Name-Real: t 6
Subkey-Curve: Curve25519
Subkey-Usage: encrypt
Subkey-Type: ecdh
Name-Email: t at 6
Key-Curve: Ed25519
Key-Usage: sign
Key-Length: 255
This looks like a code problem. Any suggestions?

Question about GPG versions:
Due to CVE-2016-6313, I put out a new version of Confidant Mail where the Windows and Mac binaries include GPG 1.4.21.
I also put in a pop-up dialog to warn if someone uses it with a pre-1.4.21 version of GPG. However, Debian and Tails 2.6rc1
have patched 1.4.18 instead of using 1.4.21, and gpg --version does not show the patch level. Is there any call to gpg that will
display the Debian patch level and tell me if the version I'm using is fixed or not?
If not, I'm either going to have to remove the pop-up warning, or rely on calling dpkg to ask the version.
