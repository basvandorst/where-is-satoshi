I am a XP Pro User, Thunderbird - I got the extension for Thunderbird to
do PnuPG... and have the executable to Install the Encryption program.
I mainly want to ?Sign?my msgs at this point and not Encrypt, is this
possible to just Sign without a lot of hassle?
Or to setup to default that way so I don't have to choose to Sign and
not encrypt?
Thanks for Any Pointers - Tom

Is this Happening a lot? Is there an Alternate Site I can try to get a
Good Download?
(not to mention the warning of Virus that the Dialog Included -Shudder!)
Now What?
Thanks Everyone, Newbie Tom
