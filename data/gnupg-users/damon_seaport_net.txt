@_subject: Automatically getting a key? 
I use GnuPG 0.9.7 in conjunction with mutt 0.95.6i on Linux 2.2.10.
All I had to do was add this line to my ~/.gnupg/options:
keyserver wwwkeys.us.pgp.net
All of my other options are pretty standard, except that I've
explicitly specified my public and private keyrings, like so:
# Debian developer keyrings
keyring /usr/share/keyrings/debian-keyring.gpg
keyring /usr/share/keyrings/debian-keyring.pgp
# My keyrings
secret-keyring ~/.gnupg/secring.gpg
keyring ~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg
Does this make any difference?
