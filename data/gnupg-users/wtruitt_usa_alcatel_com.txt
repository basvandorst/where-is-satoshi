You can search for the person on the key server using his name or
address.  Then when you download the key, it will have the signature of
the person you trust.  You don't need the key id to get the key from the
key server.

@_subject: GnuPG: what email client should i use? 
I have used several different Tcl/Tk mailers that have pgp/gpg
builtin.  This message is being sent by tkrat.  I have not been
using it lately, as I mainly stick with the command line.  I like
tkrat because it has imap capability.  Another mailer, postilion,
is based from tkrat, and has more colorful buttons.  I have also
enjoyed using exmh in the past.  I enjoy some of the capabilities
of mh based mailers.
