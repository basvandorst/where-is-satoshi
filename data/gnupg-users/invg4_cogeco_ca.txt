I am running Redhat 7.3 which installed gpg 1.0.6 when i loaded the system.  I downloaded the tarball of gpg 1.0.7 and installed it,  now i have version 1.0.6 in /usr/bin which the system still uses and gpg 1.0.7 in /usr/local/bin which does work.  How can i tell the system to use the new version ?
Thanks in advance
