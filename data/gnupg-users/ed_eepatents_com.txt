@_subject: Problem verifying GPG signatures with PGP 
I'd like to use the Win 98 build of GPG in a digital signature application, and I'd like the digital signatures to be verifiable using either GPG or PGP. So far, I've been able to import and export my public key from GPG to PGP version 6.5.3. I've also been able to use GPG to verify signatures generated with PGP. But I can't seem to use PGP to verify signatures generated with GPG.
Below my "signature" is a test message signed with both programs and the result when I attempt verification with both programs. At the very end of this message are the PGP and GPG public keys, respectively, I used to generate the signatures.
If anyone could play around with this and let me know what's going on, I'd appreciate it. GPG seems like a great little program and a great alternative to the increasingly commercialized PGP, and I'd like to be able to use it.
I don't subscribe to this list, so please copy me on any replies. Thanks!

@_subject: Win32 Installation Package for GPG/WinPT (new) 
After searching in vain for a user-friendly alternative to command-line GPG and the increasingly commercialized PGP, I have finally cobbled together something that I think will work, at least for communications between me and and my clients and colleagues.
Without modifying the source of either GPG or WinPT, I've put together an installation package that allows users to install both programs without needing to access the command prompt. (Let's face it, most people don't even know what the command prompt is nowadays.) It also allows users to encrypt and decrypt files with a simple "drag-and-drop" interface and allows generation of a key pair by filling out a text template. There is a documentation folder with the various documentation in PDF and text, including a very basic "how to" overview I've written.
A performance benefit is the integration of command-line ZIP compression ("copyleft" licensed) with encryption. Compressing data before encryption makes cryptanalysis of the ciphertext much more difficult, and PGP does this automatically for that reason.
The installation executable is at ftp://eepatents.com/clients/gpg32.exe. The ZIP file with the exe's contents is at It's somewhat thrown together as none of the source code is modified, and it is definitely not a stable release yet, but I think it will achieve the ease-of-use objective I've got in mind. While I will continue to wait for GPA, I think this will do the job for my purposes.I think it ties Timo's work nicely into GPG, with support for "idiot proof" DH/DSS keygen and file Suggestions would be most welcome, especially an easy way to allow encryption of files to any recipient. If anyone wants to modify the GPG source code and/or to use the Windows Scripting Host to make this a clear package with less reliance on DOS batch files, that would be great.
P.S. - I highly recommend the "Powerarchiver" compression software for Win32. Its freeware license looks a lot like the GPL. See  It works better than any  compression utility I've used, and it is compatible with just about every compression format.

The first "actual" release of WinGPG, a Windows 9x, ME, NT, 2K installation package of GPG and Timo Schulz's great little WinPT program, is now available at ftp://eepatents.com/clients/wingpg.exe. The ZIP archive is available at ftp://eepatents.com/clients/wingpg.zip for those who just want to browse through the files.
I've fixed numerous bugs since the beta release (though this is probably still a "beta" release and that was an "alpha"). It seems to work OK on a couple of PCs and seems to be very easy to use.
Included in this release is my first public disclosure of a passphrase selection scheme I've invented and a user's guide ("ABC MANUAL") written in simple, clear language for the average computer user who doesn't know (or care) anything about cryptography.
Timo and I plan to work together on the next release, and look forward to comments, suggestions, and the inevitable bug reports. (He's the real programmer - I'm just a frustrated PGP user and part-time crypto inventor who still remembers how to write batch files and who got tired of waiting for a Win32 installation package people could actually understand.)
Have fun.

Several people have written some pretty nice shell programs for PGP 2.6.1. These programs are freeware but not unfortunately not GPL. They have largely fallen into disuse with the advent of PGP 5.x and above, and it would be great if they could be used with GPG, which remains a command-line program. (I'm really looking forward to GPA, the GUI version of GPG, but no telling when it will be stable and usable with Win 98/2000.)
One of the better looking shells is "Scytale" written by Patrick Buseine (mailto:buseine and available at  Some nice screen shots are at  I REALLY want to figure out a way to use this software with GPG to obtain a freeware crypto solution with an easy-to-use graphic interface that I can distribute to clients and colleagues.
The command line for GPG is a bit different than that for PGP, but the software is otherwise largely compatible. Has anyone thought of implementing a "PGP emulation mode" for GPG so that it would be command-line compatible with PGP and thus usable with one of these shells? (It would be simple enough for users to rename the file "pgp.exe" for this purpose.) Ideally, the authors of this software would modify it to be GPG-compatible or, better yet, put it under GPL so others can do so. (You might want to contact Mr. Buseine about that request.)

Copy of post to alt.security.pgp:
I've been looking for a Win32 shell for GPG for a while. So far, the only ideas are:
(1) to use one of the existing Win32 shells for PGP 2.6.1 with pgpgpg, a "commandline wrapper tool to allow the use of scripts written for PGP with GnupPG," (
(2) to write some batch files that you can drag and drop files onto as icons. (Simple, but very limited.)
(3) re-write on of the freeware front ends (most running under Win32 are NOT open source) to work with GPG. See the following examples:
   (a)  (GNOME frontend - could this be rewritten for Win32? Is there a "GNOME emulator" out there for Win32?)
   (b) One of the better looking Win32 shells is "Scytale" written by Patrick Buseine and available at  Some nice screen shots are at  The author has told me he's interested in updating it to work with GPG but is very busy at the moment and is not quite ready to open the source and maintain it.
The GNU Privacy Assistant, GPA, ( is in the works, and when it's done it should provide THE solution, as long as it can be compiled under Win32.
Let's keep in touch - a good GUI for GPG will eliminate the last remaining need for PGP and NAI. (Sorry, Phil, but I'm disappointed in what's happened with ADK and PGP 7. Plus I need a free solution for distribution to my clients and colleagues.)

Posted to sci.crypt today:
No Win32 GUI for GPG yet, though Werner Koch says it is still in the works.
I've taken the liberty of copying this post (with your original post) to mailto:gnupg-users (archived at  You can get some good info about GPG there and perhaps offer help with the GPA project if you like.
Hopefully a Win32 GUI will materialize soon. Linux is great for those committing to use it, but I think GPG will really take off (and give some real visibility to GNU software) when they get it working well with one particular proprietary OS.

(2) to write some batch files that you can drag and drop files onto as icons. (Simple, but very limited.)
(3) re-write on of the freeware front ends (most running under Win32 are NOT open source) to work with GPG. See the following examples:
   (a)  (GNOME frontend - could this be rewritten for Win32? Is there a "GNOME emulator" out there for Win32?)
   (b) One of the better looking Win32 shells is "Scytale" written by Patrick Buseine and available at  Some nice screen shots are at  The author has told me he's interested in updating it to work with GPG but is very busy at the moment and is not quite ready to open the source and maintain it.
The GNU Privacy Assistant, GPA, ( is in the works, and when it's done it should provide THE solution, as long as it can be compiled under Win32.
Let's keep in touch - a good GUI for GPG will eliminate the last remaining need for PGP and NAI. (Sorry, Phil, but I'm disappointed in what's happened with ADK and PGP 7. Plus I need a free solution for distribution to my clients and colleagues.)

@_subject: More calls for Win32 GUI for GPG... 
Posted to sci.crypt today:
No Win32 GUI for GPG yet, though Werner Koch says it is still in the works.
I've taken the liberty of copying this post (with your original post) to mailto:gnupg-users (archived at  You can get some good info about GPG there and perhaps offer help with the GPA project if you like.
Hopefully a Win32 GUI will materialize soon. Linux is great for those committing to use it, but I think GPG will really take off (and give some real visibility to GNU software) when they get it working well with one particular proprietary OS.

I am trying to script GPG with TCL/TK 8.3, using the following command:

I get the following error message as a result:

@_subject: Key Generation "file open error" Problem with 1.0.6 
I am having an intermittent problem (the worst kind to debug!) with GPG 1.0.6 during batch key generation. First, I generate a "vapor key" (destroyed when the crypto session's over) with TCL (see script copied below). That step always works, but when I try to --list-keys to get the hex ID for the newly generated key, after a 2-second delay, I sometimes (20%?) get the following error:
"keyinfo" is a TCL procedure that creates a list of GPG key emails + hex ID codes. (See below.)
My script currently retries the --list-keys operation in hopes of getting it done, but it seems that once GPG produces the file open error, it can never get over it. I may have to try deleting the new keyring files (pubvapor.gpg, secvapor.gpg) on error and redoing the key generation command. That would probably help, but I'm uncomfortable with this apparent file locking bug with GPG 1.0.6.
Werner, am I doing something wrong in the scripts, or is this a GPG bug that can be fixed in 1.0.7?
P.S. - The scripts are part of my free, open-source (but not public domain) TKSEC package on SourceForge ( which I'll be announcing here with the first stable release. I don't have time to go into the details right now, but briefly, TKSEC uses GPG as a security platform for a suite of secure communication tools, all conveniently accessible from a single menu, including voice-over-IP, document transfer, and remote desktop access. A major benefit is that it uses an FTP command/reply channel to get around firewalls, and that the "vapor keys" used for encryption are permanently wiped out after the session. The vapor key passphrases are pseudorandomly generated and stored only in RAM during the session. So, no keyboard sniffer or demand for a key can be used to get at your data after you're done with it.

@_subject: Another 1.0.6 Problem (bug or user error?) 
The "vapor key" in TKSEC is generated right before a user becomes visible to his peers on the FTP-based peer-to-peer network. This produces a "key created in future" error when communicating from a later timezone to an earlier one.
I tried disabling with the "--ignore-time-conflict" option (see script below), but it doesn't seem to be working:
"gpg: key C98B30EC.235: created in future (time warp or clock problem)"
The script:
 Encrypt and sign the file
set err [catch { exec $cryptoPath/gpg -se \
  --no-tty --yes \
  --armor --ignore-time-conflict \
  --recipient $KEYS($remoteUser) \
  --always-trust \
  --default-key $KEYS($localUser) \
  --passphrase-fd 0 \
  --output $tempSpec \
  $filePath/$fileName \
  << "$pass\n" } result]
If this is my fault, please point out what I'm doing wrong. If it's a bug, this seems like a good time to report it (before 1.0.7)!

I am cross-posting this message to the GnuPG and WinPT users' lists in hopes that it is of interest to members of both. -Ed
Version 0.9.8b of the PRIVARIA Secure Networking Suite is now available at
This is a very significant release. Here are some highlights:
* You can use your existing GnuPG/WinPT installation and keys
* Install to the directory of your choice
* Reliability fixes to the FTP command core
* Uses a "safe" TCL interpreter for the Remote Command Shell by default, with option to open it up for all functions (e.g., for telecommuter access)
* Many more bug fixes
* Some cosmetic improvements
I'm immensely gratified at the tremendous response to PRIVARIA. In the first three weeks of its release, it has been downloaded over 12,000 (yes, twelve thousand!) times and has risen to the top 2% of projects on Thanks again to Werner et al. for providing GPG, which provides the authentication and secure symmetric key exchange foundation for PRIVARIA. Looking forward to an official Win32 build of 1.0.7 to include in my release 0.9.9.
P.S. - Anyone with TCL skills and CVS capabilities who is interested in helping to port PRIVARIA to Linux, please contact me.

@_subject: PRIVARIA: A GPG-Based, Firewall-Friendly Platform for Peer-to-Peer 
I am now announcing a beta release of PRIVARIA, an encryption and authentication platform I've developed for firewall-friendly, peer-to-peer networking with my clients and colleagues. (There have been many, many non-publicized alpha releases over the past several months.) PRIVARIA builds on some excellent open-source tools, including GnuPG, WinPT, and Zebedee. My goal was to make secure communications effective, convenient, and intuitive, and I hope that this new open-source software, the result of hundreds of hours of unpaid effort, helps to achieve this goal.
If you would like to help out by testing this pre-release, please install PRIVARIA (soon) on your Win9x/NT/2000/XP box and e-mail me with the GPG public key you're using with PRIVARIA. I'll reply with the password to my FTP site, which testers can use for their own peer-to-peer secure networks for as long as I maintain that site. Note that the package installs GnuPG 1.0.6 and WinPT 0.5.12a in its own C:\PRIVARIA\crypto directory. WinPT users will likely have some registry entries changed to point to the new location, and will need to transfer their keyrings over to that location. GPG-only users should be able to leave their existing GPG installations alone and just use PRIVARIA's distribution of GPG for its internal purposes. You can either copy your existing public/private keypair to C:\PRIVARIA\crypto or generate a new keypair just for PRIVARIA.
For more details, please see  I look forward to your feedback, bug reports, and making secure, peer-to-peer connections with you via PRIVARIA! And thanks to Werner Koch, Timo Schulz (WinPT), Neil Winton (Zebedee) and others for providing the important and valuable crypto tools on which PRIVARIA builds its open-source security and authentication platform.
P.S. - Help with porting to Linux would be greatly appreciated! TCL is cross-platform and all the bundled tools come in Linux flavors, so it should be a reasonably easy project for a volunteer to take on, once I figure out the mysteries of CVS and get my source committed to CVS on \---  -----------------/
