@_subject: gpg-agent as default ssh-agent on linux macines 
gpg v2.1 claims to be easy to use for SSH-authentification, too.
For me that's really great, because you can have on public key with
subkeys for all purposes, but I tried some configs I found at blogs etc
I would be very happy about an how-to use gpg v2.1 as default ssh client.
