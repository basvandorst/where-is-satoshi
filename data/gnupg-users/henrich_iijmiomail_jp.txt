@_subject: Q: select between multiple signing key 
I've generated multiple sign subkey but could not select it,
 only last generated one was used.
 There are three sign keys (one is Master, other two are subkey).
 Then tried to sign file with Masterkey...
 But asked passphrase for BD6695496E30735F, the last generated one.
 My question is
  - Can we have multiple signature subkey on one GPG key?
  - If so, how do select it?
  - If not, why we can do exec addkey?
