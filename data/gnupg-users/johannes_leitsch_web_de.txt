@_subject: Compiling my own GNUPG-binary on a Windows-system 
Hi there,
sorry to have to ask this, but how do i compile my own binary of GNUPG (or other GNU-/OS-software) from the source-code on a MS-Windows-system?
All the different Unices seem to come along with their C-compilers (or is it C++ and if what is the real difference between both?), but what "utility" do i use to make a Windows-binary from the source code.
Do i really have to buy a licence of MS-compilers (or another commercial compiler software) or is there a free / open source solution to this problem?
Is it possible to make / compile a Windows-binary on a "Unix"-system (*BSD, I'm only just at the beginning of switching to OS-software (not yet totally sure as to what is best suited for me: *BSD or Linux) but at the moment i'm still using Windows and would like to do some own compiling / making of binaries on this platform too. I started using the GNUPP-cd-rom ( ,  and would urgently like to see if the binaries supplied on this cd-rom are really "the real stuff" or if s.o. applied some "improvement" to them... ;-)
Thanks a lot already in advance for any - highly appreciated - help! A (some) link(s) would be more than enough... And if this info can easily be found in any newbie-FAQ then pls. be so kind to leave a link too!
And pls. do have a nice day! :-)
