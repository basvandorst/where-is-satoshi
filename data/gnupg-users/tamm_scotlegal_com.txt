@_subject: gpg decrypting to an empty file 
I have the following setup
1. gpg 1.0.7 on linux with key A
2. windows winpt 1.0rc2 with key B
3. public keys for A and B have been exchanged
I encrypt a file with pub key B and open in windows
I change the file and encrypt with public key A back to linux
I decrypt and I get an ampty file.
Even if I do not specify an output file, the text does not get displayed on screen yet the message indicates that the file has decrypted ok. There should be no file permission problems.

gpg: loaded digest 1
File `/tmp/tt' exists. Overwrite (y/N)? y
gpg: decryption okay
I can encrypt and decrypt on linux without any problems.
I know I should provide more information, but not sure what to provide.
Can anyone help with this problem.
