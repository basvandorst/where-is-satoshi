Hey all,
I'm trying to get gpg integrated into IMP and need a little info.
Hopefully I've just missed something obvious and someone here can help.  I'm needing to get the algorithm used for signing (either md5 or sha1) from gpg.  Is there a flag that will return this to me?

Pretty sure it means you don't have the publick key for the person you're sending the encrypted file to.  Either that or you are referencing the entry incorrectly (which equates to the same thing as far as gpg is concerned.  What's the command/options/flags etc you're using to get this error?

Hey all,
I'm getting this returned when trying to decrypt a messge from the command line.
Am I missing something here or could one of my keyrings be broken?
bash-2.04$ gpg -v --decrypt test1

@_subject: ibutton and gpg key - Java and USB 
I remember _ages_ ago when a friend of mine first found iButtons talking about this and apparently they're designed for that sort of interfacing (I'd have to double check though.)  They can run a jvm on them though.  That might be what I was thinking.  Java has trouble access outwards (security stuff) but what about having info pushed at it?  The button, with a jvm, could, when activated, look for an appropriate applet and feed it the info needed...  I'm not a java coder so I'm not sure if this would work.

Can you control the access you can give to others?  You could make a few extra admins that could do this for you.  Just give them the right to approve requests.
