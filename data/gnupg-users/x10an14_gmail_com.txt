@_subject: Rationale/reasons for splitting Sign and Authenticate into two 
I'm currently helping my workplace test out Yubikeys - to see how/if they
could help us with our software development. One expected benefit is to
allow developers cryptographically sign Git commits/tags (e.g).
My question is based on this awesome answer by Thomas Pornin:
*In a work-environment, what benefits does one gain by having separate
Authentication/Signing (sub)keys?*
I understand and agree with the rationale of keeping a separate Encryption
key (so that this could be shared with your employer), but that rationale
does not extend for Signing/Authenticating (presuming a trustworthy
workplace which doesn't need to fake authentication/signing of employees).

Hi Dirk-Willem!
Thanks for your reply - but I'm unfortunately lost as to your (what I
surmise is your implied) hypothetical use-case?
On Tue, Dec 22, 2020 at 2:56 PM Dirk-Willem van Gulik Would you mind elaborating on when you'd foresee/imagine such a
non-european/non-private sector have a need for this?
There's nothing that would stop the user in question utilizing multiple
separate "main" keys, and not just separate sub-keys per A, S, E
capability  in your scenario (even when A and S capabilities reside on the
_same_ private/public sub-key pair).

Nvm, apologies for the spam.
I retract my question now after having conferred with a third-party.
I understand now your hypothetical scenario - thanks!
Does anyone else have any thoughts on the reduced complexity of juggling
multiple (sub?)keys vs the security implications of not separating
Authentication/Signing to different (sub?)keys?
