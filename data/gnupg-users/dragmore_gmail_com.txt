@_subject: "--passphrase-file" issues 
Hi. I have a question regarding some automation options in Gnupg.
Im using Gnupg 2.0.4 running on OpenSuse 10.3 32bit.
Each 3rd day i get 5-10 new .gpg files that i need to automatically decrypt
using a known passphrase using the following command line:
gpg --decrypt-files --no-mdc-warning -q --allow-multiple-messages $(find .
-name '*.gpg')
When i add  "--passphrase-file" /root/pass.txt i still get the passphrase
dialogbox up.
PS! Im running the gpg command as root user so there shouldnt be security
If any one has a tip or a hint to what to do i would be most greatfull
Best Regards
