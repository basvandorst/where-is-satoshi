I've done some changes in the source code of GNUPG for Windows and now I'm
trying to check if it works but I don't know how to compile the code.
Can anybody help me please?

@_subject: Q: device not configured 
Hi all,
I'm trying to use gnupg for providing a print spooler (LPRng) with
authentication services for users. For simplicity I invoke the gpg program
from a filter in the server side. When I submit a printjob from a client
machine to the print server, the printjob is processed by the filter and the
result is sent to the printer. This is the standard behavior for filters. My
problem is that when I sent a printjob from a remote client to the server the
authentication process fails and the next error is logged in the server log
     gpg: cannot open /dev/tty: Device not configured
Does anybody know what does it mean? I've used the gpg debug options but I
don't understand the output information. If some of you get this error even
in a completely different context (not using LPRng) your suggestions can help.
Thanks in advance.

You are right, but you can find it with gpg --help

@_subject: passphrase and windows 
Hi all,
I'm using GNUPG 1-0-1a for Windows. In particular I'm invoking gpg from
inside a C++ code and I need to read the passphrase from a file (I had no
choice) in order to sign a file, but I don't know how to do it. I tried with
'--passphrase-fd' option but I don't understand how it works under Windows.
May anybody help me, please?
Thanks in advance.
