The 'expert' setting didn't seem to tell me enough so I tried the 'guru'
option on two different machines and noticed that the Arch Linux machine
seems to use two slightly different strings when performing the
rsa_verify step:
    rsa_verify      n:+b5cd0db854ba1...
    ....
    rsa_verify  cmp:+b5cb0db854ba1...
Notice that the 4th digit has changed from a 'd' to a 'b'.  Other digits
in the string are also different (I didn't want to include the whole
string as I'm not sure what that would reveal).
Looking at the same output on the other machine (performing the same
operation on the same file), the two strings match exactly and I don't
get the 'Bad signature' error.
I'm somewhat out of my depth now so hopefully the above will mean
something to you?
Many Thanks,

Many thanks for the reply, Werner.
libgcrypt 1.6.1
Yes.  I can run a command such as "gpg2 --clearsign doc" and it will
fail with the "Bad signature error" then I can immediately run the same
command again and it works (but not consistently).
The issue is only happening on this machine.  I am using the same
private key on a Windows 7 machine with GPG4Win and I don't get this
Please let me know if there is any more information I can provide which
might help diagnose the issue.
Kind regards.

Thank you for the response, Peter.
I haven't overclocked the computer but it is only a (quite old, now)
Acer Revo
with an Intel Atom 230 1.6 GHz CPU.
I will try this and the visual component inspection as soon as possible
and see
what I can find.
It certainly is the correct English term :)  I can't imagine how strange
must be to discuss such obscure things in a language other than one's
I am ashamed to admit that, although I very much enjoy other languages,
could not even say "Hello, how are you" in Dutch.
All the best,

The plot thickens.
I have just generated a new keypair on the Arch Linux box where I'm
having the problem and I can use this new key (repeatedly) to "gpg2
--clearsign doc" and it works every time.
So, it seems that the 'Bad signature' issue is related solely to my
'primary' key, which would suggest that hardware is not to blame?
As another test, I have also deleted the primary keypair, exported it
from the (working) Windows machine and re-imported it on the Linux
machine but I still get the intermittent 'Bad signature' error.
Any additional thoughts?

Hello everyone.  I'm new to mailing lists so apologies in advance if I commit
any faux pas.
I'm trying to sign a public PGP key but am encountering a 'Bad signature' error:
    gpg --edit-key someone at somedomain.com
    ...
    gpg> sign
    ...
    You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
    user: "My User "
    2048-bit RSA key, ID 12345678, created 2012-01-01
I enter my passphrase then get:
    gpg: checking created signature failed: Bad signature
    gpg: signing failed: Bad signature
    gpg: signing failed: Bad signature
I'm also sporadically getting the same result when clearsigning messages in
I've done some searching online but can only find old, unrelated posts or ones
relating to smart cards, which I'm not using.
The wording of the error seems to suggest that gpg is attempting to verify the
signature it just created but is failing?
I'm running gnupg 2.0.25-1 on an Arch Linux box via a PuTTY SSH connection.
Any help gratefully received!
