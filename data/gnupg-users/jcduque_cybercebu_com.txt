No. Stinson's book is, in fact, more on the theoretical side of
cryptography. A more appropriate book for developers (I assume
you are a programmer) is Bruce Schneier's book, Applied
Cryptography, 2nd edition. In it, you'll find code snippets
written in C, as well as source for some symmetric key
algorithms (both secure and non-secure).

@_subject: New optimized AES code 
Hello all,
Just downloaded gpg 1.0.5. I am particularly interested
in the AES and this is the main reason why I downloaded
gpg. Anyway, I noticed that gpg uses the first optimized
version of the AES. There is the latest optimized version
of AES on the website of one of its authors:
Any chance of using this version instead in the next
release of gpg?
Best regards,

I just did some checks on the AES version that gpg uses, and the
newer versions of the AES. gpg uses version 2.3 of AES which
contains a bug. On version 2.4, the code implementors of AES said:
Version 3 of AES is now out.
Also, could the developers add Serpent?
