@_subject: newpg won't compile (RANT!) 
I can't seem to get "newpg" to compile for me because it can't find libgcrypt-config, despite the fact that it's in the same bloody directory as I'm trying to freakin' compile newpg!
This is driving me bug-nuts because I can't use PGP/GPG in KMail w/o using a plugin now, and the freakin' plugins aren't available as "drop-in" packages, and I can't compile the stupid plugins because they refuse to recognize that pre-requisite programs are installed!
Why the bloody hell can't someone fix this stupid thing!?!? I'm sure I'm not the first person who can't compile newpg!
I apologize, but I've tried installing libgcrypt from a pre-compiled package and when that didn't work, I built a package from the tarball (using "checkinstall") and when THAT didn't work, I copied the libgcrypt-config to my /usr/local directory and when THAT didn't work, I copied the libgcrypt-config to the directory where I was TRYING to build newpg!
Now, will SOMEONE please tell me how to fix this broken package? I'm not exactly your average bozo who just picked up a RedHat CD and installed it! I've been running linux for about 3-4 years now and been building packages for about half that long and long since learned to install from a tarball, but this is ridiculous!
I'm trying to build "newpg-0.9.4" and I have "libgcrypt-1.1.12" installed and "libksba-0.4.7-1" installed. Newpg is the next step according to the "how-to" instructions from KDE on getting encryption working and I can't build the bloody package if it refuses to find the prerequisites!
As I have mentioned before, this is a RH9.0 system. I upgraded from RH 8.0 and have upgraded ALL the KDE packages and everything even remotely related!
Thanks for your time and assistance and my apologies for the rant, but I have to get this off my chest!

Werner, please re-read the section where I said I've been using linux for over 4 years now and building packages, etc for most of that. I *think* I know how to install a file. Granted, I prefer to use RPMs so that I can uninstall/upgrade, so I am using "checkinstall" to build / install, but I *am* doing it as root.
Werner, again, I really think there's something else going on here, as I *am* building these packages as root, and "/usr/local/bin" is in my path AND I've manually run "ldconfig" about a dozen times since trying to build the freakin' package.... could you PLEASE try to be a bit more helpful???

[snip my aggravation]
Thanks for your help. I apologize. I was working hard on not expressing my frustration too openly. :-)
I finally gave up and just installed libcrypt from the tarball and skipped the whole blasted RPM for that one. Checkinstall seems to work for just about everything else... Oh, btw, I *did* manually run the install since I FUBARed the command-line options for Checkinstall to auto-install. :-) And I ran "ldconfig" about a dozen times... :-)
In any event, I'm past that stage and got NewPG to compile and install a couple days ago, but I've been on vacation and away from my computer for a couple days, so I don't recall exactly where I am in the process.. I will say this... it's a LOT more complicated these days to just GPG sign a message than the "good old days" where you just created a GPG signature and told KMail which signature to use... *sigh*

@_subject: Invalid passphrase 
I *know* what I set the passphrase to on my PGP keys, but after upgrading to the "new and improved" GPG-Plugin, I can no longer use my GPG keys. It keeps telling me that I don't have a passphrase entered and automatically tries to send encrypted/signed emails, EVEN T HOUGH I DO NOT HAVE "AUTO-SIGN" ENABLED!
What the heck is the problem here, people? I manually compiled everything from the tarballs using the command-line options specified on the KMail site and have got the Daemon running, so why does it 1) refuse to recognize my passphrase and 2) always assume I want to sign and/or encrypt my emails when I have it set to NOT sign/encrypt by default?
This is being cross-posted to the gnupg-users and the kmail list because I'm not sure where the problem lies. It *was* working up until I used the new "plugin" scheme, at which point I was able to add a key for a new email address, but I can no longer use my valid passphrase for my other keys.
This is getting REALLY aggravating REALLY quickly and I'd really appreciate some help on this!

Yeah... I know. I'm having NO end of problems with encryption/signature. I'=
not sure which list I sent this to, so I'll send it to all the lists and=20

Please ignore the part about configuring it not to encrypt / sign by=20
Thanks. Will do.
No. Obviously it's trying to use an old key that I no longer have the=20

longer use that key... I have several other keys.
Hmm... are there RPMs available for 1.5.2? I haven't seen them anywhere...
Nope. Never got asked unless I specified the internal GPG handling in which=
case I got "invalid passphrase" errors.
Hmm....Ok. And what configurations would those be? Please keep in mind that=
I've not been following this topic since you guys decided to move GPG suppo=
out of KMail itself and into a plugin.
        Thanks...

No, I can't, I don't think. Because for some strange reason, it refuses to=
recongize my passphrase that way. The other way, it says "no passphrase" ev=
though I disabled caching the passphrase for signing.
BTW, I did discovered where I had auto-sign enabled and disabled it there..=
but it's really not working any more.... I had a suggestion from Ingo Klock=
to add "ignore-cache-for-signing" to my .gnupg/gpg-agent.conf file. I did=20
that and it's still not working... I've emailed Ingo and he's not replied=20
yet... Dunno. He seemed to think this was not the proper forum for this=20

Good luck! I'd like to know how you got it working since I can't get my signatures to work. I keep getting a "bad passphrase" and it NEVER asks me to verify which key I want to use! :-(
