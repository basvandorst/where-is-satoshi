RIPE objects can have multiple maintainers. Add a MNTNER object for
yourself, authenticating with your own key. Create any other objects you
need, and a MNTNER object for the other person, adding their public key.
Add mnt-by field for the other person to the objects you created. You
or the other maintainer should be able to then remove you as a
maintainer of these objects.
MNTNER objects can also have multiple authentication methods. You can,
for example, use both a PGP key and a password. I assume you can add
multiple PGP keys.

Various RFCs require the postmaster address, but following RFCs in this respect, since it has little impact on interoperability, is effectively voluntary. RFC 2142 gives other common and not really required mailboxes.

The password manager should clear or overwrite the clipboard after a short time, which should help. Keepass includes "timed clipboard clearing" in its feature list. Of course, there is still the question of whether it does (or can*) do it securely.
(*It's possible to clear the X clipboard, but I'm not sure if it remains in memory)

@_subject: Pros and cons of PGP/MIME for outgoing e-mail? 
I do find it a little bit ironic that I am also using Kaiten Mail (a derivative of K-9 Mail) for Android to send these very emails, but have user interface troubles even just to send with a different alias. Never mind that I have stopped generally signing emails because I kept my primary key offline and APG did not handle the sub-keys. Oh well.
