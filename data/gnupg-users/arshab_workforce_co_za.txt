Hi, i have been trying to run a script which encrypts and transfers files
between 2 branches, i am using gpg for encryption, i have written a bash
script and the script is working perfectly fine, but when i run it off a
cron it doesnt want to work. i have written a small bash script for testing to run off cron, gpg --output /backup/cronsuccess.gpg --recipient greg --encrypt
The cron tab looks like this
# run-parts
01 * * * * root run-parts /etc/cron.hourly
02 4 * * * root run-parts /etc/cron.daily
22 4 * * 0 root run-parts /etc/cron.weekly
42 4 1 * * root run-parts /etc/cron.monthly
30 * * * * root /backup/encrypt.sh > /tmp/ab.log
Thr log file /tmp/ab.log is created after the cron executes but it is an
empty file. executed and the encryption doesnot take place. I am using Rehat9 and i am runnig the cron as root,
i dont know what else to do to run this script, please can anyone tell
me how to get gpg running from cron
i have been batteling with this for days....
If it is not possible to run it off a cron is there some other possible
way to get this done. Thanks in advance
