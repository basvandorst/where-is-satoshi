I have a strange problem in my Mingw32 (GCC 3.4.2) build of GnuPG
v1.3.90. An 'updpref' command not function. The programm crashes.
GnuPG v1.3.6 build was OK.
Hope for your help.

I commented line 1750 in g10/keyedit.c:
 //show_prefs(temp,NULL,1))
and crash disappeared.
Why NULL? There is access to variable 'selfsig' (second param in
show_prefs) in this function (line 1974 of keyedit.c):
pref_ks=parse_sig_subpkt(selfsig->hashed, SIGSUBPKT_PREF_KS,&pref_ks_len);
                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
