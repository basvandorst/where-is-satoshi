that's what i do.  i also use mutt and its folder hooks switch my key
depending on which mail folder i'm sending mail from.

on linux there's gitwipe.
hm, dunno.  it would be nice to have some gpg utilities for querying keys,
signed data and encrypted data (with or without keys) that one could
easily use in scripts.
no, but i've used cfs in the past - crypto fs.  don't have a link handy,
but visit freshmeat.

i sent the following to a friend and am trying to see if i understand
it correctly:
so the more recipients there are, the bigger the message - but only for
multiple keyblocks.

@_subject: gpg question... 
i've been hunting on google looking for information on split or shared
keys.  i'm not sure of the terminology.
let's say you have a group of people that will have public key encrypted
files sent to them.  at any point you want to make sure that any *two* of
the people in that group can unlock a private key to decrypt those files.
so if bob, alice, charles and dorothy are to receive a file, all it
would take to decrypt it is bob and alice; alice and charles; charles
and dorothy; and so on.  any two could decrypt it.
now if i relax the requirement a bit and say that any one person in that
group can decrypt, then the following three solutions apply:
    1) the sender encrypts with all the public keys of the recipients.
       this is not as inefficent as it sounds, however it will *only*
       work for the situation where a single person can do the decrypt.
    2) a shared key.  simple for the sender, however it can only work if
       either one person can decrypt or every person is required to
       decrypt.
    3) a split key.  a key pair is generated and then the private key
       is split into several parts.  depending on how it was configured
       at the time of the split, a certain number of pieces are required
       to have a full key.  pgp supports this (or at least i seem to
       recall reading about it - but i think it was only for windows
       and only in the professional version).  does gpg?
obviously  is the one i'm interested in because it combines the ease
of use for the sender for number 2, and a level of security beyond (which is again beyond
