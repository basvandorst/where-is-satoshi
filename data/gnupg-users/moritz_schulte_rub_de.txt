@_subject: Poldi and kdesu 
I cannot really see right now, what's wrong in respect to kdesu. But it
needs to be debugged of course.
Please add to your poldi.conf file something like:
  # Specify the log file:
  log-file /home/moritz/logs/poldi.txt
  # Enable debugging messages
  debug
And send me (private mail) the relevant debugging messages. (Note that
poldi.conf is not a per-user configuration file stored beneath ~/.gnupg
but a system configuration file stored wherever your SYSCONFDIR is
located (e.g. /usr/local/etc/poldi/poldi.conf...)).
Furthermore you could do the same for scdaemon/gpg-agent:
In my ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf and in my ~/.gnupg/scdaemon.conf I have:
  verbose
  debug-all
  log-file /home/moritz/logs/gpg-agent # or .../logs/scdaemon
Make sure that the logs do not contain any sensible information. e.g.
the PIN in scdaemon logs (i think that can happen...).
