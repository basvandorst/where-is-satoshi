I now it's an old subject, but has anyone found anything out about getting gnupg working with kmail?
I've been looking around, and things don't look promising...
Kind regards

@_subject: GPG PGP S/Mime vulnerability 
I've read through Don Davis' whitepaper about the disadvanteges of the=20=
current sign (and encrypt) features in all common standards to do so.
His basic reasoning (and I've tried it, it works!) is:
I send a signed message to someone stating "you're fired".  He gets=20
angry and decides to get even with another collegue...
Using SMPT he puts my address in the from header, then pastes the=20
entire source of my signed message to him in the body (including the=20=
signatures), and sends it of to someone else...
That last person opens a message, which he thinks comes from me, and=20=
trusts the contents because the signature is verified!
More info is over here:
Kind regards

I agree to all of your comments on this, it is true that a
'real' signatures offers no better security.
But, at least in my country, the governement wants to make
digital signatures legally binding.
In my country (Belgium b.t.w.), they would probably go for
S/Mime...  According to them, you should be able to sign orders,
cheques and every other thinkable transaction using such a
signature.  These signatures would be legally BETTER than your
written one!
I know the example 'you're fired' was very badly chosen.  But
let's say you order something by e-mail, and someone, just to
bug you, resends your order (with a valid signature), would mean
that you have two legally binding orders outstanding... instead
of the one you wanted...
I know, he/she can't really gain from it, but people seem to be
intend on using new technologies (like e-mail), just to harm
Who hasn't been hasseled yet by anonymous e-mails, using the
lack of authentication in mail sending protocols?
I personally was bugged by racists for about a year through high
school because my girlfriend in those days was Turkish (we're
married now).
What I'm afraid of is that, with the current implementation,
digital signing will go the same way as so many other protocols...
That's just my two cents...
Kind regards

Under ideal surcomstances, yes it should.
But I've already placed orders (without signatures) in the past
via free-form e-mails.  In my case, I ordered a computer.
I think that, if they make signed messages legally binding,
someone could take this signed message and resend it to another
store...  I could secure myself against this by including things
like the company name in the message, but as I forgot to do so
in the past, a lot of users will to...

Again, you are right about that, but the currently proposed
legistation would put responsability with the customer.
The point is, that if the signatures would incorporate the
message-headers, they would provide better security...

@_subject: Embedded signatures 
Is it possible to sign files embedded?
e.g. sign a pdf document (signature in the pdf file), and distribute it to people
with and without pgp, so that they both can read it.
If the document ever popped up somewhere, it would have to be verifyable...
