@_subject: Seeking officers for Free-software-friendly Certification 
You're not the only one concerned; there's a lot of ISPs very concerned
that we're about to lose our only "second option" for certificate signing.
Adam McKenna  is trying to pull together people and
resources to start a reasonably-priced or zero-cost, to the end-user, CA.
The project has been initially dubbed "freecert" (ala freecert.org, no
webpage as yet), and they have a discussion mailing list (a blank email to
freecert-subscribe will subscribe you).
Perhaps your goals might coincide well? I don't suspect these are the only
two initiatives resulting from the (not-yet-SEC-approved) merger, and it
would be nice to not duplicate effort all over the place...
(I don't represent any of them, I'm just an observer who happened to
notice Adam's posting on the inet-access mailing list.)

@_subject: Req: Compiling GPG under Windows NT 
Take a peek at:
        That should give you everything you need to build natively on Win32.
Alternatively, cross-compile on a non-windows platform with gcc/egcs.

@_subject: rsa incorporation in gnupg 
As I was doing this the other day, it occurred to me that it would be nice
to have a "global" options file that is parsed for everyone. For example,
parse a /usr/local/lib/gnupg/option first, and the suppliment it with a a
user's individual settings, perhaps with a command-line option to avoid
parsing the global file for paranoid users.
