I noticed similar problem to a thread a couple of weeks ago compiling
the rsa/idea extensions on NetBSD. (-current, ELF based)
After patches, gnupg-1.0.0 installs and works fine, the rsa and idea
modules compile correctly with the switches suggested in the
documentation but when gpg is run I get the following error message:
gpg: /usr/home/jyoung/.gnupg/rsa: error loading extension:
type = 7, symnum = 20)
similar errors for idea: PLT symbol "g10_log_fatal" (reloc type = 7,
symnum = 6)
The builds use the same gcc, and the options exactly as specified at:
Has anyone else seen this problem? Any leads appreciated.
