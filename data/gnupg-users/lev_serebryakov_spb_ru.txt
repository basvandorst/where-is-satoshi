@_subject: Synchronize UID lists on public and private key -- how? 
Hello, Gnupg-users.
 I have 2 systems, where I use gpg, lets name them A and B. I did this sequence of commands:
(1, on A) generate key pair
(2, on A) add 2 more UIDs to key pair (3 in total)
(3, on A) send public key to public server
(4, on A) copy private keyring to USB stick
(5, on B) copy private keyring from USB stick
(6, on B) get public part from public server
(7, on B) add 2 more UIDs to key pair (5 in total)
(8, on B) (re)send public key to public server
(9, on A) refresh public key from public server
 Now on (A) I have key pair where UID lists are different for public and
private keys! Public key has 5 UIDs and private key has 3 UIDs! And I cannot
sign message from my "new" UID on computer A!
 Is it possible to synchronize UID list without transferring "new" version
of private key from B to A by external means?

 As far as I know, NSA is biggest employer of mathematicians in the world. I
don't know about physics and quantum computing, but they CAN invent
something, that depends on number theory.
