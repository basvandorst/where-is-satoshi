The gpg manpage says:
--keyring file
       Add file to the current list of keyrings. (...)
       If the intent is  to use the specified keyring alone, use --keyring        along with --no-default-keyring.

I guess --ask-sig-expire and --default-sig-expire is what you probably
want to use, which you can define in your config, too.

Sorry, I obviously missed the keyword 'data' in 'data signature' when I
looked through the manpage.  So dkg was right with --ask-cert-expire,
which prompts for an expiration date of the signature you're going to

I think it's the Horowitz Keyserver Protocol (hkp) which typically
uses port 11371 (see [1]).

Looks to me like the only difference between both models is in their
certifications.  Maybe you want to take a look at the product page[1],
where the following information is given in the models listing:
G83-6744LUAGB-2 -> EMV 2000 Level 1
G83-6744LUZGB-2 -> EMV 2000 Level 1, Common Criteria EAL 3+
