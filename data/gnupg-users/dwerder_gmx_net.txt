@_subject: gnupg API access 
Hash: SHA1
For developers who wish to use gnupg in their project, the website says
that they should use gpg made easy.
But it also states that gpg made easy is not yet stable..
My question is: How can I then access the API used by the gnupg command
line utility and where can I find infromation about this?
Probably I just missed this, please point me into the right direction!
btw: the enigma project for mozilla mail seems to use the command line
utility directly, the console contains the output of it. But that cant
be the preferred way, is it? What do they do with localized versions of
Thank you!

since youre running win 2000 you probably want to take a look at a graphical frontend for gpg, for example  for myself i enjoy this very much, together with enigmail for mozilla messenger :)

@_subject: gnupg and the windows command line 
I wonder how you tell the gpg command line tool on windows that you have  finished typing and that it should start encrypting, Ctrl-D as EOF doesn't  work, it just prints "^D"..
thank you!

@_subject: Adding a receiver 
I've encrypted a large file and sent it over the internet.
After that I realized that it is encrypted with the wrong public key.
As far as I understand public key encryption it should be possible to  reencrypt only the random session key for the symmetric cipher with the  other public key of the receiver so that I don't have to retransmit the  whole file.
Is something like that possible with gpg?
thanks and bye!
