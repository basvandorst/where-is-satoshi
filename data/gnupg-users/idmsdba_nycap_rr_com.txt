It isn't for the greater good if the onus to please the few (or
the one) is placed on the many. An example of doing the right thing for the greater good would
be for you to use a standard sig delimiter (newline dash dash
space newline).

@_subject: Why the software is crap 
It was starting to look like Usenet in here. On a group that I
frequent we (TINW - There Is No We) had a nearly three year
campaign by a troll end recently. His technique was to ask for
help on multiple problems and then claim that the solutions
offered didn't work on Linux, but weren't even needed on Windows.

@_subject: How Crissy Lynn can unsubscribe 
You have been asking how to unsubscribe and many participants on
this mailing list have answered you. However, the theory has
been proposed that you are not reading the list and have missed
the many responses containing instructions.
So I will tell you to look at the headers for any e-mail sent by
the list. You will find the following header
I am sending this to the list as well Crissy Lynn in the hopes
that this tempest can break free of its teapot.

It makes quite a bit of sense when you are dragged into a thread
that has gone on for a while.
You do if you must figure out what the problem is that the wrong
people have been discussing for a week.

@_subject: Terminology - certificate or key ? 
I think that was my cue.
I thought what might be meant is what I have always referred to as a
slam lock. That is, a locking mechanism that stays locked after opening
from the inside and locks itself after closing from the outside.
It is an easy way to lock yourself out of your car with the engine
running if you just had the door replaced and the new one has a slam
lock while the old one didn't.

If you look at the headers of every message, including your own, you
will find the following header.
List-Unsubscribe: ,
Use either the webpage or mailto URL to unsubscribe. If you never look
back here for the answer to your question you'll have to try a

@_subject: Don't send encrypted messages to random users 
listo factor via Gnupg-users  writes, and having
writ moves on:
Would you find it acceptable for someone to randomly call you and ask
your opinion on a topic of their choosing just because your phone
number happens to be on a public directory that person happened upon?
The reason, not only possible, but likely, would be to let someone with
a reason to send message to that e-mail have the necessary data to
encrypt it and keep it as private as is needed.

I think you are responding to your own view of the world here and not
to the tread or anything pertaining to GNUPG. I for one would appreciate it if such vitriol as this is left in a more
appropriate venue than this mailing list.
Choosing such a venue is left as an exercise for the reader.
