Hi folks,
First off, I'm new to the list, so if I violate any etiquette, feel free to educate me.
Second, a couple of quick questions before I get to the heart of the matter:
1) is there any general place to go look for help with debugging issues other than Chapter 10 of the manual?
2) is there a way to search the mail archives? ( say to go to but the latter is down, at least ATM ? not sure if that's temporary or permanent (and if the latter, we should probably update the former link)).
Now, to the heart of the matter:
I've been using GPG for A Long Time Now (my keys were generated in mid-2000). And I use it daily, but almost exclusively to encrypt and decrypt files. Recently, I've had call to use it for email again, and realized my userIDs all refer to email addresses which haven't been used in 5 or 6 years. So ? I went to add a userID. gpg responds thusly:
gpg> save
gpg: /Users/cwr/.gnupg/pubring.gpg: copy to `/Users/cwr/.gnupg/pubring.gpg.tmp' failed: file read error
gpg: update failed: file read error
(hopefully all of the) relevant details:
cwr$gpg --version

Any suggestions on how to fix this, or how to further debug it would be much appreciated.

Thanks, C! With a search front-end to the archives, I was able to find someone who fixed a similar problem by moving his sec and pub rings to *.old files, and then reimporting. It turns out that worked, sort of. If I export my public key, then import just my pub and private keys creating new keyrings, the problem is solved. However, if I try to import the entire old pubring.gpg, the problem persists and the following happens:
cwr at Hermes$gpg --import pubring.gpg.old gpg: keyring `/Users/cwr/.gnupg/secring.gpg' created
gpg: keyring `/Users/cwr/.gnupg/pubring.gpg' created
gpg(5521) malloc: *** error for object 0x70000: pointer being freed was not allocated
*** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
gpg: Total number processed: 19
gpg:               imported: 19  (RSA: 6)
gpg(5521) malloc: *** error for object 0x70000: pointer being freed was not allocated
*** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
I guess there are some corrupted public key(s)? Like I said, my problem is effectively solved; however, if the above looks like a bug and someone wants to work on it, I'm happy to change the subject line and provide whatever information would be useful.

Ignore that. The above was on a different machine, running 1.4.10. Using 1.4.14, the problem is just plain fixed; no malloc errors and the entire pubring reimports.  Still not sure what cause it to _need_ to be reimported, but all better now.

FWIW, Mac Mail marked this message as spam. Not sure if it universally does that for all inline sigs, but ... FYI.

What are some such ?real? anonymous email services?
