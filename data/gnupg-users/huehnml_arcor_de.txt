Or is it a web site? Google doesn't know about it.

Very nice. I was surprised it wasn't like that before. :-)
With regards to the "key generation on card" issue you recommended trying CVS, which I haven't so far. Is that fix in 1.4.1rc?

I observe the same behaviour. Perhaps I should create keys with a UID of "Werner Koch"? ;-)

@_subject: OpenPGP card and GnuPG with Fedora Core 4 
I've installed FC4 on a "test machine" to see whether everything that
I'd like to have works with FC4.
The smartcard does not, so far. :-(
I have installed the libpcsclite-Package and the cm2020-module-Package
from rpm.livna.org, symlinked /usr/lib/libpcsclite.so.0 to
gpg --card-status and other card-related commands.
and then a backtrace, that I only have on my other computer, not
available here right now. If there's need for it, I can provide it later.
pcscd correctly recognizes insertion and removal of the card (and the
reader, of course).
And if I set $MALLOC_CHECK_ (documented in
to "0", the glibc-line and the backtrace disappear.
Any ideas why pcscd finds my reader, but gnupg does not?

Is there no current man page included or did I just overlook it?
Is a current man page (including "cross-certify" etc.) available somewhere
