Hi folks,
just a quick heads-up for those planning to visit Berlin within the
2nd week of June:
Linuxtag 2010, June 09-12,
Mini Debian Conference 2010, June 10-11,
25th Chemspec Europe, June 09-10,
100th ILA, June 08-13,
In case you'd like to exchange gpg key signatures, the best way would
be to attend the official Linuxtag keysigning party (which was
hijacked by wanna-be data-protection experts this year)
Well, I'm going to attend all listed events. So, additional meetings
to exchange (cross!) gpg key signatures are also possible. Just
contact me by mail until 11:59pm Sunday, June 06 as to these
Take care.

Nope. More to the point, think about people having both private UID
and business UID on the same key - the way you describe it could mix
things up badly.
(I guess you know how to tell people to use a specific subkey)

@_subject: How to verify X.509 signatures? 
For Windows, they explicitly state how to do that.
I'd consult the OpenSSL manual.
If I parse your quest correctly, you are trying to check the sig of a
Windows binary on some debian system.  Why not ask the TrueCrypt head
honchos about putting up that info as well?

@_subject: gpg for anonymous users - Alternative to the web of trust? 
a) you can't
define 'easily' - these days nobody reads/checks anything anymore
(there's some XKCD about this issue)
b) you can try:
Meet with a high-profile person (of your realm/domain) that you
trust and ask that person to both honour your wish to remain
anonymous to the public and to also sign your signing key.
Apart from that, why the hassle? Simply put: Once you marked your
spot with a pseudonym and a corresponding key, it's yours.
But I think the matter you are really concerned about is this:
How can your audience be sure it's you when they in fact don't want
to make any real effort to check up on that fact.  see a)

@_subject: Generating revocation certificate 
you almost had it, just use the fingerprint of the key in question
instead of an email address:
gpg -a --output andre at ockers.eu.asc.revoke --gen-revoke 7CD3FBC8F6005ED5
will create a revocation cert for the key you signed your mail with.

@_subject: Generating revocation certificate 
i'm using on slackware64-current (if you are using windows, all hands
are off)
gpg --version
gpg (GnuPG) 2.2.15
libgcrypt 1.8.4
it looks to me you are lacking access to the secret key - you
need it in order to be able to create a revocation cert. but since
you are able to still sign mails (to this list, e.g.) that key must
be there still. if you run "gpg --list-keys andre at ockers.eu" (with gpg2)
does that fingerprint show up?:
anyhow, if you lost (access to) that key in question, it's too late
to create a revocation cert.  best practice is to deal with that when
deploying a new key.

@_subject: Arch Linux impacted by new defaults in 2.2.17 
It's all about where they look for new/updated keys.  There's folks
out there who use a WKD setup, as you mentioned, then there's some
who use a standalone (isolated, non-peering) SKS keyserver, etc.
I do not think reverting the patch that causes issues for them is a
smart move in the long run. [...]
Welcome to the mess of PKI.
