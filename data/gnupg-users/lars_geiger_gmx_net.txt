Hi Alexander,
First of all, I want to say hello to everybody as I'm new to this list.
Yes, you are using a key *pair* in PGP that wasn't created in PGP. So
PGP assumes that it is not trustworthy. You can do several things:
1) This is what I would do:
   Open the properties of the (GnuPG) key in PGP and activate "Implicit
   trust". That should make the key valid and automatically set its
   "Trust" value to maximum. "Implicit trust" is activated automatically
   for every key pair you generate in PGP, but not for imported keys.
2) Or you could also:
   Sign your (GnuPG created) key with another private key which belongs
   to you and which you trust fully (preferably one that was reated in
   PGP). Again, this will validate your (GnuPG) key and you can
   manually adjust the "Trust" value to whatever you wish.

Hi Alexander,
I thought you also had exported your private key (and imported it into
PGP) because you spoke of:
But you can only encrypt *and* decrypt both ways, if both GnuPG and PGP
contain your key *pair*.
However, if you have only your public key imported into PGP, my second
statement still remains true. In this case, you will need to sign it
with a another key to certify that it is a valid key from the person it
claims to be. After you have done that, PGP accepts this key as valid
and allows modifications to the "Trust" settings. You should perhaps
read the PGP help on the subject "Web of trust" to get a better
understanding of how that whole mechanism of key validation works.

Hi Alexander,
I just wanted to give a hint. BTW, I don't think that PGP's error
message was so unclear. It told you that it couldn't change the trust
settings of invalid keys. It's PGP's standard behaviour to expect a user
to validate a key before it can be trusted. Maybe that's different from
GnuPG but I like the way PGP handles it.

Hi Stefan,
Yes, that's true. If you want to trust a key, you first have to make it
a valid one. Therefore you have to sign it. AFAIK, there's no other way
(at least not with 6.5.8, which was the last PGP I used).

Hi Alexander,
The word "valid" is used in a special context in PGP. Complaining about
an "invalid" key is perfectly clear *if you know what "valid" means for
PGP"*. If you don't, that makes it harder to understand. But that's the
same for other software that uses specific designations for certain
No, it wouldn't have been clearer. Signing keys with your keys is one
way to validate a key. Another is having a key that was signed by
someone you trust. Or by several people you trust marginally.
OK, if you feel so. I got used to PGP's definiton of an invalid key, so
I can accept this as a good description of the error.
                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You gave the answer yourself. How should PGP know where this key comes
from? Couldn't a stranger have compromised your computer? Put a fake key
into your keyring? To prevent this, a new key isn't valid until you (or
someone you trust) confirms that this key belongs in fact to the person
it claims to.
It's a matter of taste. PGP makes it a bit harder to be careless about
unknown keys. That's what I like about it. You don't... OK.
Right, so let's end it on the list. Any further comments off-list,

That's because the signature is encrypted along with the data. So you
have to decrypt first before you can verify. Try
gpg --decrypt "filename" | gpg --verify
Or is there a simpler way for this which I am missing?

Hi Nancy,
It's a Win32 command line executable, which works well in Windows 2000
(and also in Windows XP Pro, BTW).
Not sure which ones you mean. There are some flaws in GnuPG 1.06, but
there are no serious bugs in it. If there were any, there would already
have been an update, believe me.
Yes, using it here for about half a year now. And I can really recommend
it. I'd also recommend a frontend like WinPT, it makes life a little
easier if you are not accustomed to a command line (or a bit lazy
somtimes, like myself, without autocomplete in the shell :-( ).

Hi Pavel,
Well, AFAIK, there will always only be a command line version of GnuPG.
A frontend can be used but it's not necessary, so it's not part of the
core development.
Try  It's still in development, but it's a good frontend
and it's free (*and* you don't have to pay for it).
BTW, perhaps you shouldn't send messages with high priority, it may
scare people away from reading your post.

Hi ChingChe,
Starting with version 0.91, there's also an English version of the
plugin available. If you feel more comfortable with English, that should
be an option for you ;-) You can download it from here:

Hi Fabian,
Wow, that's too much honour... ;-) It's not "my" plugin, in fact I don't
even use it (well, I don't use Outlook ...). I just knew about its
existence and that there was an English version available, so I jumped
Sorry, I can't help you with that. :-(
OK, that may be a general problem of the front-end designers. But why
can't you just use GnuPG directly to import your key first? That should
allow you to use an existing key.
