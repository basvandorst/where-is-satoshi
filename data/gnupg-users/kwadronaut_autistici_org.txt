I noticed that some tools (i.e. Enigmail) don't give you the option to specify a revocation reason. I haven't uploaded my revoked key as of yet, so how should I edit it to specify a reason?

Some suggestions and questions, some are applicable to the paper while others might be more suited for a FAQ section on the website:
* More pictures.
* You're suggesting to 'to allow easy integration with the MUA it may be better to move the contact database into GnuPG proper.' I first read that as duplicating functionality of, for example, existing Directory Servers. Is that correct? If it isn't, maybe that paragraph could be clarified.
* Address the concerns some have about DNSSEC (see Micah Andersons' mail from Fri 28 Oct 2011). Those concerns are mostly valid for TUFC if you don't rely on more traditional mechanisms like the WOT.
* Address the size-concerns some (many?) have about publishing key material in DNS. I know about EDNS0 and TCP, but there's a myriad of firewalls and DNS-servers not being able to properly deal with that. IPv6 deployment is luckily (bit by bit) making more DNS-servers accessible to answers that are >512 bytes, but it's still a challenge. * in the conventions section you're listing GPGME as 'GnuPG Made Easy An application library used to access the feature of GnuPG.' I'd write features, in plural, don't be too modest ;-)
* When suggesting DNS, IPGP records seem to make most sense to me, given the problems a lot of DNS-servers have with size. PKA and IPGP both require some other place to actually store the key. How do you picture solving that? Anyone has other suggestions or feedback on this?
