@_subject: GPG 2.0.8 compilation: ok, execution: error 
I am trying to compile GPG 2.0.8 on my Mac. The
compilation itself seemed to work flawlessly, but
p.ex. upon decrypting a text, I get following error:
MacBook:bin foo$ ./gpg2 --homedir=/Users/foo/.gnupg/
-d /Users/foo/some-encrypted-file.gpg You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: "foo bar "
1024-bit ELG key, ID 01234567, created 1970-01-01
(main key ID 76543210)

such file or directory

gpg: problem with the agent: No pinentry

      "foo bar "
gpg: public key decryption failed: General error
gpg: decryption failed: No secret key
In the compilation process, pinentry has of course
been compiled (with ncurses only). I have installed
(i.e. "--prefix=...") everything in a subdirectory of
my home - don't know if that matters.
Any idea on how to fix the error?
