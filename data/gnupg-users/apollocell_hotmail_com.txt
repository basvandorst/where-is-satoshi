@_subject: forgotten password 
I encrypted several documents using PGP, but have since forgotten the password that I used. I am now using GnuPG (for windows), and I was wondering if there is any program available that I could use to find my password. Brute force is the only method that I can think of, but if you have any suggestion, please email me.
Thank you,
