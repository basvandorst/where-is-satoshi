@_subject: Outlook 2003 problem 
Did anyone ever answer Jon Barlow's question about PGP sending an empty
Outlook message.  I have installed WinPT and the GnuPG-Plugin on two
different machines running XP and Outlook 2003.  I can send from one
without any problems.  I receive the encrypted message on the other
machine and de-encrypt without any problems.  When I try to send back a
message I send a blank message.  The setup looks the same, but I am
verifying one more time.
