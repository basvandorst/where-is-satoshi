@_subject: automating gnupg decryption 
Sean, in Linux you could create a script file (e.g., decrypt_file) that
would do the following:
    gpg --output "$1_`date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S`" --decrypt $1
If you ran the script by specifying at the end the name of file to
decrypt (i.e., "decrypt_file encrypted.gpg"), then it would create a
decrypted file with the date and time appended to it (i.e.,
"encrypted_20051111173001").  I'm sorry I don't know the equivalent
commands in Windows, but if you can find the equivalent then it should
work.  The key, I think, is finding a way to execute the "date" command,
which, in this case, is executed because it is surrounded by backquotes (`).
