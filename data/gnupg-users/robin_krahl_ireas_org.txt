@_subject: Unblocking the user PIN does not work with a new PIN 
according to the documentation [0], the unblock PIN command for a
OpenPGP smart card allows the user to choose a new user PIN.  But on my
smart card, the command fails with the error message ?Error unblocking
the PIN: Conditions of use not satisfied? if I choose a new PIN.  It
succeeds if I enter the current user PIN.  Is this a bug in GnuPG, or is
my smart card not working properly?  Or am I missing something?
I?m using a Nitrokey Storage with a ZeitControl OpenPGP v3.3 smart card.
I attached the transcript of a shell session showing the problem.  For
the first unblock command, I chose a new user PIN.  For the second, I
entered the current user PIN.

Hi Peter,
you are right, that was the problem.  If I choose a longer PIN, it is
working as expected.  Thank you!
