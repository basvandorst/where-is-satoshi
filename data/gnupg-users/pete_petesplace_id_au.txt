I cannot see any other responses [possibly because the Reply-to on your message doesn't seem to be configured correctly??] to this so I'll give it a shot.
It is almost certain that apache is not running as root (and if it *is*, it is a very bad security risk!)
Chances are it will be running as either user "apache", or as "nobody"; you will need to check your httpd.conf file to be sure.  Apache, therefore, calls your cgi script as this user, and your script calls gpg as this user.  gpg then tries to create ~/.gnupg -- and either the user home directory doesn't exist, or (for various security reasons) apache does not have wtrite access to it.
Best bet is to create a .gnupg file somewhere apache can find it, then in your script use "gpg --options /path/to/.gnupg" to specify the correct options file for it to use...
(Additionally I'd investigate that main::passphrase warning if I were you! ;-))

Indeed.  I seem to recall an early install using "nobody" -- but maybe I'm wrong...  And yes, I too assumed a *nix environment from the mention of "root".  In a Windows (NT) environment, Apache runs as a "local system account" -- presumably its own account -- and will not have access to anything specific to another user's account (ie, "My Documents" or whatever) and, depending on LAN configuration, may not have access to network drives.  It can, of course, be configured to login under any account name you

FWIW, every Windows machine I use has cygwin installed upon it fairly swiftly.  It may not quite be "linux", but since it gives me access to a bash prompt and most of the commands you'd expect to use there, it's the next best thing...  ;-)  [Although sometimes you have to be wary of cat doing nasty things to line endings...]

As I understand it -- and I'm no expert -- the blank line is required to separate the header from the encrypted body.  As well as version information, the header may also contain one (or more) comment line(s); without the blank line, the software has no way of knowing where the header ends and the body begins -- although it appears that PGP 8.1 is prepared to make an educated quess...
