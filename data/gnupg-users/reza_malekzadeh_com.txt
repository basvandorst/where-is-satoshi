@_subject: Newbie question - importing PGP keys 
I am sorry if this has already been discussed. I am new to the list.
I have existing PGP keys created with PGP for Windows version 8.0.
I just installed gpg on my Mac OS X. I would like to use the same keys.
How can I import those keys?
Many thanks in advance.
