@_subject: several questions about gnupg 
hi folks,
i use gnupg (v1.06) from within python for a program i code. now i have several questions regarding gpg (i already read the faq and did not find the answers there).
--homedir does not seem to work on my box (linux 2.4.19 pre something). i tried to generate a new keypair with
gpg --gen-key --homedir ~/.gnupg_alternative
the following error occured:
gpg: keyblock resource `/home/testuser/.gnupg_alternative': file open error
gpg: can add keyblock file Key generation failed: file create error
gpg: can't create `/home/testuser/.gnupg_alternative/random_seed': No such file or error occurs if i do the same for root)
among others i use --recv-keys to automatically retreive missing public keys from a public key server.
this feature does not seem to work reliably as the fetching often is there an undocumented command line option to set a timeout for this (e.g. stop automatic fetching after 30s if it does not succeed)? is there any timeout at all? and is there an option to make gpg retry it for a specified number of times if it fails? can you recommend a reliable keyserver (currently i use gpg returns an exit code of 0 if verification "succeeds" no matter of the key trust (e.g. even if the trust is "unknown") etc. thus i parse the output of "--status-fd 1" to see whether the signature is really valid, whether the public key is trusted and not expired or revoked etc.
i have read the DETAILS documentation, but some flag explanations seem to be missing. is there a complete list of all flags somewhere? and i do not know which flag is necessary/sufficient for what state (is there any formal documentation regarding this?). basically i want to check for valid && not expired signatures which were signed by trusted && not expired && not revoked keys, and reject everything else. what combination of flags is necessary/sufficient (in a mathematical sense) for this? currently i use a long if-chain which only accepts the signatures that
have (GOODSIG && a sufficient TRUST_*) && do not have (EXPSIG || EXPKEYSIG || NODATA || UNEXPECTED || SIGEXPIRED || KEYEXPIRED || KEYREVOKED || RSA_OR_IDEA || NO_SECKEY || BADSIG || ERRSIG || this seems to be a safe (estimated, as i have not found any formal information about this) but not efficient solution. which flags would do it? can i safely omit checks for not existing NODATA, UNEXPECTED, RSA_OR_IDEA, NO_SECKEY, BADSIG, ERRSIG, NO_PUBKEY flags?
what really happens when a signature is made with --throw-keyid? i tested this and somehow the keyid seems to be still embedded in the signature.
what steps are needed to make a public key fully trusted? currently, i "--lsign-key" it. is this sufficient or do i need "--edit-key name trust" to set an appropriate trust level too? can a public key made fully trusted just with "--edit-key name as i use gpg from within a python program i would like to skip all interactive dialogs when i "--edit-key" except for the indispensable password prompts. for other questions i would like to set the answers from within the python program. thus is there something between "--batch" (no interaction at all) and fully interactive dialogs? how could i implement something like this?
how does gnupg recognize revoked keys? does it check a public key server for revocation certificates or how does this work?
is there an irc channel of gnupg developers/users?
i hope you can answer these questions, thanks!

thanks, leigh.
nevertheless only one question has been answered so far. what about the others? as i said, i did not find any answer neither in the faq nor the docs nor the mailinglist archive, thus i think these questions are interesting to be answered for other gpg users too.
for a starter, i try to answer some of the remaining questions by myself (correct me, if i am wrong)
no, there isn't. gnupg developers use telepathy instead.
the revocation feature is a joke, man. besides this, rtfm.
no, there isn't. it was hard to program, it should be hard to just do it. btw. rtfm of ...and the rest is for you:

hi werner,
well, i think irc/jabber is nice for that purpose. but there are other ways of course..
oic. my fault.
thanks for your answers, regards
