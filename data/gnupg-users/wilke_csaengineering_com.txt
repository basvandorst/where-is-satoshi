@_subject: Problem using open PGP and enigmail 
I just upgraded to Thunderbird email version 1.5 RC1.  I also upgraded
my enigmail.  Now, when I try to send and encrypted email, I get the error:
"gpg:  can't handle text lines longer than 19995 characters"
How do I fix this?  I don't use command line gpg, but rather enigmail
extension to thunderbird for this.  Thanks.
