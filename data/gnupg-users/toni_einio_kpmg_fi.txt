@_subject: encrypt timestamp file 
============================== START ==============================
I like to automate encryption but what parameters I need to use for file which name is changing?
Here is my command:   gpg -sear xxxxxxxx--homedir e:\gnu\keys  --batch --default-key privateKey at xxxx.fi --passphrase xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx "E:\Inetpub\wwwroot\usrImport_timestamp.csv"
So there is timestamp on usrImport.csv file.
