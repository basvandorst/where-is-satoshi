I agree. With my PGP contacts I learned, that some can't handle
PGP/MIME mails. The experience is, that the Addon Mailvelope (Firefox,
Chrome) can't handle at all mails with attachment in PGP/MIME format.
Also the Client K9 for smartphones.
A compromise would be to set up per-recipient-rules in Enigmail to
send inline mails to these contacts.
Best regards
