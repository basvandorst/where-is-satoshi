According to that page, it supports 3072 bit keys (which I
 understand is perhaps overkill).
        I just bought one :-)
        I have a 4096 bit RSA key -- can I create 2048 or 3072 bit
 subkeys and only copy these keys to the card? Or will the fact that the
 primary key is 4096 bits stymie the operation?

I can report that 2048 bit RSA subkeys can be generated on the
 machine, transferred to the version 2 card, and they work.
        However, working with gnupg2 from Thursday VCS, 3072 bit keys
 can be created, transferred to the card, and may encrypt files, but
 decrypting the file failed with a cryptic "card error".
        I am now happy with my 2048 bit keys :-)
