@_subject: More secure than smartcard or cryptostick against remote attacks? 
Are there any external gpg signing devices to make gpg more resistant
against remote control viruses?
Smartcard or cryptostick will not help in my situation.
When I write a mail on my linux machine I suppose it could get compromised
one day. It obviously needs an an online connection, a web browser or mail
client. A zero day or other tricky attack could still defeat it.
I understand while the crypto device is not attached and no pin entered no
one can forge my signature.
But when I send a mail I wrote the the crypto device a virus could make my
screen lie to me and sign and send a malicious message somewhere else.
Against this case I want to defend.
Some bank offer something similar to a smartcard or cryptostick.
USB Shield ? best choice of Personal Internet Banking security or ICBC
e-Password Device.
The strong part about these devices is that you can check your transaction
before authorizing it.
Are there any devices or systems I could use to verify my mail on a
trusted device with small attack surface before I sign it?

I could air gap my private key. Put it on a machine with no network
access. Then replying to mails becomes awful?
This requires transferring incoming mail onto a usb device as text file
and put it into the other machine. Write an answer, sign and put it back
on usb an
finally put it back on the machine with internet.
More paranoids could say that the offline machine could get infected by
the usb.
To be more paranoid I could not put anything form the online machine to
the offline machine. Answer without quoting and only store on usb. Never
import to offline machine should be quite secure?

No. It does not give certainty what am I actually signing. The virus could
replace the text send to the device.

Thanks. Will consider.
I prefer to stop possibility to sign a single malicious mail. Is there any
more secure way?

I have no reason to believe my system is compromised. Taking security very
serious. Otherwise I wouldn't bother posting here. :)
That sounds like a oxymoron. How can I be REALLY sure my system isn't
compromised? Mail clients and browsers are major attack surface and a
device exposed to internet can not be as secure as a small single purposed
I think if designed right it works. This implies the compromised machine
can not attack the text reading and gpg signing device.

Exactly what I wanted to ask and what I think. Couldn't write better. Thanks!

@_subject: migrate to offline gpg master key 
At the moment my gpg master key is still stored on the machine I use to go
online. I decided to change that. The gpg master key should only be stored
on a separate offline machine.
What's the best path for migration?
I thought gpg is complicated but offline key makes my head burn. Any good

@_subject: how to use invald e-mail? 
When key is created gpg asks for e-mail address and it must be in proper
format email at domain.
I saw keys without valid email already.
How to do it?

@_subject: How to turn off gpg: key <keyid>: not protected - skipped 
I have no pass phrase on my key because I encrypt my whole disk.
But then I can't export my key.
gpg --export-secret-subkeys --armor
gpg: key : not protected - skipped
gpg: WARNING: nothing exported
Is there a option to turn this off?
