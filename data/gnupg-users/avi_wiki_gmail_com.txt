Far be it from me to argue with Rob, who likely has forgotten
more about cryptography than I will ever learn, let alone know
now, but while signing messages cannot prove that an unsigned
message is false, it can prove that signed messages are true.
For example, given the possibility of a piece of an e-mail being
quoted out of context, signing my messages allows me to
demonstrate the totality of what I did write at the time I wrote
it, so I have a recourse to show the entire post and its
context. The same would apply for text documents, etc.

Yes, Robert, that is possible. However, IIRC, signatures come with a
time stamp. In the case I am envisioning, the quotER is taking it from
somwhere, and the quotEE can show the prior, complete post.
Yes, this does not prevent someone from pre-creating two different
messages, but someone resorting to that level of duplicity is both
uncommon and will likely have other prevaricatory methods as well.

Here is one immediate issue. It seems that I cannot install
GnuPGShell at all, as my GnuPG is 1.4.12, and GnuPGShell does
not seem to recognize it. I guess I can install GPG4win on my
home computer and see if that works.
Perhaps I am an exception, but I use GnuPG most often when
composing webmail. Which means I type the email in a browser
window or in a text file, copy the text to memory, perform the
signatures/encryption on the clipboard, and paste the results
into the browser window. On the other hand, being somewhat
geeky, I want the ability to do most anything that the command
line can do when needed. When I started looking at GUIs, the
options for Windows were GPGShell, WinPT, and GPA. Here are some
things I like about GPGShell which were either lacking, or less
robust in the others.
  1) It has a bundled program, Copy2USB, which can take an
existing GnuPG install and copy the needed files and settings to
a USB stick, making for a portable installation.
  2) It has a tray program, GPGTray, from which I can launch the
key manager, encrypt/decrypt/sign/import the clipboard, launch a
app that allows me to drag files onto a taskbar to
  3) It has many options for key management "right clickable" in
the key management GUI (sign, lsign, clean, minimize, check UID,
update from keyserver, export to clipboard, etc.), yet can
launch the command-line edit allowing for complete control in a
  4) It allows for a central place to update gpg.conf without
having to launch text editors, and while most of the main
options are either checkboxes or radioboxes, there is a free-
form area where any option (such as "expert" or "bzip2-compress-
level") can be added
  5) It does not require registry settings to use (see  which
allows for a truly portable installation
  6) It makes navigating GnuPG's configurations easier (at least
for 1.4.x) so that the program files are easily placed on one
drive and the certificates/keyrings on another without issue.
When I tried WinPT and GPA, none of them had the combination of
robustness, completeness, and ease-of-use that GPGShell
demonstrated, which is why I have stayed with it for the time
being. Perhaps GnuPGShell has all of these properties as well, I
guess I can try GnuPG 2.0.x and see, but until such time as a
portable installation of GnuPG 2.0.x for Windows exists, I'll
likely stay with the working combination of 1.4.12 + GPGShell.

I hope that helps,

In one of the recent, longer, threads, it was my understanding
that Werner said that the 1.4.x branch of GnuPG will not be
updated to have ECC capabilities, and may eventually be "put
into runoff" as it were. Werner, may I request that you confirm
or refute that?
Assuming that is the case, it means those of us using 1.4.x need
to move to 2.x to use ECC. In and of itself that shouldn't be an
issue. What concerns me is that, and perhaps this is due solely
to ignorance, it appears to me that GnuPG 2.0 for Windows cannot
be installed in a solely portable fashion the way that 1.4.12
can. I do not wish to get into the debate about the benefits of
having ones GnuPG installation on a USB stick, keyloggers,
rootkits, and the overall safety of all of the above. If for
whatever reason there are people who wish to have a completely
self-contained Windows installation of GnuPG on a flashdrive
(and not one built-in like crypto drive, which cannot use ECC
now anyway) is there 1) any way that can be done, and if not, 2)
any possibility that someone other than Werner would consider
folding the code into 1.4.x? I am not a programmer by a long
shot, and this would so far out of my league as to be
functionally impossible, so I cannot volunteer to do anything,
unfortunately; merely piggyback off of the expertise of others,
I am afraid.

Thank you; I didn't see this in the manual. I'm loathe to change it
though as that probably affects many programs on the hosting computer,
and may cause many other programs to go a bit haywire.
Speaking for myself, I think I would prefer the latter to the former,
as I would prefer to have a Windows installation that is (as much as
possible) completely divorced from the hosting computer and results in
a GnuPG installation that is as "portable" as possible between trusted
computers. This would mean minimizing or eliminating any reference to
environment variable OR having the launch of the program/GUI setting
them temporarily each time if necessary. Allowing an option to have
the home and other helper directories configured as a subfolder of the
install directory on the install should be helpful as well.  What I
have now with 1.4.x is the ability to plug my stick into any trusted
computer, fire up Truecrypt, mount the encrypted drive, and use a GUI
to sign, encrypt, and decrypt the clipboard or files, manage keys
(including signing, generating revoke certs, etc.) and pretty much
using a GUI to handle most command-line actions of gpg.
Agreed. Having a portable installation would preclude integration with
other programs, so the Outlook and Explorer extensions would not be
installed in such a situation. In my current 1.4.12 install, for
example, I do not have shell integration or plugins to other programs,
which is fine, as who is to say that a program on trusted computer A
is installed on trusted computer B.
Once again, thank you.

@_subject: new release of GPA 
Hash: SHA512
This is an incomplete list, but what I like about GPGShell is
the following:
GPA does not work for me--it just crashes.
GPGShell has a number of components:
GPGTools for encrypting/decrypting files, GPGKeys which is the
keymanager to which GPA is most closely related, and most
importantly, GPGTray which is a tool which sits in the system
tray and allows me to call any of the other programs,
encrypt/decrypt a file or the clipboard, sign/verify the
clipboard, all using right clicks. This allows me to compose my
emails in GMail or the like, and then convert them into ASCII-
armored text.
The actual GPGKeys portion of the program is extremely
customizable, in that it has good graphical access to many, if
not most, of the GPG command set, and for "expert" options, it
allows the launch of the edit key in DOS and has an input box
where one can place the options that should be run in the
command line when GPG launches (such as "bzip2-compress-level
9"). It allows for easier setting of options for GPG as well.
The author has told me that he is not intending at this point to
write a version for GPG2.0, however, so those interested in
using ECC when it gets folded in to the main release will need
to find another "GPG manager" to use.
GPAs inability to run on Win7 machines sort-of takes it out of
the running for now, I'm afraid :)
I understand part of the issue is that the entire configuration
mechanism of GPG2 is different than GPG1, and that, currently,
GPG2 cannot be loaded "portably" as it were, but I believe
Werner was gracious enough to say he would look into making GPG2
more portable in future releases.
I am neither a programmer nor a software tester, so forgive me
if I did not explain clearly enough, but in a nutshell, I have
found that I can easily do anything I need to GPG-wise
(clean/minimize keys, Lsign, encrypt/decrypt/sign/verify, make
any customization to option sets, hash selections, encryption
methods) easily in GPGShell, and I have not found another GUI

One of the things I like about the shell I use is theability to use

bundled GPA does not allow any of those options. Is that intentional
to prevent people from monkeying around (they have to know the command

Also, where are the configuration options controlling the preferred
cipher used when creating keys, the bzip level, etc. adjusted? I'm
seeing that GPA does provide a front-end to gpgconf (at least on
expert mode) but I cannot find those values, whereas in GPG 1.x I
could simply have a gpg.cof file with entries like:
s2k-digest-algo SHA512
s2k-cipher-algo AES
cert-digest-algo SHA512
compress-level 9
bzip2-compress-level 9

Would having the e-mail address and name in the QR code adversely affect
compatibility with monkeysign?
For example, see the attached code which is similar to what I was playing
with for key-signing purposes, although I was going to print them on
mailing labels.

Hash: SHA256
Well, in my layman's understanding, you both may be correct.
Technically, a CA is a trusted third-party; you are a trusted
first party (to abuse terminology). The buck always stops at
you, but when using a CA, you make the (un)conscious decision
that they are trustworthy and that the trust that THEY have is
transitive (you will accept it without question).
On the other hand, the analogy with accountants may or may not
be correct. When using certificates, the desideratum is the
same--to determine the trustworthiness of the second party.
Whether the first party does this actively, or passively through
acceptance of the third party's decision does not really matter.
With the accountant, if the trader keeps the necessary records
and files the necessary forms, then the trader is serving as his
or her own accountant. Otherwise, there is no one acting as an
accountant and the local securities or taxation authorities can
swoop in and levy sanctions.
Semantics aside, Robert is correct that in actuality there is
only one issuer of trust that matters--you. If you are willing to
give Mozilla blanket transitive trust, so be it, but it is still
your decision--conscious or otherwise.

No, Doug, I really don't have an opinion. To do so, I would have had to
given some thought to the relative merits of both sides and crystallized an
opinion. Since SSL certificates do not directly apply to me at this moment,
I have not given it the attention it deserves, and so I cannot in good
faith have a reasoned opinion; so I don't--out of ignorance if you wish. My
point in posting those links was that I remembered seeing this in the past,
and thought it fair to bring to Werner's attention that there was some
controversy, so that he can, if he wishes, research both sides and come to
his own measured opinion.
