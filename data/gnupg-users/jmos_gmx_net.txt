@_subject: Question about mangling of passphrases 
Hello GnuPG Users!
I wonder if it is safe to use GnuPG for symmetric encryption with 256 Bit
The problem I see is as follows:     When someone uses symmetric only encryption GnuPG prompts for a
    This passphrase is then hashed with an algorithm like RIPE-MD160 (whis
is the default)
    into a 160 Bit hash value.
    This 160 Bit hash value (or part of it) is then used as a key for a
symmetric cypher
    like BLOWFISH (whis has a key length of 128 Bit, so I assume the least
    128 Bits of the hash value are being used).
    But what happens if someone uses a cypher with a key length of more than
160 Bit
    (e.g. 256 Bit) ?
    The hash value is too small to be used as the key for those cyphers.
    So how does GnuPG mangle the passphrase to yield a key with e.g. 256 Bit
Does anyone have an answer to that ?

@_subject: Problem with --not-dash-escaped 
Hello All!
Is there a problem with 'gpg --not-dash-escaped --clearsign ...' under
Windows ?
When I sign a message with the above command I don't get any error
messages. But when I check the signature afterwards with
'gpg --verify ...' I always get the message : Invalid signature.
I use GnuPG 1.0.6 under Windows 98. (The binary distribution from
Can anyone help ?
P.S: I didn't send the signed message via email and it didn't contain
       5 dashes at the beginning of a line, so that is not the problem

O.K. Thanks David!
Could this process be used to "emulate" a stronger Hash algorithm
(one with a hash value with more than 160 bit) ?
Let me explain this:
In the GnuPG FAQ section 4.1 one can read the following:
"1024 bit for DSA signatures; even for plain ElGamal signatures this is
sufficient as the size of the hash is probably the weakest link if the key size
is larger than 1024 bits."
So If this process could be used to "emulate" a hash with a greater size it
would not
be anymore the weakest link and it would make sense to use DSA keys with
more than
1024 bit.
I guess this is nonsense but could you please tell why the above process of
multiple hashes to fill in a symmetric key is safe and why it is not safe to
use the
same process to generate a hash with a greater size so that it would make
to use greater key sizes for DSA ?

@_subject: Problem with --not-dash-escaped 
I am signing with a 1024 Bit DSA key, but I can reproduce the error with
all keys.
The error only happens under Windows and only if the last line of the
message I am signing is not empty (i.e. the message does not end with
CR - LF).
When I sign a message that does not end with CR - LF GnuPG adds a
CR - LF pair.
That triggers the bug. When I delete the CR (and not the LF) which was
added by GnuPG the signature becomes valid !
So that seems to be the problem.
