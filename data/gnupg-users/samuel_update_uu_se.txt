gpg --with-fingerprint --verify file
Does not output the fingerprint of the key used to verify the message.
Can someone tell me the reasoning behind this?
the same is true for --import and gpg --with-fingerprint < signed-file
I would expect the fingerprint to be displayed with the other information
on the error stream when I ask for it.

Yes, and is anyone surpriced that M$ Windoze has a weak commandline,
stating it does not make it any better for us that have to work with it.
Not to mention the time for typing the passphrase a zillion times if doing
symetric encryption...
(unless gpg resets the filedescriptor when using --passphrase-fd n)
In the case of a security sensitive application like GnuPG code size is
also an important factor, _all_ functionality add complexity to something
that (idealy) should be possible to verify (not only test).
That probably would be a good idea but it would still add complexity to
the application, and in this case a whole library that is outside of the
trusted applications controll.
Even if (as I think) everything else pointed towards adding this
functionallity the complexity argument aught to keep it out.
Just my thoughts.
A possible way to do recursion from a dos prompt is making a batchfile
something like this:
REM ****************** Example file ****
echo off
REM file: e:\tmp\recursive_diff.bat
for /D %%A in ( %1\* ) do call e:\tmp\recursive_diff.bat %%A %%A
fc %1\* %2\* >> e:\tmp\res.txt 2>> e:\tmp\fel.txt
REM ****************** END Example file ****
Note that most dos environments have no good way of finding where the
executing batchfile is located so that has to be hardcoded.
"fc" is the command that is run on all files.
I used this particular file fo make sure everything had been copied
correctly after moving alot of data from one drive to another.

If I remember the license corectly (I have not checked this) anyone who
makes changes to the original source have to note it in some way in the
source or documentation that the original authors work is modified. I do

I have not used any more reacent version of GnuPG than 1.0.6 but i can not
remember anything about this in the anouncements.
A while ago I had a reason to use GPG for symetric encryption,
specifically I vas going to give it and a passphrase to someone else to
get some files across when I was away. I could not find any way to tell
it not to create the (unneccessary) configuration files before
symetrically encrypting a message.

I hope you are talking about the new version of GnuPG, because v1.0.6
hapily creates files in other directories.
I tried:
gpg --homedir /tmp -c .emacs
gpg --homedir ~/tmp -c .emacs
on Debian Linux
and gpg.exe --homedir e:/musik --symmetric .emacs
on windows 2k
in all cases GnuPG created the pubring.gpg and secring.gpg files in the
specified directories.
I tried assigning a homedir that did not exist and got this result:
samuel gpg --homedir /foo -c .emacs
gpg: keyblock resource `/foo': file open error
gpg: keyblock resource `/foo': file open error
File `.emacs.gpg' exists. Overwrite (y/N)? y
gpg: can't create `/foo/random_seed': No such file or directory
The encrypted file decrypted Ok.

For more information than you prabably want about "dash-escaped" text,
find a copy of RFC 2440 (that defines PGP messages) and search it for "dash".
Googling for "OpenPGP" and "RFC" gives RFC 2440 as the first hit.

I have not looked at your code but the example in the text does not

(You need to double them to get a backslash in a strin literal.)
But that should not give you that kind of error. Have you tried using

And unless things have changed since then you need to look-out for pipes
that block the sending process when they get filled. That was
"interesting" to find, sometimes the program stoped on a
nondeterministic statement...

I do not see this, could you elaborate?
Any password/secret for the ssh connection is of course lost but how
would a localy running script that only have two text streams as
connection to the compromised machine be threatened?
Assuming the signing is done localy and the recieving ssh session only
takes the message and no commands as input from the mail server.
I would worry a little about the possibility of missing a change in the
text shown before signing. Since you wrote the text you "know" what is
writen in it and might not read it carfully enough to catch a change.
If the mail server is compromised such a change is possible.

executable you are using from the command line.
On windows I would try to search for gpg.exe to see if any unexpected

@_subject: re. Moving from PGP to GnuPG and other questions ... 
<< Loads of questions basicly about what is the difference between
Signing and trusting a key >>
I have not been active for a while but if I remember correctly you sign
keys that you have personaly verified belongs to who ever it says it
belongs to, you trust a key owner to verify keys in a good way when
signing them.
That means that any key you have signed is a key you can encrypt to.
To be able to encrypt to a key you have not signed some other key that
you have signed and who's owner you trust to verify keys correctly must
have signed that "unknown" key. Chains of these kinds of verifications
is what builds the Web of Trust.
About verifying keys before using them, there are several reasons to
import keys that you can not be shure has not been modified in
transmission. One reason is to check signatures on a mailing list, who
actuauly is writing is not as interesting as knowing that it is the same
entity all the time. Another could be that you have no way to check it
but think that some of your acquaintances has, then you can import it
and let GnuPG check if that is true, see Web of Trust.
About "Ultimate trust", I think that is GnuPG's way of knowing which
keys you know well enough to start the chains of signing.
Earlier versions did this by assuming that if the program had the secret
key it was secure enough. Using the ultimate trust setting instead allows
(among other things) a user to keep the secret key in a secure place and
still use the public key to start a chain in the web of trust.

You _seem_ to be saying that _you_ have created a key that you encrypt to

The recipient should have created their own key and you should encrypt

When the recipient want to send things to you, your public key is used
for encryption and you use your own private key to decrypt.

owner trust to the keys in the path to the key you want to use.

Please Ingo, _all_ encryption is based on "security-by-obscurity" if an attacker finds the secret key _any_ encryption system is toast.
I can think of some possible scenarios; if an attacker is has automated the attacks, especially with attacks tailored for each known algorithm, then making the message not conform to known algorithms and structure should break the automation. Another could be, how would an attacker tell the difference between a random intercepted file that has been corrupted in transit and one with an additional human decryption step, e.g. during the window between key compromise and revocation. In this case we are dealing with humans that does not necessarily have huge amounts of resources and I'd be impressed by any people communicating that actually had the patience to keep up this kind of scheme, since any communication needs manual intervention.
