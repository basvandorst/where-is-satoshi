@_subject: need help on non-interactive gnuPG binary 
?? I am planning to use gnuPG (v1.4.10) binary in netbsd 5 for encryption. The key generation is supported as interactive session, but I want to use non interactive session. I could not find any binary with non interactive session. Does anyone know where to get such a binary??
