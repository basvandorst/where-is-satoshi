@_subject: Decrypting without files? 
I'm looking for a way to pass everything to GnuPG via pipes:
  * Passphrase
  * Encrypted data
  * Decryption key
And to retrieve the results via pipes, too.
This means that I can't have the decryption (secret) key on a keyring.  It
must come in via a pipe.
Even worst, this must work under WinNT.
Is there a way to make GnuPG do this?  Alternatively, is there a library
or something that will do this?
I noticed something called CTClib being mentioned on this list.  Is that
compatible with GnuPG 1.0.6 encrypted output, and can it be fed keys to
decrypt with (as opposed to fetching keys from a keyring file)?

@_subject: direct access to ciphers? 
How hard is it to use that code independent of GnuPG?  I want to write a
small application to encrypt and/or decrypt using RSA and Blowfish (for
example), but it has to be self-contained and not rely on using the GnuPG
I hear that GnuPG is being split into a library amd a front-end, but that
seems to be some time off...

Could you point to some information that details this countermeasure?
