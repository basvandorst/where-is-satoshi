Hi, I think this is my first post to this list, but I've been a lurker
for a bit.
This campaign looks pretty awesome. I tweeted the video and it's getting
some pickup: I hope you don't mind a bit of feedback.
One way that I think the blog could be improved is by providing
permalinks for the individual posts. I actually wanted to tweet the
"Preparing for launch" post, but the only URL I could tweet is
 so I decided to post the YouTube URL instead.
Looking back through this list archives it appears that this fundraising
campaign actually has a "matching grant", to use non-profit development
language? Each donation is doubled?
If so, that can be a major selling point for getting donations this
"giving season". Each year for 3 years now EFF has had a wildly
successful video game-themed "Power Up Your Donation" campaign that's
based on matching grants, and it's currently going on for the next
couple days: In the video you say that GPG is used by the government, hackers, and
billion dollar companies. I think when promoting GPG it's good to
include in that list activists, journalists, whistleblowers, and
ordinary people that care about privacy. I think you can brag about
widespread use amongst this same set of people:
In fact, organizations like Tactical Technology Collective do GPG
trainings for activists all the time, and Edward Snowden insisted on
Glenn Greenwald using GPG before they wrote any emails of substance. The
use of GPG amongst journalists has blown up in the last 6 months now
that everyone knows they're being spied on.
Finally, if you're raising money to rebuild the website, could you add
HTTPS to your to do list? Using HTTPS, making HTTP redirect to HTTPS,
using the HSTS header, using perfect forward secrecy ciphersuites, and
all those other best practices? I'm well aware of the drawbacks of CAs
and centralized trust, but I don't think that's a very good reason to
not protect privacy of website visitors by default.

Yeah, I was talking about:
Ahh, it's good to know that gnupg.org is available for https. But I
would guess a very small percentage of your visitors use it, or even
know that it's available.
If you want to fix this, you could make all incoming http traffic
respond with a 301 redirect to https.
Looking at my browser, for some reason gnupg.org has set two cookies,
one of which is a uuid that anyone monitoring me can use to track me,
even if I switch internet connections or start using a VPN. Because of
this (and because it's good practice and doesn't hurt) you could also
set the HSTS header, which prevents browser from accidentally (or being
tricked into) loading the website over http:
Also, looks like the CA is CAcert--an awesome CA, but not trusted by
browsers by default. I'd suggest getting a cert from StartSSL
[ since they're they only CA that gives certs for
free. And a wildcard cert (for *.gnupg.org) ends up costing like $60 USD.
Also, it would be great if the use of https could be done better. The
Qualys SSL report gives  an F (because of the CAcert
issue), but even if you used a browser-trusted CA it still wouldn't be
the best: I notice you're using Boa Webserver, and their docs don't seem to show
how to do things like set custom http headers or mess with the
ciphersuites in use. But for other servers (apache, nginx, lighttpd) you
can find security-hardened config examples here:

Oh interesting, I didn't realize there were other CAs that give gratis
certs. I don't think it matters at all what CA is used as long as
browsers trust it, and I only suggested StartSSL because it's less scamy
when it doesn't cost money.
I hope some day one of the decentralized trust solutions takes over CAs.
But on the topic of improving the HTTPS support on gnupg.org, I think
torproject.org is pretty much an ideal example. They serve binaries of
Tor Browser Bundle from  and have been
attacked by governments all over the world, so they've put a lot of time
and energy in doing things right. I'd like to see GPG have just as good
web security.
(And for that matter, why do I have two cookies in my browser that
gnupg.org set? _pk_id.1.9e41 and _pk_ses.1.9e41 -- the id one is a
unique id, which means it can be used to track my movements through that
domain even if I switch IPs.)

The reason is because people often have different websites running on
port 443 than they do on port 80, and people also often have
non-browser-trusted certs.
For a prime example, check these two:
If the browser tried https first, everything would would break, not to
mention if you click through the cert warning you just get a generic
"The page cannot be displayed" error page.
This is why HTTPS Everywhere needs thousands of intricate rulesets to
maximize the number of HTTPS requests, and do things like make cookies
use the secure flag.
I think it would help. There's no reason that security software should
serve anything over port 80 besides 301 redirects to port 443.
The problem is you're wanting to make GnuPG go mainstream but then you
end up with people seeing this:

I actually set up EFF's Piwik. :)
If you're interested, there are a couple ways to make it less privacy
invasive (though just using it instead of a centralized thing like
Google Analytics is great).
You can not include the Piwik code at all just use it to visualize your
server logs, using the script misc/log-analytics/import_logs.py. More
details about this method here:
The other way is to only include the image tracker but not the
javascript tracker. e.g.
You can pass other data to Piwik in this method as well (like page
title) but it doesn't use javascript, so it's less intrusive:

Another argument for doing this.
The centralized public key infrastructure is badly flawed, but if you do
have a cert that's signed by a CA that Firefox and Chromium trust you
get added to the HSTS preload lists for those browsers.
Here's a bit about what HSTS is:
Chromium (and by extension Chrome) ships with a list of websites that
are preloaded with HSTS. Here info about getting in the Chromium list:
 (specifically, email Adam Langley at
agl at chromium.org).
Here's Firefox's feature definition for it's HSTS preload list:
I don't know what the policy is to get on their list, but Firefox
currently ships with it:
So my guess is just open a bug asking for gnupg.org to get added.
As far as I know these preload lists only force HTTPS for these domains.
I wonder if anyone could convince the browser vendors to also do
certificate pinning, bypassing PKI based on CAs altogether?

There's a script called keytrans (with a symblink called pem2openpgp)
that's bundled with the monkeysphere source code might do exactly what
you need.
apt-get source monkeyspherecd monkeysphere-0.36/src/share
./pem2openpgp 'User ID ' < rsa_key
(I haven't tested this exactly.)
