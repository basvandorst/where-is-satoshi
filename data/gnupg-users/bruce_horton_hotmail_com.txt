@_subject: smaller GPG for signature checking only 
Hello All,
I would like to use GPG to create a digital signature
checker for a Linux based embedded system.  Memory and program footprint are premium resources in that environment.
I *ONLY* need to be able to check that a signed file is
valid.  No need for general purpose encryption or signing, etc...
I checked the GPG accompanying documentation, the FAQ, and
did WWW and Usenet searches to no avail.  Does anyone
know how to do this?  Either prebuilt x86 binaries or Makefile
settings would be fine.
Please CC me on any responses as I am not subscribed to the
