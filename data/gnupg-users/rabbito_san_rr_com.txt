@_subject: Multiple keyring support 
I was just looking through the archives because I was interested in
having multiple keyrings.  It seems like a loss of functionality came
about from 1.0.6 to 1.0.7+.  Was this intentional?  Is there another way
    - have default imports and verifies dump the keys in to a default       catch all keyring.
    - be able to override (on the command line) default imports and
      verifies into a specific keyring file.
    - override the keyring to use on the command line.
    - list the contents of the pubring.gpg first when using --list-keys
It seems like 1.0.6 did all of this, but with 1.0.7+ it's not possible
(once you setup the options file as above, you can't get back to the
pubring.gpg file by using the --keyring pubring.gpg on the command
line).  If there is a way to do all of these, please let me know.  Thank
