@_subject: GnuPG present a the French Linux Expo ? 
Hi lads
I was wondering if some of you would be interested in being present on
the next French Linux Expo (called Linux Solutions 2004), to explain
what GnuPG is, how to use it, and all the benefits it can bring on
everyday's living ...
Indeed, I can provide you a small place within the Associations Town
(there are at the current time more than 40 present associations).
This expo will take place on next february, 3rd to 5th :
  So the question : are some people interested in having such a booth ?
French GnuPG users are obviously welcome :o)
Thanks for your attention ...
