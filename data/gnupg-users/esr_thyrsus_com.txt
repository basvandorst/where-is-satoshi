Adam Cripps :
Thanks, I'll try that.  It would still be nice to know why the locking
thing didn't work, though.

David Champion :
I don't know for sure, but it seems not unlikely.
The hack Adam Cripps mentioned to locate the secret key only on the
device using the conf file seems simpler.
Just out of curiosity...could the device be reformatted with mkfs?  If
so, is there any good reason not to make it into a normal ext3 volume?

David Champion :
Is it possible to use USB mass storage as a boot device?  If so, it seems
to me that putting some kind of BusyBox-based microdistribution on it
could serve the same purpose.
