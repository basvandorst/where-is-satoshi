Hi Werner
Do we increase risk (risk of attacks, risk of errors etc ) by using front
ends ?

@_subject: How to verify a detached signature (gpg2: to exclusive) 
Thanks for the response. I did try. But GPG cannot verify this file. I get
the following answer
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: the signature could not be verified.
Please remember that the signature file (.sig or .asc)
should be the first file given on the command line.
Probably one of the following two is happening
1. This signature is NOT GPG compliant
2. Probably this signature is GPG / PGP compliant but GPG is unable to
recognise this as a GPG signature
So back to my original question
1. How do I find out if a signature file _is_ PGP / GPG compliant
1.a. Will changing the extension help ?
