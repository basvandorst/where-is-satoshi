I'm busy working on a package manager for some platform. We want to sign
packages for authentication, and use gpg to do this of course, but we're
worried about US import/export laws regarding strong cryptography.
Is it legal to import/export gpg to the USA? If so, what about commercial

Well, the other thing I've been wondering about is, why is it legal to
export signed messages in the US - Isn't that a violation as well?

What characters is allowed in a GnuPG signature? What I actually want to
know is if I can import a public key into a SQL database as tinytext or a
blob without escaping some characters.
