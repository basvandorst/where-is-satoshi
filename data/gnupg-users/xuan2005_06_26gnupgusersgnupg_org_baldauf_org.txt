@_subject: gpg --symmetric with same passphrases 
is it secure to use for different files, to be encrypted using "gpg --symmetric", the same passphrase? Or does this pose a risk of a cryptographic attack which would not exist if different passphrases were Background: There are multiple notebook computers whose each root filesystem is encrypted using dm-crypt. The partition encryption key is is different for each encrypted filesystem and resides as a file on a different filesystem in encrypted form. It is not feasible to store the different encryption keys in one keyring (in order to avoid multiple files encrypted with the same passphrase), because then, copies of that keyring would have to reside on all notebook computers. It is not feasible to use different passphrases, either.
Thank you,
