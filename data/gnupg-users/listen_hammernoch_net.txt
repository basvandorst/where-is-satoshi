@_subject: RSA key size restriction? 
> Why is the RSA support in GnuPG limited keysizes <= 4096 bits?
I think, one should limit the size to reasonable sizes. It is said, that the computing effort one needs to factorize an RSA-key with 3100 bits is about the same as to break the session key per brute force. AFAIK the amount rises with the square root of the exponent of the bit count. So the amount for a 4096 bit key should be sqrt(2^4096/2^3100) = 8,2e+149 as high... I don't see any reason for larger keys.

@_subject: gnupg 1.2.4 compile error 
I tried to compile gnupg 1.2.4 on MacOS X 10.3.2 and encountered the following error (./configure ran smooth)
What am I doing wrong? Did somebody else encounter and solve this?

thanks, David for assistance...
I tried that, invoking make brings up the next error:
gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I.. -I.. -I../include -I../intl    -g -O2 -Wall -c `test -f 'miscutil.c' || echo './'`miscutil.c

Maybe I use the wrong version of gcc...
I wouldn't matter losing translations, I'm pretty used to english..

This depends on whether you have (and still need access to) material
encrypted to this key.
I would never delete an old key. You never know where you have old
encrypted stuff on old backups you need years afterwards...

Hi everyone,
three weeks ago I experienced strange error messages compiling gpg-1.2.4  > Maybe I use the wrong version of gcc...
This was it. Using gcc 3.3 from the newest Xcode distribution did the job. Thanks for all assistance!

@_subject: Listserver (was: [Announce] GnuPG 1.3.6 released (development)) 
The list server somehow seems to stop every one or two weeks. AFAIK it
sends out all mails after it has been triggered again. Nothing to really
worry,  but its annoying that the discussions are delayed.
