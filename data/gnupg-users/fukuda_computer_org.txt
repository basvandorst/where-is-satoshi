@_subject: Files encrypted on another system 
Hi,
    I created an encrypted file on a Fedora machine, and
    lost the environment except for the encrypted file
    itself. (I remember the pass-phrase, though.)
    I have tried to decrypt the file, but I got
    fukuda at lark:~% gpg --decrypt  Sync/Diary.gpg
    gpg: encrypted with ELG-E key, ID CA21E488
    gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
    Are there any ways to recover the file?     Regards,
