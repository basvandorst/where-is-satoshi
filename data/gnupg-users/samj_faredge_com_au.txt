@_subject: timestamp conflict 
My keys were recently signed and submitted to wwwkeys.pgp.net by a pgp
user. After updating the keys from the server I'm getting errors about
timestamp conflicts (saying my public key is X seconds newer than the
sig). The key ID in question is 0xc6d394f7.
Here's an example:
Command> check
uid  Sam Johnston sig!       C6D394F7 2001-02-01   [self-signature]
gpg: public key is 28238 seconds newer than the signature
sig%       F534AAD7 2001-02-04   [timestamp conflict] uid  Sam Johnston sig!       C6D394F7 2001-02-01   [self-signature]
gpg: public key is 28214 seconds newer than the signature
sig%       F534AAD7 2001-02-04   [timestamp conflict] 2 signatures not checked due to errors
What's going on? I can't find anything in the docs about this.
