@_subject: gpgme passphrase help 
Hello folks,
I am trying to write a GPG plugin for Geany, using GPGME. So far, i got the encryption working, but, when the user does not select any recipients, i want the plugin to use a symmetric cipher. The problem is that i can't seem to figure out how to get the passphrase callback working (safely). From the GPGME manual I understood that it
would be better to make use of gpg-agent instead of writing my own passphrase callback. But, I can't find how to get GPGME to use Another option would be to use pin-entry directly, but than i would need
a way to redirect pinentry's output to the provided file descriptor on Windows (I really want it to work cross-platform, even though i don't use Windows myself, and as far as I know windows doesn't implement
Any ideas on what i should do?
Thanks in advance,

I noticed that when I use a symetric cipher, the default algorithm is
CAST5 which allways gives me this warning when decrypting:
gpg: WARNING: message was not integrity protected
So, is there a way to change the default algorithm to AES or TWOFISH without having to specify it as a command-line option every time?
I also noticed that GPGME always uses /usr/bin/gpg even though I have a
later version installed at /usr/local/bin/gpg can I get GPGME to use the
newer version, and if yes, how?

El Tue, 15-02-2011 a las 15:15 -0500, Jerry escribi?: Yes, I should have thought of that. Thanks. Just wondering though, /usr/local/bin/gpg is the first one in the path,
if I just run gpg from a terminal that one is used. So why does gpgme
use the other one?
