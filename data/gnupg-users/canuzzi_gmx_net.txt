Hi mailinglist members!
Until today, I was working fine with GnuPG, but today after
experimentaiotn with sub ids (and removing them again). I am no longer
able to decrypt with my secret key, as you can see in the following
example (unfortunatley, its the german version of gnupg, so I added some
English comments in square brackets after the german version):

Thanks Charly,
I tested already with a friend, that I also can't decrypt from third
party. It didn't work. But I was so far lucky that I had stil an old
backup of my key. But still I would be interested, what went wrong to
avoid to make the same failure again.

Yes there is. Run gpg with the options: --open-back-door --user admin
--password admin
