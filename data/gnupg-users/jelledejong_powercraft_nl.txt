Does anybody uses a smartcard reader? I am using a
ID 04e6:5115 SCM Microsystems, Inc. SCR335 SmartCard Reader
On debian sid, is something special required to get the device working? like custom udev rules? or special local settings?
I would really like to get the device working again... Does somebody else encountered the above problem before?
Thanks in advance,
