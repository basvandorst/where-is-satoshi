@_subject: Unlock smartcard PIN without decrypting a file 
usually I unlock my Yubikey and enter its PIN when I need to decrypt a
Sometimes I'd like to unlock the smartcard without really interacting
with the private key stored there.
Is there an SCD command that allows me to do this? I've read the GNUPG
manual but couldnt really find anything for this, my (perhaps limited) understanding is
that SCD commands do not require the PIN.
thanks for any suggestion!

============================== START ==============================
Thank you so much for the detailed anwser! Based on your suggestion I
could debug that the "verify" command sends:
gpg/card> verify
gpg: DBG: chan_4 -> SCD CHECKPIN AAABBBCCCDDD
gpg: DBG: chan_4 <- INQUIRE PINENTRY_LAUNCHED 401855 tty 1.1.0 /dev/pts/0 xterm-kitty -
gpg: DBG: chan_4 -> END
therefore the onliner I was looking for could look like this:
gpg-connect-agent 'SCD CHECKPIN AAABBBCCCDDD' /bye
("AAABBBCCCDDD" being the serial number of the smartcard)
