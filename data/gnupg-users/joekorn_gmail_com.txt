@_subject: Caret in passphrase 
Hello All,
I was wondering if someone could help me with an issue I'm having. I
have created my gpg key and passphrase and they work fine until I try
to decrypt a file programmaticaly.  My passphrase contains a caret (^)
which is an escape character in DOS.  If I use the following code to
try to decrypt a file, I get a bad passphrase error.
echo "B!g C^t"| gpg --passphrase -fd 0 --decrypt-files "c:\somefile.gpg"
Any thoughts on how I can successfully echo the passphrase?  I don't
want to use a file and type the results.  Our goal is to use the echo

Hi Harry,
We ran into the same problem and the only way we were able to get
around it was by storing the pass phrase in a file and using the TYPE
command instead of the echo.  Curious to see if anyone else found a
better solution
