Hi List,
SuSE 7.1
Gnupg 1.0.6
Mutt 1.3.22.1i
I am new to gnupg and need some help in resolving the following
issues. When choosing to sign/encrypt an email I get the following
gpg:A89A2371--skipped:public key not found.
When I check that particular email in the outbox, it contains this:
PGP output follows (current time. etc)
Error: could not create a PGP subprocess!
The keys are in the default ~/,gnupg location and --list-public-keys
Dallam gives me pub 1024D/A89A2371 2002-01-04 Dallam
I have looked at the gnupg site as well as google searched and can't
find anything about this particulart error, so I am hoping that
someone here can shed some light on what the problem is and what I
need to do to correct it.

Hi List,
A quick question please. Gnupg is new to me, I have only been using
it for a few weeks now. For numerous reasons I like the idea that
mail is signed and that I can identify that it really did come from
where it claims. However, on one (of the dozen) lists I subscribe to
someone has complained that I sign my mail when I post. They say
that Sylpheed pops up an annoying dialouge box ":can't verify
signature from?".
Could someone please enlighten me as to why this is? I have a dial
up account here, so at peak times I fetch my mail and disconnect and
read it offline. This is the only time I get something like
signature can't be verified. I know that my sig is verifiable, so is
his mailer misconfigured or is he just offline and can't be asked to
ever verify it? I don't know anything about Sylpheed, except that
apparently it has pop up dialouge boxes :)

Thank you for your informative reply. Actually, this isn't a
friend...just someone on the same mailing list that I am on. I do
find it a bit odd that he expects others not to sign their mail
rather than to fix/modify/change his mail client.  *sigh*
