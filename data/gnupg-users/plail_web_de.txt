@_subject: Using TC Trustcenter.de certificates 
Hi there!
I'd like to use gpg with the free certificates from TC Trustcenter.de. I
managed to import my private/public key into gpgsm and the Trustcenter
CA certificates into gpg, but I can't get my private/public key into
gpg. Originally I have a p12 certificate. Is it possible to extract the
keys in the needed format for gpg?
What I want to do in the end is sign/encrypt my emails with
Emacs/Gnus. I am using the latest versions of both in debian unstable.
thanks in advance and regards
Markus Plail

But how do I use gpgsm with Gnus then? Normally it uses gpg, doesn't it?

Ok, thanks for the info, but is there a way to import p12 into gpg? I
didn't get it to work and so worked around it by importing the p12 key
into PGP, export it and import that key into gpg. That worked but I
didn't find a way to do the same with gpg, gpgsm and openssl.
