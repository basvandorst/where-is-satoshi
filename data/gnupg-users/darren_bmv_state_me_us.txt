Hey folks,
I get the following while compiling gnupg 1.0 under AIX 4.2.1 with gcc
2.8.1.... gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I.. -I../include -g -O2 -Wall -Wcast-align
 -Wstrict-prototypes -c mpih-div.c -o mpih-div.o
mpih-div.c: In function `mpihelp_mod_1':
mpih-div.c:86: warning: implicit declaration of function `__udiv_w_sdiv'
mpih-div.c:189: fixed or forbidden register was spilled.
This may be due to a compiler bug or to impossible asm
statements or clauses.
make: The error code from the last command is 1.
make: The error code from the last command is 1.
make: The error code from the last command is 2.
I'm still looking but would appreciate anyones thoughts on the matter...

I'm installing the latest version of gcc at the moment, but I've tried it
on gcc version egcs-2.91.60 19981201 (egcs-1.1.1 release) with the same
result so I don't hold out a lot of hope for it helping much.
Actually the error message with this compiler is a bit different but in
the same place....
gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I.. -I../include -g -O2 -Wall -Wcast-align
 -Wstrict-prototypes -c mpih-div.c -o mpih-div.o
mpih-div.c: In function `mpihelp_mod_1':
mpih-div.c:86: warning: implicit declaration of function `__udiv_w_sdiv'
mpih-div.c:189: fixed or forbidden register 64 (mq) was spilled for class
This may be due to a compiler bug or to impossible asm
statements or clauses.

Just a follow up on this... I've tried Phil's suggestion on a clean
box (never had C installed until I put the latest version of gcc on it
yesterday) and I'm still seeing the same type of error in the same file.
I'm not able to follow up on this any further at this time as the project
we were going to use this on is on a very fast track and regretably I'm
forced to move to commercial product to meet the time tables that have
been set. I'm still hoping to make use of the package in the future and
will try and get back to it. If anyone has any other suggestions I would
be happy to try them.
Just wanted to report the problem as a data point for the developers.

I have the same problem on AIX 4.2.1 with both gcc 2.8.1 and 2.95.1. I've
not had a chance to hunt down the problem.
