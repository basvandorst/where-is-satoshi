@_subject: newbie problem about signing 
If you are using two secret keys, one for your regular address,
and one as a pseudonym, you can select which key to use by
passing --default-key  to gpg. You can set the default
secret key to use for signing in the options file as well. Add
the line "default-key " to the options file.
You can also make the messages go away by invoking:
gpg --edit-key  trust
and choosing "5" for ultimate trust.
