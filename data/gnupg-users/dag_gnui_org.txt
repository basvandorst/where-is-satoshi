Well, that?s seems to be true:
I dunno why  at gnupg.org did that, but whatever his reasons were, the fact that he was _able_ to do that, is exactly the key reason why proper (write-only) keyserver networks (SKS- or Hockeypuck-based) are indispensable.
Use them, not WKD or proprietary keyserver services, when you want to get a key by a given fingerprint.  In other words, when enabling --auto-key-retrieve, make sure that --keyserver is set to something like hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com.  IIUC, there is, unfortunately, still no way to configure multiple keyservers for retrieval (contrary to locating).
BTW, does anyone remember, how to command gpg(1) to print the above in a human-readable format?  There was some incantation, IIRC, but GPG?s options are so tangled, that I have failed to find it.

Yes, exactly.  Indeed, in contrast with --with-colons, --with-subkey-fingerprint alone does nothing:
Thank you.

Maybe, you would like to update an expired key in DNS as well?
By the way, it would be nice, if GPG were not interpreting locating an expired key as success, but continued with the next method instead:
No, thanks, that?s not what I forgot, I was nonplussed by the fact, that --with-subkey-fingerprint has no any effect when --show-key is implied, while --with-colons has [].
 at kde.org had resolved [<1803396.a0EWGg1j7a at breq>] my confusion already.

That is, your have not tried to check the connection on the same machine but with some other tool first?  Why?  FWIW, HKP is HTTP on port 11371.
I do not remember for sure, but is not it, at least, preconfigured to use HKPS, i. e. HTTP/TLS on port 443, if not some proprietary keyserver instead of SKS pool?

Did not gpg-preset-passphrase(1) worked perfectly on any NAMEs (IDs, UIDs) as well some time ago?  Or is that me, who have some false memories?

GNU is a vague operating system (just like, e. g., ?UNIX?) and it has no versions per se.
GnuPG version 3 does not exist yet.  The stable release is 2.2.21.
I guess, you mean GnuPG 2.1.12.  (Why not the latest, by the way?)
?The GNU Privacy Guard Manual? can (emphasis mine):
? (info "(gnupg) GPG Esoteric Options")
Nope, you?ve just posted it to the public mailing list.

Or  on the WWW.
Which reminds me...
Dear Werner (or anyone else who can edit the website),
it would really help those, who do not use Emacs (it?s odd, but there are such people!), if there would be single-page version of the manual (makeinfo --html --no-split ...) ? just like all software on gnu.org has.

Unfortunately, ?can not? is not very informative description.  Does it return any error?  How do you know that even tries?
You mean, that you expect, that GPG should silently fetch absent keys when checking signatures out of a box?  No, it does not do that:

Ah, so it?s in fact very easy to resolve ? just install gpg-agent. :-)

Yet you have not described the reason behind it so far, have you?  Why are you sure, that the issue, that make gpg-agent fail to start in your case, is hard to resolve?

Was not it you who have just complained about introduction of gpg-agent, that is about switching from a solid rock tool to a set of independent programs that are communicating via textual streams ? in other words, about GPGv2 be much more UNIX-wayish that GPGv1?
Heh.  Use of files as a temporal storage medium or just unique entities for anything from sockets to boolean flags, and therefore a need for writable FS to store them, is a hallmark of UNIX-way design.
You might believe that UNIX-way design is a bad design, of course, and that GPG should have joined the trend of moving _away_ from it before it had became a mainstream (cf. systemd, Wayland, etc); but saying ?UNIX? to mean ?cool? looks funny as hell.
