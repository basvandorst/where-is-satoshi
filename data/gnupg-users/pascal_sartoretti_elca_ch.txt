@_subject: GPA File Manager : double-click not possible ? 
I am a new user to the GNU Privacy Assistant; it works fine, but there
is one thing that annoys me in the "File Manager" window : it is not
possible to double-click on a decrypted file to open it (using the
application associated to it in the operating system), I have to open it
via Window's Explorer, which is complex because the file is in a
temporary location created by Microsoft Outlook. Hence my questions :
- Is there an easy way to open a file from GPA's "File Manager" window ?
- Why is it so complex, for security reasons ?
Thanks for any help

I am confused : is this "GPGshell" the same as the "GpgEX" component
included in the Gpg4Win package ? "GpgEX" is described as "GnuPG Shell
extension" in the installer.
I couldn't find any info on any of those component in the Gpg4Win

window ?
I couldn't find GPA's source code in neither the GPG4Win source code,
nor on the GPG4win's web site. Can you point me to the code ?
much better suited for the task.
Yes, but it doesn't work (yet?) on 64 bit Windows.
Best regards

[Pascal Sartoretti] I only found a tarball named "gpg4win-2.1.0.tar.bz2"
of 5.8 MB, could you point me to the 300 MB one ?
For now, I only want to have a look at GPA to see if my company has the
skills required to extend it, then I will use the git access.
Best regards
