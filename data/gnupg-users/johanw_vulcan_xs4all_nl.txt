@_subject: Using gpg in elm 
I try to use gpg 0.9.10 together with elm (with pgp patches). I use gpgpgp
as a wrapper. Elm expects pgp 2.6 and I usually use 2.6.3ia but am forced
to "upgrade" because I need to mail with people using some windoze version.
Encrypting a message works well, but decrypting results in an error message
that the "keepbinary" option is not supported.
Does anyone know if this has already been solved? I'm asking here before I
begin patching pgpgpg, elm or gpg myself.

1. It's easy to make up fake charges.

3. It is also very likely that resourcefull attackers of free speech will use
   that law. The scientology cult that got penet.fi closed comes to mind.

Yes, it is. The file is encrypted with the symmetric algorithm with a
session key that is generated by a pseudo-random generator. This session
key is also encrypted and stored with the message.
This does not always preserve file size. 150kb is much, but considering the
size of the files you're encrypting its relatively small.
If you just encrypt them conventionally the output should be always

My opinion with respect to this is that GPL is the lesser evil here.
Explicitly disallowing certain uses causes more problems than it's woth IMO,
without solving any problems (see the crypto export rules from the USA, do
they really believe that Iraq and North-Korea don't get pgp when if they

Due to legal or due to technical reasons? I believe that most cryptographers
believe that when you crack one algorithm you can probably also crack the
other so I guess it are non-technical reasons.
The difference here is that MS is not publishing its changes so any tool
that wants to be compatible, like Samba, must reverse-engineer the changes.
That is not the case with the photo-ID packets.

A file descriptor is an even more low-level function than a file. They

opened such an fd, you can send data through it via something that is
called a pipe. One end sends data, the other end reads it (for 2-way

data through it are standard methods in many programming languages,
including C and perl.
More information about fd's can be found in K&R chapter 8, and for piping

Read the source. Below the legal stuff it says:
 *
       gcc -Wall -O2 -shared -fPIC -o idea idea.c
 */
and place the resulting executables in the gnupg dir. Then add to your
options file:
load-extension rsa
load-extension idea
and you're done.
Sorry, details like these bothered me never enough to find that info.
I believe that some institute think they can patent IDEA (RSA is only
patented in the USA anyway) but I doubt that patent is valid in my

Because on multi-user systems other methods are easier to compromise the
password: for example, if you could enter it on the command line, a simple
ps -ax would reveal it on many unices.
On the other hand, the fd method is also not 100% secure, on some systems
users can access this information.
Examples on how to use this method in perl scripts exist in the pgp 2.6
documentation. I can mail the relevant parts to you if you're interested.
I have also once implemented this in a C++ program that I can also mail
(the programming is very sloppy compared to my current standards, but the
techniques can be easily copied).

That depends what you are trying to protect yourself from. If it's the
police: their standard procedure is to switch power off, make a bitcopy of
the drive and then try to read it in another machine. So for this procedure
an encrypted filesystem might work.
Although for the Dutch police even a strange partitioning is sufficient to
prevent them from reading the drive - I speak from experience from the DOS
age, when my 286 used some tricks with Ontrack diskmanager to use a HD the
BIOS didn't recognise, and they couldn't read it. BTW, pkzip 1.1 encryption
proved too hard for them too. :-)
On the other hand, if you're affraid some Jihad group would read the data,
they would probably be able to "persuade" you to give them the password.

or 2.3 came out still don't like the higher versions. Gnupg behaves more
like the philosophy of the older pgp versions so I like it and use it, but
communication with 2.x users is still very important to me, and I guess to
many others too.
BTW, some options to make conventional encryption compatible would be nice
too. I tested it a while back and I could not get pgp decrypt a message that
was conventionally encrypted with GnuPG.
I means "you are crazy". :-)

This is nonsense. All mentioned algorithms are freely available.
AES, 3DES, Blowfish, Twofish and CAST5 are symmetric key algorithms. GnuPG
creates random session keys for them, they can not be used for public/secret
These are hash algorithms, they are not even ciphers.
The only public/secret algorithm you further mention is RSA. This was
patented in the USA till september 2000, so GNU purists didn't implement
it in the official release of GnuPG. However, since sept.2000 the official
release of GnuPG can use RSA keys (before that there was a separate plugin).
However, it can't generate them. If you want to generate a RSA key, use
pgp 2.x or some later versions (not all later versions generate RSA keys
for the same reason). It's available for win32.

Crypto algorithms are not comparable to graphical formats, where one can
drop GIF and use PNG without loosing any functionality. Proving that a

crypto algorithm is secure is not and takes time.

The advantage of pgp 2 is that it is fixed, no changes are made anymore and,
except from attacks that require access to a computer that is supposed to be

was no acceptable replacement when it came out (and considering the weak
keygen on Linux I think I was proven right in my decision not to "upgrade").
For pgp 6, I could not even get the commandline version compiled on Linux,

Yes, but not by the software but by the user. Or by the editor the user
uses, but it should not be changed AFTER the user has pressed on save or
send. Programs that create one long line per paragraph without a "\n" on
the end but give the visual appearance the message is wrapped are IMO flawed
for use with mailers.
As it should be. When I mail from my winodws machine at work I manually
put in the enter key (I use Netscape 4.75 on that machine).
Not using hard returns causes messages to look formatted like
when I receive them on my Linux machine.
That's a bug of the mailer then, it should not alter messages by itself.
Then don't use clearsigning. Use hard returns within the windows mailer. I don't see the problem here.
Except for people who don't use a fixed-width font for mail perhaps, but
that's a bad habbit anyway.
Maybe it does in Netscape for unix, but I've never testet that. Mutt and
elm don't mess with the formatting of the message that the editor delivers
to them.
I never used a 6.x version of pgp. I could not get the Linux source to
compile, and the precompiled binaries were libc6 only (my libc5 system
didn't even recognize them as ELF executables). I mail on a regular basis
with people using windows pgp versions (6 and 7), but there the encryption
is much more important than the signing so this problem does not occur

I have no experience with either - I use Netscape on my windows machine at

that even worked for the old "windows mail" delivered with win95 and NT4
which was replaced with OE when MS bundled IE with windows.

Yes, you can be very sure: it is not going to be considered at all. Seems
very easy to me. The only other solution that is not going to break when
someone sets the wrap value a bit tighter (like the already mentioned
visually impaied who uses a very large font) is to add wrapping info to the
message and take that into account before checking the signature.
Personally I think this is also not GnuPG's task but a protocol that plays
on the lavel of MUA's and plugins.
Maybe by adding this information to the message (could be as simple as
adding a header line like "X-PGP-Wordwrap: 72".
This issue has nothing to do with CUI vs. GUI. Maybe the problem is easier
to bypass when lots of CUI programs are coupled, but I don't see any
fundamantal reason why the UI would matter in this case.
Then a mode decent method than changing message contents has to be found to
make it work.
I agree on this point.

As far as I know vulnerability to Klima-Rosa attacks was completely solved
in GnuPG 1.0.5 and up, but if I'm wrong here please have someone correct me.
So unlikely to be solved in the near futire anyway. However, I consider this
more a feature than a problem. This means that if you use a key with an
expiration date and consider it still safe on that date, you can simply
increase the expiration date without the hassle of getting new signatures.
These were not mentioned, but these were GnuPG-only bugs which are solved in
the latest versions (I thought they were solved in 1.0.4-1).
Isn't that the whole point of assigning trust values to other people's
signing anyway? Or am I misunderstanding the trust model here? If you don't
want that, don't tell GnuPG that you don't allow other people's signatures
as significant.
So this one not really belongs in this list. It's just a bug, some things
won't work, but will not lead to false signatures or allow other people to
decrypt am encrypted message.
Doesn't the whole issue of non-exportable signatures not depend on the
implementation not exporting them anyway? I.e., is it possible to export
such a signature which is correctly generated anyway with a hacked version
of gpg?

@_subject: GnuPG 1.0.6  versus  PGP 2.6.3i 
Are you sure you don't want to start a howly war here? This is the kind of
question to trigger that.
I'll try to be as objective here as possible and describe the advantages
and disadvantages of both programs. Then you can decide for yourself which
program you trust most.
An advantage of 263ia over GnuPG are that 263ia has been around for many
years now and has been examined very thouroughly. No serious bugs are known,
but it is still vulnerable to the recently discovered man in the middle
attacks and the dangers when someone can edit your secret key, issues where
GnuPG has protections. It is further much less complex than GnuPG, so the
chance of having undetected bugs is smaller.
On the other hand, GnuPG uses more algorithms, both asymmetric and symmetric
ciphers, and hash functions. From a security point of view, the ciphers used
in 263ia (RSA and IDEA) are very good tested and no weaknesses are known,
except for a range of weak keys for IDEA. I must admit that I don't know
if 263ia tests if its generated session keys are in this range and then
calculates a new one or ignores this issue. However, the only criticism I
hear on this list on IDEA is that it is patented, not that it is insecure.
GnuPG offers the same algorithms as 363ia (IDEA only via a plugin), and some
more. As long as no better attacks against IDEA than brute force are known
the choice of the symmetric algorithm won't matter much from a security
point of view. For tha asymmetric algorithm, DH keys seems to be much more
vulnerable to implentation bugs (as pgp 5.0i for Unix has shown), so I see
no direct _security_ advantages here (I consider the usage of different
encryption and signing keys that v4 keys offer (also v4 RSA keys that GnuPG
can use but not generate) and smaller signatures more as a ease of use
issue). A disadvantage of GnuPG is that it currently can't generate RSA
keys, but the next version will be able to. However, IMO then again the
"being arround for some years without bugs found" arguments is in favor of
A disadvantage of 263ia is that it uses only one hashfunction, MD5, which is
unbroken but since a not very much weakened version of MD5 is broken usage
of MD5 for signing is considered a potential risk. GnuPG offers MD5, SHA-1,
RIPEMD160, and with plugins, TIGER192 and SHA256, 384 and 512 (the last 3
also require minor changes in the source when used for clearsigning).

GPG does not support ADK's at all and hopefully never will so it is not
vulnerable to bugs in the ADK implementation.
This has to do with windows programs saving encrypted DLL's automagically in
a system directory and then overwriting system DLL's. GnuPG for win32 does
not do this, and on Unix this is no issue at all.
AFAIK, until now, yes.

In that case, questioning techniques like "if you don't give us the key you
loose your other fingers too" are likely to be used.
A 128 bit symetric key is roughly comparable to a 2048 bit RSA or DH key.
But since the asymetric key is used often and the symetric session key
only once it is logical to make those keys a bit stronger than the symetric
key. Also, the strength of RSA and DH is still based on mathematical
assumptions that are unproven (but not proven false either).

due to pgp 2.x, but this is by no means a must.
It does include RSA key generation in version 1.0.7.
The RSA patent expired in sept. 2000. before that, GnuPG didn't even read

It might be due to differences in opinion of both development teams. As far
as I understand it, Nullify tries to make a windows version without certain
limitations that the standard distribution has (like delivering idea.dll by
default, patching SHA2 in gpg.exe and increase support for RSA v3 keys for
compatibility with pgp 2.x.).
Further they use a propriarity windows compiler (VC++ 6 I believe) instead
of using a crosscompiler on Linux.
Further Nullify has a history of solving irritating bugs in the windows
version much sooner than the official release (like the win2000 keysever

However, for a program like pgp, the largest threat of someone exploiting an

those agencies with much resources found them too, while it's unlikely that

signing key I revoke it, if they have the encryption key they can read all
intercepted messages untill now and perhaps for some time, wether I revoke
it or not. Some people have sent me confidantial messages encrypted to all
keys they could find for me - even 2 keys that were revoked because they are
compromised - becaue they didn't know what key to use from the 5 I have on

I know. I hope the governments in question (most notably the UK one) know
how to use the session key and still don't demend the secret encryption key.
But the same is true when you only give them the encryption key. I think in
practice they'll just confiscate the computer and demand all passphrases.
Being able to protect the signing key is then rather unimportant compared to

This is incorrect. There is an IDEA plugin.
Not really, the other algorithms are also not broken. If they were, they
should be removed. The 3DES algorithm has had the most peer review of all
available ones, although this might change in favor of Rijndael (AES).
This was only one person, Philip Zimmermann.
No, it even has some security enhancements over the 2.x versions. However,
in favor of pgp 2.x speaks that the code has had exceptionally much peer
revieuw, certainly much more than the GnuPG code.
The reason for not using IDEA in the default build has only to do with
patent issues. If you don't care about them or they don't apply to you,
use the plugin.
Not necessarily. When implemented correctly, both are assumed to be
more or less equally secure. However, for ElGamal it's easier to mess
up the implementation since it depends critically on the random number
generator. This is what happened with pgp 5.0i for Unix.

No. However, if you generate a RSA key with gpg it will be a v4 RSA key,
which are actually 2 keys, one for signing and one for encryption. This
is incompatible with pgp 2.x. If you want to remain compatible with
2.x users you need a <= 2048 bit RSA v3 key. If only GnuPG compatibility

Fortunately not. Otherwise, all an atacker had to do to crack my secret key
was creating an encrypted message to my key and his own key.

That is equivalent of saying that you should keep your public key as secret
as possible too, and reveal it only to people you want to send encrypted
messages. While this might add a little security in theory, I think that
when the asymmetric algorithms in gpg are broken (it can be proven that the
discrete log problem and the prime decomposition are connected, if you crack
one you also crack the other) you have larger problems than public keys on

For the asymmetric algorithms the symmetric key is just data to be
encrypted; that this is a key for another encryption does not matter for
them. Your question is equivalent to the question if it's possible to
compute the secret key given the public key. The answer is yes, this is
possible, but it takes too much time to be of practical value.

I don't know how internet banking is done where you live. I have seen
banking systems for 3 banks here.
For one (Postbank, a division of ING) you get 3 lists of codes, sent in 3
separate letters on 3 separate days. You'll have to change 1 of them the
first time you use it, the other is fixed and the 3rd is a list of use-once
confirmation codes when you do payments via their program.
At ABN-AMRO you get a card reader that can is a general type. You put your
bank card in it, and it requires the pin of the chip on the card to work.
You then get a 8-number challenge when you want to login on the bank card,
type this on the card reader and it gives a 6-number response. Together they
generate a session key for an encrypted connection. This session key is
stored in a cookie.
For the CVB bank, you get an electronic number generator with a serial
number. You have to type the serial number of the generator when you want to
login. It then gives a challenge number. You switch on the generator, it
asks for a 5-digit pin code (sent to you in a seperate snail letter, and
you'll have to change it the first time you use the generator). Then it asks
for the challenge and responses with a response that you have to type on the
website, and the server generates a sesson key.
Both the ABN and CVB number generators will always produce the same response
when fed a fixed challenge.

These are things for normal accounts from which you can make payments
to other accounts, get cash from a cash machine with a bank card and
pay with that card in shops (those bank cards have the size of a credit
card, but unlike a credit card your payment is directly, on-line, removed
from your account, and it is also checked if you have enough money to make
that payment). Usually these cards are equipped with a chip that can be
used as an electronic wallet, but I've never used that. I prefer cash,
that always works. I don't know how they handle stocks - I've never owned
them, and am not really interested in that market too.

@_subject: Newbie question - how to include the pass phrase in the command 
Yes, if you want to use it and gpg asks for a password, it is encrypted. If
you sign something you need your secret key so it needs to be decrypted if
it's encrypted. To encrypt, you need the recipient's public key, and public
keys are not encrypted. They need not be.
gpg --edit-key then use the commands "passwd", "save", "quit".
You have only access to your own secret key. Wether the recipient has a
password on his secret key is irrelevant for your setup. You don't have
access that key anyway (unless there's something wrong).
No, to encrypt you only need unencrypted public keys.
No. But the current situation leeds to people removing the password from the
secret key completely because they don't know how to use file descriptors in
VB, which is an even more unsafe situation.
Try gpg --dump-options. It will show you really all options, even those that
are not in the standard help.
On a single-user box like a windows machine, yes. On a multi-user Unix
machine, some users can view the complete commandlines of all commands,
which would give away the password. My POV is that the coder of an
application that uses gpg should decide which threat it the greatest,
since he knows his target box the best, but the gpg developers seem to

That distinction should not be made in email and usenet messages. They are a
plain ASCII medium, not intended for extra markup. Line lengths should be
shorter than 78 chars anyway.
Line-wrapping mail clients are another large reason for failed signatures.
And ugly workarounds that attack the wrong end of the problem are also
already proposed (check sig for each possible breakup and say signature OK
when one of them matches).
Mail clients should not rewrap. But if you want such a machanism, the

Strange. Seems indeed that the industry has pushed the usage of
language here. I doubt that that will happen in The Netherlands,
where noone I know has any problems with using copied software.
If anyone would feel such a thing worthy of publishing (there are other,
more interesting matters happening for reporters right now...) I doubt
many people here would see it as "bad" publicity.
It is still a matter of debate if the BSA isn't assuming too much. If they
make a lot of publicity and hinder the normal work of a company and find
nothing, they will get sued for damages.
I know none here. Scientists usually have small budgets so they copy
everything they can get for free, although they ofter prefer open source.
But even a (retired) police lieutenant I know, who is usually very strict
about breaking the law, doesn't care about using copied software or copied
By new people who use pgp 2.6.x for example. That the product is frozen is
not always seen as a disadvantage. I still use it as main crypto program,
I'm using gpg mostly for being compatible and being able to decrypt what pgp
for windows users mail me.
If you consider pgp 2 a "legacy application" I don't think you're right.
Untrue? Well, we already see how the press if being equalized (I don't know
if this is the correct term?) in the USA. Anything that might point on US
casualties in the Iraq war is not told, and certainly not shown. Imagine
that the people might come to disagree with the government...
Not everything needs to be formally legislized to happen. The former USSR
gave in their constituion almost the same basic rights to their people than
we have in Europe, but anyone can see the difference in practice.

practice larger personal freedom we have in the "old Europe" than the
rights only have on paper when you can't afford the lawyers up to the

Yes. However, it still doesn't prevent the keyservers from being

To solve this the keyserver software has to be modified, for example to
delete expired sigs, or at least not to send them out. But it will keep
the gpg keyrings clean.
Or at least have them remove all GD sigs except the last issued.
Increase the expiry date of their signature to someting more usefull,
like a year.
That would blog my keyring if there are some keys on it that are placed on
the GD.
However, what about an GnuPG option like --clean-keyring that deletes all
expired sigs, or perhaps deletes all (expired or not?) sigs from a given
key, from your pubring? If the blogging occurs, you could at least clean
up your keyring without manually deleting all those signatures.

sizes grow significantly, we all have glass fiber lines to our

The only good thing about messages in the character sets you mention

As developer I understand this. However, every time this topic comes

Most people here know how to do this, but the ones who ask apparently
don't. So why not change the error message in something like: "unusable
key: probably all encryption-capable (sub)keys are expired or revoked".
That doesn't require any change in other places in the code, and does
give the user some usefull hints where to look.
BTW, something entirely different (hacking my outgoing mailspool again
manually): woudln't it be a good idea to set the default reply-to to

@_subject: w32 installation paths (was: OK, 
I think so. On Win2000, "My Documents" is a default homedir, and is also
a different physical directory for each user like the Unix homedir. A
default like \My Documents\.gnupg would be usable on NT4, Win2000 and XP.
For win98 I'm not sure if this works the same.
This could be very usable for graphical shells that want to use gpg, so
they can locate the binary easily.
To look for a previous installed version? I think that most programs just
check some registry entries like the gpgProgram. However, this can require
some heuristics like checking the old default C:\gnupg, or even a filesearch
for gpg.exe.
There is one consideration I've seen more in this thread: some people, like
me, want to carry gpg on removable media (a CDR in my case), to a computer
at work. I don't want to store my secret keyring there locally. Sometimes
users there have no rights to change the registry, and it would be nice to
a able to run gpg from CDR or memory stick without requiring any changes
to the local system. With the environment variables this is possible, just
start gpg with a batchfile that sets the env first.
And about the remarks I read about locating the executable's starting path:
I've found that this depends on the compiler. With Borland C++ Builder,
argv[0] contains the full path and executable name. With Microsoft C++,
you just get the first argument typed in on the command line. So when I type
"gpg", MS argv[0] = "gpg", while Borlands would be (for example)
"C:\\Program Files\\GNU\\gnupg\\gpg.exe".

In other cases I wouldn't care. I've never heard of Ascom-Tech suing

You wrote these 90-10% numbers come from counting keys on a keyserver.
But I disagree with your assesment of the number of abandoned keys:
considering the use of pgp 2.x among people who are more knowledgeable
about encryption, I think there are relatively less abandoned keys among
those 10% than among the 90% v3 keys. Especially among the keys created
with all default parameters among those 90%.
But that doesn't prevent decrypting pgp 2.x messages. And I hope it stays
that way (since you fixed the error in 1.3.6 I hope it still is).
That is a very formal way of reasoning. Anything except 3DES is not
required, but that doesn't mean it can't be used. Now, if I were
advertising some obscure module noone uses except for testing (like the
Skipjack module), I would agree. But not in this case. IDEA is too much
used in the field to be simply ignored (and the GnuPG developers do
acknowledge that, otherwise there wouldn't be an IDEA module and all

Are uid's also stored in the secret key? I thought they only existed
in the public key, since that's the only place where they are needed.
Storing in the secring is double: one can assume that if you have a

That's one of the reasons why most keyservers synchronise.
For keyservers, it already is. If you want to make clear that a certain uid
is not in use any more, you'll have to revoke that uid, not delete it from
your local copy.

It's probably created with one of the many hacked versions of pgp 2.x that

could be used for 16k keys max.
I'm sure it's possible to hack the gpg sourcecode to do it. I found in
g10/keygen.c the lines:
static unsigned
ask_keysize( int algo )
  unsigned nbits,min,def=2048,max=4096;
If you change the max= into the size you want, I think it would work.
I don't know how large RSA keys the gpg code can really handle, so I
would do a bit more checking before you adapt your gpg version.

Indeed. And the stmmetrical algorithms are currently certainly not the
weakest element. A symmetrical algo with no better than brute force attacs
and 128 bits is comparable to a RSA or DH key of about 2400 bits. The 256
bit symmetrical algo's are of course stronger, I don't know how much
compared with public key strength. And anyway, because breaking the pubkey
algo allows one to read all ancrypted messages and breaking the symmetric
key to read only one it makes sense to try to make the pubkey algo the
strongest element.

PGP has always been a hybrid cipher system: the data is encrypted with a

That won't work. With some work you can import the key if it's an v3 RSA key
not larger than 2048 bits (don't use idea for key encryption then or you
won't be able to import the secret key). I don't know if pgp 8.1 creates v3
RSA keys, pgp 2.x can't import v4 keys. GnuPG can't create them without a
patch (so without a recompile).
However, the messages encrypted with pgp 2.6.3i to such a key will still use
the IDEA symmetric algorithm.
If you want to communicate with users of unpatched pgp 2.x versions, you'll
really need to get IDEA integrated in GnuPG. On win32 a dll is sufficient,
but I don't know if the dynamic loading of algorithms works on VMS. If it
does, compiling the module and adding a line in gpg.conf will suffice.
Otherwise, you'll have to recompile.

Why did you rename the file? Not that it matters, gnupg will ignore
extensions anyway, but .asc is usually used for base-64 encoded
files. The signature on the source is in binary format.
The signature file doesn't match with the source file. This could mean that
the source was modified, a corrupt download, or a corrupt signature file.
Most probably, however, your browser unpacked the gzipped file but didn't
rename it. How big is the file? It should be around 3.8 MB.

always analyse the resulting message, and if some additional encryption
key turns up or extra message data is added after the message that would
be easily detectable. And more subtle backdoors, like tampering with the
RNG are nu issue since GnuPG itself deals with that.

In that case, I assume 3072bit is sufficient. Making the public/secret
key a little stronger than the session keys (128 bit for most symmetric
ciphers) makes sense (breaking the secret key lets an attacker read all
messages, breaking a session key only one so the pubkey is more
valuable) but making it extremely much  stronger is useless. Attackers
will go for the weakest link in the chain.

Privacy has much more to do with encryption than with signing. On the

When I want privacy from government agencies I would use encryption for

For email this is easy, I'm now figuring out how to set up myn own

"major in wartime": during WW2, some majors kept their position under

as possible. This turned out to be nearly impossible, and after the war
those majors were ot looked kindly uppon. You can't keep your hands
clean when you take such a post.
Another example would be the countless Stasi employees who really
thought they were doing the people a favor by defending them against
those evil capitalists. The people mostly didn't agree.
The NSA employees might think they are protecting the people against
someone worse than they are, but in many places outside the US the US is
now seen as the primary enemy. Not that we like terrorists that much,
but we have reached the point where the US causes more problems and
deaths of innocents than its enemies. Especially because they more or
less admit that all non-US citizens are fair game.
Another problem with the US, they tend to make out for others what
"crimes" are. The wars on drugs and copyright infringement are typical
examples of where the pressure of the US goes against the interests of
the people in other countries (and even their own).

The rest of the arguments are only centered about signatures (even the

where signing messages is not very important but encryption is and since

I don't doubt that. I assumed (yes I know, assumption is the mother of
all fuckups) that these things were analyzed during the long
cryptanalysis the algorithms in gpg have had. From DES I know it is not
a group (otherwise 3DES would indeed not be more secure than single
DES), I admid that a quick Google about AES didn't turn up any
information one way or the other. Is that not determined yet? Did noone
researched something like 3AES yet?
However, encrypting a message with AES with key1 and then encrypting it
again with key2 (key1 unrelated to key2) can't make it less secure since
any attacker can encrypt the intercepted encrypted message again with
little effort. That would be like saying that base-64 encoding the
message would reduce security.

combinations are safer / at least as safe / less safe.
Since I majored in physics and didn't get that much discrete math, I may
could not even understand such a proof myself completely. But assuming
the conclusion is accepted by knowledgable people I would trust the
reasoning. I also didn't check the proof that DES is not a group, but I
trust that if it was incorrect I would heve heard about that. The same
mechanism as why I trust gpg does not contain any deliberate backdoor,
even when I didn't check the entire soucre myself.
For non-speciallists you can stick with the conclusion: it has been
proven that X is true of not true without giving details about the proof.
OK, I assumed someone would have checkeds that by now. Probably I was
wrong about that.
Any attacker can encrypt my message again with a nonrelated key (and
only with a nonrelated key since they don't know the key I used). If
that would make it easier to break AES then re-encrypting the message
that would be a better than pure brute force attack on AES.
My argument is that even if it turns out to be not the case, that method
would just be an attack on AES.

The most easy solution in such cases is to try IPv4 first, if that
doesn't work or is unavailable, try IPv6 if available.
Non-working or misconfigured IPv6 setups are rather common, probably
done by default setups where the builder prefers IPv6 and a server owner
who isn't even aware the server supports IPv6. Combined with a "IPv6

Well, in making it more beginner friendly, I imagine a system that does
not bother the user with complexities about whan to sign someone's key
to which degree, but after install:
1. The beginner friendly installer notices there is no secret key yet ->
create one automatically and upload it to the keyservers. To make the
experience as easy as possible perhaps even offer to use no password on
the key so it does not need to ask for a password when opening mail
(with a warning that this could give problems if losing or confiscating
the computer is part of the threat model).
2. It notices 2 email programs -> offer to integrate a plugin in both
and set the defaults to sign and encrypt when the receiver has a public
key on the servers. I agree that for webmail solutions this might be
difficult but plugins for browser automation do exist (usually aimed at
unit testing of websites).
This approach might lead to issues, like targeted attacks with false

Fooling a computer that a certain voice belongs to someone else, sure,

string is spoken by someone I know when in fact it is not, sure, that too.
But fooling me that the person on the other end of the line is someone I

actual conversation... I don't believe it very likely to happen in the
near future. Perhaps it could work on someone I barely know, but pick
only once the wrong person and I might become very suspicious. It
requires not only changing the voice but also solving a problem much

No it's not, it is much simpler. When I call my wife and are in fact
connected with a computer or agent impersonating her, they are unlikely
being able to copy her voice so good that I don't hear it. And even if
they are, I think it's very unprobable they would be able to fool me due
to them missing context.
Try it out: have 2 people who know each other well speak via a computer
synthesised voice so voice reconnition would not work. Then have a third
person who doesn't have intimate knpowledge about both others try to
fool one of the other two he is the other person. Unluikely to work.
And even if it would be possible, it would require so much manpower to
make it unusable for mass surveilance. It would probably only be used

I just saw this posted in sci.crypt:
Short quote from the article linked to above:
    In August, National Security Agency officials advised US agencies
    and businesses to prepare for a not-too-distant time when the
    cryptography protecting virtually all sensitive government and
    business communications is rendered obsolete by quantum computing.
    The advisory recommended backing away from plans to deploy elliptic
    curve cryptography, a form of public key cryptography that the NSA
    spent the previous 20 years promoting as more secure than the older
    RSA cryptosystem.
    Almost immediately, the dramatic about-face generated questions and
    anxiety. Why would the NSA abruptly abandon a series of ECC
    specifications it had championed for so long? Why were officials
    issuing the advice now when a working quantum computer was 10 to 50
    years away, and why would they back away from ECC before
    recommending a suite of quantum-resistant alternatives? The fact
    that the NSA was continuing to endorse use of RSA, which is also
    vulnerable to quantum computing, led some observers to speculate
    there was a secret motivation that had nothing to do with quantum
    computing.
    On Tuesday, researchers Neal Koblitz and Alfred J. Menezes
    published a paper titled A Riddle Wrapped in an Enigma that
    compiles some of the competing theories behind the August advisory.
    The researchers stressed that that their paper isn't academic and
    at times relies on unsourced facts and opinions. And sure enough,
    some of the theories sound almost conspiratorial. Still, the paper
    does a good job of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the
    NSA's highly unexpected abandonment of ECC in a post quantum crypto
    (PQC) world.

the child pornographers will still use decent encryption because in any

I'd say split it: if there are reasons to use gpg 1.4 for compatibility
or other reasons, don't use sks. If you're using gpg 2.2.17 or newer,
you can use it. The people who knowingly use 1.4 will know they're in
that category.
Yet. Please look again in 5 years (estimate is till 2030 but some
unexpected attack might appear).

Why hardware? If a bug is found you can't upgrade it easily.
On mobile, encrypted messengers are the norm. WhatsApp is the biggest,
and it uses Signal's encryption algorithm which is excellent.

If a hardware bug is found you're still lost. Even Apple has found out
the hard way.
It is a risk, but not a bigger risk than someone taking over your pc or
laptop. Signal and GnuPG are both defenseless against that.

You mean like the conspiracy myth that the NSA was eavesdropping on
everyone, whether they were allowed to or not? Yes, that was not
supported by facts (before the Snowden revelations) so it must have been
utter rubbish.

The receiver uses your public key only to encrypt and verify. If you
send him encrypted mail you need HIS public key to encrypt the message,
and the receiver needs his secret key to decrypt it. If the receiver
protects his secret key with a password is something you have no
influence over.

It would be nice if GnuPG implemented an override option to use this key
for decryption anyway. The alternative is that people will fall back to
unencrypted mail.

Not supporting encryption anymore I can understand, but by removing
decryption ability which makes old mail archives unusable you can't
realistically expect people to abandon 1.4 completely.
Complex, nah, you can always put the v3 key code in a separate set of
functions that are called when a v3 header is detected. Maybe not the
cleanest design but for code that is probably not going to see any
changes it would work.

@_subject: Comparison of RSA vs elliptical keys 
Until, of course, a working quantum computer with more than a few qubits
is constructed. Then ECC is much more vulnerable than RSA or ElGamal due
to its smaler keysize (of course once a 256 bit quantum computer gets
constructed I would also worry about 8192 bit RSA being vulnerable too
in the very near future).

Have the bureaucrats who define standards have finally fixed the DOS

This strictly following standards removes all flexibility from

I agree on a personal level, but if you use your email also to

@_subject: Why is Blowfish's key size limited to 128 bits in RFC 4880? 
Be careful though, there are ciphers known where extra keybits don't
increase security. If there are situations where they actually reduce
security I don't know, but the cipher would have to be re-investigated
after such a change.
Having said that, 128 bits is really enough, 256 is overkill "just
because we can".
Brute-forcing a 128 bits keyspace and certainly a 256 bit one is still
limited by the laws of physics, like in:
- It takes more time than the age of the universe,
- It requires more energy than the stars in the milky way emit during
their life,
- If you try to seriously paralellize it, there is not enough matter in
the known universe to build all those computers.
As long as the above are the limits I feel secure enough with the keysize.
Quantum computers with enough qubits reduce the workload to brute force
symmetric ciphers typical by a factor of a square root, so for those 256
bits is sufficient. But then the public keys become the weak point, the
short-keyed elliptic curve algorithms long before RSA and Elgamal (but
when elliptic curve gets into trouble you know it's only a matter of
time before the others will be too so they do need replacement then).
