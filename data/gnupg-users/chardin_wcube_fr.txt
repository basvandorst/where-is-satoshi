I have some troubles importing a signed key from a friend. We are using GnuPG 1.2.1.
I get the following errors trying to import his signed key:
gpg --import friend.gpg
gpg: key CC2DD97B has been created 27540 seconds in future (time warp or clock problem)
gpg: key CC2DD97B: invalid self-signature on user id ""
gpg: key CC2DD97B has been created 27540 seconds in future (time warp or clock problem)
gpg: key CC2DD97B: invalid subkey binding
gpg: key CC2DD97B: no valid user IDs
gpg: this may be caused by a missing self-signature
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:           w/o user IDs: 1
I must use the '--ignore-time-conflict' option in order to be able to import it and use it correctly.
My friend doesn't understand the problem since he doesn't have any clock issue on his computer (right hour and date) and my hour/date are good as Anyone has some clues or ideas about this trouble ?
Thanks in advance.
