I'm trying to move from PGP 5.0 to GnuPG but I'm having problems decrypting emails that work fine with PGP.  For instance, here's the output
I get in mutt when I try to read such a message:
gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit (null) key, ID 9F08E689, created 1995-12-27
      "Matthew Harrell "
gpg: public key decryption failed: unknown pubkey algorithm
gpg: encrypted with 768-bit (null) key, ID 1D55B4A1, created 1994-05-28
      "David M. Meyer "
gpg: no secret key for decryption available
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available           The key this particular one was created with was an RSA key from PGP 2.6.  Is
that what's causing the problem?
Thanks for any help.

Nevermind.  Once I just realized that my key was RSA I checked in the docs and
found that GnuPG doesn't use RSA.

: : You should also get the file idea.c. Old PGP Algorithms were MD5, RSA, IDEA.
: Compiling should be like rsa.c. When generating messages, consider to use the
: switch --rfc1991 in order to generate messages that can be read by PGP 2.x.
Great.  Thanks the help.  I've got them both in there and working right now.
