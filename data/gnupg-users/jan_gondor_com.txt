@_subject: Certs by a revoked key 
But that's exactly what I said: Because we don't know if a signature was
made before or after the revocation, we should assume all signatures
from made with a revoked key as invalid. Or give a big
warning. And for certs, we should not use them in trust calculation.

@_subject: Outlook express messes up when it receives gpg-signed mail? 
Content-Disposition: inline
The problem is not that Outlook doesn't support PGP/MIME. Many programs
do not support PGP/MIME and still display the message correctly (and add
one attachment of unknown type with the signature).
But Outlook, for some unknown reason, ignores the following MIME headers
in the message:
Content-Disposition: inline
These headers clearly state that the part is not an attachment but
should be shown inline, and that it contains pure text that doesn't need
a special handler to be displayed.
But Outlook still chooses to show the message part as an attachment. I'd
say this is clearly a bug (and not just a missing feature).
So I prefer to use PGP/MIME instead of inline-pgp, because it works very
reliable (I still have to see a single PGP/MIME message with a broken
signature because of some ill reencoding) and supports signing of
Content-Disposition: inline

@_subject: OpenPGP smartcard with offline primary key 
Isn't this exactly the approach described in the thread "Clarification
on purpose of subordinate keys" two days ago? There was a very nice
step-by-step description posted by Dirk Traulsen.

@_subject: Smartcard error 
See my mail to gnupg-devel - I have the same problem on debian. With the options --disable-ccid --pcsc-driver /usr/lib/libpcsclite.so.1                                                        gnupg seems to work reliably. (After starting pcscd, of course)

@_subject: PGP and Smartcards? 
What about storing the keys on a smart card, and leaving the card in a
card reader on your remote-accessible computer?

@_subject: OpenPGP Smartcard Advantages 
It is - but a malicious card reader could also fry the card with some
high voltage pulses. But at least you know that something bad happend,
you know who (or at least which host - it may have been cracked) did it,
and you did know the risk when you put the card into the reader. And it's
not worse than losing the card.
I wondered if the card couldn't just erase itself completly when the
wrong Admin-PIN is entered three times. This would at least save the
card itself, which is worth some euros. But OTOH, just locking the card
is probably easier to implement in a safe way (it's an atomic operation
which can't be aborted by just turning of power, for example).

@_subject: Set date for signature to expire 
But then, the safe guess would be that the attack did start immediately
when the key was generated, not when the signature was added. So,
following your logic, you should never sign a key older than your
estimated passphrase-guessing-time.
I guess one should leave that decission to the key owner. The signature
only tells one thing: This key belongs to person XYZ. And nothing about
key security.
Signature expiration dates are useful when "person XYZ" is not (only) a
natural person, but some kind of role account (eg. "CEO of Company
ABC"), where that role is not a permanent one, but may change in future.
Currently, I can't imagine other sensible uses for signature expiration
(but I'm not claiming there aren't - it's only my limited imagination).
