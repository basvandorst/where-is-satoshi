I gather that a new build is expected soon, but last time I checked
gpg4win-2.1.0 included GnuPG 2.0.18 not 2.0.19.

Can I use my openPGP smartcard  to decrypt a file with a empty keyring ?
Assuming the card's public keys are lost or unreachable at the time.

card. Thus we decided not to do it at all. My usually advise is to put
an URL to the public key into the URL field and then use the fetch sub
command of the --card-edit menu to retrieve the key. Shalom-Salam, Werner
Can't we  recreate/guess the public part from the private part, at least
from off-card keys ?
I noticed that importing a private key from en export also create the
public one.
(Unless the public key is always embeded in the secret export)

public key first, before checking for the matching secret key, or
because the stubs aren't being created right in the keyrings. I am
having a similar problem with signing, even though I've explicitly
imported my public key into the public keyring (using --import, rather
than --edit-card), and have the secret key on a cryptostick.
To be able to use the private keys from a card, you have to get the
"stub" on your key ring.
First import the public keys (all of them if you use many subkey)
Then use --card-status to get the private stubs, I don't know if
--card-edit 'll do the trick.
Always worked form my cryptostick.

I already moved my subkeys to one cryptostick.
When i tried to move the primary key (4096 RSA) to another stick i got:
Note that there is NO valid choice.
Any ideas ?
I'm using gpg 2.0.20

I'm using the v1.2.
It's supposed to be fine with 4096 rsa key if used with GnuPG 2.0.20.
May be the capacity flags of my primary key is the probleme.
As i'm using subkeys to sign &  encrypt, i created the primary with only the "certify" capability and the stick only got 3 slots:
Nothing to receive a certification only key ?

Stick it in signature, that works.
But I can't.
The keytocard command displays the 3 slots, but none of them are listed as a valid choice.
I've to choose from an empty list.
I need a ctrl-c to exit gpg

Same issue, no valid selection avalaible.
I'm quite sur the root cause is the "certification only" capacity of
my key:
usage: C  <-primary
usage: S  <-subkey
usage: E  <-subkey
All keys with the S or E flags are fine.
All my real and test keys with only the C flag can't be move to my card.

I sucessfully add the signing capability to my key by editing it with the APG app on my android phone.
Don't ask how it's done...
I'll try again with my catd asap.
Thanks for your help anyway.

Hi everyone.
The last gpg-agent supports ECDSA and putty's pageant.
But, does it support ECDSA for putty/pageant ?

Hash: SHA512
If you need to be able to past your 'very strong passphrase' (may be from keepass) you can use the old pinentry provided with gpg4win 2.2, without install it.
Open the installer with 7z and copy all the dll and pinentry exec onto a new ditectory.
Edit your gpg-agent.conf to add the option:
Pinentry-program "your own pinentry full path"
Restart your gpg-agent..
Works on my xp and win7..
