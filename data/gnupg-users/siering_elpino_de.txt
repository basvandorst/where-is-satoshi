@_subject: making GPG portable 
Hi Group !
As new user in GPG I have a question on portability with GPG.
When using GPG on a workstation, it's easy to secure a file containing my
passwords, keys, pin's and so on.
But what, when I am not at home ?
I want to store all needed files on an USB device to en- and decrypt secret
So I made a configuration which works on an USB devive without installing
on the Windows engine.
Here my question:
Is it a good idea to do this ?
If the USB device is lost, only the pass-phrase secures the crypted file.
Is the risk too high, or will this secure enough ?
Has anybody a better idea for that usage ?
Thank you
