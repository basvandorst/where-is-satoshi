Try _BEGINNING("")_ instead of LEADING.
(If you've already tried this, sorry--I wasn't paying attention.)
I think they changed that a couple versions ago.

Have you tried _LEADING("-----BEGIN PGP ")_ /usr/bin/gpg-check?
I know we talked about this before, but I really think "_BEGINNING" is
what you want here--the difference is that _LEADING only matches the first
non-whitespace line while _BEGINNING will catch any line in the message
with that.
Wait...no filters offered?  Are you saying the "display" filter is working
For the sending filter, I just did a little test:  I changed the name of
the filter program to be misspelled.  When I did, the Send command didn't
offer me the filter because the file it was pointing to didn't exist.
Are you sure you're pointing to the correct gpg-sign location?
Also, have you tried putting the gpg-sign in quotes?

Makes sense I guess.  But if someone's going to hack your site, why would
they just add an ususual news item?
