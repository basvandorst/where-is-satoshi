@_subject: Key credentials validation problem 
Hi, List.
As a newbie in GnuPG I desperately need some help. Here's my question.
What I have:
1. User Public Key(created in gnupg)
What I need:
To get using gnupg(or programmatically) key credentials(UserID, KeyID). The
problem is that to get info about key I have to place it to the key ring.
How to get the info without placing the key to the keyring?
Any help is welcome.
Thanks in advance.
Best wishes, Alexander.
P.S. I'm not subscribed to the list, please, forward me the message.
