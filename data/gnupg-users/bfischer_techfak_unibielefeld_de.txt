Yes this is a known issue. The MPI assembler code for MIPS
is broken. Use the generic C code for MPI and you will succeed.

@_subject: Random sources for 150+ hosts 
Hello GnuPG users,
we are planning to use GnuPG in a heterogenous environment:
We need to support 150-200 hosts running Solaris, IRIX or
Tru64 Unix.
We are currently facing the difficulty to find good random
sources on each host/platform. There are several methods to
1. On Solaris use /dev/random (Andreas Meier's one, or that
   provided with the SUNWski); on IRIX and Tru64 Unix use
   egd. This requires that egd runs on every machine (except
   Suns). But even if egd runs under it's own user id, it
   still consumes resources massively (RAM, CPU,
   administration, etc.). I won't accept this unless everything
   else hurts even more.
2. On Solaris use /dev/random (Andreas Meier's one, or that
   provided with the SUNWski); for IRIX and Tru64 Unix provide
   a "centralized" egd-server via TCP socket. Our network
   environment is fully switched. Not that this ensures 100%
   security but it should be a hurdle against eavesdropping.
3. Implement a /dev/random in hardware, feed random to a
   randomness server and distribute it to all clients.
   This should provide high quality entropy, but this gain
   is damped (or lost at all?) if we send the random data
   unprotected (same as 2).
At first glance 2 and 3 are inacceptable -- distributing random
data over (switched) ethernet without further protection.
But if bad guy is able to eavesdrop any traffic to and from
a workstation there are many things far more interesting
than random data for encryption purposes. E.g. you may listen
to NFS traffic (homes and most apps NFS mounted), you may
get the private PGP/GPG key and X11 authentication cookies,
then you are able to contact the X11 server and get the pass
What if we encrypt this random data? Even when using a weak
encryption, there is no chance to perform a brute force attack,
since there's no way to tell whether an attempt was successful
or not.
Suggestions are welcome.

@_subject: GnuPG exploit [Fwd: Possible problem with GnuPG 1.0.6] 
Hello Phillip,
GnuPG was never meant to be installed with the sgid bit set.
It may be installed suid root on some platforms due to the
"unsecure memory" issue.
When installed suid root, gpg does what it needs with root privileges
i.e. allocating a locked memory buffer, and then drops these privileges
immediately and completely. So it drops any user privileges (set[e]uid(2))
but does not touch any group privileges, since there should not be any
group privileges to drop.
 it.
 in=20
It does exactly this.
s of=20
There is no need to do this. When doing file I/O gpg already has dropped
root privileges.
Install gpg properly, remove the sgid bit, and your "exploit" won't work
any more.

@_subject: Create root RSA key pair 
Hello Dan,
Please wrap your lines at 60-70 characters, thanx.
AFAIK, GnuPG can do everything with RSA keys, except generating
them. You may even use optionally IDEA and your signed/encrypted
messages are PGP-2.x compatible.
You may use your old PGP generated RSA keys, though.
Also, you should ask yourself why you don't want to use
DSA/ElGamal keys.

@_subject: [META]Far too much spam on this list 
Hello GnuPG users,
IMHO there is too much spam traffic on this mailing list and the
tendency is that things are getting worse. Is it possible to increase
anti-spam protection on this list? E.g. reverse lookups, known
blacklists, or even mandatory subscription for being able to post.
I know that there is no real solution for this problem. But even
little relief is welcome.

@_subject: Insecure memory 
Hello Victor,
Please read the FAQ before posting to this list:
  Personally I would not recommend a suid root gpg executable, even
after looking into the privileged code w/o finding any flaw. If you
cannot trust your computer or it's hard disk, you already have lost.
The only valid exception are diskless clients that perform
swapping/paging via network.
