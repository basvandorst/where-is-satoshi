@_subject: Diffie-Hellman Key Establishment 
Hello gnupg-users, how can I look further into how gpg-handles the diffie-hellman key
establishment? I would like to use randomness created by shaking a
device and introduce this to the key establishment part. I would be very thankful if anyone could point me either to the correct
answer or mailinglist.
Regards,
