@_subject: Safely remove gnupg 1.4 without damaging gnugp 2 on Mac OS? 
Dear all,
I have GnuPG 1.4.11 left over from a former installation. Since I
upgraded to GnuPG 2.0.22 during the installation of GPG-Suite for Mac OS
(10. 8. 5 ? Mountain Lion) I do not need the older version. Is it
possible to remove it without hurting my keyrings?
Thank you in advance for your help.
best regards,
