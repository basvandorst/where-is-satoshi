@_subject: How can I revoke a signing?    WAS: RE: [WINPT USERS] 
I hope cross posting is ok...
First I downloaded the key from the keyserver with:
        gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 0xE60F7299
I did this with the following:
        gpg --edit-key 0xE60F7299
and the "sign" command.
I use the revsig command
If you mean write out a new _file_, no, it did not write out a new file. Perhaps this is where I went wrong.
Should I try this on a file containing the old public key instead of on a key downloaded from the keyserver?
This is gpg (GnuPG) 1.0.6 BTW
Ok, well this is what I obviously don't know how to do corectly. GnuPG users: how do I do this?
How to do that is currently beyond me :-/
But I don't have one :-) that's the whole problem. There is no separate revoke cert that I can see.
GnuPG users _ is there a way I can make a revoke certificate as a file, that I can import back into WinPT?

Hash: SHA1
I just imported a friend's GPG key -- the first one I've imported in a wh=
ile -- and I cannot make it trusted.
Every time I try to use it in Kmail it's marked as untrusted, so I can't =
use it.
I ran gpg --edit  56791C97 tried 'trust' '4' (full trust) save (to which =
is said nothign needed to be saved) and closed.
That still didn't work. If I run gpg --check-trustdb I get:
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
gpg: 6 keys processed
gpg:    6 keys skipped
Which I think is correct (is used to be 5).
Yet I it's still marked as un-trusted in Kmail. I Don't _think_ it's Kmai=
l's problem, I think it's a problem with GPG.
What's the correct command to "trust" a key fully?
I tried various combinations of=20
gpg --trusted-key  56791C97
gpg --trusted-key pat
gpg --trusted-key 0x56791C97
But apparently that's not how you use that because they all gave errors.

Wow, that's drastic (though understandable).=20
Can anyone confirm this?
