@_subject: Passphrase Pop up 
Hi there we recently upgrade our Windows server from 2008 to 2019 and Gnu to 3.1.12
Since then the command line
type passphrase.txt | gpg --passphrase-fd 0 --no-tty --batch -o exp.txt -d extract_ *.txt.pgp
has stopped working as the passphrase window keeps popping up.
we run this as a schedule task.
Can someone please help me.

The OP probably meant Gpg4win 3.1.12 which is our Windows installer featuring GnuPG 2.2.21, Kleoptra, and our Outlook plugin.
