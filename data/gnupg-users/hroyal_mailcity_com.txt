@_subject: installation errors 
First, where is the archive of this list?
Then OK, I am a rank newbie at this. I am trying to install remotely via telnet (I know the server runs Linux and Apache, if that helps). I ran ./configure and that seemed to go all right.  But then "make install" gave errors, as below.
Any suggestions?  Thank you.

Thank you to all who answered. I also went through the list archives for the last few months but still did not solve my problem.      I asked my sysadmin what are the OS and C-compiler versions of the server I am trying to install gpg to, and the reply was:
"This is what the GNU C Compiler (gcc) reported as its version info:
gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)
"The OS is Slackware Linux 7.0 which uses the 2.2.13 Linux kernel and glibc-2.1.2.

[As for the issue of remote installation being insecure, at this point I am totally experimenting to see if I can get it to work at all, given my limitations.  If I can, I will be encouraged to look into SSH.]
Frank Tobin suggested that I try RPM.  What is RPM?
I tried the suggestion of Anonymous:  using ./configure --disable-nls and got the errors below (I did not delete everything from the first ./configure -- does that need to happen? -- Yes, I am truly ignorant, I admit it):. scooter: {/home/u-z/wem/public_html/cgi-bin/gnupg-1.0.1} % ./configure --disable
