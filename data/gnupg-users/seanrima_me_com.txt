@_subject: group in gpg.conf but gpgmail does not honor/see 
I am looking for a work around to the gpgmail on osx not using the group line in the gpg.conf file. I can drop to a terminal but it is not the best idea.
I was wondering if I created a key with the address of the group line, would gpg encrypt to the group line or just the key. It is for the pgpnet group on yahoo if that help

If I goto the command line and use the -r command line option gpg picks up the group ok, however gpgmail is just scanning the keyfile and not finding a key for the group, ie the email address
I think the group line is a feature that is not widely used, if it is used elsewhere indeed. Apart from the pgpnet group on Yahoo, I have not seen it used
I think it is the way that gpgmail is written it scans the keyfile and not the gpg.conf file, I guess few email rograms would. I may try creating a simple key for the group and see if gpg will encrypt to the group line as well or instead of the created key.

I will have  aplay later on, but I am nearly sure that it is reading the key file. I created a dummy key for the group and gpgmail gave me the option to encrypt but with out the key no option to encrypt is available, only sign
