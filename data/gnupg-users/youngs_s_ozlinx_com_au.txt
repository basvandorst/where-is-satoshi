@_subject: Importing keys 
I'm having a great deal of trouble importing keys with gnupg 1.0.1.
When I do...
gpg --import keyfilename
I get...
gpg: key 16F4CCE9: unsupported public key algorithm
gpg: key 16F4CCE9: no valid user IDs
gpg: this may be caused by a missing self-signature
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:           w/o user IDs: 1
What am I doing wrong?

I had a block of 6 keys, doing what you suggested I was able to import
1 of them.  The other 5 were rejected with the above error.
