@_subject: Public key 
Hey khine, if you want to encrypt a file, you need the public key *of the
recipient*.  So you need to /generate a key/ only if you plan to encrypt a
file 'to yourself' (storage, backups, etc.); if you want to encrypt a file
and send it to a friend, you need his/her public key.
Some time ago, I wrote a simple tutorial on how to encrypt your first
message [1]; there are many other tutorials on the net.
Since you are a Windows user, you may want to download Gpg4win [2].

The most "complex" part is generating and sharing your public keys, which
can be as easy as:
    gpg --gen-key
    gpg --send-key     gpg --search-key     gpg --fingerprint After checking (on the phone or on some other channel) that the fingerprint
matches, you can type
    gpg -e to encrypt a file. The commands are for the most part interactive, hence "easy
to follow").
Mail client integration becomes a must if you need to exchange more than
a few messages. I use mutt, but there are many other setups (Thunderbird &
Enigmail, claws-mail, etc.) that are PGP friendly.

Encryption via public-key requires no password at all, so maybe you
are better off switching to it, depending on your use case.

Have you tried checking 'man gpg' (search for 'FILES')? It should be
~/.gnupg/ , echo $GNUPGHOME to make sure.

Privacy and its boundaries are a well debated (and well worth to be
debated) topic; keep in mind that any discussion that starts with
framing ("privacy absolutist" is political framing 101 -- would you
feel fairly treated if I described your views on the matter as, say,
"government absolutist"?) is bound to get pretty flamish pretty soon.

GPL obligations happen when you *distribute* software. In this
case you are not (re)distributing GPG or any derivative from it,
so no restriction/obligation applies to you!

Hello John,
    I suppose Emacs caches the passphrase somehow. Maybe/Probably
this is done through gpg-agent: scan your gpg-agent config file
for `default-cache-ttl`, set it appropriately and report back!

@_subject: What's the contextual definition of the term?... signature 
Since you have only received (not so) funny answers: a signature, in
PGP,  serves more or less the same purpose of a handwritten one.
Most of the time it will mean "I am the author of this (email|document|
article)" but not always -- as with handwritten one it could
be used within a contract, etc.
If you have the public key of person A, you can verify with PGP his
signature, so you will be sure the document you received has not been
tampered with.

@_subject: some beginner questions 
Hello Will, I'll answer 1. 2. and 4. (3. is beyond my knowledge):
You got it correctly, they indeed "never forget". Littering is something
which many folks do from time to time (I think Phil Zimmermann himself,
the creator of PGP, has an unrevoked/unrecoverable key in the servers).
Just carry on and you will be fine!
There are a handful of options: fingerprint in the sig, mail headers
(like `X-PGP-Key:`), advertising on social media or on your personal
I chose the latter, but fingerprints/key IDs are so short they fit
in a Twitter bio, so I'd say all are valid choices.
If you advertise it to the "general public", maybe you want to link
to a tutorial too, so people who have never used PGP can quickly learn
how to send messages to you (that's what I did [1]).

@_subject: a bunch of questions 
Hello Charlie,
    I see no expiration date on your key (4096, not 2048). Maybe *did*
input an expiration date and then forgot to upload the key again to
a key-server?
A general word on expiry dates: you can always modify them as you
go (that's what I do), they are not set in stone?
So why are they useful? Because this way you can encourage your
friends/workmates to refresh your keys every now and then, getting
all the new subkeys/revocations/etc.
Any reasonable client (I use mutt) should allow you to switch keys,
but since the one you are using is 4096 (very strong!), if it is
not compromised you could use this for the rest of your life.
Does this address your questions?

Hello John,
Was encrypted by whom? Usually gpg tutorials start from creating your
own key (which you and your friends can use to encrypt files to you),
but apparently you have already created it.
Or is it (if you know) a file encrypted with a simple passphrase
(symmetric encryption)?

in Debian is there a small utility (`gpg-zip`, found in the `devscripts`
