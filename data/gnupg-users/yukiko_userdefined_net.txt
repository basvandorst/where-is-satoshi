@_subject: batch encrypting customer orders on remote secure server? 
I am new to the world of encryption, so please bear with me.
I would like to know if it's possible for me to use GPG to batch
encrypt my customers' orders and credit card numbers on a remote
third-party-hosted secure server.
Some (hopefully) helpful info:
My business website is hosted by a third party and obviously, I
don't have root access - I can only access my section.  I am able
to install and run .cgis in my section, though.  The website host
uses CGIWrap which creates some restrictions for .cgis when using
SSL.  For example, I can't use a .cgi to send an e-mail when SSL is
being used.
The encryption key would need to be located on the remote server
and I know the passphrase will need to be eliminated, but decryption
would be done only on my local machine after downloading the orders.
Does the website host need to install GPG for me?  Or can I install
and run it from my own directories somehow?  Can I use dev/random
even if I don't have access to that area?

I'm glad to hear that.  Yes, I can run executables. And, yes, it's
Actually, they were the ones who asked _me_ whether they would
need to install anything as 'root'.  That's why I wanted to know
if GPG could be installed by me in my own little section of the
server to work.  My other concern is being able to use the
capabilities of dev/random.
Also, do I need to compile GPG on the remote Linux machine or
can I compile it on a local Linux machine and just upload the
necessary files to the remote one?
I am looking through the archives as well.  But it seems that there
have been significant changes in GPG and I wanted to be sure I could
do what I want with the latest version (1.0.7).

@_subject: Trusted key problem with GPG 1.0.1 
First, thank you to those who helped me get started on my quest to
use GPG...
My website hoster shocked me a few days ago by letting me know that
they had installed GPG.  Then, to my disappointment, I learned it was
only v. 1.0.1.
Looking in the archives, I see that the trusted key problem has
occurred to some others, but I didn't see (or overlooked maybe?)
the solution.
I created a public and secret key on my home computer (using GPG
1.0.6 for Win32) and exported and uploaded the public key to the
remote server (running Redhat Linux).  There are no secret keys on
the remote server and I don't want any there.  I'm only encrypting.
Here is the public key (and it's self-signed):
pub  1024D/35FBF34C  created: 2002-05-14 expires: never      trust: f/q
sub  1024g/C17FB539  created: 2002-05-14 expires: never
(1)  GD LLC (gdo1) I type: gpg --always-trust -e -r gdo1 sample
But "--always-trust" does not seem to be working as per the man
since I get this message (I edited it a little here):
Could not find a valid trust path to the key.  Let's see whether we
can assign some missing owner trust values.
No path leading to one of our keys found.
1024g/C17FB539 2002-05-14 "GD LLC (gdo1) "
             Fingerprint: blah blah blah
It is NOT certain that the key belongs to its owner.
If you *really* know what you are doing, you may answer
the next question with yes
Use this key anyway?  I need to avoid all warnings and error messages since the encryption
will ultimately be called from a Perl .cgi script.
Any ideas?  I tried "--trusted-key" but 1.0.1 doesn't seem to support
this option.
BTW, with a little testing on my home computer, I was able to
determine that "--trusted-key" and "--always-trust" DO work with
1.0.6 for Win32

I also get the insecure memory warning.  Should this be happening if
they installed it as root?
Thanks for the noteworthy changes.  I'll write them immediately.  This
is the first time they've installed any encryption software.  I've
been requesting encryption modules for some time.  (For what it's
worth, from experience I know they do try to close at least some
exploitable holes.)
If necessary, can I install 1.0.7 for myself and use that instead
of their installed 1.0.1?
Thanks again,

@_subject: What's the proper way to make a key trusted? 
I had a little trouble with the 'trusted-key' command, too.
Here's the way I got it to work (There might be an easier way I
haven't found yet.) -
For a key with the ID "spoo", you would type:
gpg --list-keys --with-colons spoo
This will give you the 8 byte key ID (which is actually 16 hex
characters) among other things.  It will look something like this:
pub:q:1024:17:907CA66E6575F621:2002-05-16::64:-:GD LLC (spoo)
In this case "907CA66E6575F621" is the long key ID you need.
--trusted-key wants to decrypt by default (and won't permanently
change the trust value) on it's own.
So, to make this key trusted all the time, type:
gpg -e -r spoo --trusted-key 907CA66E6575F621 sample.txt
'sample.txt' can be any old file.  It doesn't matter what it encrypts
as long as it encrypts something AND the recipient ID matches
the trusted-key ID.
If you use --edit-key spoo, you'll see that the key is ultimately
trusted now.
