@_subject: Smartcards and tokens 
There's an important distinction to be made between using this approach
and using a SmartCard. The encrypted USB drive approach leaks the keys
into the machine you're using it from; they're accessible by simply
reading the filesystem (thus the claim that "When you unplug the USB,
your keys are gone." is wrong).  The keys in a SmartCard are write-only;
the SmartCard performs all the encryption on-chip.
You need to have an attack on the SmartCard to get the keys, while with
the USB drive approach, you just need to attack the host machine.

@_subject: PKA records 
I can't seem to find any up-to-date documentation on how to deploy DNS
PKA records for use with `auto-key-locate`. I tried `gpg
--export-options export-pka --export` and pasted those records directly
in DNS, and yet when I use `--auto-key-locate pka`, I get:
     error retrieving 'rmf at rmf.io' via PKA: Not found
The old PKA records (TXT "v=pka1; ...") had a URI, but I can see that
the new one that I exported only includes the key fingerprint, so it
obviously cannot be used for retrieval alone. What am I missing?
