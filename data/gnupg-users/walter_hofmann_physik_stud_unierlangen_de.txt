@_subject: What are fingerprints? 
The odds that two fingerprints end up being equal are
1:1461501637330902918203684832716283019655932542976 against (for 160 bit
fingerprints). This is zero for all practical purposes.

I guess one of them is wrong...

One disadvantage of this is that mailing list software may decide to
convert quoted printables to 8bit and thus invalidate the signature.
Like the one running this list did with a recent message
(<19991204161604.A2317 of mine!

Please note that the problem seems to be caused by a mail that was QP
encoded without an apparent need; there were no 8bit characters in it.
The Mail attachment that came from the list was 7bit/us-ascii encoded.
Unfortunately I configured mutt so that it doesn't save the attachment
in my local copy, so I cannot say exactly what was sent to the list. I
have however recreated the same message again & appended it to the end
of this one (not as an attachment & unsigned, hope this will get through
