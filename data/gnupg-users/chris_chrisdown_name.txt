@_subject: Using SCIM with GTK pinentry does not work 
I just tried with pinentry-qt4, and it works, so I guess I'll use that
for now. It would be nice if this was looked into, though. :-)

@_subject: Using SCIM with GTK pinentry does not work 
I use SCIM[0] to input Pinyin on Linux. This works with other programs,
but not the GTK pinentry dialog for gpg-agent.
In gpg-agent, no characters are recorded when I press keys. Disabling
SCIM fixes this problem, but that's not an acceptable solution for me --
I need it.
The changelog notes that this particular problem was fixed in 2009[1] in
2.0.13, but it still persists with 2.0.22 for me:
From the changelog:
I found some open bug entries[2] for this issue, which do not appear to
have been resolved.
The input method environment variables are in the pinentry program's
environment, but this still does not work.
Any ideas? Thanks.
