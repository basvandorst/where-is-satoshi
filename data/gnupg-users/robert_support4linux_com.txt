Hash: SHA1
I haven't encrypted messages in a long time and I was wondering if kmail =
behaving correctly. When I go to email someone that has a key on my keyri=
and encrypt it I get a pop up box in kmail that says a match couldn't be
found and to pick one from the list. Well the only one I can pick that wi=
let me thru is my own key. Is that correct?
I'm not sure if I should post this question in the kde forum or here so I
decided to start here.
