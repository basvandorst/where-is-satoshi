@_subject: Lost passphrase 
Wouldn't be much point in the passphrase if there were a way.. No,
unfortunately you're pretty much out of luck. When you make your new key,
make a revocation certificate at the same time and stash it somewhere
safe. This is a lesson I'm still learning, as you can tell by the various
public keys I have gently rotting on the keyservers.
Sorry I couldn't give you better news.
