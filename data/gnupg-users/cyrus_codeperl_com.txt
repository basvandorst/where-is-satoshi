@_subject: Generating a key using another algo 
Hello All, I was wondering how one could go about generating a key in GnuPG which doesn't use the AES-128 bit algo that it does by Default. PGP 8.x let's us do this by selecting our preferred algo in which any key we generate after that will be using that algo, so is there anyway that we can do so in GnuPG. I found something in an FAQ, but when I followed the instructions, it still did not work and was wondering if anyone else had any tips. Thanks.
