@_subject: newbie questions 
I'm new to gpg and I'm sure you can help me.
I created two main keys (twice --gen-key) and I added a second user ID to the first one. I can choose which one I take with the -u option. But how can I choose which user ID of the first main key to take? Do I always have to change it with "primary"?
I signed a document with the first key and then I decrypted it and gpg gave me both email addresses (I guess you know the English version):
gpg: Unterschrift vom Fr 11 Feb 2005 00:22:37 CET, DSA Schl?ssel ID gpg: Korrekte Unterschrift von "Sebastian Schubert "
gpg:                     alias "Sebastian Schubert "
So does it make sense to use several user IDs when everybody can see everything immediately? When I add or delete a user ID, do I have to get the signs for my key again?
Thanks for helping me
