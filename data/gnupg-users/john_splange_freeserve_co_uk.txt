"In electronic correspondence... signing before encrypting is a prudent
practice. Not only is it more secure - an adversary can't remove a
signature from an excrypted message and add his own - but there are legal
considerations: if the text to be signed is not visible to the signer
when he affixes his signature, then the signature may have little legal
force. And there some cryptanalytic attacks against this technique with
RSA signatures."

I don't think that's the point. The original poster was asking if such
a guide to cryptographic netiquette had been compiled anywhere. I can't
find such a thing myself, and nobody else has pointed one out.
That sort of suggests it needs doing, and who better than us, right? :)

one more:
Bruce Schneier once remarked that there were two kinds of cryptography in
the world: cryptography that will stop your kid sister reading your files,
and cryptography that will stop major governments from reading your files.
Storing your passphrase in the Windows registry would arguably change GnuPG
from a Type 2 crypto product to a Type 1. I'm not sure that's quite in
the spirit of the project.

@_subject: Bug: encrypt-to with no argument 
[GnuPG 1.0.6, Linux]
gpg can be made to die by putting an 'encrypt-to' command in the options file with no argument. For example:
gives this output on running any gpg command:
gpg: some signal caught ... exiting
Segmentation fault This only occurs if there is no whitespace or text after the 'encrypt-to'. Is this a known bug, or do I win some kind of substantial cash prize? :-)

There is a Perl script 'pgphtml':
which will sign (and, usefully, remove signatures from) HTML files. Though
the current release does not support GnuPG, I've sent the author a diff
to add this support, which should be published shortly.
This makes the process of signing and maintaining signed pages pretty
easy, though admittedly not cut & paste (easily bound to a vi macro
though). However, as released it puts a --- BEGIN PGP SIGNED WEB PAGE ---
banner at the top of the rendered page. You could remove that line from
the script if it annoys you.

pgpgpg does a reasonable job, though at the moment it just translates GnuPG
command-line options to PGP options, which doesn't work in every case. I
used to use it quite happily to make xfmail (which expects to find PGP)
talk to GnuPG.
Whether this would work with GPGME I couldn't say. If I were working on
a mail client (yeah, the world so needs another mail client) I'd be
inclined to simply steal the crypto frontend code from mutt. But you
didn't hear that from me.... right? :)

Yes, quite so. I didn't mean to suggest that pgpgpg would be useful in this
particular case. However it demonstrates the wrapper idea, and I dare say
the code would be a good starting point for writing a PGP wrapper.
Though using PGP when you could use GnuPG, especially if it costs you some
trouble to do so, seems to border on the perverse... ;o)
