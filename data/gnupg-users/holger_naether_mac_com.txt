Thank you Ben. I have actually received this hint this morning as well and tried it directly. When I was searching for solutions last night, I was getting stuck since I had no pgp-agent.conf in my ~/.gnupg directory. Only after being pointed to it directly this morning, I noticed that I just have to create it. Everything is working just as I would like it to now. So thank you so much for your support and help on this issue!
Best regards,

Hi guys,
I have a feeling something is not working for me as I intend it to, or as it was probably planned by the programmer.
My system details:
Operating system: Mac OS X 10.6.5
GPG version: 2.0.16
libgcrypt version: 1.4.6
GPGMail version: 1.3.1
When I boot up the system and start a program using gpg for the first time (after reboot), ie. Mail.app or PSI.app, everything is normal. To sign or encrypt requires my pass-phrase, as I also need it to verify or to decrypt. But after that I am not asked for the pass-phrase again.
I can close the programs completely and restart them, pinentry does not show up anymore and the signing/encryption/verification/decryption is done without the necessity of my pass-phrase. I can even log out of my user session and back in, and the same situation. Only after a complete reboot of the computer, I am asked exactly once per program for my pass-phrase. It seems to be stored somewhere, but I have no idea where. I don't want it to be stored, I want to enter it, whenever needed.
I have checked within GPGMail, where the option to always ask for the phrase is set. I have checked the Keychain.app, but no phrase is stored there. I have checked the net, but am not getting any hits since ... well, I have to admit I'm not even sure how to pass my question on to google; what to search for.
I hope one of you might have experienced something like this before and can give me a short hint as to where to look.
Thanks and best regards,

As far as I understand the manual page of gpg2, it should be the option "--no-tty" to be used.
--no-tty Make  sure  that  the  TTY  (terminal) is never used for any output.  This option is needed in some cases because GnuPG sometimes prints warnings to the TTY even if --batch is used.
So instead of -q or --quiet, you should use --no-tty. For example:
gpg2 --decrypt --no-tty abc.gpg
