Hash: SHA1
I use KMail 1.3.1, so this should work:
Settings -> Configure Kmail -> Security -> PGP -> Encryption Tool:
   Select GPG
Settings -> Configure Kmail -> Identity:
   Set the "PGP User Identity" box to desired key-id for signing.
   You can use other values than the key-id (like the e-mail address),
   but make sure the following returns exactly one correct value:
     "gpg --list-keys [value-from-kmail-pgp-identity-box]"
Settings -> Composer -> General:
   If you wish to sign all outbound e-mail by default, select the
   box "Automatically sign messages using PGP".
GPG Configuration
KMail can contact a keyserver to verify signatures from keys that
are not in your keyring.  To enable this, set the value "keyserver"
in $HOME/.gnupg/options to your desired keyserver.
Sending Mail (From the Composer window)
If you wish to sign an e-mail, click on the sign icon on the top
toolbar.  To encrypt e-mail, click on the lock icon.  In order to encrypt, you must already have the recipient's public
key in your keyring.  The current version of KMail/KDE does not
provide a GUI for adding public keys to your keyring, but I
believe people are working on this.
If you wish to send someone your public key, do the following
from your composer window:
   Attach -> Attach my public key

@_subject: GUI mail reader w/ GPG under UNIX [Solution!] 
Hash: SHA1
People on this list frequently ask if Netscape/Mozilla Messenger will
ever integrate PGP support.  I've been waiting years for this, and
I've finally found a better solution (at least for Linux/UNIX users):
  Ditch Messenger and use KMail!
Recent versions of this mailer rock (my review is of 1.3.1).  I use it
under KDE, but it appears to work just fine under GNOME also.  Here's
why I think it's worth switching:
  o  Straightforward GPG integration!!  Encrypting and signing are
     simple icon clicks.  Signature verification is automatic.
     Decryption, of course, requires a password.
  o  HTML e-mail viewing has 3 modes:
     x  Don't view as HTML, just show me the text (Mutt/Pine mode)
     x  View, but don't load external references (My mode)
     x  View AND load external refs (Insecure Messenger mode)
  o  Easy to configure filters (no need to learn procmail!).
  o  All the GUI folder/message manipulation that Messenger provides.
  o  There's scripts available to convert your Messenger nsmail
     directory over to the folder formats used by KMail.  (And I
     think KMail folders and in the same format as Pine.)
So all you Messenger users can stop complaining (like I used to) and
start sending PGP mail today!
