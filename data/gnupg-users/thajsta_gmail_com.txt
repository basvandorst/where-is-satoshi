Have you ever thought about GPG4WIN? It is not accessible for me since I
use a screen reader and because of that I think the graphical user
interface needs some serious work, but I hear it works well for others.

The only thing I use is the Enigmail extension for Mozilla Thunderbird
which works well enough for me, but of course I must use the version 1
branch of GnuPG.

accept for that of GPG4WIN.

Version 1.4.11 is still the latest of that branch, right? That is what
the download page says but some times there are later versions than what
is reported. Media Player Classic is a good example of this.

I strongly suggest Ultimate ZIP Cracker at vdgsoftware.com/uzc.html if I

software I have ever used and trust me when I say I have used many of
the kind. Beware that it is resource intensive if you configure it as such.

@_subject: Location of GnuPG 1.4.11 Windows binary 
You must have missed my enquiry from some time in July. I was looking
for it as well only to copy the link location of one of the FTP links
and do some self-searching. It would be useful if they announce 1.x.x
upgrades so people will not have to randomly decide when to check the
directory for an upgrade. I installed GPG4WIN and uninstalled it because
it was just too much for me and the 1.x.x branch is more simple for me
anyway since I only need it for the Enigmail extension.

I was wondering something similar. I have a few keys which I have
invalidated and disabled but there is no way to delete them. I am using
this new key which I have not uploaded because if something happens and
I must re-create the key that will too become just clutter on the server.

@_subject: It Is Gone 
Six days ago I received my machine from repair. I am now running Windows 7 Ultimate and am ready to get back into the Enigmail scene after settling in with Firefox and Thunderbird. However, when I navigated to the download page on GnuPG.org the familiar table was not there. Where did the GnuPG package go? I do not like GPG4WIN because it installs all that other inaccessible and unnecessary software not to mention it installs GnuPG version 2 which requires that other thing that deals with pass phrases and version 1.4.11 [the last version I used] was more easy to work with. Can somebody please link to or refer me to the site that contains the latest version 1 of GnuPG? Thanks.

Thanks. I should have known better to ask before I copied an FTP's link
location from the page. They made it a bit more difficult for me since
they no longer link it directly but as long as the FTP server is still
in existence I should be able to find it.

Hello. I use Enigmail, so of course I have GnuPG installed. I use 1.4.9
because [1] I can not find an executable for 2.0.17 for Windows, and [2]
I do not know how to configure the GPG-agent. Can somebody please assist
me with upgrading to 2.0.17 and configuring the agent? For about a week
I have been searching everywhere but found nothing. I did install
GPG4WIN then uninstalled it because I could not figure out how to use
the agent and the GPA utility is not screen reader accessible. Thanks in
advance for your help.
PS. I am blind and use a screen reader. Everything must be 100% keyboard

@_subject: RSA Versus DSA and EL GAMAL 
I apologise in advance if this is a stupid question to ask now or if
people already asked it before I stepped on the scene, but which
algorithm is more secure: DSA and EL GAMAL or RSA? I know the latter has
undergone a ridiculous amount of scrutiny and is immensely popular. I
also know it generates longer keys.
I have a 4096 RSA key but really never found the answer whilst searching
beforehand which one to choose. I know 4096 is much better than 2048, so
I can not figure out why Enigmail defaults to a 2048 instead of 4096 but
whatever. I am not concerned about speed; I will gladly sacrifice speed
for security any day. As always, thanks for the future lessons.

I think I made the mistake of using HTML format the first time then
learnt my signature failed to validate. I realised it was because of the
HTML check box being checked; thus, I have disabled that. I have also
disabled the text signature for replies.

@_subject: For Windows 
I use a screen reader called JAWS For Windows. The GUI is not screen
reader accessible, meaning I can not use the Arrow keys, Tab, Shift+Tab
and any other navigational keys to use the GPA utility like you can with
the mouse. I really hate that; people have no idea how much it annoys
me. I might write to the GPG4WIN developers if I can track down their
information. The command-line utility of GnuPG is more verbose than that.

Hahahaha, the RSA versus DSA is a question I asked earlier this week I
believe. You might wish to rummage through the archives for that short
conversation. I would use RSA due to its ridiculous amount of sscrutiny
over the years, but be sure to set your preferences and choose a 4096
over 2048. Doing these will increase security provided the recipient has
their security tightened as well.

It seems no matter which key server I try I encounter the alert saying
nothing can be found. This is very annoying. Does anybody know what the
problem is and how I can fix it? I can not seem to find a list of key
servers online. All I want to do is search for one's public key and
import it but I can not.

Firstly, what is MUA? I hear that but am not sure what that means.
Secondly, I have disabled that in Thunderbird. I had no idea it modified
anything; I thought it was simply a text signature that did not
interfere with Enigmail and GnuPG. Thanks for enabling me to understand
the complication there.

I do not use the Gmail interface any more; I only use the Thunderbird
client and typed the signature in the edit field found in the Tools |
Account options | General dialogue. It always appears in the body, right
under the point where I type. If this is the case it should not
interfere with Enigmail or GnuPG, correct?
PS. I learnt my lesson about including any signature for a mailing list.

Something to think about that one. I guess I will experiment in the
future, but I understand what you mean and you do have a point with the
question > answer order rather than the reverse. Now I understand why
Thunderbird has that option.

@_subject: what are the sub keys 
Exactly. Computation time is nothing nowadays. If that was the case,
those who use 1024 bit keys I would think still use the SHA1 hash
algorithm. But now people such as myself use SHA512 and 4096 bit RSA
keys, and if I could use a 8192 bit RSA key and the new SHA512/256
algorithm that I think was published just this past 02 February I would.

@_subject: what are the sub keys 
Would not it be 4096 with RSA, or is DSA in conjunction with a 4096 bit
key still popular? I have never used DSA so does what Robert said
pertaining to my used combination apply here?

Enigmail allows only 1024, 2048 and 4096. I have never heard of that,
but even still I would personally choose the largest key for the time
being till RSA becomes obsolete. Is there anything larger than 4096
since you mentioned values unknown to me?

I really wish 8192 would become available. Not that it would be the end
all/be all of key security but according to your theory it sounds much
more difficult to crack.

Well excuse me for not knowing it all. I only know what Enigmail allows
through its user interface, and bad judgement is sometimes a method of
learning for better decision making. I have only begun using both GnuPG
and Enigmail this month along with Thunderbird, and this list educated
me a lot since I have been subscribed. Anything else you would like to
point out? I apologise if I come off mean in any way.

It is no longer shown but it is available at
ftp.gnupg.org/gnupg/binaries or something of the sort. Copy one of the
link locations that link to the source code and modify that path in the
location bar. It is inconvenient no doubt but it works.
I hope there will be updates to the 1.x branch because I use it with
Enigmail and have no use for the PGP agent that I read is mandatory in
the 2.x branch.
