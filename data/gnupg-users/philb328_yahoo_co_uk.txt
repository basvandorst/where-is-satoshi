@_subject: Using notations on data signatures 
I'm a bit confused about --sig-notation.  Suppose I detach-sign a file; is it
reasonable to use notations to briefly comment on it? e.g.,   --sig-notation user at some.domain="This loan application is approved."
(Not dealing with loans really, but needed some example....)
Is the notation part of the signed data (whereas the comment headers aren't)
so that tampering with the notation is evident?
