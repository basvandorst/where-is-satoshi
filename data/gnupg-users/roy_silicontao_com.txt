@_subject: GunPG error and GPA error. 
I am trying to get GPA working but ever time I try to encrypt a file I get "error accessing file", these are my sets.
1) Start GPA
2) Select Windows -> File Manger
3) Select Open
4) Select a file to encrypt
5) Select encrypt
6) Select the public key of the person I want to send it to
7) Look at undiscript dialog that only says "error accessing file"
So I try to runt the command line... below is what happens.
Basicly, it complains about some path that I can't find in the docmentation any where, "trust path" what ever that is, then it asks if I want to continue. I type yes and it encrypts it. I send it out and the receiver can decrpyt it using GPA. But neither of us can make GPA encrypt any thing.
Any help would be great.
------ Out put from command line useing gpg -----------
[roy roy]$ gpg --encrypt 16c5x.pdf
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
You did not specify a user ID. (you may use "-r")
Enter the user ID: Dave Thompson
Could not find a valid trust path to the key.  Let's see whether we
can assign some missing owner trust values.
No path leading to one of our keys found.

It is NOT certain that the key belongs to its owner.
If you *really* know what you are doing, you may answer
the next question with yes
Use this key anyway? yes

I had to sign the keys of other people before I could encrypt to them.
This is a good idea if the receiver got confimation that I encrypted it, but that does not seem to be happening. We will keep playing with it.
