@_subject: delete key from batch mode problem 
I would like to delete key from batch mode. But when --batch option is present it gpg answer :
gpg: can't do that in batchmode
gpg: (unless you specifiy the key by fingerprint)
I don't find in documentation how to specify a key by fingerprint. So, My question is :
How to specify a key by fingerprint or where can i find doc on this ?
Hope for your help...
