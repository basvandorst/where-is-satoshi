What does the usage letters mean in the key listing?
  usage: CS
  usage: SEA
What does SEA stand for? I think S and E stand for Signing and Encryption  respectively but what about A and C?

use the command line options '--symmetric' for encrypting symmetrically. Here's a sample:
$ gpg --cipher-algo AES256 --symmetric file.ext
where --cipler-algo list can be obtained from: gpg --version

Hash: SHA1
I have two encryption keys and three signing keys:
pub  4096R/057AC4BC  created: 2005-12-08  expires: never       usage: CS
sub  4096R/0DBBD3FD  created: 2005-12-08  expires: never       usage: SEA
sub  4096g/E3DD0205  created: 2005-12-29  expires: 2006-04-29  usage: E
sub  1024D/CC89E9DE  created: 2005-12-30  expires: 2006-04-30  usage: S
but while signing a message, GnuPG uses the DSA key as the default signing
key and the ELG-E key as the default encryption key. Is there a way to spe
cify which subkey GnuPG should use to sign/encrypt?
For example this message was signed using the 1024-bit DSA key using the
SHA1 digest algorithm.

When I select the SHA256 algo, gpg returns an error that DSA will use nothing more than a good 160 bit algo. Thanks for the help though.

there is something called MDC in the features list. What is it and how do I benefit from it? I found some info here but didn't knew what to do with it:

@_subject: Using other compression algos with GnuPG 
The current version of GnuPG I have supports only three compression
algorithms viz: ZIP, ZLIB and BZIP2
Is there a way to direct GnuPG to use some other algorithm besides
these? for example RAR (

@_subject: How to protect private keys? 
The private keys are encrypted even in exported form. Anyone who can grab your private key will need your passphrase to decrypt it. By default, GnuPG uses the cipher CAST5 to encrypt private keys. You can change that with the --s2k-* options. However, for a hacker, having something to decrypt or maybe brute force it is much better than having nothing at all. Keeping this in mind, try to keep your private keys private. Like keep them in a portable USB key or something similar.
