What's wrong with that?  From what I see, 0x42473204 has no other outside
signatures that would allow a path.  If you didn't have this path, you'd
have none at all.
Also, this may be a slightly better path:
5 steps from 0x14964AC8 to 0x2A94C484
0x14964AC8 (Greg Sabino Mullane ) signs
0x69A38ADE (Peter M Kahle Jr. ) signs
0xE26A6F28 (Alexander Pennace ) signs
0xF5C75256 (Russell Coker ) signs
0x91B0D3B7 (Dirk Eddelbuettel ) signs
0x2A94C484 (Kyle Hasselbacher )
I actually met Dirk and presented an ID and everything.  Jason's signature
is just a persona sig.
