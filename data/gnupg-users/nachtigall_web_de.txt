@_subject: Flexibility when using photos 
Dear all, I just created my first own key pair and thought about adding a photo. If I add a photo, will it later still be possible to change this photo while keeping this key pair (in case I get this green colour one day ;-) ?
Has adding a photo any negative sideeffects, i.e. compatibility problems with older versions or with pgp?
Couldn't find anything in the docs about this,
