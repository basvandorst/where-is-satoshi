@_subject: Integrate pinentry-mac into pinentry 
Whatever happens here, a vanilla pinentry MUST still be buildable on older
MacOSX systems.  Pinentry-mac and its Xcodeproj have long since abandoned
10.4, 10.5, and (I think) 10.6.  Users on those systems should still be
able to build a non-GUI pinentry (as they can now), so an Xcode project
should only come into play for newer systems.
