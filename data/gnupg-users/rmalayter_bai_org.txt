That's really not true. Cracking the asymmetric keys would allow the
attacker to read *all* of the victim's mail. Cracking the symmetric
session key would allow him to read just one message. The
public/private keypair is a much more attractive target.
By brute-force, is completely infeasible to crack a 128-bit symmetric
key. However, 512-bit asymmetric keys *have* been cracked by brute
force using the General Number Field Sieve. The 1024-bit symmetric
keys used in OpenPGP could be vulnerable to brute-force.
Attacks on large asymmetric keys will be possible in the near future.
A 1024-bit asymmetric key is *not* 2^512 times as strong as a 512 bit
key. The complexity GNFS algoritm is O(e^(1.923
+(ln(n))^(1/3)*(ln(ln(n)))^(2/3))), so factoring a 1024-bit asymmetric
key us only about 200,000 times as hard as factoring a 512-bit
asymmetric key. This will probably happen within a few years, as
computing power increases and factoring algorithms get even better.
Basically, if you're attacking an OpenPGP user, and resorting to brute
force (which you probably wouldn't have to do in practice), an attack
on the asymmetric key is the only smart one.

@_subject: working on a shred for win32 
After reading the list archives about GnuPG's lack of a --wipe option on any
platform, and then looking at and trying many of the free/shareware Windows
file wipers out there, I decided to try to port Gnu fileutil's shred to a
GPL'd native windows command-line util. Sourceforge's otherwise excellent
windows-native ports of Gnu fileutils is missing shred. BCwipe is great, but
overkill for my situation, and a bit uweildly to manage as it requires a
local install on the destination machine.
I waded into the Gnu shred source code, and decided a feature-for-feature
port of shred was beyond my rusty C and meager Win32 API knowledge. So I
wrote a simple, single-executable DOD 5220.22-compliant shredder in ANSI C
using the free windows-native lcc environment. However, I'm having an issue:
How can I force non-cached file writes with the Win32 API? Lcc includes
Win32 libraries, but I was sticking with fopen() hoping that fflush() would
suffice for forcing data to disk. I've poked around MSDN, but I'm a DBA and
network admin, not a Win32 developer, so I had a tough time. General MSDN
searches on 'file cache', 'foce flush', etc. turn up too much noise to be
useful. Currently, my fflush() and fclose() don't overcome Windows file
caching. So despite the 32 passes I make shredding the file, I'm getting
only one overwrite on media before deletion.
Thanks for any insights,

@_subject: Still problems with compatibility 
You you need to use the --force-v3-sigs option for GnuPG. Despite claims to
the contrary, NAI's PGP 6.x-7.x are not fully OpenPGP compliant. OpenPGP
secifies v4 signature format as default for all signatures, including
message signatures. NAI PGP seems to supports v4 signatures only for
self-signatures used in key storage and exchange, not for message
Section 5.2 of RFC 2440 has details of the differences between the key
formats. Basically, the fingerprint algorithm on v4 signatures is a bit more
secure because it takes the length of the signature into account.
Since all implementations of PGP and OpenPGP accept v3 signatures for
messages, you can use --force-v3-sigs without too much worry.

This was discussed a few days ago on this list, but I realized I sent my
solution to the questioner, not the list. So here goes:
Export the keys from your current version of PGP into an ASCII armored file.
If it's a command-line version, probably something like:
     pgp -a -kx  exportpub.asc pubring.pkr
     pgp -a -kx  exportsec.asc secring.skr
If you have a GUI version of PGP (e.g. Mac or Windows), follow the GUI
instructions for key export, using ASCII armor rather than binary format.
To import into GnuPG, do this for both public and private keys:
     Gpg --import exportpub.asc
     gpg --import --allow-secret-key-import exportsec.asc

Thanks for pointing me in the right direction, Janke.
I've now got a working shred utility (created in the MinGW environment so it
can be GPL'd) which does unbuffered writes and uses CryptoAPI to generate
secure random data for overwrites. I've got to do some sort of byte-by-byte
writing with small files (which are stored directly in the MFT on NTFS
systems), and add a bit more error checking, and I'll post it.
If anyone has suggestions as to how to force overwrites on small files
stored directly in the MFT, please let me know. FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH will
work in this case, but FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING will not, since it is not a
full-sector write. I'm thinking a byte-by-byte overwrite of the small file,
followed by a call to FlushFileBuffers() will do the trick, but I'm not
quite sure if NTFS will force the write out to the MFT as it does with a
standard file in a standard sector.

when using FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING:
*File access must begin at byte offsets on disk that are integer multiples

are integer multiples of the volume's sector size.  For example, if the
sector size is 512 bytes, an application can request reads and writes of
512, 1024, or 2048 bytes.  You'll probably want a buffer of 4096 bytes.
*Buffer addresses IN MEMORY for read and write operations should be sector
aligned (aligned on addresses in memory that are integer multiples of the
volume's sector size). One way to align buffers on integer multiples of the
volume sector size is to use VirtualAlloc to allocate the buffers.

Even if you only used the 32 lower case letters, and your passphrase was

of years and every (conventional) computing machine on earth. A
general-purpose quantum computer might theoretically be able to crack it in
a short time frame, but such a device has not yet been publicly announced -
maybe the NSA has one.
If your passphrase is 36 characters long and made up of dictionary words
separated by spaces, well, that makes a brute force attack a lot easier -
but certainly not *easy.* 50,000 english words at 5 characters (average)
apiece, separated with spaces... That makes 5 English words in the
passphrase. That's still 80+ bits of entropy. Distributed.net has been
trying to brute force a 64-bit password for 3+ years using the equivalent of
250,000+ Pentium 300s. And distributed.net is only a bit more than halfway
Unless your original passphrase was quite short, a brute force attack is
probably not feasible. If you consider a passphrase using only the 96
"typable" characters on a standard PC keyboard, any passphrase longer than 7
characters (96^7 ~ 2^46, or a 46-bit passphrase) is probably not crackable
using a the computing resources available to an individual.
If you were careless enough to make your passphrase was a single dictionary
word, it can probably be cracked in minutes, if not seconds, by simply
trying every word in a dictionary.

This seems kind of pointless to me. Okay, so maybe this-or-that
implementation of PGP does fix the high-order bit of a generated key at 1.
You could be fooling an attacker who is simply trying an exhaustive keyspace
search by using a 1023-bit key. But this attacker would be a moron, and not
much to worry about.
I'm no mathemetician, but from what I've read it seems that the General
Number Field Sieve (currently the best factoring algorithm) doesn't work
like a brute-force keyspace search at all: it will factor any length of
number smaller than the limit implemented by the programmer. If the
programmer codes for 1024-bit keys, his algorithm will factor 1023-bit keys
as well. (Can any academics out there confirm this?)

Factoring the 1024-bit public key would be easiest. Assuming each character
in that passphrase was really chosen randomly, it represents over 400 bits
of entropy. This means it is stronger than any common symmetric cipher, even
256-bit AES. So strong, in fact, as to be pointlessly long.

easier than brute-forcing a 400 bit entity.

Point taken. Still, though, this is good news for PGP on the corporate
Windows desktop. We've tried to substitute GPG and various shells, and
our tech people were fine with it, but our regular users just hated
everything we tired. Although the security issues of closed-source
encryption software are worrisome, there's nothing open-source I've seen
that comes close to the PGP suite's ease-of-use.

studied the functionality issues and licensing & training costs. And
feature-rich groupware (which includes a lot more than email), like
vertical-market app support, is one of the major stumbling blocks
preventing us from going for the open-source desktop.

I think you're missing something big. Doesn't PGP 8 output
OpenPGP-compatible files and key material? Which will, presumably,
always be readable by GnuPG, right? This the whole point of open
standards and RFC documents: compatibility.
I use GnuPG and open source shells, but I'm an engineer. I didn't choose
GnuPG because I think it's a better program than PGP 8. I chose it
because it's open-source, and I understand why that's important for
Windows users, on the other hand, obviously trust at least one
commercial software developer, so why shouldn't we encourage PGP 8.0's
use by the Windows masses?  Presuming they like it's simpler interface,
trust the software developers, and are willing to pay for it? By and
large, the windows masses will never use GnuPG - so what's the harm in
promoting PGP 8?
The only way to get widespread use by non-technical types of GnuPG is to
have a really slick GUI design with nice a nice installer, great
documentation, and good technical support. These are the sort of
"non-programming" tasks that commercial software developers do ten times
better than free software projects. (Notice: I did not state that either

the VB program via DataStage, I can no longer find the public keys I

mess with the path.  But, before I hurt myself too badly, I thought I
would ask you experts.  Any advise?

The problem is most likely the encryption algorithm used by GPG on
the private keys. I have always been able to export and import a
private key by removing the password from the private key, exporting
it with the --rfc1991 option on GPG into an asci file, then importing
it into PGP. Then you can re-apply your passphrase to both your GPG
and PGP keyrings.
An unencrypted private key is, of course, a security problem. Make
sure you shred your intermediate file with PGP's tools, and any of
the .bak files that the commercial PGP autmatically makes of your

The Windows CryptoAPI provides a pretty good system entropy pool, much like

this amount of timing data - combined with the pre-existing random seed pool
- certainly seems viable. Key generation in GnuPG actually seems pretty slow to me, especially on

I was wondering this because back in '97 when I generated a PGP key using
the 'slow' method I had to move the mouse, tap keys, etc. to generate
entropy and then wait a while while it calculated a key.
In the options file it makes reference to unix random number generators but
doesn't mention how Windows operates..
Also keygen on GnuPG seems awfully fast.. granted I have an XP 1700 which is
a significant improvement from what I had in '97, but still shouldn't it
take longer than a few seconds to generate a 2048 key?

I downloaded the GnuPG 1.06 source, and looked at the file rndw32.c.
It appears that GnuPG doesn't use CryptoAPI for random generation on Windows
at all. This is understandable. GnuPG is open-source, and it wouldn't want
to trust a closed-source program for something as security-critical as an
entropy gatherer. What GnuPG does do is read a multitude of performance counters and system
timers, check for # of bytes free in memory and on disk, and hash all the
results together with the random_seed file. One could argue that these
closed-source sources of data are just as suspect as CryptoAPI, but
whatever. The basic RNG design appears to use a fast pool / slow pool scheme
similar to that used in the very secure Yarrow RNG. See
 for more details.
All in all, I think this is a pretty good entropy collection mechanism.
Although I would like to see GnuPG use the hardware RNG present in newer
Intel chipsets, I don't think Intel supports accesssing it through anything
other than CryptoAPI. Maybe I'm wrong.
I'd also like an option in GnuPG to distill entropy from the noise of a
sound card with a disconnected microphone, but I suppose that, too is asking
a bit much of Werner and Co.

You can look at the source code to find out if it uses CryptoAPI. I don't
think it does.
I couldn't find any mention of GnuPG in Sam Simpson's FAQ, but I know that
GnuPG uses it own a random seed file and conservative entropy estimates when
generating keys. It will wait for keyboard interrupts, mouse movements, etc,
to make sure it has enough entropy.
GnuPG (and PGP) work securely even without an OS-level secure RNG. When a
random number is requested, some portion of the random seed file, some
system counters and clock data, and some keyboard and mouse timing events
are collected and hashed with SHA-1. Some of the results are hashed again,
and inserted into random seed to replace the 'used' entropy with 'new'
entropy. This is pretty secure, as long as your memory contents or random
seed file are not compromised.

I'm also wondering if this means usage of GnuPG on non-unix systems is

random number generator it should not be used 'in ernest' on non-unix
systems which I read as a polite way to say 'not trustworthy'.

Maybe. Any group English words, even the first letters of the words of a

many times more English words start with C than with X, and most
sentences begin with an article or other short word like "the". Your
suggestion would be a very bad method of selecting random characters.
If you want 128 bits of security from a random combination of the 95
non-whitespace characters typeable on a U.S. keyboard, you need just 20
characters. But you need to use an ASCII chart and dice or another truly
random source to pick the letters well.
For example, this passphrase has ~131 bits of true entropy (truly random
ASCII numbers taken from Certainly secure, but I don't think I could remember that, or type it
accurately. If you used DiceWare instead, this would be a passphrase of
10 randomly chosen English words, all lower case. Definitely longer, but
easier to remember and type correctly.
I personally think that using an 128-bit passphrase is overkill, as
anything passphrase of around 80 bits (13 random chars/7 DiceWare words)
is out of reach for the foreseeable future. It's taken distributed.net
more than 4 years with hundreds of thousands of computers to brute-force

Easier to use, maybe, but probably less secure. You only have 65
distinct syllables in your chart. That means there's about 6 bits of
entropy per syllable. So you need 11(!) syllables to match the strength
of a 5-word diceware password. If you're only using 4 syllables as in
your example, you have a mere 24 bits of entropy in your passphrase -
which means it can be brute-forced in seconds on a single modern PC.
Here are some 11-syllable example passwords I produced with your system:
I'd hardly call those easy to remember, even if it is shorter to type
than a diceware password. Have you considered adding more syllables to
your system, using digraphs and trigraphs for consonants?

@_subject: Secret splitting w/ threshold 
I was about to implement a custom secret-splitting threshold scheme for our
corporate officers, using Shamir's polynomial method and a simple
spreadsheet to do the math.
Then I considered doing a simple geometirc scheme, giving each officer the
equation of a line and letting the secret be the intersection of two or more
of these in cartesian space. This scheme would be simpler for the execs to
reconstruct in an emergency without technical help. In fact, the whole
reconstruction process could be described on the back of the laminated
"secret card" I'm going to give them.
As I understand it, both of these schemes are equally secure, presuming
large enough numbers are used as coefficients. Can anybody offer a reason
why I shouldn't choose the easier geometic scheme?
Also, it occurs to me that there is probably a good open-source program that
implement this sort of thing, although my Googleing bore no such fruit. Does
anyone have a good link to a simple, secure secret-sharing program?
Finally, the secret-sharing built into the commercial PGP, while pretty
neat, was only useful for PGP key material. I wish to share 10-20 bytes of
passphrase material. What secret sharing capabilites are coming in GnuPG?
Will it be able to share any secret?

@_subject: Secret splitting w/ threshold 
The Shamir and geometric threshold schemes are fairly straightforward and
secure protocols, so the usability design isn't really an issue. Simply feed
your sharing program it N shares (as files or whatever), in any order, and
it reconstructs and displays the secret. What's really needed, I suppose,
would be a standard message format that would encapsulate the sharing
algorithm used, the degree of the (m,n) threshold scheme, and the actual
data associated with the share. I would think OpenPGP packet formats could
handle this easily, with appropriate additions to the list of algorithms.
Of course, the question is, is a secret splitting feature useful enough for
it to be added to the OpenPGP standard? I think so. Heck, every organization
should probably share it's administrative pass phrases and keys in such a
secure manner.
Or perhaps a separate, simple "Open Threshold Scheme" standard, based on the
OpenPGP packet format, would be a better idea. Some form of standard is
desirable so that shares can be recovered universally. If I make a custom
program to split disaster recovery passwords for my executives, but both
myself and my custom share combining program are inaccessible when a
disaster recovery needs to be occur, the whole exercise was pointless.
Signing isn't really the issue. My intent is to share an administrative pass
phrase such that any two executives can get together and reconstruct it, but
one executive losing or compromising his "secret card" doesn't compromise
the pass phrase.

Maybe not in one or two sentences ;)
In an encrypted, but not signed message, it is theoretically possible
to modify the message by inserting more encrypted bytes into the
middle.  Sort of like transforming "Hi Fred, I hope you are well" into
"Hi Fred, you rotten bastard, I hope you are doing badly and soon fall
down a well".
Signing prevents this problem, as the signature would not be valid on
a modified message.  However, GnuPG also supports the MDC
(modification detection code) feature of OpenPGP which includes a
mini-signature inside the encrypted data which can also prevent this
without signing.

Tampering isn't the point. Check out that reference I posted earlier.
Basically, it summarizes as:

but you don't know who originally wrote or encrypted the message.
E(S(m)) has the vulnerability that you know who originally wrote and

S(E(S(m))) prevents both of these vulnerabilites, provided that the
inner and outer signatures are both valid and made from the same

don't do it in one step, on the encryption or decryption end.

This is nearly impossible, unless the method for generating the pass
phrase is known, or a standard method for pass phrase generation,
like the one at  is used.
For example, the pass phrase "Ryan is great" isn't very high-quality
if it's mine, since my first name is Ryan. If it's your pass phrase,
the pass phrase is a bit better, but still no better than 53 bits of
entropy: 3*log2(250000). This is because there are about 250000
English words, and you're using three of them.
If your pass phrase is composed of random characters, the formula for
bit strength is simple: N*log2(M), where N is the number of
characters in the passphrase, and M is the number of allowed
characters. For a U.S. keyboard and a 12 character passphrase, this
works out to about 12*log2(95), or 79 bits of entropy - about
equivalent to the 1024-bit private key it protects.

Not too complicated... The Modified CFB used in OpenPGP is inherently

For some reason, Win32 ports of GnuPG 1.1.91 doesn't appear to handle
the REG_EXPAND_SZ registry data type correctly.
For example, I want to change the HKLM\Software\GNU\GnuPG\HomeDir
setting from a static string data type to a REG_EXPAND_SZ type, with
value "C:/Documents and Settings/%USERNAME%/Application Data/GnuPG".
This should, in theory, allow multiple users to have individualized
options for GnuPG on the same machine. The %USERNAME% is supposed to be
replaced by the current user when the value is read from the registry,
returning a customized user's Windows 2000 profile path for each user.
I thought Windows would handle this variable replacement itself, because
it works transparently for several other programs I use frequently.
However, when I change HomeDir to REG_EXPAND_SZ with the value mentioned
above, I get these errors from GnuPG:
gpg: keyblock resource `C:/Documents and Settings/%USERNAME%/Application
Data/GnuPG\secring.gpg': file open error
gpg: keyblock resource `C:/Documents and Settings/%USERNAME%/Application
Data/GnuPG\pubring.gpg': file open error
Obviously, %USERNAME% isn't getting replaced as it theoretically should.

are multi-user machines, and I cannot expose the same key rings to both
users. This issue is my only remaining stumbling block; I've got

HKEY_CURRENT_USER for a configuration value, and if they don't find it,
look for a global setting under the same key in HKEY_CURRENT_MACHINE. I
think GnuPG should probably work the same way.
That way you can set up a REG_EXPAND_SZ variable
HomeDir=3D"%APPDATA%\GnuPG" in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE that will work for all
users. But this default HomeDir value could still be overridden and
customized by each indiviudal user if desired.

course, if you're not an Exchange server shop, but use POP3 or IMAP

2) You cannot decrypt OpenPGP messages without the private key and
pass-phrase of the sender, and then only if they encrypted the
message to themselves. This is the whole point of PGP. If you don't
have the private key and pass phrase, or if the messages weren't
encrypted to the user himself as well as the recipient, you'll have
to trust the *recipients* of the encrypted messages to forward you
unaltered copies of the encrypted messages. Basically, if the OpenPGP
user didn't want those messages recovered, you're screwed.
3) You (supposedly) cannot decrypt an encrypted PST file if the

is relatively weak, since it is "compressible", so there may be a

than 64 bits of entropy--it shouldn't matter much if your private key
ring file is backed up to a tape you don't control or is accidentally
left on some disk somewhere. In this scenario, any conceivable attacker
would be much better off torturing your pass-phrase out of you than
trying to attack your private key ring file.=20
Are you a spy, a defense contractor, an revolutionary, a terrorist, or a
government official? If not, you probably don't need to worry about
someone expending the huge resources needed to crack your private key
ring file so they can surreptitiously read your encrypted messages
without your knowledge. You need to match your level of paranoia to the
threat you face.
Now, if you have a weak pass-phrase with less than 64 bits of entropy,
well, you need to think about wiping disks & backup media, or more
probably revoking you key.
Also, if others in your company had root-level access to your
workstation, then you can consider your key compromised. Any one of them
could have put a keystroke logger on your machine a long time ago to
capture your pass-phrase.

You could certainly store keyring files in a SQL database, then extract
them from to a unique temporary filename when need. Use random hex
characters of something to preface the temporary file name. Then you can
call GPG like this:
    gpg --keyring 0431265474Fpubring.gpg --secret-kering
0431265474Fsecring.gpg Then set up a background thread that cleans up old keyring files /
directories based on date.
You should have a sufficient number of random characters in your prefix
to prevent any possible collisions for security's sake. I would suggest
at least 32 random hex digits, or 22 characters if you use base64

It's at least as secure as storing each user's key in a separate
directory on the server. All you need to do is make sure your random
temporary filename space is large enough that there are no collisions,
your random numbers are generated well (with GnuPG itself?), and the
user's SSL session is protected from hijacking using best practices.
It is of course uglier than using the data directly from the DB;
however, I've seen loads of commercial and purpose-built web apps that
use per-session temporary files. Some times it's the only way to
interface with a particular program on the web server.
Your other option is to use the GnuPG source or the GPGme library to
build a special version that accesses the keyrings directly from a
database. This is what open source software is all about.

Gotta love the old "birthday" paradox... it is the reason why SHA-1 only

the hash is 160 bits long. Since a PGP fingerprint is only 80 bits of an
SHA-1 hash, it offers just 40 bits of collision resistance.
Of course, 2^40 PGP keys is an awful lot, so using the fingerprint as a

Athlon XP machines 395 days (average) break the 64-bit keyspace. This is
using hand-optimized client programs written in assembly language.
Now, you want to be conservative in your estimates of security, so you'd
have to assume that testing password hashes could be optimized to at
least the rate of distributed.net's RC5 client program. You'd also have
to make some assumtions about realative performance; some CPUs are
better at certain tasks. But assuming a 3 GHz P4 is 50% faster than a
2-GHZ Athalon, it would take a network of ~30,000 3 GHz machines 395
days to break a 5-word diceware passphrase.=20

RC5 is a block encryption algorithm similar to 3DES, AES, CAST, or
Blowfish. It is patented by RSA Security, and is used via license in
quite a few commercial products. RC5 is short for "Ron's Code No. 5",
named for its creator Ron Rivest (he's the "R" is "RSA"). RC6, an
update of RC5, was a finalist in the selection process for AES,
however Rijendael was chosen instead for a number of reasons, none of
which involved security.
RC5 is not, to my knowledge, part of any IETF standards like OpenPGP.
RC5 is interesting in that it can accept a variable key size, and RSA
offers rewards for cracking it using various key lengths.
Distributed.net received $10,000 for craking the 64-bit key, and is
working on the 72-bit RC5 challenge now. (Note also that the amount
of electricity used by the computers participating in the RC5-64

GnuPG is also good for sharing information securely when another channel

a machine hosted off-site, I send the hosting service a signed and
encrypted email with my configuration changes or password information.
Voice mail or even plain telephone isn't secure enough, and I'm not
driving over there every time.
GnuPG is useful because it makes intercepting or forging messages orders
of magnitude harder. It is very easy to do these things on unencrypted
communications; using GnuPG takes out >>90% of your potential
adversaries. A snoop or hacker that is not specifically after *you* will
simply move on to an easier target.
Assume that anything you put on your PC is vulnerable to a determined
attacker that is targeting you specifically, be it a skilled hacker,

the key, or make a copy by breaking into the locker room in your health

usually get a court order to look in the box.=20
But by using the safe deposit box, you reduce the spectrum of attackers

If you want to make your own secure secret splitting scheme, and not

so your pass phrase has good entropy. The pass phrase would look
something like this:
    3.5324658768678568,-2.423532534543098
Next, give an equation of a *random* line through this point to each of
your secret holders, along with instructions about how many digits to
round with and how to format the password when they reconstruct the
secret. You should give them at least one more significant digit in all
of the coefficients of their equations to ensure that they get the same
rounded answer. To reconstruct the pass phrase, at least two of your secret holders must
get together and find the intersection of their lines, then use that as
the pass phrase for the secret key. No single share is enough to find
the pass phrase, since there are an infinite number of points on the
line described by each share.

[Nicholas Paul Johnson]
You have it basically right. In fact, this is the way most secure
password authentication systems work. Both the user and the server have
a shared secret, which is the password. The server sends a random
message over the wire to the client, which then concatenates the secret
password, and hashes the result. This hash is then sent over the wire
back to the server. Presuming the hash function is secure, an
eavesdropper cannot figure out the password, nor can they "replay" the
attack, since the random message used only once.
Sometimes the details change; in most modern systems only a hash of the
user password is stored on the server, so an "extra" hashing step is
required before concatenation at the client. Also, in systems like
Kerberos, a timestamp is part of the hashed authentication string, so
that a particular authentication session is "valid" for only a certain
amount of time. But the basic underlying idea of authentication as the
validation of a "signature" of a random message as you describe remains.
Of course, finding a secure way to share the secret (password) in the
first place can be difficult. But _Applied Cryptography_ illustrates
several protocols for this as well.

There are 95 "printable" characters on a US keyboard, including the

95 ~= 2^6.57
So we have 6.57 bits of entropy per character, assuming we select or
characters totally randomly.
128/6.57 ~= 19.48
So we need 19.5 characters to get 128 bits of entropy in our pass
phrase. Since you can't enter half-characters, you really need a 20
character pass phrase.
Any non-randomness you add to the process (using real words, using the
first letters of each word from a sentence, for example) severely
decreases the amount of entropy per character. English prose has about
1.5 bits of entropy per character, which means you'd need an
86-character pass phrase of English text to get 128 bits of entropy.
That's a lot to remember.
Incidentally, the entropy of English text has usually been calculated by
its compressibility. The very best arithmetic compression algorithms
(e.g. PPM) will compress a large body of English text down to about 20%
of its original size. 8 * 0.2 = 1.6, which is why we frequently see the

@_subject: Passphrase Encoding and Entropy 
[Oskar L.]
There are a number of options in OpenPGP for converting a pass phrase to
a symmetric encryption key. They are called "String-to-Key (S2K)
Specifiers" and are listed in RFC-2440. Some are salted, others
unstalted, and some use more than one iteration of the hash function.
Many different hash functions are supported, although MD5 and SHA-1 are
the most commonly used.
I believe the GnuPG default settings work like this: the passphrase is
stored as unicode (UTF-8 encoding maybe?) in memory, the random 64-bit
salt is read from the password file and tacked on to the begginnging of
your passphrase. The entire salt + passphrase string is hashed with
SHA-1. That generates the encryption key used to encrypt the private key
or file with 3DES. It helps the attacker because the attacker only needs to try 26^6
combinations instead of 95^6 combinations. That is a big difference. The
all-lower case password would require ~2^27 guesses on average to crack.
The one using six of the full 95 characters on a U.S. key would require
about 2^38 guesses. That makes it ~2000 times harder to crack (but still
very weak considering all the multi-core multi-GHz computers cheaply
available out there).
The fact that the attacker must take the time to make the SHA-1 hash of
each guess doesn't really figure into the discussion, since making that
hash takes the same amount of time for every guess - it is a "constant
time" factor that drops out when comparing the relative strength of one
passphrase vs. another.
It works because the attacker just has to make their password-guessing
program smart enough to skip the unused characters. They start with
"a","b"... then to "aa","ab","ac".... and finally all the way up to
"zzzzzy","zzzzzz". If they had to cycle through all the combinations of
all the characters on the keyboard, instead of just lower case, there
would be 2000 times as many steps in this process. They wold have to go
through combinations like "4Av%

@_subject: passphrase or random characters the safest 
Just to inject some practicality into the discussion, a pass phrase with
more than 64 bits of entropy is probably safe from all non-governmental
attackers. After all, it took distributed.net five years to crack 64-bit
RC5 using tens of thousands of machines.
Beyond 64 bits, attacks against the endpoint computers (keyboard
sniffers, etc.) and the key holder's body will be far more
cost-effective and attractive. The pass phrase would certainly not be
the weakest link in the security chain.
Using a 2311000-word Oxford English Dictionary (the latest count I found
on their web site), that's CEILING(64/log2(231100)) = 4 randomly
selected English words. Much easier to remember, and those four words
would actually provide 71+ bits of entropy. As 9/11 taught us, it's pointless to build ever-stronger defenses
against attacks we already know how to defeat. Our bomb-sniffing and
X-ray machines failed us when faced with a few fanatics carrying
box-cutters. It is the *new* avenues of attack that we must think about
and guard against. A 256-bit-strong OpenPGP pass phrase is pointless
when used on a machine compromised by a keyboard sniffer, or when used
to hide secrets from an attacker that is willing to torture the key
I recommend Bruce Schneier's latest books, _Secrets and Lies_ and
_Beyond Fear_, which have great discussions of *practical* security.
