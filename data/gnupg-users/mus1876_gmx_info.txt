Hi list,
I'm using GnuPG 1.4.1 on WinXP Service Pack 2. Whenever I --clearsign a text
message containing some kind of list, dash characters get duplicated. Is
that a feature or bug? See yourself ...

Hash: SHA1
- - A dash followed by a space character at the beginning of the line as it
is commonly used in enumerations produces an extra dash.
- -Second test with a dash and no whitespace in between yields the same
- -	Third test with a dash and a tab character has the same effect.
 - Fourth test with a space character followed by a dash character.
Lastly a dash anywhere inside the text like this one - isn't duplicated.

The program's first response is:
gpg: conversion from `utf-8' to `CP65001' not available
gpg: using character set `iso-8859-1'
What kind of setup (charset, file encoding) would you recommend in general.
I thougt that gpg fully supports UTF-8. At least according to the manpage.
Thank you

I totally agree what friends of Alphax say.
Wouldn't it be cute to have a sepcial option to flag both keys and
subkeys as non exportable (uploadable) to keyservers? Speaking of myself
at current, I also don't want to see any of my keys posted to a
keyserver by someone else, be it on intention or not.
