Nice angle Stan.
Peter M , you sir are on point.
Faramir,  my personal perspective is that good software should be
like..  gnu/linux. Simply enough for simpletons/ average joes/janes to
use,but adaptable enough to grow and adapt to meet the needs and skill
of the user. Robert Hansen -  (You share a name with an infamous traitor) , at the
risk of sounding rude,  You didn?t have to be an arrogant asshole
ravaging everyone with your prick of peer-review..Not everyone respects
the words of academics who for the most part,  have never placed their
lives, or the lives of others on the safety of crypto. Try
peer-reviewing that.. Sending 30 Israeli academics to Iran to relay ?-R?d? traffic just for shits and giggles, and having to hope that they
didnt make a mistake lest they be hanging from a ceiling with a hot
poker in the bum. Johnny will surely encrypt then.. Or squeal. So stop
being a dick and allow people to share their views. The rest of us don?t
give a fuck about what you will be happy to read, or not read. So come
off your high-horse, and join the rest of the lot. Or join me, in a
warzone, where crypto keeps my secrets, and my life.. pretty snug. For
Stay safe..

Sir Hansen:
Well, pseudonyms do not make my words less valid. I am not one of the
gpg-using  advocates, who has to be open, and forthcoming with all to
make a point. A pseudonym is well within my rights. You simply don?t
need to know. That assymetric advantage is your own fault. It was yor
choice to use a name. Don?t discredit me for being more.. distrusting.. I didn?t know that gmail is disposable.. hmm.. Once again, we all are
subjected to what Mr.Hansen feels. If you read NDA?s carefully, not all
agencies (not units) are the same when it comes to disclosure. Speaking
in generalities is quite legal depending on context, country, purpose,
and ofc what agency one is affiliated with. (It is not neccesarily the
same in your country as it is elsewhere. ) Nice strawman , and a perfect
example of implicit assumptions however. Moving on, back to crypto..
However yes, I do agree with you that skepticism is warranted.
Especially when academics are supposed to know more of field-crypto than
the practitioners who are actually at risk. Ofc said practitioners are
generally in locales, and roles in which the only peer-review is what
they receive from their captors if they get caught. Whether in a
military or paramilitary capacity...
I thank you for your viewpoints all the same Sir Hansen. The
contemporary civilian perspectives on crypto  are quite illuminating all
the same.
The real question is why secrecy and the employment of pseudonym is
frowned upon both in society, and ... here?
Thank you and Good Day sir.

# very fortunate, however it also is why those that do, are often
frustrated or ignored by those who simply can never imagine the
situations, and how things are often not as simple as signing keys, or
using keyservers, or the tactical risks inherent something, which in the
?normal world? would be quite routine and harmless. Even cryptographers
have social biases.
# sure, and that is your prerogative to shape your security stance to
your personal risk-assessment, which ofc is shaped by your views,
experiences, interests, intentions. Nothing wrong with that. What is
wrong is when some (not saying you personally) , assume that their
intended usage or views of crypto is the same as all others, and apply
their personal views, opinions, or biases to others and judge them with
their own standards. I personally use gpg for work, play, family, and
friends because of the fact that I do not want to risk my loved ones, or
friends being hurt if I made a mistake. for sensitive data, simply lower
the cryptolength of keys.. ie, use 1d - 1w expiring keys, transmitting
data, and ofc having stringent controls of pubkey dissemination for
operational security.
 I believe there is a field which deals with such things as
trust, loyalties, psychology, interests, motivations, power, coercion,
psychology.. Such a field might be stereotypically depicted in the
popular media, however cryptography goes hand in glove, with such a
(under)world. Crypto is what keeps our secrets safe, and our
civilizations safe. It is a powerful weapon, and like any other weapon,
is a double-edged sword. Layering this to mitigate against human
weakness is .. common sense if you have something to lose. If your
family was in some kind of unpleasant situation because someone
*thought* that you were working against their interests, I am confident
that you would take steps to protect them ja? Both digitally, and
physically no? Crypto is another tool that protects you from the wolves.
# I never said that the person you encrypted it to was the end
recipient. If you are a digital courier, you can have something
encrypted to you, however upon decryption, you find that it is -R?d
again to another party, and you are simply given an email address, or
physical address to relay it to.. Or you put it on a flashdrive, and
leave it at a pre-arranged locale. Even if you are tortured for your
part, the ciphertext is still not within your means to decrypt. If you
used a symmetric password, then you might be able to namedrop, and now
others are at risk as well..
Someone down the line can give up the password. Now the torturers
dilemna, is that you could never fully prove your innocence, and the
torture could never fully prove your guilt. Using crypto in the first
place stands out, and is in the torturers eyes, a sign of guilt. Telling
them that you cant decrypt something, will make them think that you are
lying. Even if you are able to decrypt the first file, which could be
-R?d, for example , by the time you give in, and try to say that the
second file is really not within your ability to decrypt, the overseeing
party would be foolish to believe you. So their only recourse is to
continue torturing you, even if you are fully honest, or fully lying, as
they can never know when you are ?spent?, and have told all that you
know, as there is always a risk, that you are just resisting them,
holding something back.. While you can never prove that you honestly
have no way of decrypting the data (as it can be -c -R as well... which
means that you can never prove yourself innocent. Anyone that signed
your key, can also be grabbed.. And I know you might think of the xkcd,
however in the real world, when you have someone using electricity, or a
cold water and a sjambok, or worse, coercing you via your friends and
family.. It doesnt matter what you or cryptographers think. All that
matters is what the person who has your family thinks.
(The movie unthinkable speaks to this dilemna, albeit obliquely)
# not neccesarily. They most likely will be sadists,
( , and they may want
information about who you deal with, or to prove a point to you.. Ie,
you are sng?d (snatched and grabbed) , torturing you, for who you deal
with, not what you deal with is far more revealing. And then they
release you, so that your friends and family, and allies, all think that
you revealed something. Which makes them distrust you. You feel
alienated, especially after watching tv, as every time you go to a
store, you think of that coke bottle up yer ass.. And you feel cut off,
and if they beet your feet, well you wont be walking too well..
Electricity and water are both deniable. However, now you feel
powerless, you arent sure who to trust (they told you that your friends
are really their friends), and you might be shunned from whatever you
were a part of, as they have to assume that you compromised others. So..
You might find yourself just a smile, and a pawn in a bigger game. You
made a sadist happy, and sow distrust and panic in whatever organization
your opposition has a dispute with. More importantly, they will grab
you, and see which birdies chirp about your arrest. You were essentially
just bait. And they will naturally monitor you, and see who approaches
you, or is worried about you.
This is all far more relevant than the ciphertext. Its who you know, and
what you are about. Not what you hide. Thats easy. If thinking in this
light, you could see why some are keyserver/ keysign averse (lsign only) ...

A name is just a name. Even if my real name was used, I do hope my
credentials would not be public nor that I am recognized.  Not everyone
enjoys publicity, or being overtly affiliated with a group such as this
one. Even knowing about crypto, tends to make some suspicious, politics
and dogma aside.
Im not, cant speak for others :-)
unfortunately so. I like to think that my occupation, and education
affords me a greater ranking than so, but that would require you all to
know my credentials.. Which, no one here needs to know. So I can
understand how I might appear to be abnormal from the majority here.  Granted. However if I used a real name instead of a pseudonym, would
that make people ?feel? better? My words would not have changed. Perhaps
I would just be seen as ?socially accountable? (reputationally -
speaking) for any insightful or inappropiate comments. The same is true
of a pseudonym. My reputation is on the line. Just not my real name. I
do not wish to be publicly affiliated with this group (No offense) . I have my reasons for that.

With due respect Mr Lebbing,  my initial post -
 was in response to Mr. Hansen?s post
which (from my perspective) was exceedingly rude, and arrogant. I
wondered why the same company that castigates me for being rude, or
insulting allows one with a ?real name? to disparage another member. Not
a double standard at all eh? So yes, I was intentionally rude with Mr.
Hansen , (and only him afaik) as he was quite offensive to Mr. Segment..
(Full Disclosure: I enjoyed it. Sometimes people learn with a taste of
their own medicine.. )  So it is understandable if Mr. Hansen does not
hold me in the highest regard. However that is between us. Others here should promote mutual respect of all members, and not selectively attack
new members, while allowing the ?old guard? to speak as they like to
other members with impunity. So yes, I enjoy crypto, however the most recent postings have been
straying from that.

On PKI,
I fear that the property of it being so decentralized, and relatively
free, is the same reason why it does not have wider adoption. It is not
a centralized product, nor is trust maintained by any government /
private institutions (banks, clerks, notaries, etc ) to prove identity.
So, thus.. PKI is both adopted, however split given its decentralized
nature. Using openID as an example, to try and free themselves from
centralized SSO (google, yahoo, microsoft, well, and facebook as a
newcomer) openid sought to allow anyone from any domain login to other
sites, with a universal token. Well.. the benefit that brings the user,
is a significant downside for those who would like to have a more
consolidated approach to things.
  Gpg is not owned by any entity, it can be used in many countries
legally, and virtually any other country illegally. It can be used to
designate trust (albeit in a simple manner) , or delegate it (truth be
told,  I don?t fully understand tsign per documentation). The same
properties which make it suitable for anyone with the motivations ,
interest, and time to learn how to master it and use it in their own
lives, means that it is not adopted by governments and corporations
because of the fact that it is not beholden (afaik) to any country,
government, company, or organization (well, ignoring the gnu folks who
develop it). Furthermore, said interests have a strong interest in
ensuring that products are strong enough to keep out the opposition /
?bad guys? , but weak enough so that the implementing party can still
exercise it?s power if it deems it necessary.  I see a power in a
digital signature, and using a public key for a designated task. In
fact, i personally believe it is a key aspect of
 , if one knows
how to harness it properly. PKI may take time to come, however  Change
does tend to scare people. Especially if they have a vested interest in
a status quo.  Think of a criminal organization (or worse) that
understood and used gpg, monkeysphere, and only relayed the important
traffic via couriers with flashdrives. That would make it very hard for
law enforcement, or security types to try and track down. In conjunction
with twitter, or statusnet, or other things, they also used pastebin for
Command and Control , Communications  and Intelligence (C3I). Try
finding a court in most countries that would have enough evidence to try
such a ?plot?. That kind of power of technology, as a double-edged sword
surely is not lost upon decision-makers in Government and Industry. Requesting your Comments.

Well, PKI is used by at least one country on a national level , it works
pretty well,
 , it is issued for free by all major banks, and there
are other PKI solutions issued by a few other companies which have
national adoption. You pay a bit extra with your mobile carrier  if you
want the private key in a sim card of a cell-phone, but then you have a
mobile PKI solution..
You login to your bank website with the security device (there are two
main types) , and download the personal certificate into the client-side
program ( nexus personal) , and it is valid for one year. This gives you
a wide-range of options in the entire country, as you can use most
government and many government functions automatically without needing a
un/pw, and digital signatures are used to sign statements, file taxes
(automated) , etc.  On the server-side, as far as i know, the
instituting agency/company simply requires a bankid server for
Bankid is a nationally subsidized program, and it is mandated for most
local and federal agencies to be compatible with it (many are coming to
speed) , for efficiency, security, and less paperwork (sending
usernames/ passwords via post costs trees, ink, time, and money) -
however the old way is still an option.  I had forgotten about it (as it
is quite ubiquitous now), but just wanted to toss that into the

aye sir.
Perhaps he was not personally under attack, however the way that you
speak to people (see respect) matters. Even if Mr.Hansen had evidence,
that is no excuse to rudely dismiss another in such a way that brings
them public shame and puts Mr.Segment in a fight/flight position. (if
peter had responded to defend his name (see respect), it may have led to
animosity. If he did not, he may be seen as weak, or conceding the
"high-ground" to Mr. Hansen. In the course of human events, conflicts
have started for far less.  Since Mr. Segment did not respond, no one
else (at least publically) knows of his position regarding the matter.
However just because one has evidence does not mean you can speak to
anyone however ye like and claim that the evidence gives you the right
to ignore the emotional side of people. Trust, respect, and the other
social values are at the root of it, emotionally-based. As rational as
people may try to appear, even they are driven by emotions at their
core. That should not be undermined. That is the principle which
Mr.Hansen dismissively  ignored for Mr.Segment, and why I (a third
party, who has no knowledge, relationship, nor affiliation with
Mr.Segment in any way) could justify speaking to Mr. Hansen in such a way.
Of course not. However even if it is not taken seriously, notification
of such could surely be done in a more polite way?  If everyone else in
effect states their opinion,as many postings lack the peer-reviewed
research,  why should Mr.Segment be arbitrarily held to a higher
standard when it suits one person?
I will quote a few passages, all which oddly enough are lacking the
evidence coming from a "formal usability study,  peer-reviewed journal"
to reinforce my point Mr.Clizbe.
chief sysadmin for a law firm and deployed GnuPG to 150+ desktops.
Pretty much anyone who has ever deployed GnuPG and/or PGP has faced it.
 Solutions to this problem exist, are well-known, and pretty thoroughly
tested." "Deploying PKI is nowhere near as big of a problem as convincing people"
"I think the other 99% deserve better."
"And if you draw the line anywhere in
between, then you're adopting my position but just quibbling over
precisely where you want the line to be drawn."
" (T)hat PKI adds benefit to their lives."/
Perhaps my reading comprehension skills are lacking, however I fail to
see any of the above quotes (all authored oddly enough by Mr. Hansen) as
having any of the evidence that he (seemingly arbitrarily) prosecutes Mr.Segment  for failing to provide. Is this a valid evidence of hypocrisy?
I will allow the fellow readers of the thread to join together in
peerage to review such evidence for themselves.  Agreed. How is this relevant to the point of mutual respect or even the
topic? I consider myself fortunate that you Sir, are of an open mind.
Ah yes now I understand!, Without evidence, I am stating opinions and
"pet theories" ,  however with evidence, I can legitimately speak to
anyone as dismissively  as I please  and call this an "academic exchange
of  ideas!." (which is strictly impersonal, as evidence is what matters
ja? )
Well, how about if i (hypothetically) told you that :
is until such time as you get out into the field, do a formal usability
study, write up the results and get them accepted to a peer-reviewed
journal.  Once you do that, I will be happy to read your paper, give it
due weight, and refer other people to it." /

Quite a rude response to your words no? Or is this acceptable form of
discourse in the academic realm?
Given what you have stated in your email, saying that to you is *not*

Can you please reference me to the appropiate peer-review journal as
evidence of your "Anonymous Coward" theory? You see without the "data to

Unsupported assertions regarding your opinions about the likeness of my

Revenge is a pleasure enjoyed by many, in ways big and small. I am just

out of revenge, and that I obviously don't *care* what my credibility

important than credibility.  However we are far from the realm of crypto
and this current sub-topic is  irrelevant to the topic at hand Mr.Clizbe. I was unaware, unsurprised, and your point is......  ?
rude yes, and I am glad that you found it entertaining.
really? Interesting.
who said anything about sending 30 (thirty) academics to Iran getting

I find your assumptions that everything must be legal , naive and narrow
minded. haha.
Or perhaps you did not consider that there are ways of
infiltrating/exfiltrating people beyond national borders that are not
conventional (we wont speak to the legality of things, as It would be
legal under Israeli law if they chose to undertake such operations, and
clearly frowned upon by the Iranians/Persians. Legality is a subjective
concept. With something called legal precedent.. (a form of evidence
which you lack here. But surely you knew that).
 I howl in laughter as in your "haste to insult" , you clearly have
failed to  consider
I thank you for more evidence of your na?vet?. Visas, and customs.. haha.. Oh? So if ideas are what matters, and not the people, then I can
certainly understand the logic behind condoning/defending Mr.Hansen's
treatment of Mr.Segment. I don't quite understand all the tears shed
over how I have "been rude" , "attacked" , or "offended" Mr. Hansen.
Clearly that does not matter, as I am simply presenting an idea.
Yes, with this exhausive (both to read, and reply to) email, I concede
that a certain patience (on both sides) has been displayed Mr. Clizbe.
I will not question that, however I fail to see your evidence of this?
(Isn't nice being treated like this is it) . Seriously, I am here to be
polite, and focus on crypto. The emotions, egos, drama, and bullshit
really detracts from the point.
Once again, I could care less what Rob thinks of me or others. Reading (
 ),
he really does have a rather high opinion of himself doesn't he?
That's great. Without evidence to support your claims, nor relevance to
this point, these words are deemed unfounded, and consequently... what
is your point? (to gather sympathy? )
Ah.. Your interest is in the beer! Fair enough Mr. Clizbe, thank you for
stating your interest.
I understand that. However dealing with people who all come from
different backgrounds, and obviously have different levels of
experience, knowledge, opinions, and even coherence to impart,
politeness still should help. Peer review works quite well. I use it
often in my line of work. However being impolite creates more personal
problems (like your email, and Mr. Hansen's, as well as the drama that
has been started around all of this, including the pseudonymn debate,
and who I am, and my credibility) which all... Are besides the point of
.. "What is killing PKI".. That is the true casualty of this entire
weeklong exchange. The point of the thread.  So with that, I want it to
be known that I am officially tired of this back/forth exchange about
the entire affair, as it would not have happened in the first place if
Mr. Hansen had exercised more forethought and discretion in the delivery
of his words. People matter. As do ideas. You can't have trust without
respect, and respect without politeness. Most here understand how
important trust is in the world (whether technical, social, physical,
legal, etc) , it is still important.  Politeness is a necessary
component inherently tied to human interaction. So I have no
ill-feelings towards you Mr.Clizbe, nor Mr. Hansen, nor anyone else. I
am focused on the possibilities of tech, not the people. I want to end
this long-winded drama which has been wasting everyone's time, and has
not had a damn bit of relevance to "What is killing PKI" .. We have
killed the topic however that much. And for that, I apologize for the
part I played in that, and I look forward to splitting a few beers with
all parties involved as a token of peace(not sure where in the world ye
all are) . Thank you for your response Mr.Clizbe, and you were quite
thorough. I like that, even if I did not (obviously) agree with your
points (or at least most of them) . For anyone else who wishes to state
an opinion on this affair, please email me directly, and keep it out of
the thread.

gpg just to decrypt your msg without a compelling
curiosity/self-interest. ) Furthermore, on my iphone, gpg is not exactly
supported. Sure, there are other apps, that let me encrypt to a public
key, and a few allow one to load a private key, but they are not gnupg
(and so I personally don't trust those apps). Encrypting *all* traffic
is thus infeasible in the manner that you speak, unless you want to
carry a system with you (or a flashdrive with a private key on there,
assuming you can trust it).. Either way.  Or, if you were in contact
with someone who you usually encrypt traffic to, but they were on an
untrusted computer, or on their phone, would you lower your "standard"
and send it in the plaintext for them? Or maintain your standard, and
send them something that you know that they cannot access until later?
Just a few questions to toss your way MPFA .  I recall Mr. Tobias
mentioning something about an "encrypt-everything lobby" which your
words, put you firmly in. :-)

Well, if Alice uses gpg for everything, with a strict signing/encryption
policy, and she meticulously makes sure that fingerprints match, keys
are valid, etc.. And her brother/boyfriend/beuau/coworker etc, Bob
doesn't.. Bob's "insecurity" (for not using it , some of which get
passed onto her, especially if she has a i-do-not-send-plaintext-policy,
and she has/wants to send/receive comms from Bob. So Bob lowers the
quality of her personal security standard, and if Charlie,
 knows "a bit" about gpg, but doesn't see the need, unless it is for
"sensitive" applications (to alice, all comms are sensitive,
irrespective of the content, to Charlie, only matters that he
feels/defines as "sensitive" should be encrypted) much to the chagrin of
Alice, who often tries to tell Charlie about traffic analysis, and how
he is making things easier by only encrypting what he wants to hide, not
the mundane, the routine, and what he wants to hide. She also clearly
has a self-interest in him adopting her higher-standard to increase her
security and communications.
Lastly, we have David.. Who knows about encryption, even likes using
it.. But.. he "can't be bothered" to encrypt and/or sign his traffic
because he says "what's the point? the government can break it anyway
(his opinion)"  , or  "I would sign/encrypt, but Im at work, or I
haven't found the time to load gpg on my new home computer", or  "not
enough people use gpg to make it worthwhile or mean anything"
So people have their options, and they clearly choose to use it. But you
are at the mercy of their opinions, options, feelings, and standards.
And at the end of the day, it's alla bout standards. Poor Alice in her
crypto-Wonderland. Too bad not many others share her enthusiasm and

Finally, *someone* gets it. You always have to push the bar of sec and
crypto. Not wallow in routines and complacency.  That is how people get
sloppy, and dogma sets in..
Or a modern-day equivalent, how western defence companies knowingly
sell/give/transfer armanents to embargoed powers, (cough China, Iran,
DPRK) either directly or indirectly against their own or friendly
soldiers/civilians ?
