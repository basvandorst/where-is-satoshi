I'm using GPG regularly and did want to "save" my private key.
On the IRC channel someone linked me to paperkey :
While this project is really interseting, it does not fit my needs.
I found ssss ( too, but it wasn't
really usable beacause it has too many limitations IMHO.
So I did it myself : ShareIt (
It's a very simple program which take a file (whatever in it a GPG key
or a pdf, etc...) and generates some fragments which can be given to
some contacts in order to "store" the document while not making it
readable directly.
It is using the Shamir's Sharing Secret Algorithm
I ever worked on a faster fragmentation this morning and will push it on
the repo this evening (I can't from here). I planned a C version too, I
hope to release quickly, but it is not really needed urgently because
the Python version
is fast enough to share a GnuPG key.
Any Comments and/or critics are more than welcome, especially on security

The demo of ssss shows :
- - a secret limited to 128 characters
- - a generation of n fragments in once pass. You couldn't generate a
new fragment later
- - you have to copy paste each fragments after splitting, and right again
on combination
Plus, in the source code, you can see it is not using the modulo part,
needing a specific lib (if I understood well).
Finally, when I tried it on the demo page, if I enter less fragments
than needed, it seems to raise an error which can help into
discovering how much fragments are needed.
In the end, it was a good exercise for me and I wanted to share it.
And as a Python version it is runnable everywhere without compiling
which seems to be a problem with the last version of ssss.

I'm really sorry to have set up such a conversation :o)
As I said earlier I'm not quite good at crypto-things, all I wanted to
do was to protect my private key easily in case of HDD error.
And all I wanted to do with this little tool was to share it with you.
If you can explain to such a nooby-noob like me what matters, I'll try
to do my best not to make you loose your time ;o)
