@_subject: Slow encryption on Solaris (GPG 1.0.0) 
after a successful install of GPG 1.0.0 on a Sun Ultra 10 with Solaris
we have the following problem : encryption and signing is very slow,
10 seconds for a 20 Ko file (768 bits key, default DSA and ElGamal),
it is much faster (less than one second) on a Linux box (Pentium II 350
Has anyone already seen that or has a solution to make it work faster ?
Thank you in advance !
