@_subject: gpg-agent: hide my passphrase length 
============================== START ==============================
I just discovered gpg-agent and it's useful to type my passphrase less Without gpg-agent, when gpg prompts me for a passphrase, it does not display the number of characters I type. But when I enter my passphrase in gpg-agent, a star is displayed for every letter I type (I use pinentry-curses as a backend). So, I feel less secure. It may not be so important, but I don't like it when people can see length of my passwords. I looked for a way to change that behaviour, but found none. Do you known of a solution ?
thanks a lot
