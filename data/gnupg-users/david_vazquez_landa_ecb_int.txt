@_subject: GPG Decryption fails for files > 1MB 
Hello list,
We have an issue with one of our users. When he sends encrypted messages larger than ~1 MB, we get these errors:
8218 - PGP decryption error - gpg: encrypted with RSA key, ID CD5AA2E4
gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit RSA key, ID B44D925D, created 2006-03-29
      "Mehdi Rahman "
gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit RSA key, ID 4E9BF326, created 2010-03-16
      "Mehdi Rahman "
gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit ELG-E key, ID 044C8E09, created 2008-04-04
      "EXDI_STC (EXDI PGP key for STC) "
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=27)
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=0d)
gpg: mdc_packet with invalid encoding
gpg: decryption failed: invalid packet
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=0a)
gpg: block_filter: pending bytes!
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
This is the output of gpg.exe ?version:
$ /cygdrive/d/GNU/GnuPG/gpg.exe --version

Is this a gnupg bug?

Hello Werner, The files sent to us are already encoded using --armor. Funnily enough, only files larger than 1MB fail. Anything smaller can be decrypted without problems. Anyway, thanks for the hint.
