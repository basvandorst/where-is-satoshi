Hey there,
gnupg-2.0.30 (from tarball) and all dependencies extracted.
./configure runs fine
returns No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.
directory contains "Makefile.am" if I rename to Makefile, and run make
returns missing separator.  Stop.
Insight appreciated, thanks

./configure run in the gnupg-2.0.30 directory returns 'required libraries
not found', i.e, the GNU portable threads library, which I've downloaded
from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/pth/ unpacked, and installed
sudo make install
Aside from "make[2]: Nothing to be done for `install-exec-am'."
Everything appears normal, except ./configure for gnu PG will continue to
return "library missing"
