@_subject: Copying of pubring/secring 
A new day a new distro installation! :)
Did a fresh ftp installation of Debian Woody including GnuPG.
On the same harddisk is my Mandrake installation with installed GnuPG and my user's ~/.gnupg including pubring/secring.
I tried to copy the keyrings to the new ~/.gnupg in the Debian installation but asking 'gpg --list-keys' I am told that
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=00)
gpg: read_keyblock: read error: Invalid packet
gpg: enum_keyblocks(read) failed: Invalid keyring
Hmm, username is the same as in the old installation where I copied the rings from.
Anybody can help or point me to a doc to solve this?

I just did a copy transfer and I found out that it only works if the versions of GnuPG are the same on both machines.

You should read the numerous threads [1] of the last weeks about the step of Mandrake Linux to hide 'root' as an option to log into the GUI environment. The standard xdm in Mandrake Linux only show user-icons as options to login to KDE or GNOME, etc.
There are lots of noobs complaining about that. Given replys that it is a Bad Thing(TM) and totally unnecessary they come back and claim that's their computer and they can do whatever they want and so on ad This shows exactly what you wrote.
The more M$ is scewing the users with new schemes to get their money, the more Linux is becomeing userfriendly, the more users come to try the alternative and of course thea are carrying with them the mindset they have been working with all the time.
Same happened when a people was converted to christian religion. They turned (or were turned) to the new religion but all of them inserted some or a little of their former religion into their new religious Same happened when the US of A were young and all the emigrants came from all the various countries. You can't stop that.
This is a thought that could make a Linux user of the first 10 years [1] Threads are available in alt.os.linux.mandrake

@_subject: Revoke old keys 
Hash: SHA1
everybody starts at some time and at that is a newbie and makes newbie
mistakes. I started with pgp in 1997 and - of course - made newbie
mistakes: I did not create a revokation text and I did not store the
passphrase anywhere.
Now - over the times - I wonder if I can revoke those keys. The email
addresses don't exist anymore so nobody could send encrypted messages
using those keys. So there is no real danger there. Although the old
unuseable keys clog up the list.
Is there any chance how I could delete or revoke them? I only have the
public parts of those keys, of course. The secret parts are long
vanished into data nirvana.

Thought so.
Yes I know it's 'gpg --delete-secret-key DEADBEEF' and 'gpg --delete-key
DEADBEEF'. I already did that. My question was about the keys on the
keyservers, like you can do with a revocation certificate.
Thanks for helping.

Makes sense. Thanks for the insight.

With this you question the whole concept of Digital Signing.
If this is your opinion you'd never trust a digitally signed message=20
like a hand-signed hardcopy.
IMHO it's far easier to forge a real hand-signed letter than a digitally=20
signed email.
But anyhow, as soon as communication between 2 different location is=20
involved you can't get 100% security. With a certain amount of criminal=20
energy you can forge averything.
So in the end you *have* to put a little bit of trust into digital=20
signing and de-/encryption. Otherwise you have to stick to RL=20
encounters only.
This is not a technical issue but a fundamental one.
