@_subject: how to transfer a secret key to another comp? 
Hash: SHA1
I'm very new to encryption, and have been following this list (and
others) closely to learn as much as I can.  I too keep my keys on both a
desktop and a laptop.  I've simply been copying the secring.gpg and
pubring.gpg files between them - rather than the entire directory -
whenever I have any kind of change on one or the other, and everything
seems to work just fine.  Am I missing something by doing this rather
than an export and import?
