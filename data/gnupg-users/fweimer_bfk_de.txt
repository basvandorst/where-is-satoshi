Have you seen the publication date?  This has already been addressed
by new software releases.

@_subject: Ignoring expiration dates 
Is it possible to ignore the key expiration date during encryption?
Unfortunately, people tend to set expiration dates without thinking
about the consequences.  It's not always possible to get a new
self-signature in a reasonable time frame.

* Werner Koch:
Oh well, this is a bit counterintuitive because the expiration time is
a hard fact in X.509, and rather fuzzy in OpenPG.
Would you accept a patch, even if it's a kludge?  (Expiration doesn't
seem to be signalled separately, so we'd have to change the code that
generates the expiration flag, and not the code that uses it.)

* Werner Koch:
For v3 keys, it is, but not for v4 keys.  Implementations are free to
take the minimum or maximum of the expiration date over all available
self-signatures.  After all, OpenPGP is just a format spec, and
doesn't say much about semantics.
Actually, this is a very old discussion.  I've come to accept that
it's okay to choose the maximum, but I still don't buy that's the only
choice.  8-)
Okay.  I guess I need some form for my employer.  Would you send it to
me, please?

Tell your friend about Esc-P.
He probably wants you to send your message in OpenPGP/MIME format.
This is the better choice for various reasons, but it's still less
supported in the field.

IIRC, this particular software does not implement Shamir's scheme.

@_subject: Using S/MIME encryption with self-signed certificates 
Is it possible to use gpgsm to encrypt data for a self-signed X.509
certificate?  Right now, the program bails out with "issuer
certificate is not marked as a CA", and I would like to work around
that, preferably without running a full CA.
