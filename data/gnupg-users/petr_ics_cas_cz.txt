The thing I want to do is pretty easy: When I do some updates on
my machine, I want to verify that the software downloaded from a mirror
site has not been compromised. Usually there is a file published on the

What did I try, but what does not (and probably cannot - but why?) work:
I downloaded the file redhat.asc and run `gpg --import redhat.asc`.
I get these error messages:
What is the correct solution?
Thank you in advance.
