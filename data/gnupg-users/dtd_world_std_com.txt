mr. greene --
the point is that charlie decrypts alice's _signed_ message,
then re-encrypts it, without removing the signature.  i'm
sorry my summary was unclear about this point.  i wrote the
summary to serve as a press-release, more-or-less, and as a
teaser to get people to read the paper.
please do read the paper.  the links are live now:

i've corrected the obvious typo:  it's bob who re-encrypts
the signed message, not charlie.  sorry;  getting kind of

hi, mr. shaw --
actually, my paper only recommends signing a recipient-list,
when the message is to be encrypted, too.  as you point out,
to force every signed message to include a recipient-list,
would defeat the purpose of many signed messages.

Anthony Greene replied:
for na=EFve users (my paper's focus), encryption is pivotal:
their ignorance of PKI subtleties misleads them into
thinking that forwarding a signed-&-encrypted message
is impossible, when of course with secure-mail crypto,
forwarding is straightforward.  with a signed plaintext
delivery, Charlie might more readily see and understand
that Alice's signed message doesn't refer to him.
