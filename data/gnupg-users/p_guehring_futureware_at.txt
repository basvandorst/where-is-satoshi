Sure *any* setgid program can write to that. But should gpg do it?
Aren't the checks for effective rights there to handle that?
Gpg should handle everything it really needs the rights for (allocating t=
secure memory, ...) with the rights it has. And everything else (like=20
reading/writing most of the files) with the rights of the user who called=
 it.
(In Perl checking for that looks like that:=20
if( -r file && -w file && -R file && -W file) {overwrite(file);}
If GnuPG wants to be setuid root, than it has to be developped to be safe=
 in=20
that way.
echo owned | gpg --passphrase-fd 0 -o $i own.gpg
- From gpg --help:
 -o, --output                     Als Ausgabedatei benutzen
It seems to me that the user requests to write to that file, so the right=
s of=20
the user should be checked, in my opinion.
Many greetings,

That's the right aim.
But I would suggest a different way to achieve it:
At first, we should have as many algorithms available as possible. Specia=
applications (embedded systems, ...) requires software that is flexible.
But you are right, we should simplify OpenPGP.
But I would say that should be done by having a table, where all develope=
of OpenPGP compatible software sit together and decide upon the default=20
values. Which algorithm should be the default in all implementations out=20
there? (same thing for similar detail questions)
Trust comes from use, testing and verifications.=20
If GnuPG wouldn't implement it, nobody could test it, try it, ...

@_subject: OpenPGP debugging 
I am searching for an OpenPGP fileformat analyzer.
gpg -v -v -v -v -v --list-packets openpgp.key
is coming near, but I am still missing a hexdump of the individual fields, or even a description down to the bit level if necessary.
This is necessary to analyze the correct encoding of certain fields.
One interesting document I found today gives examples of the PKCS standards:
 Is there something similar available for OpenPGP?
Best regards,
Philipp G?hring
