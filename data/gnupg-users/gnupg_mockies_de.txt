@_subject: pinentry-mac never displays any UI [seems to be solved] 
I stumbled over the same problem. I am using mac-gnupg-2.0.4-2 from Ben.
echo GETPIN | /Applications/pinentry-mac.app/Contents/MacOS/pinentry-mac shows the pinentry dialog, though.
But testing it together with gpg-agent didn't work (using something like 'echo "test" | gpg -ase -r KEY | gpg'). The pinentry icon bounced in the dock but no UI is shown (this seems to be the same problem Richard had).
I was able to solve the problem by simply deleting the "no-grab" option from gpg-agent.conf (*hehe* "simply", took me ages to figure that out).
Everything works fine, now. Thanks Ben for your work. Since kde-3.5.6 I was not able to use gpg in kmail because the usage of gpg-agent is not optional any longer. And I wasn't able to get this working till now.
