@_subject: can't disable core dumps 
Hello to everybody:
I am trying to make a script to generate a sign configuration files via
CGI and Perl and I have a problem when I call gpg to sign my generated
Here is the sentence that gives me problems:
$resultado=system("echo $FORM{'$passphrase'}| gpg --yes --no-batch --clearsign /var/www/files/file.txt");
when I execute that sentence I receive this output in my apache log.
I know that it is not a good practice to send my passphrase in a pipe and that is the mistake. I have tried to work with various cpan perl modules but none of them work in my case.
GnuGP::Iterface return me the same resulta as "normal" way and GnuGP tell me that gpg cant open shared memory.
I hope anybody can help me.
I am using Fedora Core 4 and perl 5.8.6 and gpg 1.4.5.
Many thanks.

I found the problem:
It was the SELinux configuration on Fedora Core 4. I put SELINUX=permissive in /etc/selinux/conf and it worked.
