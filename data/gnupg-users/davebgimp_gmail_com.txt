@_subject: Installing GNUPG on a USB Flash drive 
I'm looking to install GNUPG on a 512 meg USB Flash drive. Since I
bounce around between OS's on a daily basis (I use Mac, XP and Linux
on a regular basis), I thought it would be a great if I could just
plug it in, navigate via the command line and go. I did a bit of
looking around and have noticed that others have done this. What I'm
looking for is links to possibly a tutorial or any instructions. I'm
mainly an end-user, so this is unfamiliar territory. I understand that
I'll be needing to partition the Flash drive for the different OS's.
Anyway, has anyone done this, or at least installed for one particular
OS? Any info pointing me in the right direction is greatly
appreciated. Thanks.

@_subject: How to install your GPG keys to a USB dongle for Windows 
I recently decided to store my keyrings on a USB dongle. I had a lot
of trouble finding information on how to do this properly for Windows
(lots of info for Linux though). After figuring it out, I thought I'd
pass on the information.
How to install your GPG keys to a USB dongle for WIN XP
   1. Install the latest binary version of GnuPG
   2. Attach your USB dongle and create a folder named keys, or
whatever's appropriate for you. If you have pre-existing keyrings,
place them here.
   3. Open REGEDIT (START > RUN > type regedit)
   4. In REGEDIT, navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\GNU\GnuPG
   5. Right click in the folder and select NEW > STRING VALUE
   6. Name it "HomeDir" (without the parenthsis, of course)
   7. Right-click the entry and select MODIFY.
   8. Under VALUE DATA, type the full path to your desired key folder.
For example, mine is F:\keys\ ("F" being the USB dongle). Hit OK.
   9. Open a command prompt and type "gpg --version" or "gpg
--list-keys". Check for the Home that is listed, it should now be your
dongle and any keys in that folder should now be listed. You're done!
