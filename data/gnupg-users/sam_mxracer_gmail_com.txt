@_subject: Encrypted file-size approximation with multiple recipients 
Hash: SHA512
After reading in the gpg man page different recipients can have different key sizes.  Additionally gpg will look at the supported cipher algorthms of all recipients and attempt to choose an algorithm common between them.
That means your calculations aren't accounting for the different key sizes nor is it accounting for the size of the session key (session key is for the symmetric algo).
You can go about this one of two ways.  You can try write a program smart enough to account for that or you can keep it simple.
KISS: assume worst case for every recipient and then do the math.  e.g. 4096 bit rsa keys with AES256 cipher algo for the session key (assuming AES256 has the largest session key).
At least that's how I would tackle it.

@_subject: Using an RSA GnuPG key for RSA ? 
I think generally it would be bad practice either way.  A compromised
server happens more often than a compromised gpg key.  Therefore if a
server gets compromised effectively your gpg private key has been
compromised.  It would be best to keep them separate entirely and not reuse
the RSA key pair anywhere else.  Treat your gpg private key like your
identity (i.e. social security number) because it really is your
identity... unless you want to go through the hassle of generating a new
key and having your web of trust go through the hassle of resigning it when
your RSA key gets compromised on a server.
openssl tools are simple enough that generating throw away RSA keys is a no
brainer.  The same goes for most applications that support RSA keys.

@_subject: Length for AES256 symmetric encryption passphrase? 
You're making the assumption that 32 ASCII characters can produce every
possible binary combination in 256 bits.  I don't know how AES handles
password phrases longer than 32 bytes but the key can be stronger I'd
imagine with more random data as the key.  I'm simply presuming.

@_subject: Length for AES256 symmetric encryption passphrase? 
Interesting math.  However, I believe the OP mentioned they're generating
the password and storing so human readable, i.e. English, isn't an issue.
What would be the recommended length for completely random characters
generated, for example, by a password manager such as keepassx?

@_subject: Length for AES256 symmetric encryption passphrase? 
To clarify and be more specific... if one were using the password as the
symmetric key in the GPG software (libcrypt)?  Or perhaps even just using
openssl tools?

@_subject: Length for AES256 symmetric encryption passphrase? 
Just to be clear I'm not the OP so you don't accidentally confuse my
question with theirs.  My original doesn't serve a purpose because I use
GPG for encrypting my files and leave it up to that and don't normally use
AES directly.  My question was merely a curiosity so you can take it for
what it is.
Specifically, I said the password manager was keepassx for password
generation.  I realize that GPG and openssl are entirely different.
Perhaps my question was too broad with too many variables to be properly
answered by a single person and should have been broken up into different
parts to appropriate audiences.

@_subject: Heartbleed attack on Openssl 
For the most part it is service providers who are affected by the bug.
There's a handy website to verbosely explain heartbleed.
Affected services include HTTP, email servers (SMTP, POP and IMAP
protocols), chat servers (XMPP protocol), virtual private networks (SSL
VPNs), databases (e.g. mysql), and pretty much any service that uses
openssl TSL/SSL to secure transport of services if they're recently patched.
Security notices for popular server distros...
RHEL - Ubuntu - There's not much you can do at this point.  Update your system packages and
that's about it.
SERVICE PROVIDER
Essentially you want to take the following steps if you're  service
1. Test for the vulnerability -  it is also
prudent to search for the affected package versions across all services.
2. If vulnerable patch the OpenSSL version of public front end services
first.  Patch backend services after the front end is secure.
3. Reissue SSL private keys and certificates.  Since the leak exposes the
private key it is no longer pristine.
For the remaining more thorough steps of what to do see the
heartbleed.orgwebsite which has a nice set of instructions.

@_subject: It's 2014. Are we there yet? 
I've actually started talking to my family a lot about using it and getting
my parents to use GNUPG.  I think the biggest problem is "too many paths"
to accomplish what is needed.  There's so much software and so many
recommendations that you, as an expert explaining to your friends, need to
show them a single path and say, "This is how it is done."
I've written a document for my family and regularly link it on facebook
encouraging friends and family to use it.  Warning to PGP experts, the
terminology is dumbed down and the concepts are filtered so not everything
is technically correct but explained in a way that the user can
understand.  Also, it's a few pages of text and mostly screen shots.  I
tried making it fun somewhat so bear with the imagery.

I agree with your concerns.  In reality I only started using GPG a few
weeks ago which would explain my amateurish approach I suppose.  There is a
source document written in openoffice...
Also, I have created sha1 files... just append *.sha1 to the file name e.g.
For now I have removed the PDF since I have widely distributed the link to
the PDF so that people don't download it and receive misinformation.
The odt file remains.  I'm open to editing the document for clarity and
fact checking.  Once, an acceptable revised copy is well received on the
list then I'll recreate a PDF and upload it again.

@_subject: Heartbleed attack on Openssl 
^ That.  Assume the worst because the vulnerability was there for two
years.  Not sure who you're having a hard time convincing but send them to
heartbleed.com.  The first three paragraphs are for high flying executives
whose "business critical documents" are at risk.
What type of person are you trying to persuade?  If you download any of the
vulnerability test scripts in the wild you'll notice that the 64k output is
truncated and the script simply states "you're vulnerable".  Edit that
script so that it dumps the full 64k.  While you're at it put that script
in an infinite while loop and dump the output to a file on disk.  Then use
Firefox or chrome or whatever browser you want and log in to the service.
When you're done search the file for your credentials.  It doesn't matter
what browser you're using.
I have verified this claim.  (Firefox Version: 28.0+build2-0ubuntu0.12.04.1)
$ dpkg -L firefox | while read x;do [ -f "${x}" ] && (if ldd "${x}"
2>/dev/null | grep libssl &>/dev/null;then echo "${x}";fi);done | while
read x;do echo "${x}";ldd "${x}" 2>/dev/null | grep libssl;done
        libssl3.so => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libssl3.so
        libssl3.so => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libssl3.so
        libssl3.so => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libssl3.so
        libssl3.so => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libssl3.so
        libssl3.so => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libssl3.so
$ dpkg -S /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libssl3.so
libnss3: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libssl3.so
If it was openssl then it would be linked to
package which is a dependency of the openssl package.
While it's true Firefox does not link openssl in binaries the vulnerability
allows an attacker to easily hijack sessions, steal usernames and
passwords, and steal the server private key during the SSL negotiation
phase.  See my comments above for how you can verify that.
True.  $ grep -rH 'http:' /etc/apt/sources.list*
I'm not sure who you're trying to convince, Felipe, but HOPEFULLY you have
already handled this bug by patching and added rules to your intrusion
detection system for packets trying to attack SSL using this method (the
attack packets look very different from normal SSL communication).
Pete, forgive me breaking down your reply but I found it a good exercise in
attempting to verify your claims.

For example, my keybase account is... My friends who regularly interact with me on github (and more rarely

@_subject: encrypting to expired certificates 
This is a resent because I accidentally mailed Peter Lebbing directly
without the mailing list.
Allow me to lay to rest all the confusion in this thread.
On Tue, Sep 16, 2014 at 6:45 AM, Peter Lebbing Not really sure where you're going with this.  It has already been
*established* that if you're the key owner you can adjust the expiration
date of the key.  I think there's a lot of confusion around the intention
of a floating expiration here.  Expiring keys have the following function:
Expiring local copies of public keys on other peoples' computers to force
them to get a public key update from the owner.  That is to say that if I
have Peter Lebbing's public key and it has expired that means I must reach
out to Peter Lebbing for the latest copy of the public key of the exact
same fingerprint.  Expiration in this context does not mean the key is
forever invalid.  It means that *my copy* is invalid until I get a more
recent update from Peter Lebbing.  That just means Peter Lebbing would have
changed the expiration date of his public key and extended it.  So when I
get his new expiration date that is the time in which I must reach out to
him next for another public key update of the same finger print.
This protects both the key owner and correspondent in a couple ways.
1) If I have an expired key and I check to see what the latest key is of
Peter Lebbing, he may have revoked it.  In this case it forced me to go out
and check and see that it was revoked so I *must* not use this key again.
He can give me his new key with proper WoT validation.
2) If Peter Lebbing as a key owner loses his key and my local public key of
Peter Lebbing expires then the next time I reach out to Peter Lebbing for
the latest key copy he can tell me he, in fact, lost the key and give me a
new one with proper WoT validation.
To bring this full circle: the expiration date's purpose is to force users
of any public key to periodically check with the key owner that the public
key is still valid.
So if a key is expired I *must* not encrypt with it.  I *should* instead
reach out to the key owner and ask for their latest public key of the same
fingerprint which would have a new adjusted expiration date.  This ensures
I'm not encrypting to a compromised key, a revoked key, or a key in which
the owner lost the private key.
If you're the owner of a key that has an expired date, you *should* extend
it to allow further use of the key by your contacts.  If you decide you
don't want to use the key any longer then you *should* revoke the key.  If
you accidentally lose your key then no worries, because eventually it will
expire and nobody could encrypt to it even if they wanted to.
Hope this helps,
