@_subject: encrypt the sent folder 
How can I make sure that all the emails in my Sent folder are encrypted
and can't be read without my private key?  In other words, I want my
email in my Sent folder to be encrypted even though the email sent on
the wire is plain text.
Encrypt to self option only works if I send an encrypted mail.  I
couldn't get it to work all the time.
here is my gpg.conf:
comment ""
keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve verbose include-revoked include-subkeys
encrypt-to 0x34697591
default-key 0x34697591
Email client is Thunderbird/Enigmail.  Mails are stored on IMAP server
if it makes any difference.
Thank you.

Surely there must be a better way.  These all require admin access to the
IMAP server.  The software already does what I want some of the time (when
I send the recipient encrypted email).  I just want it to do it all the

I thought it was a mis-configuration on my part.
Fair enough.
Nope. I am the admin.
The servers in question already has encryption at the file system level
with cryptsetupLUKS for Linux and truecrypt for windows boxes.   But the
trouble is these do not provide any defense against attacks through the
network.  They will happily serve the emails thru the network to the
appropriate user when asked.  FS encryption is only good at boot time.
Once the partition is mounted, you can access the data.
I can give the end users a smartcard or a usb stick.  The objective is
to provide a solution so that not even the admin can read the emails
(say by changing the password and logging in as the user) unless he/she
has the secret key.

Ahh, this is the problem.
Should I open another RFE?  These are all the same problem after all.
And thank you for the explanation.

I think I am not expressing myself clearly.
No, see below.
We provide IMAP+SSL and POP3+SSL email access to our employees.  Plain
IMAP and POP3 is not provided.  SMTP is also secured.  We also provide
webmail service secured with HTTPS.  Again plain HTTP is not allowed.
This is basic stuff.  So eavesdropping on the wire is not my main
concern.  And mails are stored on IMAP servers with encrypted file systems.
This is not an authentiation issue because you can change the
authentication method at the server.  I want the emails to stay
encrypted even if the server is compromised.  I don't want anyone with
the root password to say "that is what you wrote 2 months ago" unless he
has my secret key.  And that is what GnuPG does, no?
And since all our email accounts are virtual - meaning thay don't have a
shell account, dont have a home directory and emails are stored under
the same UID at the server - I have to solve this at the MUA level.
Please tell if there is an alternative.

I'll fight for the budget but it's not likely.  Thanks anyway.

Which option is that in gpg.conf?
How does one deal with people quitting or people getting hired?  You can
revoke the keys for those that quit.  But how do you inform coworkers
that someone's key is revoked?  Or similarly distribute the new public
key to existing employees for someone who has been just hired?  In-house
Thank you

Over the years, I found that a good sign of an expert is that he/she
knows which problems are not as easy as they may seem.

@_subject: [OT] Why are you using the GPG / PGP keys? 
The college kids I talk to nowadays use email mostly for either
- official business
- communicating with their parents
and that's it.  Sure email is still relevant in the business world but
the future seems to have moved on.  The original assessment that email
is a dying tech/past its peak is spot on.
