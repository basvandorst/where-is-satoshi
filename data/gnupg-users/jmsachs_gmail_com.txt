@_subject: using gpg with private keys from openssl certificates? 
I'm experimenting w/ using the "freemail" certificates from thawte & was just
wondering if there is a way I can use them with gpg (openpgp, NOT S/MIME). I
can figure out how to use openssl to extract the rsa public key / private
key from the exported PKCS12 file, but I'm not sure how (or if) there was a
way to import that to gpg. I'm also missing some big picture issues, e.g.:
* is this a bad idea?
* if I sign a message with that key pair, and someone challenges my
identity, what's the best/easiest way for me to prove my identity? do I just
send them the certificate or a portion extracted thereof?
* is there a tutorial on openpgp, S/MIME, openssl certificates as to what
the different cryptographic assertion primitives are, from the standpoint of
a user who treats the algorithms/tools as a black box? (I've been interested
in RSA & public key encryption for 20+ years from a math standpoint, but as
a software user I just want to do things correctly) e.g.: "a certificate is
{a public key, identity information corresponding to that public key} signed
by a well-known Certificate Authority (CA) to assert that the Certificate
Authority asserts the public key belongs to the entity designated in the
certificate", "to verify a certificate, you use {program X with these
command-line options} to verify that CA's signature is valid"
This is as confusing as looking at plumbing pipes/fittings to me: I know
what the individual pieces do, I just have trouble understanding their
function in an overall cryptographic framework.

(at least I think assert is the right word... I couldn't think of the right
word when I wrote that)
I don't need them to interoperate, I would just like to use the same key
pair. WoT is fine but it would be nice to have a way to assert that [X = the
person in possession of private key K_pr = me + anyone I'm stupid enough to
share my private key with] is both trustable via Wot, *or* by trusting a
certificate authority. "trustable" probably not the right word but I'm a bit
shaky on the protocol vocabulary.

Interesting, I'll look into that...
hmm, let me try to restate more carefully, based on my understanding
(corrections welcome if I get information/terminology wrong here)
I know that X.509 and OpenPGP are "incompatible" in the sense that VHS and
Betamax are (were) incompatible. I'm not looking for something that works in
one to work in the other. Both, however, are based on underlying
cryptographic primitives to make security/identity assertions. One of those
primitives is (or can be) an RSA public/private key pair and the operations
using that key pair. This is used automatically by various software tools to
do different things in each of the two systems. But both rely on the
principles of public-key cryptography, including that a public/private key
pair, when kept secret, can be used as a security/identity assertion, by
encrypting messages with the private key, since the probability that someone
besides the person possessing the private key could have encrypted the
message can be made sufficiently small, and anyone can verify the encryption
using the public key.
So (and here's where I'm less clear) if I wanted to link the assertions made
by my X.509 certificates and my OpenPGP keys, there's no way to
automatically do this. But if I were to use the same private/public key in
both cases, I can assert to a third party that the entity in control of the
certificate / keys is the same entity because they are based on the same
underlying cryptographic primitive. In order to verify that assertion, that
third party would either have to manually transfer the underlying public key
from one system to the other, or allow a reputable software tool to perform
that task automatically. Such a reputable software tool may not exist right
now, and therefore this approach is not useful for third parties without the
manual skills to transfer public keys from one system to the other.
If there is an alternative approach that makes the same kind of assertion
(the entity named in a given X.509 certificate is the same entity in
possession of the OpenPGP key pair), then that would suffice for me. This
could conceivably involve putting some appropriate key/signature/whatever
into the X.509 certificate, if I could figure out how to make the
corresponding certificate signing request with the CA.
