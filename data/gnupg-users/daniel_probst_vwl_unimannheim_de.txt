@_subject: GNUPG-1.0.1/Cygwin 1.1.1 update 
There have been some questions re gnupg on MSWin systems but ported by
cygwin (sourceware.cygnus.com).
The newest cygwin vers 1.1.1 supports /dev/random under win32.
I thought I'd take a stab at compiling gnupg-1.0.1. It compiles more or less
out of the box with
configure --enable-static-rnd=linux --disable-nls --disable-dynload --disabl
some checks still fail and I haven't checked everything out properly yet.
As there has been some interest in gpg under cygwin, I thought I'd let
everybody know ...
