hi all!
In the last days I had been looking at the capabilities of gpgme. I couldn't
find howto change the path for the current keyring.  Do I need eyes glasses?
Best Regards,
(i didn't find anything related in the archives)

Another problem i see with email signing, is that the signature only valida=
the body, and someone can take ambiguous signed messages and give them=20
another sense (out of the original context). If the people start signing=20
_all_ theirs mails, and sends bodies like `The deal is off', `I love you',=
`Meet me at the bar at 15.00' then a 3rd party can fake the email headers a=
forward it. The new recipient will think that the message is valid. IIRC, [=
talked about that.=20
While this is not an issue when replying emails, as the original body and=20
sender usually is quoted, it is a possible issue with new emails.
