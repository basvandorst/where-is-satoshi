If you don't have a copy, you should get one, and the discussion you'd find most useful is in chapter 22.

Gotcha.  Well, as long as it's only a case of simple personal authentication  and not the evasion of a major government's dedicated intrusion attempts, I'd say do the confirmation over the telephone.  You can do PK key exchange through public channels and verify authenticity with a phone call.  It's not like ordinary individuals have networks of spies and spoofing servers at hand. And this guy still has an audience!
