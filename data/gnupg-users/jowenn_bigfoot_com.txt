@_subject: AW: Win32 - export keys 
I hope the problem with standard output on Win 32 is corrected soon, because
I need gpg as a filter application on a system running win98. And I have to
deliver the system in 10 days.
Sometimes it seams the stdout and or  in is opened correctly, because I can
encode and decode a string with a pipe, but often it fails.
Hope this is somehow related with the stdout problem with --export-keys. and
therefore not that offtopic
??? Can I compile gnupg under windows or do I have to compile it under linux
with a crosscompiler installed?
Kind regards
Joseph WENNINGER.
