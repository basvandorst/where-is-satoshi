Hash: SHA1
i'm from Germany, so please excuse my really worse english.
I'm new to gpg an generated myself a key a month ago. now i want to use
encrypted mail under windows too. so I downloaded pgp 8.0 beta from the
new PGP Corporation. But when I exprt my secret key by the following comm=
 $ gpg --output secretkey.asc --armor --export-secret-key maui
PGP won't be able to import it. Why ? Are they key fornats incompatible. =
anyone help me ?
I'm Using SuSE Linux 8.1 with gpg 1.0.7
Cipher: 3DES, CAST5, BLOWFISH, AES, AES192, AES256, TWOFISH
Pubkey: RSA, RSA-E, RSA-S, ELG-E, DSA, ELG
Hash: MD5, SHA1, RIPEMD160
And Windows with the newest PGP 8.0 Beta
I hope someone can help me to solve my problem.

I get the message that the 16bit encoding of the secret key is unsecure.
I don't think that this is a positive message.
Can I change my key back to the original format when I'm done with export=
to PGP ?
