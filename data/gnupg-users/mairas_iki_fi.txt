@_subject: Fetching keys from key servers? 
Are there any plans to make gnupg support fetching keys from key
servers using user ID as the search criteria? The current method of
supporting key ID's only is not too useful, since for the trouble of
looking for the key ID is as big as fetching the keys manually.
Pgp does this with no problems, but I'd really like to use gnupg

I remember having read that the US patent on RSA will expire next
year. Does anyone have hard facts about that?
Does anyone know the expiration date of the IDEA patents, then?
