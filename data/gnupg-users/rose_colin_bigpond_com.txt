This is my first post to this list so I hope I didnt screw it up. I am using
knode and only discovered today that it signs posts. I am using Mandrake 8.1,
CryptoKernel and KNode 0.6.1 and it signs with GnuPG fine.

Hash: SHA1
Last night I sent a signed message to someone and they told me they were unable to find my key on a keyserver ( So I put my key up on this server and did a search for it. If I search under my email address (or part thereof) I can find my key fine but if I enter the 8 digit key that comes with a signed message who's user is not on my keyring then I find nothing. I assume that the 8 digits I send on a signed message are  '8BBEA7F4' (correct me please if I am wrong) and if I do a search for this on the keyserver it again says 'no match'.
If I see the below in a message
Message was signed by unknown key ID C37FC139
then do I not do a search for the 8 digit code on the keyserver to verify the key and the user?

For your prompt and helpful assistance with the keyserver '0x' thing. I guess it would have been covered in documentation somewhere but I hadn't found it.
Thank you all

I have just recently mucked around with essentially the same thing under Linux Mandrake 8.1. So I can help with encrypted file systems if you are running the same version of linux as I have the appropriate binaries to install on your system (for the crypto-enabled kernel).
