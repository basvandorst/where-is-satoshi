How about if you append a hash of the file to the file, and encrypt that too?  Then have the remote machine do the trial decrypt-and-check-hash.  If all is OK the remote machine can then tell the local one to delete the original; and if it's not OK, it can scream at you.

Wasn't the original poster looking for something which didn't require trusting one particular piece of software?  If they're happy to go with gpg, or to use two different PGP implementations at the two ends, then sign+encrypt would indeed appear to cover it.
(Of course, it's not quite true signing, in the sense that it's only there as a check against corruption, and the signing key will be visible on the source machine.)
