Hello Heiko,
use "keyserver-options honor-http-proxy" in your gpg.conf
set the environmeny variable http_proxy accordingly, i.e.
set http_proxy=
~                      ^^^^^ ^^^^^
~                        |     + proxy port
~                        + proxy host
it'll ask it's dns-server (independently to the port-question - dns and
port do not depend on each other, at least not in your scenario)
well, try the following:
rem should fail, to be sure we're doing it right later on
gpg --recv-keys 0x259C3499
set http_proxy=
rem to be sure the honor-http-proxy (and keyserver) option is set
find "keyserver" c:/path/to/your/gpg.conf
rem should work now, if you've access to the proxy-logs there should be
rem a log entry like:
rem [...] TCP_MISS/200 1745 GET
 [...]
gpg --recv-keys 0x259C3499
if this works, set http_proxy in your systemproperties (for yourself or
systemwide) and restart mozilla so the new environment variable is
active (if unsure: reboot...)
also the keyserver-entries should be active (esp. honory-http-proxy, the
other ones are set by enigmail independently IIRC)
i hope those. if it doesn't work, contact me directly (i'm currently
subscribed to the digest-list only)

indeed - it's a documented one :-)
i was just browsing enigmails site [while searching a changelog for the
new version] and found:
"7. Enigmail fails to access keyserver from behind a firewall?
If you are using HTTP proxy behind a firewall, you need to use GPG with
the "keyserver-options honor-http-proxy". It is essential to set not
only the environment variable "http_proxy" to point to the proxy server
but to also set the environment variable "ENIGMAIL_PASS_ENV=3Dhttp_proxy"=
before starting Mozilla and using Enigmail. This ensures that Enigmail
will pass the environment variable to GPG."
BTW: It's your key-id i used *smile*
to the enigmail-folks: Why using another environment variable? If
http_proxy is set, simply pass it - or do i miss some point?
