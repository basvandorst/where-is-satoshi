It's just a bug that just about everyone noticed shortly after 1.0.4 was released. I'm sure the next release (or patch) will take care of it. =)

Hash: SHA1
Hey everybody, =)
It was pointed out to me (thanks Jean-Francois) that my signatures are coming out bad on this (and other!) lists for some reason. I haven't had any trouble in the past with using this key for signing or encrypting or anything like that.
However, if I grab any message that I send (I grabbed some from sent-mail and some test ones I sent to myself) I get the following errors from gpg:
gpg: can't handle these multiple signatures
gpg: can't handle these multiple signatures
However, it seems to only happen with e-mail sent through this particular client, as far as I can tell. (I'm using kmail from KDE on this machine). I can send e-mail from other mailers and I can decode them successfully, and I can run "cat  | gpg --clearsign | gpg" and get perfect results.
I'm still a bit perplexed, though. I could understand if my signature was being mangled, or the message was being modified, or something of that sort... but I don't get that the signature is *bad*, I get the above "multiple signatures" error message.
Does anyone have any ideas what might be causing this?
(Just to try to get some diagnostics out of the thing, if I take an e-mail message that gives the above errors, and then take a message signed fresh with --clearsign on the command line, and run them both through gpg --list-packets, the output is identical:)

Hash: SHA1
You're right, it needs an fflush() after each write, and I also forgot an fclose() at the end. I typed that thing up in my e-mail buffer, so there were admittadly some bugs. =)
Anyway, my point was that it's pretty easy to make a program that does almost exactly what every other "wipe" or "shred" program does for Windows if you want one. (BTW, if anyone wants the code I posted before with lots of little tweaks and fixes I added for fun after I sent the original message, I'd be happen to send it to ya).
All the arguments about possible not overwriting in place don't apply if you have a FAT filesystem. Once the data is out of the write cache, It does always overwrite files in place, assuming you don't resize the file first. (=
Obviously, no shredding or wiping program is going to be absolutely foolproof, but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't use one at all.

Sure: you're probably just getting a real public key that's being regenerated from the secret key. With most (if not all) public key algorithms used by PGP/GPG, the public key can be made with minimal effort from the secret key (whereas the converse is not true--the public key cannot be made from the secret key).
I know this is true for RSA and RSA-like algorithms, and I believe it's true with Diffe-Hellman (and variants like ElGamal).

I actually ran into this same thing when I upgraded to gnupg-1.0.4 and had some other users trying to install it... it seems that for some reason it won't make the ~/.gnupg directory for you.
However, if the directory already exists or if you just make the directory yourself, it works fine.
mkdir ~/.gnupg
gpg --gen-key
works fine.
This will never happen if you already have a ~/.gnupg directory (ie if you are upgrading from a previous version and you already have keys)

First of all, that's laughable. Take a look at GPG's code and PGP's code and it's obvious that
they aren't copies of each other.
Second, if someone wanted to copy PGP, what's to reverse engineer?! PGP's source is freely
availible. You can download it and look at it or compile it or whatever. You don't have to
"reverse engineer" anything. =)

Actually, the license for IDEA isn't really as restrictive as soft
people have made it sound. IDEA is completely free and doesn't require
a license for any personal, education, or non-profit use. The only time
it requires a license is when it's being used for commerical purposes
or by commercial entities.
Of course, it's still better to use a *completely* free algorithm
that's just as secure (TripleDES or Blowfish should do the trick), but
the idea that you have to obtain a license before you install IDEA is
false, unless you're planning on using it for commerical purposes.

If there's not already something that does that in Windows from the command line (I know some gui utilities that do it, and of course PGP does--but this assuming you're not using PGP), this should do the trick (this does exactly what most utilities like shred do--overwrite with '1's, '0's, and random bytes.

That's not entirely true--PGP (at least, the latest Windows version) does import secret keys (and notify you with a pop-up), but it DOESN'T automatically trust it.
I know this because I had to go in and manually force it to trust my own key after I imported it, or else it wouldn't trust any of the keys that secret key had signed. -- I think this is an acceptable behavior.

I suppose they don't want to fill up their null device. Or perhaps they don't want arbitrary users (or worse, a hacker!) to be able to penetrate and corrupt their nullness. ;-)
Seriously, though--it sounds like whoever denied the request has NO idea what /dev/null is. Maybe you should talk to someone else at the company. Without the null device availble, lots of programs won't work.
