@_subject: Problem with GEAM and KeyIDs 
I tried to configure GEAM 0.8.2 on a system with SuSE Linux 7.2 and
GPG 1.0.5. Automatically encryption is working now, but I've got a problem when I modify the decrypt file.

That's the KeyID, which I get with "gpg --list-keys" and the key is
working. What's wrong with the ID or which format does GEAM want? Anything I missed in the examples???
