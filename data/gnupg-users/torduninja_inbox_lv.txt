Hi all,
I have just changed to GnuPG (from the old freeware PGP v7) running
on Win2kSP3. I have GnuPG-w32-1.21-nr1 from Nullify.org and GPGshell
2.65. At the same time I updated my PGP with the freeware 8.0 version.
First problem: I can't open the .ems attachments in my mail client
(Eudora 5.2). I have set the Windows prefs to open .ems files with
Notepad, which works fine anywhere else on the system, but Eudora
gives me a "plug-in no longer available" message. This might seem
off-list as it's no doubt a Eudora problem, but several posts to this
list use .ems attatchments. At present I have to go to the attachments
folder in the Eudora repertory and open these files independently. Any
Second problem: When I ask GPGshell to sign a message the result is an
encrypted PGP message, not a signed clear-text message This happens both
for current window and clipboard data, and it happens when using other
applications (eg Notepad) as well as using Eudora. Maybe I've missed
something in configuring GPGshell?
Finally, a question: To test the compatibility between GPG and PGP8, I
created new keys in each, imported the public keys of each to the other,
signed them, then sent encrypted and signed messages to each. GPGtoPGP
gave no problems, but in decrypting the PGP-GPG message I got this
     gpg: WARNING: message was not integrity protected
What is the problem here?
Grateful for any help.

OK. That works fine.Thanks Adam. But what is the difference between "sign" and "encrypt and sign"?

Hi all,
Thanks to those who have enlightened me on the difference between
"sign" and "encrypt and sign".
So far I have not had a reply on the last point of my original post:

I see that GPGshell gives me the option, in GnuPG preferences, to
remove this warning (no-mdc-warning). As there appears to be no
option in PGP8 relating to modification detection code, I
assume that PGP (at least in the freeware version) encrypts
without mdc, which would make all messages vulnerable to message
modifications attacks. Am I correct?

@_subject: location of files 
If you are talking about the gpg.conf file, on win2k you will find it in the directory where you installed gnupg . The default location is C:\gnupg, but it can be different. Your keyrings and trustdb file should be there as well. You should also find a "readme-w32" file in the "Doc" subdirectory which tells you how and where you should install the different elements of gnupg.

Hmm. I wonder how many of those keys were actually generated by GnuPG
and how many were made by certain hacked versions of PGP. And for
those created with GnuPG, the following remark in the Readme file
might have played a role:
~  "Please note that the GnuPG implementation of ElGamal signatures is
      *not* insecure."
Which line?

Thanks, David. That should be good enough for those of us who want to generate oversize keys for some reason.
Actually, I agree with the criticism of these large keys, but I have a correspondent who refuses all encrypted communication with keys smaller than 7680 bits. Paranoia or eccentricity - I'm not sure. I have a large RSA v4 key created with a hacked PGP version, but I'm not happy with it because it has a v3 signature on the subkey, which doesn't seem too reglo for my taste.

This is a problem with the PGP 8.x freeware "Version" line. The line is 65 characters and armored blocks are wrapped at 64, so this line often causes problems.
to a
It seems that one can change the line in clear-signing or keyblocks, but I once had an "invalid armored header" on an encrypted message in which the sender had changed the version line. PGP decrypted the message OK, but not GnuPG.

Hi Graham,
I was going to wait until you'd finished moving house before tapping you for some tips on on a secure box, but as you kindly jumped the Aa I said, I'm using Mandrake for training purposes, so if I screw up something it doesn't matter much. In the end I'll use it as a rescue OS in case my W2K system goes down and I have to recuperate files. (I have Mandrake on the same machine as W2K). At present I'm trying compiling from source, which in most cases poses no problem.
That's Principle  on my list.
Of course.
I'm still checking out some different distributions. My first thought was to adapt the Knoppix Privacy Edition to run from hard disk, and maybe I'll try this because it offers swapfile encryption as well as an encrypted file system. But on my travels I met someone from Yoper (which is a distribution from New Zealand). Their distro is optimised for i686 and higher and has an encrypted file system (not sure about the swap file encryption - I'll see about that when the CDs arrive). It allows installation of RPM, DEB and TGZ packages but the big plus with this distro is that for registered users they'll make packages for anything you can't get to install or update yourself, tailored to your hardware.
The information I've been able to get on "security-enhanced" distros concentrates almost exclusively on network issues, which doesn't concern my project. I want an encrypted file system and swap file encryption but maybe  you can suggest other stuff I should have, too.
As for applications, I'm thinking of KDE, Open Office (plus other office software), Mozilla + Enigmail for preparing email to be transferred to a
removable medium, GnuPG of course, The Gimp + Image Magick, and (what I haven't found yet on Linux) a good video-editing application.
Apart from that, I want to make it as hard as possibly for anyone to even boot the system if they get access to my machine. I have a password-protected BIOS and my idea is to disable booting from floppy or CD-ROM. I'll have a FAT32 partition (no OS) as a halfway house for transferring files to my NTFS box so I can set the MBR to point to this partition. To boot the system I'll have to log into the BIOS and enable the floppy or CD-ROM to boot up.

On Thursday, March 27,2003 David Shaw replied:
OK. That's clear. Just two more questions.
1...Do I get any extra protection in using a password (random
characters) longer than 128 bits?
2...If I import keys created in PGP does GPG use the PGP cipher or does
GPG convert to CAST5?
