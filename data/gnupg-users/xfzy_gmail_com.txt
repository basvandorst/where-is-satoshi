Hi guys,
in a script in a specific situation I use embedded filenames for decrypting (as in "gpg -v --use-embedded-filename file.gpg"). For this script I need to know the name of the resulting unencrypted file, because I want to check headers on this file and extract if it's a compressed file format.
I don't see any way to get the file name within the script. My idea was to take the text output of "gpg -v --use-embedded-filename file.gpg" to a file via ">", but this is not possible, because it displays text on the console of course, as I have to enter a passphrase...
Do you see any way to get the embedded file name for variables?

You want to start cmd.exe first, cd to where you need to be and then do your commands. Otherwise you won't see error messages in case of errors.

First start a sheer cmd.exe via runas, then use this new cmd window for your gpg commands.
