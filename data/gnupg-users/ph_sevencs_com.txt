@_subject: Signature check with libgpgme-11.dll 
I have a problem to use the functions of libgpgme-11.dll in my application.
I have downloaded the gnupg-1.4.10, libgpg-error-1.7 and gpg_MadeEasy_1.1.8.
All three packages were installed to c:\usr\local\bin The gnupg-1.4.10 and libgpg-error-1.7 were build with ./configure, make, make install.
I have patched the gnupg-1.4.10 as described by Carlo Luciano Bianco.
The gpg_MadeEasy_1.1.8 was configured with ./configure --prefix=c:/usr/local --enable-static --with-gpg=c:/usr/local --without-gpgsm and build with make and make install.
To build the libraries I used MINGW32.
My operating system is WinXP and Visual Studio 2005 (C++).
In my application I load the libgpgme-11.dll via LoadLibrary(...).
I init GPGME like:
I init CTX like:
I read the public key file like:
But if I import the public key file into the context CTX like following code I get the error 117440662 (invalid crypto engine).
If I test the following I get the ErrorCode GPG_ERR_INV_ENGINE
The version no. of the engine cannot found but the file_name can.
Do you have any ideas how I can fix this error (compile gnupg-1.4.10 with valid crypto engine)?
If you need more details please let me know!
A soon answer would be appreciated!
Thank you very much and
best regards

My operating system is WinXP and Visual Studio 2005 (C++).
I my application I load the libgpgme-11.dll via LoadLibrary(...).
If I start the app and init the GPGME I get always the same error 117440662 (invalid crypto engine)
Here is my initialization of GPGME:
Have you any ideas how I can fix this error and what's the reason of this error is?

@_subject: verify signature between two files 
I am developing an application that needs to verify the signature between two files.
One File (*.asc) contains the PGP PUBLIC KEY, the other one contains the PGP SIGNATURE (*.asc or *.sig).
I have downloaded, installed and build libgpg-error1.7, libgcrypt-1.4.4, gnupg-1.4.10 and gpg_MadeEasy_1.1.8.
I have included the libpgpme-11.dll in my c++ project in MS Visual Studio 2005.
My question is:
Is there a method in the libpgpme-11.dll (or perhaps in any other dll) that I can call in my source code and give the method two parameters wich contains the path of the two files and wich can verify the signature between the two files?
For example:
verify_Signature( path of PUBLIC_KEY file, path of PGP SIGNATURE file );	
Please let me know if there is a method as described above and where I can find it (if possible with little example).
If there is no such method available, please can you give me some information how I can solve this issue and where I can get more information about the described problem.
Many thanks and best regards
