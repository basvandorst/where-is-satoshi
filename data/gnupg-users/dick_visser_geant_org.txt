@_subject: Change the location of the gpg-agent socket? 
I'm using gnupg 2.1.11 on OSX. This works great.
I'm using BOX as a sync tool to keep my .gnupg directory backed up.
However, BOX chokes on the unix socket 'S.gpg-agent' that's there when
the agent is running.
I've searched through the docs but couldn't find a way to configure
the location of the socket, other than at compile time.
Any ideas how to achieve this at runtime?
Many thanks!

It would, but that's not possible, so that's why i was asking.
Background, .gnupg being a configuration directory, and sockets seem
like a weird thing for a configuration directory. System sockets
aren't created in /etc/ either but usually in /var/run or something.
