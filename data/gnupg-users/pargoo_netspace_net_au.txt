@_subject: Cannot import sec/pubkeys! 
Hi all,
     After trying everything, I cannot import my secring.pgp or pubring.pgp
files into GnuPG.  I have pgp 2.6.2 on my Dos box - from where the keys are
coming, and version 2.6.3 under RedHat 6.0 (which sees my keys just fine),
as does kcmPGP under the KDE desktop.  So, until I try to import them, both
keys seem ok.  I have both the RSA and IDEA modules loaded.
     Upon typing 'gpg --import .pgp/pubring.pgp' the error message I get is:
     gpg: /usr/lib/gnupg/rndlinux: error loading extension:
usr/lib/gnupg/rndlinux: cannot open shared object file: no such file or
     gpg: key  secret key imported
            etc/...
     gpg: mpi too large (61922)
     gpg : Segmentation fault caught...exiting
     I've been picking the brains of a friend who is familiar with GnuPG
and he can't help me, apart from saying that he has 'rndunix' instead.  The
GnuPG I installed was an rpm, version 1.0.0.
    Cheers,
Guy Parry
