@_subject: [p2p-research] Fwd: video : take back our banks - new 
Been listening to the p2p network and picking up great stuff, but not felt up to add anything til now.
I have attached an article which is being published in Capital and Class in Jan. which might be of interest to the network - this is the Economic Conscience and Public Discourse attachment.
The second attachment - New Enclosures Article - is the draft of an article responding to the Wikileaks storm. I have only written the draft intro and laid out the general direction, bullet points of the main narrative etc.
I hope it can be both wide ranging whilst still doing full justice to the fine details of the myriad facets of re-establishing the Commons. Would welcome some help in describing p2p sensibilities and motivations from the network. Don't want to speak for others when you are all out there already.
Hope that makes sense. Cheers Jim Shorthose   econowmix at googlegroups.com

Launched to mark the start of bank bonus season, a new animation is setting
out to increase public pressure on government to take on the banks and not
sweep reform under the carpet. It ask politicians whether they have a plan
to tame the bank, and if not, why not?
The minute-long animation is inspired by *Rolling Stone *journalist Matt
Taibbi's description of investment bank Goldman Sachs as a giant vampire
squid "sucking on the face of humanity".
The animation is backed by a wide range of influential pressure groups
including: *nef*, Compass, PLATFORM, ResPublica, 38 Degrees, WDM, Positive
Money, Tax Research and the Post Bank campaign.
