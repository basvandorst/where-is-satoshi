@_subject: [p2p-research] pdf : extra-economic measure of value - 
Thank you Dante, excellently put, I am just now finishing my book on how the
idea of 'employability' and associated government policy attempts to force
people's activities into economic measures of value, simultaneous requiring
a forced subjectivity of mind toward constant knowledge acquisition
according to market demands. Lifelong learning schemes are used to measure
corporations' 'excellence' barometer in South Korea, people can gain credits
for 'intangible cultural understandings' which can be used by potential
employers to measure productivity capabilities, skills competitions gage
tacit know-how of young enterpreneurs, the global competencies index, the
list goes on for these incredibly explicit economic measures of value in the
supposed global knowledge based economy.

'Presenting a Case for Guaranteed Income and its Advantages'
Lynn Chancer has asked the question--one that has been on people's minds not
least since the Speenhamland Law: why guarantee income? 'Are the benefits of
this notion only that it is redolent of a broader concept of entitlement, or
are there reasons to advocate this particular policy over full employment or
other strategies focussed on jobs'?
The case for a guaranteed income falls into four categories of advantage:
Cosma Orsi presents his ideas on the Partner State and basic income (not
only here but this is one paper):
Also see Robert Theobald, The Guaranteed Income (Doubleday & Co. 1966)
including Erich Fromm's 'The Psychological Aspects of the Guaranteed Income'
in this text; Stanley Aronowitz and Jonathan Cutler, Post-Work (Routledge
In terms of cultural spaces and social improvement, see Joshua Cohen and
Joel Rogers, What's Wrong with a Free Lunch? (Beacon Press, 2001) and Steve
Shafarman, Healing Politics: Citizen Policies and the Pursuit of
Happiness (Xlibris,

Hi all
The FP7 project proposal I am coordinating is on the transformation of the
public sector predominantly in European countries and ideas for how to
utilise peer production techniques to accomplish this.
We put out a call for participants a month ago and we are nearly 'full', but
in particular, if you are a researcher at a 'legal entity' particularly in
Eastern Europe (we want a genuinely representative spread of participants),
please let me know what your view toward the problems with the onslaught of
new public management within your country, and either your ideas toward how
reform can be achieved, or a proposal for this kind of discussion.
All the best

Thanks for the emails, and I've emailed all on the FP7 googledocument but I
can also create a separate one.
In response to the points below, the European Commission looks for specific
proposals, and we'll need to narrow down the remit considerably. Michel's
suggestion for 'public/state support for social innovation by civil society'
is a broad category that sort of fits in to what is asked within the Public
Sector of the Future remit, and I remind him and other participants that the
*FP7 Cooperation Work Programme: Socio-Economic Sciences and the Human*ities
sets out clearly what is expected. I emphasised this section (more pasted

of these "New Public Management" reforms on some important policy domains
such as, for instance, education, health, water, energy and transport, and
study whether they have been effective in delivering services compared to
previous policies and taking into account and responding to the needs of
citizens/users for social cohesion.
Finding and making comparative analyses toward public support for social
innovation will be appropriate as a part of the proposal, but we need to
narrow our focus to aspects of the public sector i.e. 'important policy

Distribute the poster any way you see fit... thank you!
Industrialisation started here in Manchester, and post-industrialisation is
an ongoing process. At this event we will discuss how we intend to promote
sustainable political economic and production models using all resources
available. Speakers will be talking about Fab Labs, radical ideas toward
collaborative platforms, and other peer to peer models of production that
defy  competition and the strictures of capitalistism. The event is
intended, furthermore, to launch the Peer to Peer Research Group, an
independent group linked to the Peer to Peer Foundation

THANKS for this Michel!
As you know, I am one of the founding members of the Manchester Film
Cooperative, and have been interested in the Cooperative movement for some
time (some of the first cooperatives in the UK were started Manchester,
though the first was in Scotland), and have recently come into the free
software community. In the same spirit as Suresh, I'll try to help out if
possible. Josef and I are planning to touch base tomorrow.

Hi everyone, thanks for the kick up the ehem to get this emai out Suresh,
I've been meaning to for a few days:
Giles Simon (who works for Cooperatives UK and with Ed Mayo) and I make up a
sort of steering group for the Manchester Film Cooperative with a group of 5
or 6 others, and I brought this up at our last organisation meeting.
We are happy to do a screening on open source related stuff, during
Cooperatives fortnightly. Thus bringing the open source and cooperatives
movements into one room, which is the King's Arms in Salford, a great little
venue five minutes from Manchester city centre.
 In fact the theme for the next season which will have been launched by
then, is Movement so fits right in I'd say... Our theme right now is Work
and we're showing LVTrier's The Boss of It All next month (Paul A Taylor
will be our speaker for this film, he and I have written a paper looking at
open source and work), just showed Roger and Me last week.
Anyway I've run this past Josef but not in any great detail so let's talk...
The film cooperative is also interested in Vicky's project this summer, we
are talking about showing a film on the side of a bus, but we need to speak
to the ArcSpace lot about that,

@_subject: [p2p-research] Inaugural Open Infrastructures Conference 
Hi Suresh,
I need to have another conversation with Josef about what I'm suggesting
below as it's an initiative to get P2P and the Cooperatives movement in the
same room (metaphorically and literally), and in this case, putting on a
relevant screening during Cooperatives Fortnightly. Your suggestion here
also looks interesting.
I'm not sure about* free *space in Manchester of Salford... in the case the
Film Cooperative hold monthly screenings in a really great place called
Kings Arms, which we in fact rent for 100 british pounds per screening!...
The Cooperative is run by members in a not-for-profit way, but we generate
an income by  charging people to come to see the films and to see the
after-film speaker. That's how we fund it. We also pay for the distribution
rights for the films. But because we're a co-op and this tried and tested
'business model' is run by members, we can make our own decisions re-how we
do things, because we fund ourselves... we are usually down to the last 5
pounds, but it's a very popular event and we fill the room to
I think the idea is great, and in terms of getting space, I can look around
Manchester, we used to have something called The Basement which actually at
some point burned down which is a real shame!.... Are you also going to be
putting in grant applications to run this?
Smiles, Phoebe

@_subject: [p2p-research] Manchester Film Cooperative, Revolution OS 
I've love to let the list know that on Tuesday the 29th June, we will be
screening Revolution OS
as part of our theme for the Manchester Film Cooperative on 'Movement'.
Because we are a Cooperative, the themes, and films we screen are voted on
by members. We make no profit of course and are run in the Cooperatives
alternative model. We screen films in the upstairs venue of the fabulous
Kings Arms with interested people: activitists, people on the left,
concerned citizens and more.
We'd love to get the Free Software community involved in the screening on
the 29th June, since it is also part of an initiative to get the Cooperative
movement to speak to the Free Software communities. The last weeks of June
are this year's official Cooperatives Fortnight.
You see the connection.
I have, personally, written about the ecologies of free software (final
section of book to be published as soon as I get these proofs finished, it's
called the* International Political Economy of Work and Employability*, with
Palgrave; as well as a piece in FibreCulture next year in the special issue
Media Ecologies), a piece with Paul A Taylor  (2009) ?Exploitation of the
Self in Community-Based Software Production: Workers? Freedoms or Firm
Foundations??, *Capital and Class *97: 99-120, and I put on the event Media
Ecologies and Postindustrial Production last November
 which brought practitioners and
thinkers from across the world to sunny Salford!
Anyway hope this sounds interesting and hope to see you at the King's Arms
on the 29th June. We need a speaker too if anyone is interested--all this
requires is a chair for the discussions we hold at the end, complete with
delicious King's Arms beers. Ed Mayo may come--as in, the Secretary General
for Co-operatives UK  but
this hasn't been confirmed yet.
All the best, and hope you can all come,
