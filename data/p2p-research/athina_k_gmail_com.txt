Hi again,
I agree with Tere, I dont see a onflict of interest here. As far as I am
aware, one can publish in a journal and then with the journal's permission
(which is always given), publish the same or similar piece in a book or an
edited volume. It has happened a lot especially with work in progress. In
fact, in british academic terms, the last Research Assessment Exercise, the
same/similar piece of work, if published by two different venues could count
twice (this was not so in the RAE before that).
This is technical stuff, my point really is that some people's work might be
suitable for C&C (if it goes through as its editors can be difficult), and
others an edited volume somewhere, some can do both, they do not exclude
each other (its allowed!) and much more so, since work progresses, and by
the time a book comes up, material will be expanded and better to publish
Hope you are all in a creative pre christmas mood

Hi MIchel
This has been also my question and my motivation for writing on
on your question 'Will new open spaces that emerge,
ALWAYS become co-opted by the old rules systems?  Will they
ALWAYS be forced (as they scale?) to adopt the old rules?'
I would go argue that to be co-opted means to be forced to take a 'reform'
attitutude to social change (see for example the reform wings in the global
social movements to reform global neoliberal institutions etc), a more
'gradual' change, like running two parallel systems, so  people would have
time to adjust,  often means that change is  more like 'improvement' or
'inclusion' on social conditions, not radical change, which truly upsets the
status quo in any way
i d say that is the politically correct style revolution!
the other option 'the truly radical revolutionary' change from one day to
the next is always crashing against the unwillingness of human nature, of
domestic governments and the hierarchical world system to adapt and to lose
and gain in the process, often met with violence or blockage, repression in
all social settings, internet non excluded as you know.
In other words, closure and fixity is always there to piss everyone off and
to enclose the open spaces we create. However the filights away from the
system smoothed and morphed as a result of these spaces are somehow i think
registered and provide the 'bad' examples for the new generation to follow
(if they get off their consumerist arses and do something eventually!)
its not my fault you asked..........
hope all is well!

Hi everyone,
I had a meeting yesterday (Friday) with people at the Enterprise Centre at
Hull uni and they are very much interested in a conference, very keen to
involve business school and other departments in the idea, so we can cover
the sponsoring of the speakers comfortably and have a great time. This means
they would like me to do a proposal for such an event, and I will be doing
that this week, to send it the following back to them.
This is logistical stuff, as I already sold the conference in content and I
will be throwing in some ideas on what it could be to these people, so they
can take it to the relevant departments and negotiate some money for us. I
am planning to email that proposal to you mid-week hopefully, so any
comments can reach me in time to incorporate your ideas.
I figure if I create a stucture of sorts, you can build on it with your
stuff as well, if that is alright.

@_subject: [p2p-research] Discussing the rhizomatic state 
Hi All,
This is my primary research interest, so I thought I would offer a
couple of sentences here. The hierarchical versus networked, or
vertebrate versus cellular or arborescent versus rhizomatic, are all
different. Not black and white as we conceptualize them for reasons of
theoretical convenience. In practice, as we discover there are
necessary multimodal hierarchies some overt and some covert in
existence to attempt order into chaotic systems. It is the right
question to ask which of these orders benefits the movements or (why
not the state, if one is interested in the boring stuff!), and whether
content, message, ideology, organization, mobilization, recruitment,
decisionmaking, affect which shade of 'order' fits which 'cause' if
you like.
On the second question, obviously there are enormous differences
between a sociopolitical or politico-economic/socio-cultural movement
or network which is more dependent on active desire rather than
reactive/reactionary and violent, fixed predatory identities, which is
what we are witnessing with al-qaeda and various Non state
ethnoreligious actors in low-intensity conflicts. In terms of the
hierarchy-network question as well there are differences as al qaeda
is a network, one might argue quasi-rhizomatic, in the sense that it
is based on kinship, and identity is predatory, while the ideals
remain reactionary and adhere to the ethnos and religion (not as in
nationality, but as in Muslim peoples, the global ummah). Only the
network style is adopted for practical reasons to survive and move to
recruiting a new generation. In contrast the anti-globalization
movement or dissidents within countries in sociopolitical
cyberconflicts are not only networked for practical reasons they see
and believe this 'philosophy' of peer production or new age ideologies
as close as to being a coherent political statement in itself.
Lastly, the role of the state is to keep up with the one and fight the
other (or the other way around depending where you stand ideologically
; )
Hope this helps

Hi MIchel and All,
I think there is a trend in the literature and research at the moment on the
sustainability issue and it is everywhere. I d love to have a look at this
generaly or  regarding military power and the US and blog for you, but I
have to leave it for April if that is ok, there is a lot on until then.
Perhaps what would be a good idea, since I would have time form April
onwards, is for you to think of various things that you need comment on,
make a list if its not too much to ask and I ll have a go at blogging for
them in one go. Alternatively, I could start and blog on my new book on

them there.

Hi All,
I just had a chance now to read this discussion and by coincidence I have
been discussing with my students, while teaching a course on New Media and
Politics, the issues of participation, democracy and power in relation to
online projects. So it seems quite topical to me right at this moment.
I think a big problem comes from the fact that political and particularly
western democratic theory has dealt with participation in a very bizarre
way. Sadly, it seems what has prevailed regarding theories of participation
in maintream political theory is that the more it increases, the more it
'lowers' the quality of democracy, as the lower classes participate more and
this elitist view  inevitably has costs for our understanding of
participation and the internet. The current figures of political
participation in western democracies, according to some, have to stay low
for democracy to work......(blame it all to the Greeks I do!!)
This idea has dictated odd and downright exlusive/binary political
practices, on a micro-level, such as those you referring to in the case of
wikipedia. Moreover, in my view you can't get credit for 2 out of 3, you
need all three things identified by Jon earlier to be there to talk of
peer-to-peer, and perhaps some more, otherwise you end up with good
intentions, espoused ideals and organizational philosophies, which when
translated in reality, in real actions, they are not really charactiristics
of p2p practicing communities. Simply then, you can't have your pie and eat
it too, pretending to be revolutionary/transformative or whatever and all
that while you just apply a selection of these processes (thats more like
some of the NGOs!). Or I will do my 'hobby' (the word MIchel hates) get
credit for it, create reputational capital for myself and hope that I ll be
a little bit revolutionary as well if it turns out that way..........like a
collateral damage kind of thing
It is also funny that one of you mentioned the Soviets.There is a feeling I
am getting some times that  perhaps we are in a way running again on a more
global level, a much more sophisticated early 21st century understanding of
social tranformation resembling the early 20th century international
communist ideas, which of course resembles sth else before that (Anarchist
theorists and before that bourgeois revolutions), if we look at this from
world-systemic perspective. I think the bigger question is right now is
whether the explosion of new political ideas due to new technologies is
there to conserve the status quo or transform it. I am getting mixed
signals, which maybe signifies the creation of country-blocks again in the

@_subject: [p2p-research] Open letter to Routledge 
Hi Michel,
Well its true, it can get too expensive.
The reason is that most specialist research monographs tend to be published
first as hard back copies and sold mainly to libraries (uni and public
libraries, or big companies do and can afford them), because they normally
appeal to a very limited audience. Then if and when the book is more popular
it is done again in paperback, targetting students etc, and it then becomes
much more affordable.
A way round this problem if you want to get your hand on any of this type of
specialist exensive stuff is to ask for a review copy from the publisher, to
write a review on the book you are interested in, they will send you one.
It would be particularly bizarre for me to sign a letter to Routledge as it
is the publisher for 3 books I am involved in 3 different series, but I am
willing to sign a letter all the same, as not many people can initially
afford to buy anything i write, so i have to send illegal electronic copies
and the like to people, its kind of restrictive, I agree, I am with you

@_subject: [p2p-research] From the document web, via the data web, 
Well its the middle of the night here too, and after reading that I thought
that there is a little bit more to the technical side of this, which Henrik
very competently discusses here.
I think this piece makes a serious point in relation to our understanding of
knowledge and how our philosophy of human-to-human and human-computer
interaction influences knowledge and particularly 'universal'  knowledge (a
truly bizarre utopian enlightment concept), as well as the uncertainties
created by 'globalization' and technocracy.
The article deserves attention because it warns against relying on 'boolean'
logics in IT terms, I would argue in relying also in 'binary' terms in the
political sense (although that is more relevant on the point of allowing for
interaction, disagreement and happily conflict, as they produce the most
interesting results).
What has been done 'technically' with Web 2.0 is not enough and
fundamentally the architecture is still the same relying on certain logics
of 'universal' truths, fact triangulation and customer-client relationships,
instead of networking and building on each other and why not, even
producing  'biased' knowledge. The reason the Web 2.0 is not that 'fun' is
because it is impersonal (or often too personal!), alienating to the
computer illiterate, and not catering for exciting interactions for those
that are IT literate.
To put it simply, some aspects are too centralized (control of platforms,
software, e-commerce etc), while others are too scattered and lost to the
few more well known blogs and webpages. The architecture is not enabling,
because it was devised for different purposes.
All the great efforts and amendments to that will always fall short. It is
like a house constantly changing builders, architects and engineers, I see
it difficult though, however good these people are to have better
cyberspaces, unless the foundations are looked at, and not only in technical
The philosophy part this author advances is in my opinion spot on.

hi ryan
last time state sponsored capitalism came about after the 1930s depression
totalitarian and fascist regimes followed as well, do you have any thoughts
on that? perhaps in certain cases we are already witnessing a tendency
towards neototalitarianism

@_date: 2009-04-12 20:06:33
@_author: Athina Karatzogianni 
@_subject: [p2p-research] Prospect Magazine: After Capitalism 
Hi Michel
you wrote to andy "but totalitarianism, neo or not, I disagree,
I also think it's counterproductive because when the real thing comes, we'll
have lost all our conceptual ammunition"
I think the real thing is already here in embryo. The difficulty is that
recognising it as such, means you are obliged to do something about it.
There is not enough willingness on the part of the middle classes, as
life-style anarchism/or discursive theme variations of it are what is
currently on the menu. Push button democracy is better than nothing, but not
really the solution. On the contrary, as you constantly point out, the
hardware 'real' aspects are very important, nevertheless individuals could
feel threatened enough in certain 'liberal' democracies not to participate
in alternatives, and that could have a serious effect.
There are elements of every day life in these democracies that are
neototalitarian. A small example that pops into my mind now is when the
knowledge worker is constantly scored, timed and monitored in his work from
going to the toilet to all sorts. Permeating everyday life with fear of
losing your job (a teacher here in Britain lost her job for saying to a
child when asked in a multicultural class that there is really not a santa
clause per se --last xmas). In Britain it is a mainstream observation what
there is a nanny state in operation, it is not a paranoid idea. Look at the
state's reaction at last demos in London. Perhaps things are not as hard
core as Thailand or other  countries, but they are still quite worrying,
especially when these governments make very 'democratic' claims, providing
the standards by which other countries would have to abide by to be deemed
democratic enough to be included in alliances and economic unions.
Lastly, neo-totalitarianism is not only the extreme forms one imagines,
there are various freedoms that have been recalled both sides of the
antlantic the past 7 years. That is another quite mainstream observation,
especially now that Obama is in charge supposedly reversing the mess. You
might have not experienced this in circles where being critical is one's
job, like universities, but in the UK, my current country of residency I
have seen from 96 to now a progressive trend towards neo totalitarianism,
well hidden perhaps for the audiences abroad. In some professions, in some
communities and in certain situations people are very careful of what they
say and dont say.
just a thought
hoped you all had a great easter day

I would also like to add here if I may, in response one of your previous

supporting this effort (i have kept  chasing them around for the past 2

they are here to be taken. I am not excluding anyone and neither does what

how it can exclude anyone? I have taken it for granted that it has a peer

time in hull to discuss all these issues and create some sort of governance

I am very familiar with Nottingham Trent's issue with web content and othe
problems with IT control in general, a colleague just beagn  project there
and he is having a very difficult time with them. They also insist on not
outsourcing work, which is weird as their prices for the simplest work are
very high.
I am positive Hull is going to be fine. I am negotiating now to be excempt
from any centralised control and have my content aprroved by the final
person without jumping any hoops at all. So fingers crossed we will be fine.
Now about your theoretical conversations I would have to agree with Michel
we need a basic platform from where to find common ground and agree to
lanuch from. The other debates and high theories can follow and indeed they
will be a significant part of theoretical research and research
output produced from the members of the P2PResearch group.

This was really big in the 1990s, in that instance mroe with the third way
debate, so there are many people to look at if you have access to an online
journal outlet, with an athens password, your university should provide you
with one (i already did at some point i dont know if you still have it).
For instance: for a recap and more biblio see Elson's Socialized Markets,
not Market Socialism at the socialist register journal
he did one back ion 1988 as well titled Market socialism or socialization of
the market for the new left review as well
also in the case you cannot get your hands on an athens password, there are

Sorbonne ? Paris IV]
Public Keynote: TBA
Our plenary theme is ?Developing the Virtual Society: Conflict in Adoption
of Online Collaborative Networks?. As virtual society develops and peer
technologies pump in its heart, this conference brings together academics of
all disciplines to discuss conflict in the adoption of collaborative
networks. This is a time of confrontation between older forms of
communication and organization and new ways of sharing, collaborating and
acting collectively. We seek to explore conflicts emerging in the transition
from and resistance to horizontal participatory networks and also conflict
within collaborative networks. We welcome suggestions for panels and papers
on any area relating to our theme, and particularly in the following areas:
?    Network Theory
?    P2P and FLOSS methology adoption
?    FLOSS methology
?    Open source conflicts and forking
?    Adoption by NGOs and the developing world
?    Adoption by social movements, hacktivism, cyberconflict
?    Institutional resistance to networks
?    Online P2P Places and Conflicts
We encourage especially contributions, but not limiting, to politics,
economics, computer science, business, psychology, sociology, and law.

Just to get in this for a moment, since I ve been following the discussion
for days. Andrew Rogers: the reason we are in a global financial mess is
because we thought we could predict everything with rigid financial models,
supercomputers and infallible systems? Complex and chaotic systems are
extremely difficult to predict. We dont live in mediocristan, but in
extremistan as Taleb amusingly informs us. That is common knowldge I should
think. Besides all the American utopian technology crap of the 1950s, what
makes you really think that 'a computer will still be able to predict and
manipulate your behavior below the threshold of your ability to detect it' ?
Hmmmmmmm, we dont live in a comic book and writing about life like we do is
charming but really not helpful.......

Dear All,
On P2P TV, I was wondering what *the state of the literature* is on that and
also problems with Internet Protocol TV, as I  have a PhD student coming in
September to do this kind of research, and I am getting interested in it as
well. Does anyone have any biblio/references on that beyond the general and
what can be found online? I would be very willing to share
resources/findings after my student gets on board.

@_subject: [p2p-research] petition on academic freedom in Thailand 
A Thai professor is facing charges of insulting the king for passages
written in an analysis of Thai politics and the 2006 coup.
The "offending" passages can be read here:
*Stop the use of lese majeste laws in Thailand. Defend freedom of speech*
We, the undersigned, oppose the use of lese majeste in Thailand in order to
prevent freedom of speech and academic freedom. We demand that the
government cease all proceedings in lese majeste cases.
The September 19, 2006 military coup in Thailand claimed "Royal legitimacy"
in order to hide the authoritarian intentions of the military junta. *Lese
majeste charges* have not been used to protect "Thai Democracy under a
Constitutional Monarchy" as claimed. The charges are used against people who
criticised the coup and disagree with the present destruction of democracy.
They are used to create a climate of fear and censorship.
One obvious case is that of associate professor Giles Ji Ungpakorn, from the
Faculty of Political Science, Chulalongkorn University. He is facing *lese
majeste* charges for writing a book *A Coup for the Rich*, which criticised
the 2006 military coup. (Read the book at Others who have been accused of *lese majeste* are former government
minister Jakrapop Penkae, who asked a question at the Foreign
Correspondent's Club in Bangkok, about exactly what kind of monarchy we have
in Thailand. There is also the case of Chotisak Oonsung, a young student who
failed to stand for the King's anthem in the cinema. Apart from this there
are the cases of Da Topedo and Boonyeun Prasertying.
In addition to those who opposed the coup, the BBC correspondent Jonathan
Head, an Australian writer names Harry Nicolaides and social critic Sulak
Sivaraksa are also facing charges.
The latest person to be thrown into jail and refused bail is Suwicha Takor,
who is charged with *lese majeste* for surfing the internet.
Thailand's minister of justice has called for a blanket ban on reporting
these cases in the Thai media. The mainstream Thai media are obliging. Thus
we are seeing a medieval style witchhunt taking place in Thailand with
"secret" trials in the courts. The Justice Ministry is also refusing to
publish figures of *lese majeste* cases.
We call for the abolition of les majeste laws in Thailand and the defence of
freedom and democracy.

Nietzsche's typewriter - a Hansen Writing
1878 model of the Hansen Writing
In 1881, when he had serious problems with his sight, Nietzsche wanted to
buy a typewriter  to enable him to
continue his writing, and from letters to his
is known that he personally was in contact with ?the inventor of the
typewriter, Mr Malling-Hansen from Copenhagen?. He mentioned to his sister
that he had received letters and also a typewritten postcard as an example.
Nietzsche received his writing ball in 1882 directly from the inventor in
Copenhagen ,
Rasmus Malling-Hansen .
It was the newest model, the portable tall one with a color ribbon, serial
number 125, and several typescripts are known to have been written by him on
this writing ball (approximately 60). It is known that Nietzsche was also
familiar with the newest model from E. Remington and
Sons(model 2), but
he wanted to buy a portable typewriter so he chose to buy the
Malling-Hansen writing ball, as this model was lightweight and easy to carry
? one might characterize it as the 'laptop' of the day. Unfortunately
Nietzsche wasn't totally satisfied with his purchase and never really
mastered the use of the instrument. A number of theories have been advanced
to explain why Nietzsche did not make more use of
research indicates Nietzsche was not aware that his trouble in using
machine had been caused by damage to it during transportation to Genoa in
Italy, where he lived at the
when he turned to a mechanic who had no typewriter repair skills, the
man managed to damage the writing ball even more. Nietzsche claimed that his
thoughts were influenced by his use of a typewriter (*"Our writing
instruments contribute to our thoughts"*,
one researcher has noted, "Nietzsche's interest in rhetoric and his
experience of the typewriter framed his understanding of language in a
highly symbolic way: the traditions of the philosophy of language versus the
scientific and technological conditions of
February 16, 1882 he even made a poem about his writing ball:

Und feine Fingerchen, ums zu ben?tzen.
*Or in English:*
The Writing Ball is a thing like me: of iron
Yet twisted easily ? especially on journeys.
Patience and tact must be had in abundance
As well as fine [little] fingers to use it.

Anarchist professor warns of potential for London protest violence

This is the ageing anarchist police fear will bring chaos to the capital's
streets next week.
Prof Chris Knight who lives in a ?1million house himself, is organising
protests under the banner G20 Meltdown.
Yesterday he warned bankers to stay away when his group comes to town. He
added: "If you're thinking of coming in, my advice is don't. People are
incandescent about the way you've destroyed their lives."
His group threatens to storm buildings that don't switch off lights on
Saturday - which has been designated Earth Day.

Asked if he supports violence, Mr Knight said: "Not against people but I'm
not too bothered about damage to property.
"Make no mistake, we are quite prepared to go the whole way.
"One way or another, those lights will be getting switched off."
Worried police have drafted in more than 2,500 officers and cancelled all
leave. Knight, a professor of anthropology at the University of East London,
is planning operations from his home in Lewisham.
Asked about the ?7.2million police operation to combat the anarchists, he
said: "If they want violence, they'll get it."

THE university professor who has been suspended for "inciting violence"
before G20 protests remained defiant today and renewed his threats against
the police.
University of East
Chris Knight said: "The message to police is 'if you press
your nuclear button, I'll press mine'. It sounds like a threat? Well, yeah -
don't do it. If you want violence, you'll get it."
The university suspended Professor Knight on full pay pending an inquiry
into his behaviour after he told the Evening Standard this week: "If they
[the police] want violence, they'll get it."
The 66-year-old, who lives in Lewisham, has organised next Wednesday's G20
Meltdown Financial Fools Day protests under the banner of The Government of
the Dead.
He will also lead attempts to target businesses in the City and Canary
fail to switch off their lights tomorrow night.
The University of East London did not take immediate action against
Professor Knight, but it was confirmed today that he had been suspended.
He was told his comments were "inciting criminal action, specifically
violence against policemen and women and damage to banking institutions".
A university spokesman said: "Professor Chris Knight has been suspended from
his duties at the University of East London pending investigation. In order
not to prejudice this process we cannot make any further comment."
Professor Knight was unavailable for comment.
Academic suspended for G20 outburst
2 days ago
An organiser of G20 protests was suspended from his job as a university
professor after he warned bankers could be "hanging from lampposts", it has
been reported.
Chris Knight, the professor of anthropology at the University of East London
who is organising protests under the banner G20 Meltdown, told BBC Radio 4's
PM on Wednesday: "We are going to be hanging a lot of people like Fred the
Shred from lampposts on April Fool's Day and I can only say let's hope they
are just effigies."
The University of East London told the BBC that the professor was suspended
from duties while an investigation took place into his comments.

Posted on March 26, 2009 by Liam
are not many jobs in which you can win favour with your boss by going on
national TV and predicting that bankers might be ??hanging from lampposts?
with the blatant implication that you think this is a very good idea, even
if it does capture the mood of the moment. Chris Knight is at that stage in
his career where he no longer gives a tuppenny f about these things and
has been all over the press expressing the uncontentious view that the world
revolution begins next Wednesday in London and that by June the entire
planet will be one country.
He used a slot on Channel 4 news to tell viewers that the lights will have
to be switched off in every office building they see during ??Earth Hour? or
?our agents will find ways to enter the building, even if it means knocking
down doors and ?windows to break in.? Predicting that up to one million
people will be demonstrating this Saturday he threatens ?mutually assured
destruction? if the cops get violent. It?s the ?our agents? phrase that
leaps out.
If a stranger in a pub came out with this sort of stuff there are some
questions you?d ask straightaway. ?Is he the undercover leader of a mass
movement that?s been quietly building?? Possible but unlikely. ?How long
will it take me to finish this pint and go somewhere else?? ?If I go to the
toilet will he nick my jacket?? You would not think that he is anything
other than a harmless crank with a good line in demagogy. That?s not how the
University of East London sees things. They have suspended Knight from his
post in the Anthropology Department on the grounds that he might be inciting
Credit has to be given to Knight and the networks with which he works. They
have a panache and a theatrical flair that the rest of the left lacks. They
connect with thousands of angry militant young people and give them easy
answers. On the other hand they give them an utterly wrong conception of how
politics works and how strong the social resistance movement is. Chances are
that some people will roll up to the Bank of England next week expecting to
be part of an army that will fight the cops and trash the City. It?s a very
individualistic, moralising type of politics. The Met will teach them the
hard way how wrong Knight was.
Knight has the right to express this lunacy loudly and in public from any
forum that is open to him. His employer, which used to be considered a
radical campus, has no right to censure or silence his private political
views - especially at a time when similar opinions are commonplace on every
chat show that discusses the recession.

  I personally agree with what this petition says, and I think you might

Best wishes,
athina karatzogianni
below is the text as well
To the Corporate Management Team (CMT) of the University of East London
We are writing to you to express our anger following your decision to cancel
permission to hold the planned UCU (University and College Union) sponsored
alternative summit and close down the university on Wednesday 1st and
Thursday 2nd of April 2009. We are urging you to reconsider both of these
In the last 15 years, anti-g8/g20/WTO/debt etc. protests have been held
across the world; often to coincide with the meetings of the powerful,
taking a stand of dignified rage against decisions that have led to
increased poverty and inequality, ecological devastation, war, the violation
of human rights, and a global economy that is now imploding after huge
wealth has been concentrated in fewer and fewer hands. The very vast
majority of these protests have been peaceful. In the case of the Genoa
demonstrations in 2001, as has been reported by a variety of sources -
including leading newspapers in the UK - the police were found to have been
responsible for the violence that ensued.
On these occasions, universities around the world have often played a
crucial role in hosting fruitful debates between individuals and civil
society organisations, in a common effort to develop strategies and visions
to put the world on a better course. Alternative summits have often been
held in university spaces, as occasions open to a wide public. There is a
reason for this. The life-blood of democracy is the meeting and sharing of
hearts and minds, and the university is one of the best existing
institutions that can facilitate this: in fact, this is the university?s
only fundamental purpose. A university like the University of East London
(UEL), proud of its open access policy and of its commitment to inclusion,
even more than others, must take a stand to defend its public role of
facilitating dialogue and promoting social justice. But in order to do so,
the university has to be open. It is the responsibility of its management to
defend the historic role of the university as a sanctuary for open debate;
not to collude with those who are responsible for the present crisis in
depriving it of that role.
Yet, a few days ago, senior university management of UEL decided to cancel
the alternative summit that was sponsored by UCU, citing ?security?
considerations (the classic excuse for every historic attempt to curtail
free speech). Now it even proposes to close the campus for normal academic
activity. So instead of opening up to the world, UEL shuts down and closes
in on itself. Instead of seizing the opportunity to become a common space
thriving with creative energies, it plans to become an empty shell for two
It is time for the university management to become accountable not only to
the government funding bodies, but to the wider public to whom it owes both
its livelihood and a duty to fulfill its role as a part of civil society.
The past 3 decades have seen public spaces such as universities hollowed out
by the state and by corporations, as more and more of our common resources
are transformed into sterile commodities, valued only in cash terms. In
universities this has led to a policy regime which increasingly sees
?employability? in the ?creative industries? or in ?business and finance? as
the only benchmark of success by which a university education can be judged;
which sees research separated from teaching; which sees ?knowledge transfer?
to the commercial sector as the only legitimate destination for the fruits
of inquiry.
There is a deep connection between this process and the ones that have led
the world to its current state of social and economic injustice and climate
chaos. In all such cases, the real collective creativity that generates
value of all kinds - from the factory to the seminar room, from the
laboratory to the orchestra, from the field to the home - is channeled into
the endless, mindless production of commodities. This connection between
social creativity and commodification must be weakened, if we want to meet
the challenges of our times. But this cannot be done if spaces for debate,
questioning and social invention are closed down.
We can all see where such neoliberal dogma has led the global economy. Now
is the time to decide whether UEL will carry on following the rules of this
discredited programme, becoming a part of the deepening problem; or whether
it will start to become part of the solution, as a university should.
We urge you to reconsider your decisions and take this unique opportunity to
open the university as a crucial centre of democracy, since democracy is now
the only safe path for the world out of the current multifaceted crisis. We
must keep our university open to staff and students, rejecting the claims
and ?risk assessments? that reproduce fear instead of promoting dialogue. We
urge you to take responsibility for enabling the university to act as a
truly public space for debate in a time when nobody can doubt that radical
new ideas are needed. The alternative summit must go on; classes and
lectures must go on. We would feel ashamed of UEL if this institution - to
which its staff is so committed - were to become known as the university
that had closed its doors to democratic debate and education in times of
crisis such as these.

@_subject: [p2p-research] Fwd: [ox-en] No more money trickery propaganda 
Dear All,
I just wanted to say that it seems to me here there is an interwining of
three conflictual situations here if it helps making sense of it at all:
One conflict involving *content*: the monetary debate, and this must be
encouraged to continue and flourish whoever, and wherevever the participants
may be in the future.
A second involving *process of exchange of ideas/content*: which list is
carrying it off, who is on it, who is leaving it and why, and for example
why if the 'leader' of a list is not interested in a subject or is angry
should the conversation not continue in that list, issues of censorship and
self-censorship etc. This  one has to be managed by the moderators and
founders of the different groups publicly or not depending how they operate.
Third, involves the *human relationship and the friendship*, about which I
think Michel and Stefan can deliberate in private and not in public. It is
their relationship and their responsibility. We should all stay out of that,
unless we are explicitly asked to help.
We are all interested in content and argumentation, and process, [more or
less depending on how its is argued and debated], but the rest is a private
matter, and I would suggest to continue the first two and drop the third
conflict as one to be resolved as and when the two people see each other in
person. We all know as users and as researchers that this kind of computer
mediated interaction can be sometimes unessarily intense compared to

Hi All,
As much as entertaining this is, it just occurred to me, that we could
actually set a reading on this and discuss freely, at least then we can use
a common base and language to talk about this, a specific author for
instance we can agree on and preferably contemporary, even better of the
last year to capture the crisis. This way at least there is a platform to
launch from a proper debate and avoid the 'you and nonsense, no common
sense, semantic misunderstanding' etc. I feel that it might prove to be more
constructive and who knows a possible review might come handy to collect
people's view on the author we choose and the subject matter related to what
is debated. Just an idea. As this is not my expertise, perhaps the people
who feel more passionately about this can offer such author so we can all
sink in? I would find it easier to participate in the debate, as currently I
am sensing there is a lot missing I could learn more about. I have heard one
of these authors speak today on the radio on my way to uni, but I am not
sure if it is specific enough for you guys, or 'p2p correct' if you allow.
In any case i thought i d mention it *Animal Spirits*: How Human Psychology
Drives the Economy, and Why It Matters for Global Capitalism by George A.

Ha ha thats pretty correct Andy, although if there is a work on it already,
needs to to be engaged with and critiqued or shredded to pieces. By the way
I dont think the articles you are mentioning are doing that much better ho

@_subject: [p2p-research] Is the P2PFoundation a Shill for Proprietary 
Hi this is an interesting situation. It is about a software tool for network
analysis. It is ignored but it would be perhaps useful instead of
hypothesizing about whether this person knows about user freedom or p2p to
make that statement after you have talked to them and perhaps if they are
oblivious to it to engage them in the process. Secondly, it is an invitation
to review, to be critical of the product. If it is a very expensive licensed
software targeted at corporations (which is what it seems to be) then why
not try it and constructively compare and contrast with p2p products and so
It seems this raises again the issue of ideology I think in p2p which so far
has been a bit conveniently thrown under the carpet, especially in relation
to the commercialization and promotion of the open source and open products
in general.
Either you view this product as something you can criticize constructively
and propose an alternative open product, or you bar proprietary products
from reaching the list in the first place. This means fixing an identity for
the p2p list and excluding anything outside that identity, which needs to be
decided collectively I should think.
In any case, I think personally its fair enough to want to keep the list
strictly on p2p and open products and ideas.

@_subject: [p2p-research] P2P Ideology 
Dear All,
I wish at the moment I had the luxury of time, but as I am in Shanghai and
exhibiting my capacity for sustaining boredom in meetings, just a couple of
things to feedback to the substantial comments so far.
Matt has pointed to the inevitable social and politico-economic implications
of p2p, and Paul raised the issue of the difficulty in living by the high
moral ground, which are both, entirely valid observations. The problematic
truly begins after these observations in what Sam, Stan and Michel are
debating on in relation to ideology. Both Michel and Sam have a negative
understanding of ideology. The former mentions it as a mechanism for
exploitation and exclusion, as did some of you as well on the exclusion
point, while the latter placed it against culture and the p2p process
I tend to agree with Ryan, we cannot avoid the topic of ideology, power
decision making, leadership emergence, it will keep coming back in the
everyday life of this movement to haunt as again and again and in the bigger
choices we will be asked to make. Stan wrote I think that we have to have a
clear signal to send. No one can get away with no strategy, no clear
identity, no message framing, no clear compass. No movement ever succeeded
with no ideology or a parallelogram of ideologies with a common
root/denominator. I am not sure being a 'bat' neither a mammal nor bird, a
Switzerland, however admirable, is a solution so we can be friends with
everyone under the sun. I dont want to be friends and collaborate with
fascists, racists, or totalitarians to name a few for example. So yes, I d
like to exclude, and ideology helps you do that however fuzzy the spectrum
may be. It is idiotic to be politically neutral in the fear of alienating
potential partners or collaborators. I am not an intellectual whore and none
of you have given me the impression that you are so far. So yes, there is a
question of ideology and in my humble opinion, openness is one thing, being
undefined altogether is another.
I hope you forgive my harried response. I should hope to be able to think
about this a bit more and write again soon.

Hope everyone on list is enjoying Wikileaks (so rich in issues for p2p
Here are a couple of paragraphs of what I did for Digital Icons.
*Blame it on the Russians: Tracking the portrayal of Russians during
cyberconflict incidents*
This article tracks the portrayal of Russian hackers in relation to various
cyber conflicts
and cyber crime incidents. It employs cyber conflict theory (Karatzogianni
2006; 2009a;
2009b; 2010) to engage with various aspects of cyber conflicts implicating
Russian hackers,
such as the cyber conflicts involving Estonia and Georgia. Further, its
purpose is to identify
and analyze the continuities in the coverage of Russian hackers, and links
made in the global
media between intelligence, cyber espionage, cyber crime and patriotic
hacking, which even-
tually and inevitably also implicated Russian hackers and Russia in the
Climategate hack.
The article is not written in defence of Russians or the Russian government.
The intention
here is to simply demonstrate that although Russians *are* involved in cyber
crime and cyber
conflict incidents - as are other nationals by participating in cyber crime
gangs, ad hoc patri-
otic assemblages, or even hacking dissident media organisations to reinforce
the government
line - they are also portrayed by the majority of the global media as
*the*perpetrators of every-
thing under the sun (unless the crimes are attributed to China or Chinese
hackers).The paper
demonstrates that the Russians were accused relentlessly of the Climategate
hack under a
new Cold War rhetoric spurred on by Russia's energy interests and
motivations. In contrast
to the overwhelming blame that Russian hackers are made to bear, there are
other possible
competing explanations: involvement of oppositional bloggers and scientists
invested in the
Climategate debate, or computer security failure at East Anglia University's
The first element of my analysis in this article is mapping the real events
and the envi-
ronment of cyber conflict. The Estonian and Georgian cyber conflicts are of
the ethnonation-
al type, revealing also cultural struggles, due to Russia's alleged
continuing intervention in
the political life of these countries. The hacker groups involved in these
conflicts and their
systems of belief and organisation aspire to hierarchical apparatuses
(nation, ethnicity, identi-
fication with parties and leaders). The Climategate hack case, on the other
hand, has sociopo-
litical and economic aspects, as it is an issue that is global in nature in
terms of content.
However, the Climategate case also points to ethnic and national issues in
the coverage, as
geopolitical narratives involved the main protagonists in the Climategate
debate and the ac-
tual groups blamed for the hack. In mapping the environment of cyber
conflict, the relation-
ships between military and security, politicians and media, and geopolitical
dimensions need
to be addressed.
In the process of building my argument, I surveyed approximately 130
articles collected
between 2007 and 2010. The articles were sampled by using the keyword
'Russian hackers',
while also snowballing to include other items that followed the initial
searches. The articles
discussed here include sources from mainstream media (online versions of
magazines and TV outlets, such as *The Guardian, New York Times, Wall Street
Journal, The *
*New Scientist, The Independent, Le Monde, BBC, AFP, Reuters*); country- and
specific media and blogs (such as the *Georgian Times, Russia Today *and
climate sceptic
blogs); and IT business, security, and military sites and blogs commenting
on cyber security
and on technical aspects of the cyber conflicts discussed (such as *National
Defence Maga-*
*zine, Wired Magazine, Asian Computers, PC World, *Villeneuve's blog). An
effort was made
to include an equal number of articles out of these three types of sources.
My analysis is also based on my previous research, where I integrated
elements of social
movement, conflict and media theories into a single analytical framework of
'cyber conflict',
in order to explain the empirical evidence of various cyber conflicts.
Elements of social
movement theory were adopted to discuss sociopolitical cyber conflicts;
conflict theory was
used to address ethnoreligious cyber conflicts; and media theory was
deployed as a compo-
nent for both, deriving a single integrated analytical framework for
understanding cyber con-
flicts. This framework has been applied when analysing ethnoreligious and
ethnonational cy-
ber conflicts (i.e. Israeli-Palestinian, pro-Islamic-anti-Islamic conflicts
related to the Iraq war,
Indian-Pakistani and American-Chinese) and sociopolitical cyber conflicts
(such as anti-
globalisation, anti-war movements, dissidents in authoritarian regimes and
Internet censor-
ship in different countries (Karatzogianni 2006). Lastly, I have used
framework analysis of
content, similar to Juyan Zhang and Shahira Fahmy's (2010) approach in their
analysis of American and Russian press coverage of political movements in
Ukraine, Belarus
and Uzbekistan. The authors chose the sourcing, causality and moral judgment
frames to ap-
ply to their empirical evidence. This type of frame analysis is taken into
account when look-
ing at discourses and analysing the Internet as a medium.
The first section of this article is an overview of cyber attacks; the
second discusses the
global media coverage of Russian cyber crime; the third explains the
connection of cyber
crime and politically-motivated cyber attacks in the post-Soviet cyber
space; the fourth sec-
tion looks at cyber security and geopolitics discussions; the last section
dwells on the new
Cold War rhetoric and the framing of Russians as responsible for the
Climategate hack. Al-
though the global media often portrays individuals and groups of Eastern
European or post-
Soviet origin as a uniform category, the main focus here is on the media
portrayal of Russia
and the Russians.

Hi MIchel
I just saw this message right now, I do hope you are feeling better. I tried
calling 0066 53 817857291 (66 thai code and 53 chiang mai?) but no luck
In any case what I was going to say is hang on in there and try and look
after yourself, in Greece we say: 'Eat well, sleep well, love and be loved'.
I had a health issue that tortured me for 3 months after china with massive
pains due to irritable bowl syndrome, couldnt do anything for weeks. Have
patience it is going to be alright.
Try not to get stressed, its the cause of 90% of illness.
All my love and wishes for speedy recovery

@_subject: [p2p-research] Intelligent People Have "Unnatural" Preferences 
What a load of nonsense
I think this male monogamous, atheist, genius fallacy is snake oil science
personally and generalising on one characteristic (physical or otherwise) of
a person to validate them, their morality and their intelligence has been
proven very dangerous in the previous century. Whoever came up with this was
seeking to validate their own gender, their own sexual choices, and their
'genius' ego, manipulating any science that was getting on their way.
Think about it
Plus, how many pre-1980s monogamous, atheist, male geniuses have you heard
of anyway? And how come not women's preferences? Are women also low
intelligence if they are polygamous? And gays? Or is it only monogamous gay
people that are above average intelligence?
It is flattering for some to be sure, I am an atheist and currently
monogamous and like to write at night, I dont think that validates any
claim, do you? Oh I forgot I am not male, and I am not a liberal, so my
chances of fitting this fascist psychiatric profile are low
I do intensely dislike people that get away with such nonsense
