@_subject: [p2p-research] On Alex Rollin stated intentions to expel 
Hello Michel and Alex,
I am a newcomer to P2P research list (but not to peer networking) and have been slow to catch up with the coding/content dispute that has broken here. I've now read most of the recent contributions and Michel I want to assure you of my support in how you have been handling this.
It may be as the scope and scale of p2p evolves that you could pay some attention to how your role plays out. This is true for any of us, reflexively being intelligent about how we do what we do, and especially with reference to power.
However I see you as being persistently patient and facilitative in dealing with the non-negotiable demands being expressed by Alex, and I see you Alex as being persistently unaware of how imperious, duress-laden and domineering your take on wiki-building has been.
Alex, such domination behaviour unhinges the often delicate nuanced 'agreeing to disagree' that cooperative mutuality seems to require. It generates 'either' 'or' choices.  This is not to deny confrontation, ie unsolicited feedback, but if this is framed as coming from an over-arching 'right to insist' then it is likely to be destructive of rapport and trust. Which I would argue are a key ingredient in our network communities.
Other thoughts/suggestions:
Splitting is a fundamental organic process it is sometimes felt as tearing but later it can be often something to be pleased about, especially if a thread of contact, no matter how thin, is maintained across the divide.
In an situation similar but smaller in scope to yours Michel, I have found it effective re the network I have been in for 16 years, to describe what I do as being 'a conduit into and out of the network'. This coupled with a network agreement that no one can speak FOR the network, ie no one owns it, means that anyone can speak in their own voice FROM the network. Through this ground rule I and others have been able to find an often feisty political voice with which to publicly raise professional issues that were being denied or swept under the carpet and to pursue what we feel to be essential positive programmes.
As someone has uggested, the current conflict might also be due to you both having reached an internet 'glass ceiling' up against which nothing much can be done without personal face to face contact, preferably with mediation. Is that out of the question?
Finally, Michel, in recent months I have found in the P2P Foundation pages a rich, refreshing and inspiring source of orientation and experience, much of it directly coming from you.  I look forward to this flourishing being sustained.

UK. I live on the Thames in London and just this week a consultation opened on the role of the Port of London Authority that as I now appreciate a century ago was made statutory manager of an enclosure of the tidal Thames.
Since then most of their industrial business has faded and they have drifted into being exploitatious monopoly landlords.  Resistance to this posture has now grown to the point where they appear to be willing to listen to it and I thought I would introduce the notion of commons into the consultation.
Any pointers to previous experience of related negotiations would be helpful. I have searched widely for material but haven't as yet come up with any texts or contacts.

Hi Kevin,
I've subscribed to the news list but don't appear to have received a confirmation.  Would it be possible to send a welcome message from the new list when it has settled in so that we know the transition is done?
