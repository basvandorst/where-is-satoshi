Don't be offended. Just reacting to the liberal use of the word 'communism' in that wikiworld book. Michel Bauwens April 29 at 9:48am technically, p2p as a social mode is what alan page fiske calls communcal chareholding, i.e. exchange with a totality, it is not related to workers coop, which is currently just a different market modality, unless there would not be work for money exchange in the coop. as far as I can see Tere's is asking is how do we get from p2p in the immaterial world, to a system of worker coops. If that is your usage of communism (in old marxist terms, this is what technically would rather be socialism, i.e. the intermediary stage where there is still exchange, i.e. everyone gets rewarded according to effort. Daniel Araya April 29 at 10:07am Michel, you are humorless on this subject. The point is not "my interpretation" but the common understanding of a term loaded with generations of assumptions. It is not merely an empty signifier but comes with over a century of political contestation. Tere clearly uses the term communism to highlight Marxism not despite it.

I do. I think that the introduction of networks is reconfiguring the world entirely. Its speeding globalization and restructuring global power. I disagree however, that cognitive capitalism/cultural economy is a fetish or illusion. I think it is a new stage in capitalism that will require significant changes in education. But I would agree that the P2P vision you have is likely beyond the 'knowledge economy'. My only doubt is the time frame. I don't think its around the corner as you do. I think capitalism with adapt to the ecological crisis in front of us through innovation. The major reason I say this is simply that I don't believe humanity as a whole is anywhere near being culturally mature enough for communal shareholding. So I guess I would agree with the Marxist view of economic stages, but disagree that the final stage is communism. Unless by communism you mean stigmergic innovation (but it in that case I would jettison the baggage of the term). I am a techno-utopian, thats true. But I've never believed in the notion of 'humanism'. I find it a silly self-worshiping religion. I agree with what you say here, though knowing you, I think you are a great romantic yourself but yes, cultures and systems need to mature during a sizeable time, and political phase transitions come after, their level of violence a function of the failure of the older system to change through other means. If you look at the political revolutions at the end of feudalism, they took quite different features in different countries. I still need to read "The first european revolution" which says the final shift to a consolidated feudalism occured in a pan-european way in about 975.
Do you agree with me that a deep transvaluation is taking place now, similar to what occured at the end of the roman empire and feudalism, setting the stage for a system that will have quite different premises?
As you may know, my own notion of mutual reconfiguration of social classes is quite different from the marxist premise as well,

@_subject: [p2p-research] P2P revolution? 
I resonate with alot of what you're writing here Kevin. I think networked production will change things dramatically. But the only economies in the world right now that are seeing significant economic growth are industrializing ones (BRIC, etc). This may change in the near future but for the moment it is BRIC countries that are predicted to become the largest in the world (while advanced countries begin to contract). To my mind, the P2P 'revolution' looks alot more like of a bunch of guys on listerves talking about a revolution in the abstract. I might concede that advanced economies lack the leadership to fully leverage peer networks for production. But for the moment, my money is on Asia and the development of industrialized capitalism outside the West. There we see a revolution in the concrete. For a fully fleshed out P2P revolution to unfold you will need to integrate the education system in some way. Its not going to simply happen spontaneously-- at least not in the numbers you would need to make ubiquitous. The feudal age had the church. Modernity had the university. What does peer production have?  Hotmail has tools for the New Busy. Search, chat and e-mail from your inbox.

@_subject: [p2p-research] communism is silly 
I didn't realize 'communism' was about all that: Energy, the
environment, economic freedom, innovation, the end of selfishness... Wow. I had thought it was merely a translation of Rousseau's urbane
notions of tribalism into the field of economics (combined with a
generous "borrowing" off Hegel of course). But lo-- communism is many
many things it turns out. More than simply a critique of capitalism, or
the forced manufacture of equality, it appears to be the swiss army
knife of economic revolution. Tell me Michel, what technology, democratic practice, or medical
innovation has a Marxist ever invented? Why in the history of
experiments with communism was there no democratic communist state? Call P2P commonism if you like but the continued harping on a dead
eurocentric philosopher who couldn't even feed his family is
ridiculous. Collectivism is your hope not mine, so I'd prefer not to
soil the promise of networked production with the adolescent silliness
of class war and a "proletarian revolution". most of the speakers specificially disavow such romantic yearning for a perfect future, and speak of the actual movement to create non-commodiized social relations, here and now ... this is something that I presume most people sympathetic to peer to peer are doing ... while the success of this is historically mitigated, the refusal to see humans as only commodified social relations and the continued practice of commoning, is really what sustains civilisations, which would collapse without it ..
romanticism, or 'positive hope' or 'false utopian expectations', are not characteristic of one particular side, since 1989 they were most prominently characteristic of the so-called free-market right, which so spectacularly failed in 2008,
at this stage, the left has a much firmer grasp of 'negativity', i.e. social and environmental externalities, costs and dangers, than anyone in the grasp of elite politics, free market absollutism, enterpreneurial romanticism, or transhumanist technological determinism, all dreaming for magical solutions that will wipe way all the real problems humanity is facing at this stage
what is the left really about, in its core, is expanding the field of opportunity to all, and the democratized choice of any policy which affects any individual, while the right hope that the free rein to the elite, restricting decision-making to moneyed interests, and letting the top 1%  grab the lion's share of the social product, will magically and romantically 'trickle down' ..
hoping that one day you will read evidence-based literature such as
- the spirit level,  and what they show is that while neoliberalism has dramatically restricted post 1973 growth levels, most of the countries with high growth rates, such as Brazil, adopted more equitable social policies ...
I think a possible exception to this might be China, though your colleague Jan Niederveen Peterse calls it a 'social capitalism' as well, but is is the one BRIC country where social equality decreased ... but frankly would you want to live in a FOXCONN compound ..?
I will maintain the romantic fiction that communism remains to be fully actualized somewhere somehow in spite of half a century of failed attempts across the planet if you'd like Michel ;)

@_subject: [p2p-research] The problems of debt 
Michel, you're presenting a false argument IMO. Ryan is making the point that the entire system of capitalism (all strata included) is highly productive-- the most productive system so far in fact. Marx himself made the very same point...  this is of course very questionable ...
put capitalists in a room, and they are tremendously unproductive, they are only productive because workers are productive, but you could argue, that the organisation of production is a form of productivity ... yet most of that done is not done by capitalists but by a paid managerial class ... also, as we now know, the most well-paid were actually destroying the most value (there is a study of the NEF on that ... .. the added value of capitalists and financiers is actually negative)
so your statement that in capitalism, the more value you create, the more you consume, is a nice piece of mythology, but unwarranted and disproven ..
you also discount social movements ... the Nordic countries have very strong labour and social movements, could this be an explanation, rather than mysterious goodness, that explains their social system,
and is it a coincidence that the best-paid workers in the world, i.e. the Koreans, also have the strongest unions?
following your reasoning, the top 1% of the population mysteriously created lots and lots more value ... yet, growth rates declined dramatically since the 1980's
In the past and present, people of enormous productivity (e.g. capitalists) consumed significantly in a way that others see as wasteful.  Indeed it is.  But they view this as a reward for their huge productivity.  Measuring productivity and value creation is hard.  No one knows exactly how to do it.  But we do know that people will argue that their capacity for value creation is greater than it might actually be.  In other words, people negotiate for their own benefit rather than society's.  If society does a bad job at evaluating value of productivity, systems become very inefficient, and the machines of society too often produce stuff people don't want as much as they could have if the machines had been used efficiently.  In capitalism, the more value you create.  The more you get to consume.  In any other system, immediate imbalances are inevitable.  The only possible non capitalist system that can work, in my view, is one where moral responsibility to the society is a sort of currency...as in Nordic countries.  In those places, value producers subordinate their own desires to those of others.  Why?  Who can say. Money is, in simplest terms, a machine.
It isn't like a machine.  It IS a machine.  It is a machine that either makes something others want (value) or it is a machine that makes things only a consumer wants (i.e. consumption).
If it makes consumption, it is used up.  If money makes value, like all machines that can be used more than once, it is a value multiplier.  If someone uses money to create value, then they are productive.  Productivity leads to happier worlds because people have things others want.  In an eastern-styled anti-desire world, these systems do not apply...though there is ample evidence, given free choice, nearly everyone wants something that is scarce.  Wanting fewer things that are scarce is a sort of advantage in this new world, but it is a choice most would not want to make freely.  People like cars, tools, luxuries of all sorts...jewelry, prettier mates, etc.  These things cost machinery...money to produce.  If they don't create further value...then that is consumption.  Non productive consumption burns up capital.  It is a fire in the machine shop.  Granted, it is a necessary fire, but it is a fire none-the-less.
Build a good machine...and value is created.  Build a worthless life or machine, and value is consumed.    I've been asked to explain debt problems as influenced by technology.  I'll try.
Here's my "theory".  Many others share or have versions of something similar.  I claim no originality.  I've posted several versions on this list.
1. Growth occurs when someone produces something others value.  The sum total of value is the economy.
2. In the past, it was a matter of work and labour to produce something of value...like digging a hole where a hole was wanted.
3. People learned to take money that was not in use and to use it by borrowing it and then buying value-production which was then placed on sale.
4. The process of 3 entails risk.  Risk was rewarded by profit. 5. The system of 3-4 really works quite well so long as profit is likely.
6. In a world where learning and high productive machinery requiring low skill levels is readily available (i.e. post 1990 or so) making profit is harder.  7. Item 6 is especially true if innovation is not protected by the state (e.g. through intellectual property.)
8. Because profit is harder especially in tangible goods and services (because of technology and learning distribution) credit is harder.
9. When credit became hard, the incentives to cheat increased.  People lent money badly and then cleverly sold the bad loans to others who didn't understand.
10. When 9 happened, the state had to decide whether huge firms fulfilling important institutional roles would die, or be saved.  11. Nearly all states, especially in Japan and Europe, chose to save old institutions (e.g. Royal Bank of Scotland), or in the US, AIG.
12. There is now an open question as to whether markets can still create value (e.g. the iPod) in such a way that debt is justified.  If not, capitialism in the form that creates ready growth through using unused money is screwed.
13. When money goes unused, it is difficult to create new money and growth of value.  There is no/little incentive to innovate.  This can be called "deflation."
14. Deflation is more dangerous to capitalism by far than inflation.  Deflation means shrinkage of an economy because unused money becomes more valuable by sitting than by being used.  Thus, people become even more risk averse.
15. When 14 happens for a long time (e.g. Japan) then demographic and institutional patterns start to become unsustainable.
16. When 15 happens, we do not understand the long term outcomes, but they don't seem good.

@_subject: [p2p-research] Post-Capitalism 
Ryan, one question I have for you: Do you think there is room for continuous innovation in 'capitalist' post-industrial economies? If so innovation in what areas? Green energy? Or are we in the early phases of a post-capitalist commons-based era? What is your view (ignoring all the Marxist fog)...? Hi Ryan,
when do you place item 8, I think this would be crucial in your theory,
if you place it in 2008, then obviously, this is right, but if you place it before, it's totally against the historical record, as debt and credit is precisely the strategy that was chosen to jumpstart the economy, i.e. the social product going to labour was dramatically diminished, forcing the middle class to resort to debt-fuelled lifestyles ... It is the collapse of this strategy that led to the meltdown of 2008 and the death of the neoliberal model (but not of the power of the elite that sustained those policies, as you rightly say, they were 'saved' and remain in place)
as any enterpreneur or capitalist knows, in real production, profit only comes from monopoly, i.e. preventing as long as possible that innovations are shared, once this happens, super-profits become impossible, and start declining very rapidly; this is of course why IP is crucial,
in a world of open and social innovation therefore, and I think this is happening, profit tends to be distributed much faster, and therefore declines much faster,
as you can see in the RSA animate presentation by David Harvey, and this is confirmed by The Big Shift of Hagel/seely brown, production-based profit has dramatically declined, and only financial rent is now providing profit, or at least it was until 2008 I've been asked to explain debt problems as influenced by technology.  I'll try.
Here's my "theory".  Many others share or have versions of something similar.  I claim no originality.  I've posted several versions on this list.
1. Growth occurs when someone produces something others value.  The sum total of value is the economy.

On Sun, Jul 11, 2010 at 10:50 AM, Ryan Lanham     Money is, in simplest terms, a machine.
It       isn't like a machine.  It IS a machine.  It is a machine that       either makes something others want (value) or it is a machine that makes       things only a consumer wants (i.e. consumption).
If it makes       consumption, it is used up.  If money makes value, like all machines       that can be used more than once, it is a value multiplier.  If someone uses money to create value, then they are       productive.  Productivity leads to happier worlds because people have       things others want.  In an eastern-styled anti-desire world, these       systems do not apply...though there is ample evidence, given free choice,       nearly everyone wants something that is scarce.  Wanting fewer things       that are scarce is a sort of advantage in this new world, but it is a       choice most would not want to make freely.  People like cars, tools,       luxuries of all sorts...jewelry, prettier mates, etc.  These things       cost machinery...money to produce.  If they don't create further       value...then that is consumption.  Non productive consumption burns       up capital.  It is a fire in the machine shop.  Granted, it is a       necessary fire, but it is a fire none-the-less.
Build a good       machine...and value is created.  Build a worthless life or machine,       and value is consumed.          On Sun, Jul 11, 2010 at 10:33 AM, Ryan Lanham       I've been asked to explain debt problems as         influenced by technology.  I'll try.
Here's my         "theory".  Many others share or have versions of something         similar.  I claim no originality.  I've posted several         versions on this list.
1. Growth occurs when someone produces         something others value.  The sum total of value is the         economy.
2. In the past, it was a matter of work and labour to         produce something of value...like digging a hole where a hole was         wanted.
3. People learned to take money that was not in use and to         use it by borrowing it and then buying value-production which was then         placed on sale.
4. The process of 3 entails risk.  Risk was         rewarded by profit. 5. The system of 3-4 really works quite well so         long as profit is likely.
6. In a world where learning and high         productive machinery requiring low skill levels is readily available         (i.e. post 1990 or so) making profit is harder.  7. Item 6 is         especially true if innovation is not protected by the state (e.g.         through intellectual property.)
8. Because profit is harder         especially in tangible goods and services (because of technology and         learning distribution) credit is harder.
9. When credit became hard,         the incentives to cheat increased.  People lent money badly and         then cleverly sold the bad loans to others who didn't understand.
10.         When 9 happened, the state had to decide whether huge firms fulfilling         important institutional roles would die, or be saved.  11.         Nearly all states, especially in Japan and Europe, chose to save old         institutions (e.g. Royal Bank of Scotland), or in the US, AIG.
12.         There is now an open question as to whether markets can still create         value (e.g. the iPod) in such a way that debt is justified.  If         not, capitialism in the form that creates ready growth through using         unused money is screwed.
13. When money goes unused, it is difficult         to create new money and growth of value.  There is no/little         incentive to innovate.  This can be called "deflation."
14.         Deflation is more dangerous to capitalism by far than inflation.          Deflation means shrinkage of an economy because unused money becomes         more valuable by sitting than by being used.  Thus, people become         even more risk averse.
15. When 14 happens for a long time (e.g.         Japan) then demographic and institutional patterns start to become         unsustainable.
16. When 15 happens, we do not understand the long         term outcomes, but they don't seem good.

@_subject: [p2p-research] communism is silly 
This is really too lengthy to parse effectively Michel. My critique is of communism. I pay homage to the many social revolutions over the past centuries-- especially the recent civil rights movements in the US. Many of these movements owe something to worker protests. sure. But even more-- I would argue-- to a deep strain of Judeo-Christian ideology that successive waves of revolutionaries have borrowed heavily from. Including Marx himself. My bone of contention-- as I have already said-- is the loose way Marxists claim all social revolutions as their own. As I believe you are doing right now. You point out the many contributions of social protest and I would respond by saying, terrific. The more the better. But please spare me the Marxist babble.
communism was the dream of european and other workers to have a world in which equal relations and full democracy would be possible, and part of the broad tradition of emancipatory thinking who wants to give every human an equitable chance .... it belongs in the same tradition as the french and the american revolutions ... communism by the way was not a collectivism, i.e. a theory of subsuming the individual to the collective, but rather based on the principle, like in mahayana buddhism, that the liberty of the individual is predicated on that of his brothers and sisters, in other words, nobody can really be free by enslaving others, or in a world predicated on exploitation of others.
the reasons why class society persisted,  including in the state-capitalist or state-'socialist' countries, is a complex one, and I would welcome the debate on the issue, so why don't you start, and I'll promise to respond (not of course, that I have a full answer myself)
I'm personally not sure that this dream will ever be a reality and am not prepared to wait for it, but I think we can make substantial advances to a more equitable world order, not just because we can, but because we must, as the present infinite growth order is not compatible with our survival.
P2P is one attempt to formulate a narrative and a politics that can bring about such a change, by subsuming market dynamics (but not capitalism) to a higher purpose and deeper social logic through the generation of commons. In that, I honour the many previous attempts to achieve it, from many different sides, which for me includes that dead european philosopher, but also many others; and I recognize as primary enemies totalitarianism in all its forms, especially Stalinism in all its derivative forms.
You ask, "Tell me Michel, what technology, democratic practice, or medical innovation has a Marxist ever invented?" and of course the answer would be the same as for the masons or christians, many, as indeed many technologists, democrats, and healthcare pioneers have been Marxists, though of course much less people espouse the label today. Do you imagine that all the inventors in world history were all hayekians or schumpeterians? I would like to turn it around and make it personal as well: nothing you have today, your ability to study, etc .. would have been possible without the social struggles and sacrifices of the working men and women for social justice and a more equitable distribution of the social product, including in terms of education, anti-child labour laws, universal suffrage, etc... Non of these things would have been achieved without the 'socialist' workers movement in the 19th and 20th century. None of these achievements were 'given', or just a pure result of automatic prosperity. So, in your own privileged position of a Canadian studying at a prestigious university in the U.S., you are paradoxically a product of Marx, and without the inspirational force of him and many others who inspired social movements, you might still be working in the mines, or a foxconn equivalent, at a minimum wage, barely able to feed your family.
Then you ask: Why in the history of experiments with communism was there no democratic communist state? You probably know the classic marxist answer, which isn't mine, which is that this realization was supposed to happen in advanced western countries, the only one with the productive capacity to go beyond the scarcity paradigm, and when the many attempts failed, through violent suppression as you probably know, then successfull power grabs could only happen in countries without that capacity, and hence quickly degenerated into new class systems to allocate the scarce resources.
My own answer is different. First, I'm not sure that classlessness is possible without a very long cultural and psychological maturation, and with only 2% of the people at a peer to peer level of intersubjectivity (susan cook greuter's statistics), you can imagine what a long trip that would be. Like the going beyond the ego of eastern enlightenment, I'm not waiting for it. Second, I think that Marxists got the change scenario wrong, as i have argued in a few texts such as "To the Finland Station". Phase transitions did generally NOT happen with a class taken over power from another, but from a dual transformation of both producing and managerial classes around a new productive paradigm. It is only after a long maturation, through the stages of first emergence, then parity, that phase transitions occcur as a change in the state form and in the dominant form of political power. In this sense, socialism turned out to be to things, in the West, a means of redistributing the social product to the working people who create value in the first place (the social-democratic version), and in eastern europe and china, a different version of capital accumulation, based on the exploitation of the workers by a managerial class that was in control of the state, essentially a variety of capital-ism, with salaried workers on the one hand, and a collective ownership of the state by a managerial class on the other (the nomenclatura, or whatever you want to call it).
My analysis of the failure of socialism then, is that it did not fullfill the condition that Marx himself had put forward, i.e. that the old mode had exhausted its possibilities, and that a new productive mode makes it appearance. Obviously, though the state-capitalist or state-socialist mode did have some successes, such as higher growth than its capitalist competitors for a number of years, it could not deal with technological complexity in the way capitalist democracies could (and we will see how non-democratic capitalism like China will do on this score in the next 20 years), and it was thus NOT more productive than capitalism, and thus unable to overtake it.
But as I argue in my own work, peer production is hyperproductive in this sense, and this is why there is a re-orientation of capitalism towards peer-production modalities today.
In my take today, this means an increasing turn of working people towards peer production, and a turn of a section of capital towards netarchical capitalism, through the joint modality of the commons.
So the phase transition towards peer to peer is not predicated upon the creation of classnessness, but on the becoming core of the commons as a social relation of commoning, while the remaining scarce good dynamics can still be allocated through the market and other modalities. So the difference is that as the present system is based on competition, and within the competing entities on cooperation (through the hierarchical wage relationship but also moderated through more and more horizontal networking), then in the future I envision, based on the already evident practice of existing commons, the core becomes cooperation through the commons, while competition exists between the different commons. And we move from a system which cannot recognize externalities in its practice (market transactions are by definitions outside this purview), to a system where externalities are build in.
Let me stress that this had nothing to do with collectivism ... peer to peer is neither a return to premodern wholism, nor coercive cooperation in the stalinist version, but it is based on the free aggregation of individuals around the common creation of value through shared commons of knowledge, code, and design.
Otherwise, you need to explain to me why forced cooperation through wage dependency is individualism, but free cooperation is collectivism?
I didn't realize 'communism' was about all that: Energy, the environment, economic freedom, innovation, the end of selfishness... Wow. I had thought it was merely a translation of Rousseau's urbane notions of tribalism into the field of economics (combined with a generous "borrowing" off Hegel of course). But lo-- communism is many many things it turns out. More than simply a critique of capitalism, or the forced manufacture of equality, it appears to be the swiss army knife of economic revolution. Tell me Michel, what technology, democratic practice, or medical innovation has a Marxist ever invented? Why in the history of experiments with communism was there no democratic communist state? Call P2P commonism if you like but the continued harping on a dead eurocentric philosopher who couldn't even feed his family is ridiculous. Collectivism is your hope not mine, so I'd prefer not to soil the promise of networked production with the adolescent silliness of class war and a "proletarian revolution". most of the speakers specificially disavow such romantic yearning for a perfect future, and speak of the actual movement to create non-commodiized social relations, here and now ... this is something that I presume most people sympathetic to peer to peer are doing ... while the success of this is historically mitigated, the refusal to see humans as only commodified social relations and the continued practice of commoning, is really what sustains civilisations, which would collapse without it ..
romanticism, or 'positive hope' or 'false utopian expectations', are not characteristic of one particular side, since 1989 they were most prominently characteristic of the so-called free-market right, which so spectacularly failed in 2008,
at this stage, the left has a much firmer grasp of 'negativity', i.e. social and environmental externalities, costs and dangers, than anyone in the grasp of elite politics, free market absollutism, enterpreneurial romanticism, or transhumanist technological determinism, all dreaming for magical solutions that will wipe way all the real problems humanity is facing at this stage
what is the left really about, in its core, is expanding the field of opportunity to all, and the democratized choice of any policy which affects any individual, while the right hope that the free rein to the elite, restricting decision-making to moneyed interests, and letting the top 1%  grab the lion's share of the social product, will magically and romantically 'trickle down' ..
hoping that one day you will read evidence-based literature such as
- the spirit level,  and what they show is that while neoliberalism has dramatically restricted post 1973 growth levels, most of the countries with high growth rates, such as Brazil, adopted more equitable social policies ...
I think a possible exception to this might be China, though your colleague Jan Niederveen Peterse calls it a 'social capitalism' as well, but is is the one BRIC country where social equality decreased ... but frankly would you want to live in a FOXCONN compound ..?
I will maintain the romantic fiction that communism remains to be fully actualized somewhere somehow in spite of half a century of failed attempts across the planet if you'd like Michel ;)
(I just prefer science fiction to romantic fiction myself. Never been a fan of Rousseau...)
hi daniel,
let's not have this discussion stalinist totalitarianism = communism, you should know better ... I'm assuming that your studies did include a minimum of political theory ?
your example is about just the opposite of what callinicos, himself a trotskyist, would mean under communism ..
It strikes me as funny that Callinicos seeks the museum of Capitalism in a Communist era when it would seem to work the other way: Take a trip to Burma or Cuba or North Korea and you find the living museums of communism in the era of global capitalism...
'So often the vocabulary of the previous wave of emancipation is taken as
the standard for the next ? as if all subsequent waves of emancipation
should carry the banner of Voltaire and Diderot, of Marx or Che Guevara.
As if secularism should be the touchstone for all newcomers to the
gate ? emancipation frozen in time, gilded, decorated and elevated on
a pedestal, such as French laicite?'.
this video is really worth viewing and listening to, in order to have an idea of left thinking today ...
alex callinicos presents the more traditional view, but zizek really rocks here, and if his nervous mannerisms irk you, just close your eyes
both speakers confront the idea of the commons, talk about recent events in China, and much more,
didn't get myself yet to the third speaker, john holloway ..

@_subject: [p2p-research] What comes next? 
Very nicely layed out Ryan. My thoughts also.
As you say, what comes next? Thats the question. One possibility is simply no growth economies in advanced countries (Japan simply got there first). And a significant shift in power/wealth to industrializing countries (which are the bulk of the world's population anyway).
And yet there is that nagging question of P2P. Could it replace capitalism... I like Michel's optimism there... just not sure on this myself
1. I believe free market capitalism has largely proved the happiest time for humans by far.
2. I believe in governments regulating markets. 3. I believe these things require careful balances.
4. I believe that technology is all important in changing the rules.
5. Technology has made labour and learning problematic.  6. Because of 5, the credit/debt economy of the world is now broken.
7. There may be ways to fix 6, but I don't see how.
8. If there is no way to fix 6, there will be great disruption and trauma.  9. Something else will ensue.
10. P2P may be part of 9.  I think "free" economies are a logical technical outcome.  11. Understanding free economies is therefore important.
12. There is no future in the past.
13. State socialism and communism are the past.  14. It is possible that debt-based capitalism is becoming the past.
15. If 14 is true, there is an urgency to uncover some means of solving what will replace it.

I pay homage to the many social revolutions over the past centuries-- especially the recent civil rights movements in the US. Many of these movements owe something to worker protests. sure. But even more-- I would argue-- to a deep strain of Judeo-Christian ideology that successive waves of revolutionaries have borrowed heavily from. Including Marx himself. My bone of contention-- as I have already said-- is the loose way Marxists claim all social revolutions as their own. As I believe you are doing right now. You point out the many contributions of social protest and I would respond by saying, terrific. The more the better. But please spare me the Marxist babble.
communism was the dream of european and other workers to have a world in which equal relations and full democracy would be possible, and part of the broad tradition of emancipatory thinking who wants to give every human an equitable chance .... it belongs in the same tradition as the french and the american revolutions ... communism by the way was not a collectivism, i.e. a theory of subsuming the individual to the collective, but rather based on the principle, like in mahayana buddhism, that the liberty of the individual is predicated on that of his brothers and sisters, in other words, nobody can really be free by enslaving others, or in a world predicated on exploitation of others.
the reasons why class society persisted,  including in the state-capitalist or state-'socialist' countries, is a complex one, and I would welcome the debate on the issue, so why don't you start, and I'll promise to respond (not of course, that I have a full answer myself)
I'm personally not sure that this dream will ever be a reality and am not prepared to wait for it, but I think we can make substantial advances to a more equitable world order, not just because we can, but because we must, as the present infinite growth order is not compatible with our survival.
P2P is one attempt to formulate a narrative and a politics that can bring about such a change, by subsuming market dynamics (but not capitalism) to a higher purpose and deeper social logic through the generation of commons. In that, I honour the many previous attempts to achieve it, from many different sides, which for me includes that dead european philosopher, but also many others; and I recognize as primary enemies totalitarianism in all its forms, especially Stalinism in all its derivative forms.
You ask, "Tell me Michel, what technology, democratic practice, or medical innovation has a Marxist ever invented?" and of course the answer would be the same as for the masons or christians, many, as indeed many technologists, democrats, and healthcare pioneers have been Marxists, though of course much less people espouse the label today. Do you imagine that all the inventors in world history were all hayekians or schumpeterians? I would like to turn it around and make it personal as well: nothing you have today, your ability to study, etc .. would have been possible without the social struggles and sacrifices of the working men and women for social justice and a more equitable distribution of the social product, including in terms of education, anti-child labour laws, universal suffrage, etc... Non of these things would have been achieved without the 'socialist' workers movement in the 19th and 20th century. None of these achievements were 'given', or just a pure result of automatic prosperity. So, in your own privileged position of a Canadian studying at a prestigious university in the U.S., you are paradoxically a product of Marx, and without the inspirational force of him and many others who inspired social movements, you might still be working in the mines, or a foxconn equivalent, at a minimum wage, barely able to feed your family.
Then you ask: Why in the history of experiments with communism was there no democratic communist state? You probably know the classic marxist answer, which isn't mine, which is that this realization was supposed to happen in advanced western countries, the only one with the productive capacity to go beyond the scarcity paradigm, and when the many attempts failed, through violent suppression as you probably know, then successfull power grabs could only happen in countries without that capacity, and hence quickly degenerated into new class systems to allocate the scarce resources.
My own answer is different. First, I'm not sure that classlessness is possible without a very long cultural and psychological maturation, and with only 2% of the people at a peer to peer level of intersubjectivity (susan cook greuter's statistics), you can imagine what a long trip that would be. Like the going beyond the ego of eastern enlightenment, I'm not waiting for it. Second, I think that Marxists got the change scenario wrong, as i have argued in a few texts such as "To the Finland Station". Phase transitions did generally NOT happen with a class taken over power from another, but from a dual transformation of both producing and managerial classes around a new productive paradigm. It is only after a long maturation, through the stages of first emergence, then parity, that phase transitions occcur as a change in the state form and in the dominant form of political power. In this sense, socialism turned out to be to things, in the West, a means of redistributing the social product to the working people who create value in the first place (the social-democratic version), and in eastern europe and china, a different version of capital accumulation, based on the exploitation of the workers by a managerial class that was in control of the state, essentially a variety of capital-ism, with salaried workers on the one hand, and a collective ownership of the state by a managerial class on the other (the nomenclatura, or whatever you want to call it).
My analysis of the failure of socialism then, is that it did not fullfill the condition that Marx himself had put forward, i.e. that the old mode had exhausted its possibilities, and that a new productive mode makes it appearance. Obviously, though the state-capitalist or state-socialist mode did have some successes, such as higher growth than its capitalist competitors for a number of years, it could not deal with technological complexity in the way capitalist democracies could (and we will see how non-democratic capitalism like China will do on this score in the next 20 years), and it was thus NOT more productive than capitalism, and thus unable to overtake it.
But as I argue in my own work, peer production is hyperproductive in this sense, and this is why there is a re-orientation of capitalism towards peer-production modalities today.
In my take today, this means an increasing turn of working people towards peer production, and a turn of a section of capital towards netarchical capitalism, through the joint modality of the commons.
So the phase transition towards peer to peer is not predicated upon the creation of classnessness, but on the becoming core of the commons as a social relation of commoning, while the remaining scarce good dynamics can still be allocated through the market and other modalities. So the difference is that as the present system is based on competition, and within the competing entities on cooperation (through the hierarchical wage relationship but also moderated through more and more horizontal networking), then in the future I envision, based on the already evident practice of existing commons, the core becomes cooperation through the commons, while competition exists between the different commons. And we move from a system which cannot recognize externalities in its practice (market transactions are by definitions outside this purview), to a system where externalities are build in.
Let me stress that this had nothing to do with collectivism ... peer to peer is neither a return to premodern wholism, nor coercive cooperation in the stalinist version, but it is based on the free aggregation of individuals around the common creation of value through shared commons of knowledge, code, and design.
Otherwise, you need to explain to me why forced cooperation through wage dependency is individualism, but free cooperation is collectivism?
I didn't realize 'communism' was about all that: Energy, the environment, economic freedom, innovation, the end of selfishness... Wow. I had thought it was merely a translation of Rousseau's urbane notions of tribalism into the field of economics (combined with a generous "borrowing" off Hegel of course). But lo-- communism is many many things it turns out. More than simply a critique of capitalism, or the forced manufacture of equality, it appears to be the swiss army knife of economic revolution. Tell me Michel, what technology, democratic practice, or medical innovation has a Marxist ever invented? Why in the history of experiments with communism was there no democratic communist state? Call P2P commonism if you like but the continued harping on a dead eurocentric philosopher who couldn't even feed his family is ridiculous. Collectivism is your hope not mine, so I'd prefer not to soil the promise of networked production with the adolescent silliness of class war and a "proletarian revolution". most of the speakers specificially disavow such romantic yearning for a perfect future, and speak of the actual movement to create non-commodiized social relations, here and now ... this is something that I presume most people sympathetic to peer to peer are doing ... while the success of this is historically mitigated, the refusal to see humans as only commodified social relations and the continued practice of commoning, is really what sustains civilisations, which would collapse without it ..
romanticism, or 'positive hope' or 'false utopian expectations', are not characteristic of one particular side, since 1989 they were most prominently characteristic of the so-called free-market right, which so spectacularly failed in 2008,
at this stage, the left has a much firmer grasp of 'negativity', i.e. social and environmental externalities, costs and dangers, than anyone in the grasp of elite politics, free market absollutism, enterpreneurial romanticism, or transhumanist technological determinism, all dreaming for magical solutions that will wipe way all the real problems humanity is facing at this stage
what is the left really about, in its core, is expanding the field of opportunity to all, and the democratized choice of any policy which affects any individual, while the right hope that the free rein to the elite, restricting decision-making to moneyed interests, and letting the top 1%  grab the lion's share of the social product, will magically and romantically 'trickle down' ..
hoping that one day you will read evidence-based literature such as
- the spirit level,  and what they show is that while neoliberalism has dramatically restricted post 1973 growth levels, most of the countries with high growth rates, such as Brazil, adopted more equitable social policies ...
I think a possible exception to this might be China, though your colleague Jan Niederveen Peterse calls it a 'social capitalism' as well, but is is the one BRIC country where social equality decreased ... but frankly would you want to live in a FOXCONN compound ..?
I will maintain the romantic fiction that communism remains to be fully actualized somewhere somehow in spite of half a century of failed attempts across the planet if you'd like Michel ;)
(I just prefer science fiction to romantic fiction myself. Never been a fan of Rousseau...)
hi daniel,
let's not have this discussion stalinist totalitarianism = communism, you should know better ... I'm assuming that your studies did include a minimum of political theory ?
your example is about just the opposite of what callinicos, himself a trotskyist, would mean under communism ..
It strikes me as funny that Callinicos seeks the museum of Capitalism in a Communist era when it would seem to work the other way: Take a trip to Burma or Cuba or North Korea and you find the living museums of communism in the era of global capitalism...
'So often the vocabulary of the previous wave of emancipation is taken as
the standard for the next ? as if all subsequent waves of emancipation
should carry the banner of Voltaire and Diderot, of Marx or Che Guevara.
As if secularism should be the touchstone for all newcomers to the
gate ? emancipation frozen in time, gilded, decorated and elevated on
a pedestal, such as French laicite?'.
this video is really worth viewing and listening to, in order to have an idea of left thinking today ...

@_subject: [p2p-research] Post-Capitalism 
Ryan, have you read JSB's 'The Power of Pull'. I haven't had a chance but it looks interesting... He was kind enough to do the foreword to my book and I find him tremendously helpful in interpreting changes to learning and education.
I'm not particularly wedded to capitalism myself. My interest is really more innovation and like you I think that networked models will go a long way towards speeding (and democratizing) innovation. Where P2P is clearly valuable is in the area of non-rival and anti-rival goods but I'm not clear on its value for rival goods. Where we may disagree agree, I think, is with regard to the rise of industrializing countries. My own view is that advanced countries have reached their peak economically. Assuming of course that the kind of capitalism that takes shape among BRIC countries is progressively reshaped for sustainability and green innovation (which looks to be China's long run goal-- see below), then we may be able to avoid the coming global melt down that Western capitalism has pioneered. In that sense, I think we have crossed a rubicon in the last decade that will reshape the global landscape.
Hi Dan:
Arguing with Marxists is very similar to arguing with anyone who believes strongly in their point of view.  Personally, I see little evidence to support Marxism any time I've made admittedly minimal efforts to understand it.  As I am inclined to work with and use things that are evidential, I have never seen any reason to seriously engage Marxism any more than I do have reason to engage others systems or beliefs that are minimally evidential.  That said, some very smart people have used Marxism as a basis of analysis particularly in sociology and history.  I don't diss it as a sort of theory of how the world works much from those academic traditions.  It isn't useful as economics or social policy so far as I can tell.  It also isn't in any way a good predictor of social evolution.  I think Marx meant well.  State implementations of his theories have been uniformly disasterous in my opinion.  Others can certainly disagree, but I think an objective viewer would find most instances of Marxism in practice to be worse than mere failures.  You ask is innovation possible in a post-capitalist world.  I suspect it is not only possible but it will accelerate.  What is killing capitalism is technology.  Technology is rapidly encroaching on the mind and the body as to how humans can control and own reasoning.  This is not a bad thing.  Personally, I'd much rather trust a system that was built and vetted by thousands of doctors and nurses than the ideas of one human.  Soon, that sort of collective, social technology will be commonplace.  Elements have already begun.  Your field, learning, is all important.  Soon there will be a greater synergy between machine learning and human learning.  This is all but inevitable unless some cataclysm freezes us where we are or in a lower state of progress.  Innovation requires a sort of willingness to trial.  Trials and experiments are typically expensive and hard.  In a post capitalist society (one where debt driven growth is not the norm) it may be less risky to try things.  This will give even further impetus to innovation in co-ops, maker faires, garage-level manufacturing, etc.  I think all that stuff is very very exciting.  Anyone who does not have a still or a CNC router or a set of test tubes in the garage right now is really missing out on what is most exciting about our times...it is the democratization of R&D...and that is the most important driver of innovation of all.  Don't get me wrong, we are still in the corporate age and will be for 20-30 more years at least.  The change is started though.  Many of the people on this list are doing it.  That's why I am here.  The associated Marxism is not helpful, but I'm unlikely to convince those of that inclination of that nor are they likely to convince me.  In general, it is better, as Michel has said, to seek out common ground.  I find Marxian influenced people, like people of any strong metaphysical view, have great difficulty finding common ground, however. Ryan, one question I have for you: Do you think there is room for continuous innovation in 'capitalist' post-industrial economies? If so innovation in what areas? Green energy? Or are we in the early phases of a post-capitalist commons-based era? What is your view (ignoring all the Marxist fog)...? Hi Ryan,
when do you place item 8, I think this would be crucial in your theory,
if you place it in 2008, then obviously, this is right, but if you place it before, it's totally against the historical record, as debt and credit is precisely the strategy that was chosen to jumpstart the economy, i.e. the social product going to labour was dramatically diminished, forcing the middle class to resort to debt-fuelled lifestyles ... It is the collapse of this strategy that led to the meltdown of 2008 and the death of the neoliberal model (but not of the power of the elite that sustained those policies, as you rightly say, they were 'saved' and remain in place)
as any enterpreneur or capitalist knows, in real production, profit only comes from monopoly, i.e. preventing as long as possible that innovations are shared, once this happens, super-profits become impossible, and start declining very rapidly; this is of course why IP is crucial,
in a world of open and social innovation therefore, and I think this is happening, profit tends to be distributed much faster, and therefore declines much faster,
as you can see in the RSA animate presentation by David Harvey, and this is confirmed by The Big Shift of Hagel/seely brown, production-based profit has dramatically declined, and only financial rent is now providing profit, or at least it was until 2008 I've been asked to explain debt problems as influenced by technology.  I'll try.
Here's my "theory".  Many others share or have versions of something similar.  I claim no originality.  I've posted several versions on this list.
1. Growth occurs when someone produces something others value.  The sum total of value is the economy.
2. In the past, it was a matter of work and labour to produce something of value...like digging a hole where a hole was wanted.
3. People learned to take money that was not in use and to use it by borrowing it and then buying value-production which was then placed on sale.
4. The process of 3 entails risk.  Risk was rewarded by profit. 5. The system of 3-4 really works quite well so long as profit is likely.
6. In a world where learning and high productive machinery requiring low skill levels is readily available (i.e. post 1990 or so) making profit is harder.  7. Item 6 is especially true if innovation is not protected by the state (e.g. through intellectual property.)
8. Because profit is harder especially in tangible goods and services (because of technology and learning distribution) credit is harder.
9. When credit became hard, the incentives to cheat increased.  People lent money badly and then cleverly sold the bad loans to others who didn't understand.
10. When 9 happened, the state had to decide whether huge firms fulfilling important institutional roles would die, or be saved.  11. Nearly all states, especially in Japan and Europe, chose to save old institutions (e.g. Royal Bank of Scotland), or in the US, AIG.
12. There is now an open question as to whether markets can still create value (e.g. the iPod) in such a way that debt is justified.  If not, capitialism in the form that creates ready growth through using unused money is screwed.
13. When money goes unused, it is difficult to create new money and growth of value.  There is no/little incentive to innovate.  This can be called "deflation."
14. Deflation is more dangerous to capitalism by far than inflation.  Deflation means shrinkage of an economy because unused money becomes more valuable by sitting than by being used.  Thus, people become even more risk averse.
15. When 14 happens for a long time (e.g. Japan) then demographic and institutional patterns start to become unsustainable.
16. When 15 happens, we do not understand the long term outcomes, but they don't seem good.

@_subject: [p2p-research] Concerning wikiworld and its use of 
You offer a coherent account as always Michel. I never dispute your reasoning. I'm just wary of the numbers that you're using. The 30% of western society that is supposedly made up of 'cultural creatives' is not connected to peer production or even particularly familiar with shareholding. In fact, I would say that these so-called 'creatives' (assuming they exist) are more closely aligned with Florida's idea of white collar innovators. In other words, they are largely an educated elite (software producers, film makers, games designers, artists, legal professionals, academics, designers, engineers, etc). Most of these professionals are in reality the front end of advanced capitalism and absorb the lion share of its wealth. Peer production has been incredibly successful in many areas linked to digitalization (FOSS, etc) and that offers real hope that it can be extended to other domains. But it remains highly speculative to say that this is what is coming. In 50 years China inc could be running the global economy through never-ending cycles of 5 year plans.
Can stigmergic innovation replace corporations and property-based capitalism? I would say yes possibly: If the innovation cycle is faster and of higher quality. In the meantime I see corporations developing platforms for collaborative innovation as the next wave of capitalism. P2P may ultimately replace this crowdsourcing/user-innovation but I would still argue that none of this will happen without a cultural project focused on transmitting skills and ideas. In other words, education... Hi Daniel,,
I do not think cognitive capitalism is an illusion, is it the stage we're in, but it does faces important structural constraints because pure IP strategies are doomed in the medium term; this is why the new breed of netarchical capitalists are doing well without it and they are bound to be a new format for cognitive capitalism;
What are your ideas about time frame, mine are 40-50 years to achieve parity (18th cy scenario); note than an increasing number of capital-sympathetic people, like Ryan on our list, also use the same time frame for the death of capitalism, though they are not clear I think about what may replace it.  Anyway, not sure 40-50 years to achieve parity, not dominance, is 'just around the corner'.
Also, nowhere in my writings will you find any description of a classless society. I personally see that, if at all possible, as lightyears away; instead what I talk about is a class reconfiguration around commons and peer producers, as the core of the value creation process, but surrounded by a pluralist economy for material production.
I agree that humanity as a whole is not mature enough for communal shareholding, but active minorities are and 'cultural creatives', up to 30% of the western population see it as an ideal, and 2% (susan cook greuter's figures) are substantially p2p enabled.
The Renaissance was produced by 2,000 people I once read, so it is  by no means necessary for the whole world to be culturally mature, to see significant shifts in the operating logic of a economy and civilization. Even capitalism in its current form, according to Paul Ray's latest figures, is only upheld by 17% of the population, yet it is the driving logic and seat of power.
So, if 2% of the population take up p2p practices to a significant degree, and connect with the 30% that strive for it to work, they can upgrade the constitution of the whole fabric of society
Well, I agree with the critique of humanism, but on the other hand, I don't see the point of anti-humanism, so rather what is needed is to extend human-love to other beings and the planet, and not to revert to human-hating,
I do. I think that the introduction of networks is reconfiguring the world entirely. Its speeding globalization and restructuring global power. I disagree however, that cognitive capitalism/cultural economy is a fetish or illusion. I think it is a new stage in capitalism that will require significant changes in education. But I would agree that the P2P vision you have is likely beyond the 'knowledge economy'. My only doubt is the time frame. I don't think its around the corner as you do. I think capitalism with adapt to the ecological crisis in front of us through innovation. The major reason I say this is simply that I don't believe humanity as a whole is anywhere near being culturally mature enough for communal shareholding. So I guess I would agree with the Marxist view of economic stages, but disagree that the final stage is communism. Unless by communism you mean stigmergic innovation (but it in that case I would jettison the baggage of the term). I am a techno-utopian, thats true. But I've never believed in the notion of 'humanism'. I find it a silly self-worshiping religion. I agree with what you say here, though knowing you, I think you are a great romantic yourself but yes, cultures and systems need to mature during a sizeable time, and political phase transitions come after, their level of violence a function of the failure of the older system to change through other means. If you look at the political revolutions at the end of feudalism, they took quite different features in different countries. I still need to read "The first european revolution" which says the final shift to a consolidated feudalism occured in a pan-european way in about 975.
Do you agree with me that a deep transvaluation is taking place now, similar to what occured at the end of the roman empire and feudalism, setting the stage for a system that will have quite different premises?
As you may know, my own notion of mutual reconfiguration of social classes is quite different from the marxist premise as well,
It may be true Michel that Ryan and I have a similar 'cultural disposition' that we're both unconscious of. I concede that. There is a great deal of Marx's thinking that I admire. But my own subjective reasoning for my distaste for Marxism overall is simply that I'm not attracted to romanticism, whether economic (Marx), cultural (Nietzsche) or political (Rousseau). There is a kind of narcissism at the base of it that honestly repels me. I share your intuition that we will likely see a post-capitalist system shift at some point. And I might even concede that Marx had some unique vision of this shift that still gives us insight today. But I disagree that any economic shift in history comes about through class war, coercion or any other "cheap" alternative to cultural evolution. In my opinion, new economic systems emerge organically as cultures mature. If Marx had been authentic to his desire for an evolutionary model of economic change, I think he would have concluded this himself. I understand ... I know Daniel quite well for having had him over a few times and staying at his place,
you and him share a very broadly similar worldview, which I would call social liberal ... and you're both northamerican
Michel, I must say I sympathize deeply with the tone Daniel is using.
Hi Tere,
this is from a little dialogue on facebook,
perhaps you want to say something about your future vision and your choice of terminology?
couldn't find the beginning of the discussion, but you'll get the drift
Daniel Araya April 28 at 11:45pm Michel. New models are always appreciated even if they borrow from 'communism'. But a direct application-- its silly. Why do you continue to deny the wealth generated by capitalism and wax poetic about an abstract communism that exists no where. Have you read Don Quixote? Michel Bauwens April 29 at 12:07am Daniel: I gather neither you nor me actually read the book, so what are we talking about. As for me, I'm only talking about the real observable, already existing thing: the peer to peer dynamics online, and the commons of the physical world, not of which are abstract. So I'm wondering what you are referring to? Daniel Araya April 29 at 12:12am I'm talking about confusing p2p with communism. One is an emergent form (growing out of the real capacities of networks--- collective intelligence). The other is a romantic vision for a secular paradise of worker coops. They may be parallel but in my mind they're not the same.
Don't be offended. Just reacting to the liberal use of the word 'communism' in that wikiworld book. Michel Bauwens April 29 at 9:48am technically, p2p as a social mode is what alan page fiske calls communcal chareholding, i.e. exchange with a totality, it is not related to workers coop, which is currently just a different market modality, unless there would not be work for money exchange in the coop. as far as I can see Tere's is asking is how do we get from p2p in the immaterial world, to a system of worker coops. If that is your usage of communism (in old marxist terms, this is what technically would rather be socialism, i.e. the intermediary stage where there is still exchange, i.e. everyone gets rewarded according to effort. Daniel Araya April 29 at 10:07am Michel, you are humorless on this subject. The point is not "my interpretation" but the common understanding of a term loaded with generations of assumptions. It is not merely an empty signifier but comes with over a century of political contestation. Tere clearly uses the term communism to highlight Marxism not despite it. So its not some 'new road' he's pointing to but a mere restating of a well-worn gospel. Build a working an example of this utopia and I'm sure people will begin to take it seriously again. Until then... Michel Bauwens April 29 at 10:32am that is why I personally not use this terminology, because indeed it is so loaded, and certainly in the U.S., can only lead to misinterpretation

@_subject: [p2p-research] P2P revolution? 
I like what you're saying Kevin. It tailors nicely with Marx's vision. But I'm skeptical of the premise that networks simply eliminate hierarchy. Even if peer production is the final form that we see emerge around distributed networks, I think corporations, states, etc will remain a large component of the sociotechnical infrastructure managing social systems. Part of the premise behind many notions of P2P is an argument for abundance over scarcity, atleast in human capacities (even if we have real scarcity in the natural world). I share this view. And I think peer production platforms can harness social innovation in profound ways. But this isn't to say that hierarchy disappears altogether. Rather the structures of human agency that are employed to perform in those hierachies will progressively disappear. The point I'm trying to make is that we will need technology to leverage and coordinate the same hierarchical functions that we now rely on leaders, mangers, specialists, etc to perform. Thinking out loud, I guess I would say that I accept Marx's vision of a classless society with the caveat that technology is the lever that makes it happen. Rather than some kind of miracle in social relations, or dialectic in consciousness.
fully manifest. In the meantime, I suspect human hierarchy will remain
apart of the human condition for some time.
