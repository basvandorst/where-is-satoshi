 best regards,
Emerging Media Practices and Environments symposium 27.-29.5.2009
The media environment is changing from the rigid channels of the past  to a social mediaspace, where audiences become also actors, editors  and distributors of content, equipped with new software powered  social media tools. With new tools and technologies, new practices  are born, which in turn inspire and demand new technological and  service developments, as well as redesign of regulations, agreements  and laws.
The Emerging Media Practices and Environments symposium will discuss  this development, focusing especially on the audiovisual media, and  aims to identify opportunities, interests, and challenges and develop  recommendations for future developments.
The panel sessions include insights from pioneers of new video  practices, technology developers, broadcasting companies, audiovisual  archives, rights agencies and other important actors in the media  environment, and are hosted by Paula Le Dieu, Tommi Laitio, Sanna  Marttila and Kari-Hans Kommonen. All participants of the symposium  are invited to take part in the discussions and in the development of  a wish list of future developments for the audiovisual media  environment and its actors. An Open Space session offers participants  the opportunity to present their own relevant work and activities to  the community.

@_subject: [p2p-research] Fwd: Herbologies/Foraging Networks 26-28th March, 
Hei Sam, Michel,
Yes I will write a report of the activities after the festival,  mostly some time in April..
To answer your question Sam,
There is community except the one 'in the making' of the programme.
As an organiser and producer, I'd like to think there will be more  people interested in Herbologies/Foraging Networks activity  afterwards :)
There is a few associated groups/projects to the programme that have  some potential to support online sharing..
One is the Public School Helsinki network that has recently started  here, which has an 'Urban Foraging' course integrated with the  Pixelache theme..
There was also last week a good beginning to this with the  'Kasvitietotalkoot' (plant info bee) project initiated by Pispala  Cultural Association, Tampere FI, hosted on the Appropedia server..
It seems the group involved (initated from Pispala in Tampere) wish  to continue to develop their materials there.
I think they made a decent choice of wiki.
Another interesting platform here for traditional knowledge here for  Finnish speakers is
But I understand that appropedia is merging with ekopedia.org in the  so this may offer some sustainability for the platform.
My best regards,

[PLEASE CIRCULATE WIDELY]
"The New Cooperativism"
Affinities: A Journal of Radical Theory, Culture, and Action
Volume 4, Issue 1, 2010
 Journal Publication Announcement
Cooperative practices and values that challenge the status quo while,  at the same time, creating alternative modes of economic, cultural,  social, and political life have emerged with dynamism in recent  years. The 15 articles in this issue--written by activists, coop  practitioners, theorists, historians, and researchers--begin to make  visible some of the myriad modes of cooperation existing today around  the world that both directly respond to new enclosures and crises and  show pathways beyond them. Prefiguring other possibilities for  organizing life and provisioning for our needs and desires, we call  these cooperative experiments the new cooperativism.
