Hi I subscribed to the 'digest' version of this list but am still getting lots
of messages every day - see the one below which has only one message in it -
hardly my definition of a 'digest'?? Is there a way to fix this?

@_subject: [p2p-research] comments on german wikipedia conflict? 
Hi Michel Thanks for the ref, and sorry to disappoint but I dont have much to say about this - it seems to be the start of a process so see how it goes. Do you know anything about the background - cases of deletionitis? I guess the technical aspect is key, if they really have a workable different template that could compete with Mediawiki. I've been looking at Citizendium lately and its patchy - a lot of basic stuff is not there. I'm not clear about whether these guys want to duplicate parts of WP or completely redo it - a large task.

@_subject: [p2p-research] some wiki editing rules 
Hi everyone
I don't contribute much (or at all) to the wiki but I support the work so here are my two cents:
-I dont think a fork would be useful - there should ideally be a compromise between WYSIWYG and more complex tools, perhaps an opt-in as suggested?
-it does sound like the project is experiencing growing pains and that perhaps more formal governance structures need to be set up (along with a specialised list?) to discuss these technical issues...
-alternatively or in addition: perhaps a page could be set up on the wiki explaining what the proposed changes are, compared to the existing situation; this page could then be used as a place where people could debate the pros and cons of these and other proposed technical changes?

Hey Martin,
 Mathieu here, I'm the editor of a new journal project, critical studies  in peer production ( we have been fine-tuning  layout etc for a while, getting ready to launch soon. I really like the  points you make below, if you would like to convert them into a short  article we could include it into our "debate" section with possibly a  response from Michel or whoever feels strongly about the issue?
 All best,
 Mathieu

Hi all
Not sure if the following call came through the list, I find it hard to keep up with the heavy traffic, but just in case it didn't, I'm sure there are some people here who could help.
ps. More food for thought: ----- Original Message -----

Hi Michel, Martin
 I understand there needs to be content for the P2P blog... Perhaps we could strike a  balance, something like : the journal publishes a piece by Martin and a response by you  and maybe others, which can then be republished in installments on the  P2P blog. Would that work?   Glad you're up for it! We are hoping to go live in January so it would be good to be ready then. Articles in the debate section should be between 1000-3000 words. I can't focus on specific points right now (though Michel's summary below seems a good summary) as I have too many things on my plate. Maybe we can discuss more in detail in a week or so, if that is OK.

@_subject: [p2p-research] GAIA - Global Alliance for Immediate Alteration 
Looks like these folks could use some input from / are on the same track as _some_ segments of the P2P community? GAIA - Global Alliance for Immediate Alteration
 New Transnational Social Network Union to Crack Capitalism and Protect  Life, Peace and Justice on Earth
  This space is an experiment for constructing a new type of   transnational social network union that aims at bringing individual   industrial and non-industrial workers in the Global North, the   precariat in the Global South; peasants, domestic, immigrant and   jobless workers together with social movement activists from other   struggle fields, activist/researchers and many others who has to work   in order to reproduce his/her life and to provide an open space where   we can connect our networks and struggles to each other.
 GAIA project is an open invitation for inventing a world wide, common,   grassroots, wiki social movement union that will aim an immediate   alteration of capitalist social, cultural, and political order.
 Hundreds of millions not if billions of workers in the world are out   of reach for the established trade union mechanisms and structures,   they do not have any protection at all. Peter Waterman calls them   'Labour's others', for some others they are the new working class; the   precariat composed of people who holds no property and even secure job.
 What kind of trade union structure will be able to go beyond the on   going problems, and the crisis of unionism that had been born out of   those well known problems, and will become the change maker of our time.
 Can open space online social networking ensemble a model for such   future union organisation through the internet?
 There are already many good examples of action and organising taking   place via the net and incredible results are getting reached, as it   happened in 2007 when financial support has been mobilized from the   wealthier segments of the Western working classes for the Ford   worker's first ever strike organised in Russia since the beginning of   the 20th Century.
 For already some times online social networking is gaining ground as   an important and dynamic form of communication and collective action   tool. Many activists are involved today in one or another social   networks on the net, as well as on the real world. Time has came to   transform this tool into a new generation social movement union.
 Therefore we need comprehensive discussion on how can this happen,   would it work, how would we build and gain legal ground for such a   union, is it possible, or necessary? How would such union look like,   be governed and function against the offensive coming from the   employer and the state?
 'Social Network Unionism' working group has recently been created with   the aim of promoting such discussion and providing space for   comprehensive work in order to experiment with Social Network Union   idea by utilizing the opportunity created by UnionBook.
 With the creation of GAIA space within Open WSF, I would like to   invite all who involved one way or other in labour and trade union   movements, environmental justice activists, women rights activists,   immigrants' rights activists, water justice activists, information   activists, activist students and others from other struggle fileds to   join and contribute to build GAIA space together as network of   networks that can stop capitalism and save the peoples and the mother   earth.
 Please join GAIA, invent discussion groups on below or any other   relevant topics and lead the experiement to save our common future:

 Demands of GAIA:
