"In the case of this new mathematical proof, the author Vinay Deolalikar,
apparently took the standard approach that one does in maths, sent a
pre-print to a number of experts in the field for comments and criticisms.
The paper is not in the ArXiv and was in fact made public by one of the
email correspondents. The rumours then spread like wildfire, with widespread
media reporting, and widespread online commentary.
Some of that commentary was expert and well informed. Firstly a series of
posts appeared stating that the proof is
That is, that it was worth deeper consideration and the time of experts to
look for holes. There appears a widespread skepticism that the proof will be
correct, including a $200,000 bet from Scot
but also a widespread view that it nonetheless is useful, that it will
progress the field in a helpful way even if it is wrong.
After this first round, there have been summaries of the proof, and now the
identification of potential issues is occurring (see RJLipton
for a great
As far as I can tell these issues are potentially extremely subtle and will
require the attention of the best domain experts to resolve. In a couple of
cases these experts have already potentially ?patched? the problem, adding
their own expertise to contribute to the proof. And in the last couple of
hours as Michael Nielsen  pointed out to

the beginning
of a more organized collaboration to check through the
This is collaborative, and positive peer review, and it is happening at web
scale. I suspect that there are relatively few experts in the area who
aren?t spending some of their time on this problem this week. In the market
for expert attention this proof is buying big, as it should be. An important
problem is getting a good going over and being tested, possibly to
destruction, in a much more efficient manner than could possibly be done by
traditional peer review."

@_subject: [p2p-research] some wiki editing rules 
Hi, I am Maria and I like WYSIWYG.
It sounds only slightly better than, "and I am an alcoholic" - but there it
is. I am confident in my abilities to read code, to program and even to do a
little computer science if needed. But I want to confess my love of tools
like Wikispaces, Google Docs, Etherpad clones and Jing, because they support
two things I do daily, in bulk:
- Copying and pasting of content without reading code
- Inviting noobs to do one-time contributions
I have been using Elluminate, provided free through LearnCentral, to host
one-hour conversations about math communities:
For someone who has not done a webinar before, it typically takes about half
an hour to configure the sound system and to try out the five relevant
moderator tools. As we do this training, we discuss the event, so I feel it
is fair to ask for that time, in a live on-topic conversation. But with
shorter contributions that don't focus the community limelight on the
contributor quite as much as a hosted event, the ratio of training/creation
has to be significantly smaller than 1/2. Actually, I only feel comfortable
with one-liner training: "The edit button is at the top right" or
"Double-click anywhere to add your comment."
I looked at the WYSIWYG versions of the pages linked in this thread, and at
the first glance, they seemed "editable enough" with code pieces marked as
The personal conflict expressed in this thread, and implications for the
communities I am trying to build, makes me long for the structure of the
World of Warcraft guild to which I belong: a benevolent dictatorship. It
looks like p2p is going for a meritocracy, though, and currently two
different dimensions of merit, content and technological, are clashing in a
rather scary manner.

@_subject: [p2p-research] On Alex Rollin stated intentions to expel me 
I have read the exchange. It's non-consensual:
- Both parties strongly disapprove of the way they are being talked to
- Both parties realize the other person does not consent to being talked to
in this way
- Both parties continue, in full view of this realization
When this happens, discussing the content is futile, and meta-discussion at
any level of "meta" tends to be futile as well (yet here I am doing it).
I am for "nuking from space" when something like that happens in a community
- full moratorium on all dispute-related activities whatsoever, done by
pulling the necessary plugs. When time passes, activities can experimentally
resume one by one, and stopped if any non-con among participants should
arise. Often, this simply leads to new communities being born as members
want to continue what they've been doing, elsewhere. This describes my
dictatorial preferences in management, and assumes there is someone "in
space" with a sufficient plug-pulling power to make that happen. Looks like
this would be James.

I am proposing the activities related to the conflict should be frozen for a
while, together with their discussion. Someone techy should make a list of
actions (like DynamicPageList) and freeze all that for a few weeks, or ask
people to stop doing actions from the list.
Actions that cannot happen consensually should not happen.
I realize this stop, in itself, is non-consensual.

"Does it remind us of anything?" When the ancient Greeks were switching to
writing (from their oral tradition), many philosophers observed it
undermined the memory of their students, and cried for more stringent
measures to save the young minds.
Activities that assume filtering, cutting and pasting are different from
those that do not. Assignments that require low-level skills are made

 How about
changing the assignments?

education at its best teaches people to think critically and originally."
*Really? Let's preserve OUR methods of thinking and tell THEM not to use

generations, especially when a big culture shift is happening.
Educators should ask themselves, diligently: "How can we help this
generation of students improve in their methods of work?" Only in the
context of this question the next one, "And how can we help them adopt those

@_subject: [p2p-research] Fwd: Ecocities Emerging - July 2010 Issue 
I would like to question the claim (or assumption) from the introduction
that the people the author calls "haves" are "currently comfortable." It
really depends on what each smaller demographic slice does, and how it
lives. Some "have" populations are very neurotic, for example. Four million
psychiatric drug prescriptions a year to US children don't spell "comfort"
to me. Family statistics - note that good family life is a major correlate
of happiness - aren't encouraging, either. In a survey I read recently, 60%
of UK employees said their jobs are socially useful, and this got to reflect
on their personal comfort levels!
I see this assumption that comfort=big price tag as dangerous, for reasons
explained in the same intro. It makes sense to find and then distribute
practical knowledge on how ecologically and socially sound practices can
make us MORE comfortable and happy, on the personal level.

Quote: "LLENTOWN, Pa.?No money? No problem! Pay with time, instead.
That's what Maria Villacreses did when the economy put a hitch in her
wedding plans: She used "time dollars" on everything from a wedding-day
makeover to an elaborate seven-layer cake.
In a modern twist on the ancient practice of barter, people like Villacreses
are joining time banks to help them get the things they need or want without
having to spend cash.
In a time bank, members get credit for services they provide to other
members, from cooking to housekeeping to car rides to home repair. For each
hour of work, one time dollar is deposited into a member's account, good for
services offered by other members.
Scores of time banks are being started in hard-hit communities around the
nation?and thousands of devotees are helping each other survive tough
financial times.
"Even though we were planning to do something small and simple, it takes a
lot of money, time and effort. Through time banking, I got a lot of help,"

in Allentown, where 500 members offer everything from electrical work to tai

Is this happening to school teachers and administrative stuff? It would make
sense as education becomes disintermediated - much like the job of a travel
agent, the job of someone "providing information" is now done by students
themselves, using online tools. The demand for mentors remains high, but
students increasingly seek them directly, as well.

How is politics easy to fix? I don't know Brazil well enough, but as far as
Russia, I don't see forces that could fix its politics (or its economy, or
its public health) at all, let alone easily. The average life expectancy

This, unexpectedly, articulated to me why I don't recommend most of Russian
literature to my kid. It tends to take people to other realms, darker ones
at that, and just dump them there without developing any filters - as the
authors themselves either never learned to cope constructively (Dostoyevsky)
or just followed the tradition of not providing filters to readers.

About OER Glue
[image: external image chalkboard.jpg]
OER Glue is a *uniquely open approach* to online learning that lets content
be used where it already resides rather than requiring it to be copied into
a new system. OER Glue can be used to *efficiently assemble courses* and
teach online by ?glueing together? open education resources (OERs) and
integrating with popular online services including Google Documents, Blogs,
Facebook, Twitter, and discussion and assessment tools. OER Glue?s web
browser add-on approach allows it to wrap context and navigation tools
around online content and to *integrate content and services from multiple
sources in a coherent manner*. In order to ensure that resources remain
available, OER Glue integrates with services such as internet archive. The
following scenarios describe the experience of using OER Glue:
Student Use of OER Glue  |
Teacher Use of OER Glue Key aspects of OER Glue are:
   - *Student engagement* ? OER Glue increases student engagement and
   satisfaction by supporting online instruction that utilizes timely,
   authentic content and popular Web 2.0 tools.
   - *Instructional effectiveness* ? OER Glue supports effective instruction
   by helping teachers find and develop learning activities and assessments
   that are aligned with their instructional goals.
   - *Teacher efficiency* ? OER Glue helps teachers efficiently assemble,
   deliver, and update online courses.
   - *OER* ? OER Glue helps authors easily find and adapt relevant high
   quality free online resources for their courses.
   - *Glue* ? People are frustrated with the poor user experience of
   existing systems that require you to copy your content into them, but
   enthusiastic about the new Web 2.0 tools that continue to emerge. OER Glue
   lets you use content where it already is and to easily integrate third party
   tools in a coherent manner to teach online.
