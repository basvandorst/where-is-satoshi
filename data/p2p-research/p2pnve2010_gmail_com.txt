Dear Colleagues,
Please be advised that the paper submission deadline (August 20, 2010)
of ?The 4th International
Workshop on Peer-to-Peer Networked Virtual Environments (P2P-NVE
2010)? is 4 days away.
P2P-NVE 2010 will be held in conjunction with ?The 16th International
Conference on Parallel and
Distributed Systems (ICPADS 2010),? held on December 8-10, 2010 in
Shanghai, China. You are invited
to submit your papers to P2P-NVE 2010, whose CFP is attached. All
Accepted papers will be published
by IEEE Press (indexed by EI) and will be included in IEEE Xplore
digital library.

Environments (P2P-NVE 2010)
in conjunction with
The 16th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems
(ICPADS 2010)
December 8 -10, 2010
Shanghai, China
PURPOSE AND SCOPE
A networked virtual environment (NVE), also known as a distributed
environment (DVE) or collaborative virtual environment (CVE), is a
computer-generated virtual world where multiple users can assume
representatives (or avatars) to concurrently interact with each other
networked links. Examples of NVEs include early DARPA SIMNET and DIS
as well as currently booming Massively Multiplayer Online Games
Some recent studies propose using P2P architectures to increase NVE
scalability and to reduce NVE management and deployment costs. Typical
examples of such studies are P2P voice chatting, P2P 3D streaming, P2P
state management, and so on. In spite of the success of the studies,
we need
more studies about state consistency control, persistent data storage,
multimedia data dissemination, cheat-prevention, topology mismatching,
virtual world interoperability to construct NVEs of better

Virtual Environments were held in conjunction with the 13th, 14th and
International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems in 2007,
and 2009, respectively. To adhere to the theme of P2P-NVE workshops,
theme of P2P-NVE 2010 is to solicit original and previously
unpublished new
ideas on general P2P schemes as well as on the design and realization
of P2P
NVEs. The workshop aims to facilitate discussions and idea exchanges
by both
academics and practitioners. Authors are invited to submit an
version of original, unpublished manuscripts, not to exceed 8
double-columned, single-spaced pages, to the workshop. Submitted
should be in accordance with IEEE Computer Society guidelines, and
will be
refereed by reviewers in terms of relevance, originality,
correctness, and presentation.
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
-   P2P systems and infrastructures
-   Applications of P2P systems
-   Performance evaluation of P2P systems
-   Trust and security issues in P2P systems
-   Network support for P2P systems
-   Fault tolerance in P2P systems
-   Data structures for P2P systems
-   Efficient P2P resource lookup and sharing
-   Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) and related issues
-   Solutions to topology mismatching for P2P overlays
-   P2P overlays for NVEs
-   P2P NVE multicast
-   P2P NVE interoperability
-   P2P NVE content distribution
-   P2P NVE 3D streaming
