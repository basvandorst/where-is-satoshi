I'd love to write on this but things are at their busiest at the moment. I
am sharing with my team with hopes that we can collaborate on a post in the
next few weeks.
My initial thinking would be on the importance of making sure the
conversational tools and overall engagement strategy are just as
well-designed as the 3-D architectural tool. Otherwise, it will not have the
impact it was designed to have.
But thank you very much for sharing. Truly an amazing development that I did
not hear about through other channels, though I had heard ideas for this
sort of tool discussed often.
