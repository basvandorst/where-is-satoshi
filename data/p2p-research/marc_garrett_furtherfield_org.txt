An interview with Michel Bauwens founder of Foundation for P2P Alternatives.
Lawrence Bird interviews Michel Bauwens, one of the foremost thinkers on the peer-to-peer phenomenon. Belgian-born and currently resident in Chiang-Mai, Thailand, he is founder of the Foundation for P2P (Peer-to-Peer) Alternatives, and works in collaboration with a global group of researchers in the exploration of peer production, governance, and property. Lawrence Bird is a designer, instructor and writer with an interest in cities and their image. He has been trained in social science-based urban design (MSc), and in the phenomenology of cinematic architecture (PhD). He's currently working on the postdoctoral project Beyond the Desert of the Real, based in Winnipeg, Canada. He also makes films, and is currently developing a hybrid film and animation project WPG_POV. Other Info:

Hi Michel,
It was pleasure,
It was good timing that Lawrence came long and joined our ranks when he did. This interview will feed into our networked communities, expanding its context(s), as well as building on top of its already progressive exploration around art, technology and social change :-)
Wishing you well.
