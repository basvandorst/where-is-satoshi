Hi Y'all ...
My Current Knols on Logic and Semiotics ---
These are works-in-progress, of course, but
some of them are more ingressive than others.
Early days, and there are the usual species of bugs in the system,
but I am quite impressed with the potential of the environment as
it appears so far.

Many in academia hate wikipedia, because it is not ?authoritative. Is this new project just a way to ?validate and legitimate truth? through the old traditional educational systems?
I don?t care if it is sponsored by one of the Wikipedia founders, that type of authority doesn?t give it legitimacy to me either.

I?m no fan of aspects of wikipedia, but not because of authority or lack thereof. They are really a basic filter of no ads and a guaranteed relevant overview or introduction to information, from which I can get a general enough idea about something to dig further somewhere else. If I find out they?re off, so be it. Most reasonable people use it in this same way.
My biggest problem with wikipedia is that it does not control for people dominating it through spending a lot of time on it, or far worse, tagging, obfuscating, and DELETING content. Rule  Do not delete content, you gain nothing and lose a lot by cutting off the long tail.
The problem with wikipedia in academia isn?t wikipedia at all, because I think they were, and are, just another social organism that?s provided valuable lessons about p2p. The problem is that academia is still largely technophobic?or if that is too strong, technoresistant?and clueless about p2p and information, i.e. I go to google scholar and can?t read minimum 75% of the research. Academics are no longer just at universities, and locking up authority makes no sense. PLoS has gotten a clue, but how long will it take for all the other publications?
If most academic authority remains locked up, it is necessary to create academic authority outside those walls. Wikipedia?s perceived dominance as any sort of ?deep? research authority is a reflection of academia?s failing, and we would all be well served by opening up those silos of information.

As a lifelong critic of almost everything ?establishment?, I was more than a little bemused to find that it was actually possible to do things worse, but Wikipedia and Citizendium showed me that it was.
Whether Eduzendium can escape the Randroid fardels of Sanger and Wales remains to be seen, so I will leave that case open for now.

I have worked as a librarian in a university for the past eight years. I am aware of the joke about the dog saying that on the internet no one knows that he is a dog. However, I am sick and tired of faculty, and the Director of the Library where I work telling students about the uselessness of information gleaned from Wikipedia or straight off of Google.
Instead they are directed to State sanctioned databases where they collect rather generic stale articles on various topics. Instead we should be teaching them critical thinking skills to evalutate information with.
The ?traditional processes of validating and legitimating truth  are suddenly challenged ? (Paul Hartzog). Peer to peer methods are diffusing the academic sphere so that there is no longer a distinct line between the amatuer and the academic.
Most academics are too locked into the same old traditional ideas that they feed their students.

Hi Jon,
Despite my own critique of Wikipedia, I take a slightly different view on the Wikipedia as an overall project. I basically believe that peer production and peer governance, are a more dynamic mode of production and governance, despite the flaws and dysfunctionalities that we may discover in it. To take a historical analogy: feudalism had qualities and weaknesses but undoubtedly, capitalism was more dynamic and efficient. This means that however flawed Wikipedia might be, it is still this kind of processes which will largely replace earlier modes in knowledge production, such as private exclusionary encyclopedic production a la Brittanica. So, the locus is on either reforming, or offering alternatives to Wikipedia, within the format of peer production of knowledge, the key being the successfull marriage of wider participatio, with processes for the selection of quality and excellence. I do believe that the basic process of opening up knowledge production to non-credentialed experts is a sound one, and if it can work for free software, it can work for more soft knowledge production as well.
What is not clear to me yet is the nature of your critique of Citizendium and Eduzendium, quite different animals from Wikipedia. What do you see as ?wrong? with those?
Is your alternative a return to classic expert-written, paid, private IP proprietary, knowledge production ventures?

Hey Jon - why are you joining Wikipedia with Citizendium? My understanding is that Citizendium was an attempt to cure the failures of Wikipedia - even if it was not that successful - then applying all Wikipedia critisism to Citizendium without any supportive argumentation is rather unfair.

All of the the Library/Information Science folks that I know have been teaching what they call ?Information Literacy? ? basically just critical thinking applied to emerging media ? for many years now.
The problem with Wikipedia is not so much with the content ? it?s mediocre to misleading, but it could be fixed in time if it were not for the warped practices that appear doomed to prevail there ? it is the conduct that malleable minds ?learn by doing? from the doings there.
My serious concern, based on two years of experience watching it happen, is that the best lessons of Information Literacy are being undermined by over-exposure to the warp of the Wikipedia culture.
I have collected previous comments on this theme at this page of The Wikipedia Review:

I don?t know what to say. If you believe that Wikipedia exemplifies the ideals of a peer community then I fear to wake you from your dogmatic slumbers ? I have seen how grumpy people get on being roused from such a dream as that! Wikipedia has its elite. That elite did not ?emerge? from the grass roots of some self-organizing e-lysian field ? that elite has been carefully elected and empowered by the ownership of Wikipedia. Wikipedia maintains an Iron Cage like none I?ve ever seen before. Maintain your ideals, but learn to recognize those who would use your ideals against you.
10. Michel Bauwens Says:

I am NOT saying that the Wikipedia ?exemplifies the ideals of a peer community?, I?m saying that it IS an expression of actually existing peer production and governance, and exemplifies the possible dysfunctions of it. Think about it: who is getting paid to produce the wikipedia, who orders the volunteers to write the articles, etc
?? It is neither a market, nor a corporate command structure, but a dysfunctional peer production process, that is nevertheless, despite all its weaknesses, overtaking Brittanica.
This means that reforming Wikipedia to make it into a corporation of paid workers, or a market of freelancers, is not an option, but that it is within that very dynamic of voluntary contributions and universal availability that solutions need to be found, i.e. from dysfunctional to more functional and democratic methods that are more productive in terms of selecting for excellence etc
 or failing that, creating alternative projects that do.
Peer production and governance is an actual practice, that carries with it certain potential and ideals, which may or may not be fully realized, and subject to its own problems and dysfunctions, which cannot be understood in terms of previous mode of productions and governance.
That is the point that I?m making.

Let?s back up a little then.
I have been assuming that the word peer connoted equal. For instance, the word umpire derives by incorrect division from the Middle French nomper for not equal. So I would not call something a peer system unless all of the people in the system had equal status, that is, no umpires. Wikipedia is so remote from being anything like a peer system that it really makes no sense to apply the concept in any positive way.
I view the economics of motivation and reward in somewhat broader terms than the purely monetary, and I have gotten some sense of what rewards, or prospects of reward, motivate various classes of workers in Wikipedia.
But the fact remains that Wikipedia is exactly like some of the most regressive systems that we have seen in the past ? where the majority of the monetary rewards are going to classes of people who OWN the means of production and distribution, and who spend their time figuring out how to increase their control and their exploitation of that production, as opposed to producing anything themselves.

that?s the problem between definitions and real life.
Peer production has three aspects:
1) voluntary contributions;
2) participatory processes;
3) commons oriented output.
Clearly, the Wikipedia has one and three, but the participatory process has gone astray.
A different issue, but of course related, is the relations between the commons and the businesses that live from it. What you have here is I think a similar issue to why democracy invented the separation of powers. What you decry is that the group of people that you say are profiting from it, are perhaps also responsible for the degeneration of the participatory process.
This is entirely possible, but I think that it can also degenerate on its own (tyranny of structurelessness), or it is the degeneration that subsequently creastes possibilities of privileged capture.
What I?d like to know is details about how you see that mechanism of exploitation, and how it impacts the process. Are you sure that the deletionists have the same agenda, and are beholden, to the individual business interests of some in the wikimedia foundation?
My provisional sense is that this is not necessarily related.
At the start you said ?back up a little?.
So let?s do that. Take the difference between stalinism and fascism. Both are despicable totalitarian systems, but they proceeded from entirely different premises. The first was a degeneration of an egalitarian ethos, the second an actual carrying of an inegalitarian ideal. No matter how rotten the first was, it was originally an attempt for an egalitarian society.
The Wikipedia is similary an instantiation of an egalitarian ideal, that has gone astray. However, we have to keep a sense of perspective on these things, it is still a matter of voluntary contribution, and still a matter of universal availability.
The exploitation part seems very relative to me: how much money are Wales et al. actually making of Wikipedia? Unless you know things that I don?t, I don?t see much evidence of it But I?ll keep an open mind for your answer.

Hey Jon ? why are you joining Wikipedia with Citizendium? My understanding is that Citizendium was an attempt to cure the failures of Wikipedia ? even if it was not that successful ? then applying all Wikipedia critisism to Citizendium without any supportive argumentation is rather unfair.
I participated in a couple of the projects that Larry Sanger carried on in the interval between Wikipedia and Citizendium and I participated in the early phases of the Citizendium startup itself.
Based on that experience I would have to express the following evaluations:
Sanger rightly saw the need to fix one of the big problems with Wikipedia, namely, the lack of accountability and responsibility that is engendered by the use of pseudonyms, but he failed to learn almost every other lesson of Wikipedia?s failings, and he is characteristically impervious to any significant criticism of the underlying Wikipedia model, the lion?s share of which he himself crafted.
His feeling appears to be that it was only the implementation of his basic policies that went off track, not the foundation itself that was flawed.
This has resulted in an even more rigid adherence to the fundamental Wikipediot Dogma than we find at Wikipedia itself.
I do not expect anything new to come of that.

I haven't been questioning the validity the peer ideal,
so far as I understand your understanding of it, but I
do begin to be surprised that you think Wikipedia has
much if anything to do with it.
If I seek to explain the divergence of perceptions here,
my first hypothesis would probably be that we have different
levels of experience with the actual workings of Wikipedia itself.
I see in all of us a strong desire to believe in certain types
of social organization, in particular, a learning community that
is dedicated to distributing the sum of human knowledge as widely
as possible.
There was a time when I imagined that Wikipedia might have been founded
for just that purpose, a time when I imagined that the rules of its order
might have been reasonably well-suited to achieving that end.
Increasing familiarity with the realities of Wikipedia
has taught me that neither imagining has substance.
In our discussions at The Wikipedia Review, I have often
referred to the distinction that Argyris and Sch?n made
between ''espoused values'' and ''enacted values''.
I am sure that everyone recognizes the distinction
under one name or another.
But it's critical to note that not every organization that espouses
certain ideals is really determined to enact those ideals, whether
this discrepancy occurs through deliberate deception, "bad faith"
self-deception, or merely through incompetence.
Whatever the case, it is not really necessary for us to figure out
whether a leader is a fool or a liar on order for us to decide that
we do not want to follow that leader any further.

It may take me several passes to work through your text below.
Let me begin with your definition of peer production,
even though I remain a little troubled by a nagging
sense that some essential element of equality is
missing from the mix.
You have stated your opinion that Wikipedia exemplifies
or exhibits the characters of 1 and 3, lacking only 2.
There are several questions that I would have to ask at the outset:
A. Is peer production like "fire production", where missing any side
   of the "fire triangle" -- fuel, heat, oxygen -- breaks the chain
   of necessary causes?  Or does one get partial credit for 2/3?
B. What is the output?  What is the product of ultimate interest?
   Is it the content of documents and files, the content of minds,
   or is it the conditional general resolution of people to act in
   certain ways, in short, beliefs?
C. What does it say about the level of voluntary contribution
   when there is a very high level of involuntary exclusion?
Sufficient unto the day ...

    that potentially expresses an 'espoused ideal', and to
    different degrees, it will have discrepancies with

When we speak of "governance" in the system-theoretic sense of "regulation",
then we become very interested in the "differential dynamics" engendered by
these differences.  Indeed, you can usually tell a person who wants to fix
the problem and who knows at least how to begin fixing the problem from
a person who wants nothing more than to deny the problem and hide the
very existence of the problem from others by that person's attitude
toward these discrepancies.
But I already know the tribal attitude of Wikipediots toward solving any problem.
It is summarized in the Chapter & Verse of WP:BEANS, which amounts to the advice:
"Ignore it and maybe it will go away."
Have to break here ... will continue from this point next time ...
Jon Awbrey
MB: The other thing though, is how to establish a kind of cutting off point,
    when it really becomes something else.
MB: Take Russia, at what point did it become something altogether different
    than the originally espoused ideals of socialism?  How real where the
    original soviets? how significant was it that competing interpretations
    where suppressed from the very start; and what did it really become when
    stalinism was fully consolidated as a new system: was it state socialism,
    state capitalism ?? extremely difficult questions
MB: and here we are at the very beginning of peer production,
    witnessing a degradation ... at what point does it really
    turn into something altogether different??
MB: So my question to you is:
MB: what then, has it become?
MB: If not peer production and governance, you would then have
    to explain to me how to 'explain away the input and output
    feature, as being also part of another system? and then
    explain that other system, which in my eyes, is not
    a market, nor a command and control system ...
MB: So my problem is:
MB: 1) to see it as a degeneration of peer production and governance, but
    still exemplying this new mode of production;  and we can then discuss
    the various degrees of degeneration and perhaps indicate cut-off points
    (by analogy, when did the perhaps original council system become a top down
    but different system, only retaining public property, but embedding it in a
    new extremely totalitarian and unequal hierarchy system);
MB: 2) to see it as something different than peer production, yet another mode?

I am aged enough to remember the beginnings of the open source, free software,
shareware movements.  I can recall attending my first seminars on the hot new
paradigms of "groupware" and "collaborative software" in the mid 1980's and I
worked on several wiki development projects -- if only as a content filler or
a "playtester" -- before I ever heard of Wikipedia.  So I always view each of
these projects that we have been talking about as yet another experiment in a
very wide field of possible experiments.  The critical thing is to learn what
can be learned from each experiment before moving on to the next, and to stop
the experiments that go bad before they do too much harm to their subjects or
to the public at large.
I do not view Wikipedia and Citizendium on the analogy of naturally evolving
political systems like those that you mention -- no doubt politics is always
a bit "violent" in the sense of Aristotle, but I think there is a difference
between a nudge and a putsch.
I think that Wikipedia and Citizendium are more accurately viewed on the model
of "theme parks", like Disneyland(TM).  Yes, Wikipedia is like Fantasyland(TM),
complete with Gnomes and Trolls, and Citizendium is more like Frontierland(TM),
where gun-totin' Constables are deputized to keep the peace.  Theme parks like
these are the enterprises of entrepreneurs.  They are "para-sties", derivative
of legendary realms that once or never existed, in days of yore and yesteryear,
if ever.  To speak of them as "degenerating" into this or that other condition
is simply to put the cart before the horse.  There were ever thus, it was only
the willing suspension of disbelief that we maintained in their interiors that
illusioned us willing ticket-holders to view them as anything but wholly-owned
capital enterprises.

Michel, my new comments interleaved and unindented below:
MB: Hi Jon, thanks for that.  I do not use the concept

        for a definition, basically, people volunteer
    those aspects of themselves that they judge of use
    to the project, and nobody stops them from contributing.
I continue to feel that we cannot sever the concept of
a peer from its historical ligaments in such embodiments
as "a jury of one's peers", "peer review", "peer pressure",
and so on, without doing radical harm to the idea.  Of course,
there is no suggestion of "equal in all respects", which would
be absurd, but merely a requirement of being evaluated by those
whose experience is comparable enough to allow of fair, informed,
and prudent judgment.
As for the condition, "nobody stops them from contributing",
that is precisely the catch in systems like Wikipedia and
Citizendium, where excommunication has gradually become
the primary means of dispute resolution, and where the
prevailing notion of due process is to revoke people's
rights of citizenship first and then try them later.
MB: | Peer production has three aspects:
 1) voluntary contributions;
 2) participatory processes;
 3) commons oriented output.
JA: You have stated your opinion that Wikipedia exemplifies
    or exhibits the characters of 1 and 3, lacking only 2.
JA: There are several questions that I would have to ask at the outset:
JA: A. Is peer production like "fire production", where missing any side
       of the "fire triangle" -- fuel, heat, oxygen -- breaks the chain
       of necessary causes?  Or does one get partial credit for 2/3?
MB: I would tend to say, you get partial  credit;  so  in this context,
    I would say that Wikipedia is a dysfunctional model of peer governance
    (I do think it is actually still very productive in terms of producing
    useful services, and I think the millions of users would agree).
I am not so sure, but will save these points for later.
JA: B. What is the output?  What is the product of ultimate interest?
       Is it the content of documents and files, the content of minds,
       or is it the conditional general resolution of people to act in
       certain ways, in short, beliefs?
MB: in this context, a universal encyclopedia accessible everywhere
    for free, to which, theoretically, everyone can contribute
This is one of those places where I think that people
are all too often dazzled by content and message when
they should be paying at least equal attention to the
conduct inculcated in easily-impressed users -- as in
shanghaied sailors? -- and the characteristics of the
medium that is being crafted under their very noses.
These are factors that educators and media engineers
are trained to examine and critique.
JA: C. What does it say about the level of voluntary contribution
       when there is a very high level of involuntary exclusion?
MB: Yes, that is the problematic which may render various process
    dysfunctional to various degrees, and a key issue is, when do
    we hit a threshold ...
Let me just insert a note here of a distinction to take up later.
When we speak of "functional" or "dysfunctional", this is always
relative to the "end in view" -- the intended function or purpose.
Most of the time we think we know the relevant aim from context,
but when there is a gap between espoused and enacted functions
then we have to ask "dys/functional in relation to what end?".
MB: This is a very difficult issue,  free software is still pretty much
    a male, probably 'western' affair, but that is indeed involuntary,
    and various women's groups are working to change that practice
    and the culture that engenders the practice.
There are exclusions based on demographic factors, and there are
exclusions based on disciplinary, ideological, and methodological
MB: In Wikipedia I would say that the politicization of the
    collective choice process, in the hands of deletionist and
    less than capable editors, is what makes contributions an
    increasingly high threshold affair which leads to exclusion;
    in this case, choosing for deletionism was a conscious decision
    by this group; and you can probably not say that it is involuntary,
    therefore, it is a much more serious offense against the ethic of
    participation.
Yes!  The so-called "Five Pillars" of Wikipedia supposedly include the
off-the-cuff rules of thumb for deletion decisions, basically saying
"improve, don't delete".  But Wikipedia policies and guidelines are
hopelessly inconsistent -- the steamroller of NPOV and the scalpel
of NOR, that excises any sin of originality that might arise as we
attempt to synthesize diverse data from sundry perspectives, will
always render it easier and safer to lobotomize than to think.

Thanks, Henrik, it looks like it may be a while
before I can catch up with the first day's mail!
Yes, I think we clarified the sense of the "peer = equal" equation
a bit in discussions that followed the initial exchanges.  Based on
my experience, however, "benevolent dictators" have a notorious habit
of mutating very quickly into the usual sorts of Benitos, and this is
almost certain to happen in a regime of anonymous authority.  Moreover,
when we speak of "meritocracy" we must be careful to ask "merit at what?".
In Wikipedia, for example, wikiplebes earn their merit badges by exhibiting
their expertise at playing a very peculiar sort of game.  Does that sort of
"merit" have merit for the external society?  Will they one day insist that
it does?  What then?
Yes, these are of course issues for any society, or theory of society,
that must try to work out the optimal relationship between "democracy",
the dialogue among people, and "inquiry" (research and reality testing),
the dialogue that we have with Nature, who can be a very harsh dictator
whenever we fail to understand the dictation.
These questions were part of my research programme for many years before
I ever fell down the Wikipedia rabid hole -- for the sake of applications
to the wiki medium I started collecting a few notes and references on the
following threads at The Wikipedia Review:
Meta-Thread on Inquiry
Meta-Thread on Fascism
Sadly, I think that the Citizendium model, despite 1 or 2 bug fixes,
remains undermined by Sanger's insistence on trying the fundaments of
the Wikipedia model all over again, namely, the peculiar mutations of
the norms of scholarship that we find in his ideas about NPOV, NOR, VER,
IAR, and so on down the (party) line.

[Note to Greg: Do Not Read Until You Get Back From Vacation!!!]
I, on the other will be attending
to a busted water heater here in
the sunny North ... just barely
time for a very brief note ...
Here is a the short article that Greg Kohs posted
on the Wikipedia Review Op-Ed Blog about the links
between Wikia and Wikimedia:
"The Tight-Knit Web of Wikimedia and Wikia":
Also, I see that they have just started a thread on this subject at the WR Forum:
"50 Ways That Connect Wikia/Wikimedia":
So maybe these pieces will help cut through the fog a bit.
I will prevail on Greg to think about this again
when he gets back from Florida, as I do not have
the investigative skills to read financial reports
and government filing forms without falling asleep ...
Gotta run ...

I will be pre-occupied with "emergent" household maintainance issues
over the next few days, but I may have just enough time before the
plumber arrives to post a short note.
I did not succeed in convincing Larry Sanger that a strong tradition
of reflective internal criticism was the best way to avoid being buried
by external criticism in the long run, but here is a link to my last best
attempt to do that, copied from various fora of the Citizendium base camp
to the Wikipedia Review:

MB: Dear Jon:
MB: Thanks for your precious insights.
MB: If you have any time at any point, I would like to invite you
    to write some short piece about the relation between dialogue
    and inquiry, a crucial point a believe, which I would like to
    publish both in the blog and the governance section of our wiki.
MB: In addition, I would really appreciate a formal critique,
    for lay persons, about the NPOV, NOR, VER, IAR, etc. and
    what alternatives could be proposed in a hypothetical
    wikipedia fork.
MB: Thanks for considering doing this!!

I've been busy putting some standard articles at PlanetMath,
which is by the way a very nice peer production environment
for mathematical content.  Here's a sample I've done so far:
The links above give you the HTML view.
There's a toggle at the bottom of the

@_subject: [p2p-research] Fwd: "Transformative Studies Institute" sent you 
I was assuming that you forwarded me that note about some
article deletion problems -- or was it just some kind of
Facebook fluke?
At any rate, the suggestion was to put a copy of the article
at the MyWikiBiz site, which uses the same MediaWiki platform
as Wikipedia -- actually with added semantic capabilities --
where you (or whoever is its principal author) can protect
and maintain it till the Wikiphuss is passed.  Or you may
just quit caring about the WP copy eventually, as I and
many others have.
