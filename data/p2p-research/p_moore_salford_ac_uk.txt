@_subject: [p2p-research]  discussion on Capital and Class issue 
Hi Andreas et al
Hmmmmm I guess I wasn't aware that there were other publication ideas
that were going ahead, also sorry to hear that this wasn't necessarily
an agreed item, I was under the impression that it was. I have heard
from nearly all of the speakers with proposals so I am really under the
assumption that most people are ok with this. Are there any participants
who would prefer to do it another way?
At the Capital and Class AGM on Saturday, the other editors were very
sympathetic to this idea and I was given the go-ahead to proceed. Not
all papers will necessarily be included, of course: it depends on the
final proposal I assimilate and on the willingness of course, of
participants, to see Capital and Class as an agreeable forum for
Does anyone else have insight or comments to make on this? Many thanks

Hi Phoebe,
I don't think that I received your first email, so this one comes a bit
as a surprise to me. It seems like your plans of a Capital & Class
special issue are already well developed.
I remember you mentioning this possibility at the workshop, but don't
recall that there was a general agreement to have C&C as first
publication choice. Also this would somehow collide with my idea to make
a book with most of the contributions. No publisher would accept a book
proposal with contributions that are already published somewhere else. As aleady indicated in several emails preparing the workshop my first
publication choice would either be an edited book or a special issue
with a well recognised journal, and we have aleady an expression of
interest from TCS, which does have a much broader reach than C&C.
For this reason I am still keen on a discussion about core issues
emerging from the workshop (in terms of relevance) and about issues
where participants had different perspectives, standpoints, and
arguments. This debate has not really started yet and after paternity
leave I will sure make some comments on this. For me this debate is
crucial as it will define which theme(s) should be put at the forefront
of a publication.
Hope this makes sense,

Hi all
After my call for papers for the special edition emerging from our
workshop on p2p production at Nottingham Trent, I have received 5
abstracts, three papers, and 2 possible inclusion statements, many
thanks to all of you. If you haven't submitted one to me, please do so
and I'll include you. Please include a short bibliography as well.
In the special issue I want to put the question of 'ethical economy/ies'
at the forefront because I think this discussion brings up a lot of
important points as well as questions regarding measurement of value,
and exchange relations 'outside' of capitalism, and so far I have been
given both proposals that critique, and advocate p2p as an arena for
these possibilities. The proposals so far represent the discussion that
is taking place more broadly and Capital and Class will be an excellent
forum for this discussion.
The AGM for the journal is tomorrow and I've 'warned' them of my
intention to create this special issue. I'll be in touch with you after
the meeting with more details of what will be required. At this rate,
the papers will not need to be very long and I'd probably make a
deadline for next March or so (just something to bear in mind).
Many thanks

@_subject: [p2p-research] Thanks Tere and Athina 
Thanks Tere and Athina, I am so pleased with your input, comments and clarifications. I have been quite busy preparing for a consultancy gig from tomorrow morning so am up to my ears. So thanks for picking up on these things with the group. It is indeed the case that one can publish in more than one place, as long as publishers are in agreement and copyrights are managed appropriately. Yes, academic publishing doesn't follow the same principles as GPL obviously, but it is always flexible, and repeat publications have been incorporated into the RAE as well.
I spent all of last Friday putting together a description of what I intend to do,  and incorporating all abstracts I'd been given so far, and then presented this to the Editorial Board of Capital and Class on Saturday (most of whom have never heard of p2p so took some convincing, but in the end, I got it passed. Steve Fleetwood is now on the board and he is pretty excited about the project as well). As this will be a special issue, I individually will have the final word on what is included, so editorial awkwardness can hopefully be circumvented. The journal is very highly esteemed and accepts fewer articles than it rejects-also please note that it is second only to New Left Review in left wing journals on the nationally recognised citation index. So we are in a 'win win' situation.
I will send the proposal I've managed to put together early next week because now, as I said, I'm off to the Balkans in the morning and back Friday.
Hope you are all well.
All the best,

Hi again,
I agree with Tere, I dont see a onflict of interest here. As far as I am aware, one can publish in a journal and then with the journal's permission (which is always given), publish the same or similar piece in a book or an edited volume. It has happened a lot especially with work in progress. In fact, in british academic terms, the last Research Assessment Exercise, the same/similar piece of work, if published by two different venues could count twice (this was not so in the RAE before that). This is technical stuff, my point really is that some people's work might be suitable for C&C (if it goes through as its editors can be difficult), and others an edited volume somewhere, some can do both, they do not exclude each other (its allowed!) and much more so, since work progresses, and by the time a book comes up, material will be expanded and better to publish anyway. Hope you are all in a creative pre christmas mood
 Hello all,
I do remember that Andreas mentioned in an early e-mail that a journal was interested in the possible papers of the seminar. I think he might
even have said something on this in the final discussion. I didn't react
then or later 'cause I didn't perceive any conflict of interest. As I understood it, Andreas had in mind a publication of the papers of the
seminar, with possible influence from the journal, while Phoebe's idea
was more a special issue around the themes. In any case, I myself expect to keep on writing on these issues and any number of possible
publication venues is fine for me. So, the proposal I sent to Phoebe
involves a second author, a colleague of mine, and would tilt things
toward capital and class, and my seminar paper "as is" is still looking for a place to be published...

Hello everyone,
I agree with Athina and Tere: that two different venues have expressed an interest in publishing our work should be interpreted as something very positive. Neither do I see a conflict of interest here: as Athina and Tere say, we could publish in both spaces. In the present case, I have already sent Phoebe an abstract for a paper co-authored with J. Soderberg to include in her proposal to C&C. But in parallel I could prepape a text for TCS - or any other journal for that matter - based on my presentation at the workshop. What I'm saying is what Tere and Athina have already said: we could publish in both venues.
Best regards,

@_subject: [p2p-research] Keele University 
i was in keele all day with the UCU Left (which i'm a member of). there were about 500 people from all over the country there which was great.. the issue is as you'll see from the link above is that keele university plans to turn its economic and management studies, which includes courses on industrial relations (old school IR), into a business school department rather than allow it to remain within the remit of the faculty of humanities and social sciences. as is stands, this is the only IR subject group that's NOT in a management school left in the country...  keele management are also planning to lay off 35 lecturers. so their council met today to discuss this, and so we marched all round the campus with whistles and placards, and then there were a few speakers in this auditorium from different unions, as well as a lecturer in the IR dept there. it was a really good rally. i am hoping it helps because it has implications for the entire university system and the recent onslaught of managerial decisionmaking that has no place in the public sector.

howD all,
I know this list is getting a lot of lurkage,
but I am explicitly requesting a response,
because I could use the help.
I am looking for any works by any authors,
that hybridize or otherwise cross-pollenate,
any of the following authors:

Chantal Mouffe
Ernesto Laclau
Paul Virilio

and I'm looking for avenues into networks of thought,
coming from outside.
Please also recommend any authors that are NOT on this list,
but that should be.
