Just a couple of quick notes, I'll answer to last message from David
later this week as I must absolutely finish something else first.

grain of salt, of course (**) (just like the ones from TPB founders
that they aren't making any money, just paying expenses): but I

As it turns out, I had already written about this problem:
Is a short synthesis of these three links and a couple more recent
others on the same topic OK for the blog? If yes, I can surely do
it. Just tell me if you have a preferred publication date.
