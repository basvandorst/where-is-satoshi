Dear Colleagues,
Our servers have been down for last four days due to the blackout caused by
a severe typhoon called Morakot. We apologize for any inconvenience caused.
For compensation, we have decided to further extend the paper submission
deadline of the 3rd International Workshop on Peer-to-Peer Networked Virtual
Environments (P2PNVE'09) to be August 20, 2009. Please be advised that this
is the firm deadline. So, please submit your paper soon via
P2PNVE?09 will be held in conjunction with the 15th International Conference
on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS?09) on December 9 -11, 2009.
Attached is the CFP, where you can find useful information about the paper
submission. Please note that the topics of interest include not only
specific topics related to peer-to-peer networked virtual environments but
also general topics of peer-to-peer networking.
We are looking forward to receiving your paper submissions.

P2PNVE 2009
The 3rd International Workshop on Peer-to-Peer Networked Virtual
in conjunction with
The 15th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems
(ICPADS 2009)
December 9 -11, 2009
Shenzhen, China
About P2PNVE 2009
The rapid growth and popularity of networked virtual environments(NVEs) such
as Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) in recent years have spawned a
series of research interests in constructing large-scale virtual
environments. For increasing scalability and decreasing the cost of
management and deployment, more and more studies propose using peer-to-peer
(P2P) architectures to construct large-scale NVEs for games, multimedia
virtual worlds and other applications. The goal of such research is to
support an Earth-scale virtual environment or to make hosting virtual worlds
more affordable than existing client-server approaches. However, existing
solutions for consistency control, persistent data storage, multimedia data
dissemination, cheat-prevention, topology mismatching, and virtual world
interoperability are not straightforwardly adapted to such new environments.
Novel ideas and designs thus are needed to realize the potential of
P2P-based NVEs.
The 1st and the 2nd International Workshop on Peer-to-Peer Networked Virtual
Environments were in conjunction with the 13th and 14th International
Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems in 2007 and 2008,
respectively. To adhere to the theme of P2PNVE workshops, the theme of
P2PNVE 2009 is to solicit original and previously unpublished new ideas on
general P2P schemes and on the design and realization of P2P-based NVEs. The
workshop aims to facilitate discussions and idea exchanges by both academics
and practitioners.
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
-P2P systems and infrastructures
-Applications of P2P systems
-Performance evaluation of P2P systems
-Trust and security issues in P2P systems
-Network support for P2P systems
-Fault tolerance in P2P systems
-Efficient P2P resource lookup and sharing
-Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) and related issues
-Solutions to topology mismatching for P2P overlays
-P2P overlays for NVEs
-P2P NVE multicast
-P2P NVE interoperability
-P2P NVE content distribution
-P2P NVE 3D streaming
-P2P NVE voice communications
-P2P NVE architecture designs
-P2P NVE prototypes
-P2P NVE consistency control
-Persistent storage for P2P NVEs
-Security and cheat-prevention mechanisms for P2P games
-P2P control for mobile NVEs
-P2P NVE applications on mobile devices

About P2PNVE 2009
The rapid growth and popularity of networked virtual environments(NVEs) such
as Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) in recent years have spawned a
series of research interests in constructing large-scale virtual
environments. For increasing scalability and decreasing the cost of
management and deployment, more and more studies propose using peer-to-peer
(P2P) architectures to construct large-scale NVEs for games, multimedia
virtual worlds and other applications. The goal of such research is to
support an Earth-scale virtual environment or to make hosting virtual worlds
more affordable than existing client-server approaches. However, existing
solutions for consistency control, persistent data storage, multimedia data
dissemination, cheat-prevention, topology mismatching, and virtual world
interoperability are not straightforwardly adapted to such new environments.
Novel ideas and designs thus are needed to realize the potential of
P2P-based NVEs.
The 1st and the 2nd International Workshop on Peer-to-Peer Networked Virtual
Environments were in conjunction with the 13th and 14th International
Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems in 2007 and 2008,
respectively. To adhere to the theme of P2PNVE workshops, the theme of
P2PNVE 2009 is to solicit original and previously unpublished new ideas on
general P2P schemes and on the design and realization of P2P-based NVEs. The
workshop aims to facilitate discussions and idea exchanges by both academics
and practitioners.
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
-P2P systems and infrastructures
-Applications of P2P systems
-Performance evaluation of P2P systems
-Trust and security issues in P2P systems
-Network support for P2P systems
-Fault tolerance in P2P systems
-Efficient P2P resource lookup and sharing
-Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) and related issues
-Solutions to topology mismatching for P2P overlays
-P2P overlays for NVEs
-P2P NVE multicast
-P2P NVE interoperability

P2PNVE 2009
The 3rd International Workshop on Peer-to-Peer Networked Virtual
in conjunction with
The 15th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems
(ICPADS 2009)
December 9 -11, 2009
Shenzhen, China
About P2PNVE 2009
The rapid growth and popularity of networked virtual environments(NVEs) such
as Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) in recent years have spawned a
series of research interests in constructing large-scale virtual
environments. For increasing scalability and decreasing the cost of
management and deployment, more and more studies propose using peer-to-peer
(P2P) architectures to construct large-scale NVEs for games, multimedia
virtual worlds and other applications. The goal of such research is to
support an Earth-scale virtual environment or to make hosting virtual worlds
more affordable than existing client-server approaches. However, existing
solutions for consistency control, persistent data storage, multimedia data
dissemination, cheat-prevention, topology mismatching, and virtual world
interoperability are not straightforwardly adapted to such new environments.
Novel ideas and designs thus are needed to realize the potential of
P2P-based NVEs.
The 1st and the 2nd International Workshop on Peer-to-Peer Networked Virtual
Environments were in conjunction with the 13th and 14th International
Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems in 2007 and 2008,
respectively. To adhere to the theme of P2PNVE workshops, the theme of
P2PNVE 2009 is to solicit original and previously unpublished new ideas on
general P2P schemes and on the design and realization of P2P-based NVEs. The
workshop aims to facilitate discussions and idea exchanges by both academics
and practitioners.
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
-P2P systems and infrastructures
-Applications of P2P systems
-Performance evaluation of P2P systems
-Trust and security issues in P2P systems
-Network support for P2P systems
-Fault tolerance in P2P systems
-Efficient P2P resource lookup and sharing
-Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) and related issues
-Solutions to topology mismatching for P2P overlays
-P2P overlays for NVEs
-P2P NVE multicast
-P2P NVE interoperability
-P2P NVE content distribution
-P2P NVE 3D streaming
-P2P NVE voice communications
-P2P NVE architecture designs
-P2P NVE prototypes
-P2P NVE consistency control
-Persistent storage for P2P NVEs
-Security and cheat-prevention mechanisms for P2P games
-P2P control for mobile NVEs
