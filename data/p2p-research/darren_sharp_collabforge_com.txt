Please join us for this last-minute talk by - and with - Mark Elliott at the
Sunlight Foundation office in DC.
Beers and stimulating conversation are complimentary. (PLEASE RSVP!!)
Mark is up from Australia for ONE DAY ONLY to show us his work on open
government and mass collaboration. Through his company, CollabForge, he has
successfully completed several web-based public engagement projects with
government agencies in his home country of Australia. These include the
Future Melbourne project in which citizens used a wiki to plan for their
city's future.
