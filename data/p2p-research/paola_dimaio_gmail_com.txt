Thanks a lot Marc
for the interesting comments
the way natural organisms are adaptive is very intresting and we can
certainly learn a lot , but from my observations so far, social
systems have to deal with additional complexities
people are very different from ants and bacteria, cause they have
egos, emotions, personality, opinions, fears, egoes (again) and lots
of other characteristics that are unique to humans
I think the paper can be freely cited, and reasonable quotes excerpted
with due credits
the slides are also referenceable

Sorry for the impolite subject line
I am researching Open Innovation models, and have just realised that the
'open innovation center' at berkely is
anything but Open
There are at least 4 ways to get involved, they say, and they all imply
paying huge sums of money to the Center, and it also implies that they are
intersted to work for their students (I presume berkeleys) and their
No way for other 'open innovation' experts (non Berkleys) to interact with

Thanks for sharing
a few of us on this list already work in universities, and work with
I think the term 'third world' has been replaced with 'developing countries;
which is preferred term, in fact that is out of date, and we use emerging
economies instead, or some other euphemism
the next question is why would a developing country forum would be held in
switzerland? (as much as I love the country)
would it not make sense to have it in a developing country
(or does it coincide with the economic forum?)
other than that, it could be interesting, would be nice to know what kind fo

I half started a post in reply to the interesting threads but did not have
time to accomplish a good post so I discarded it
I think most answers of 'how' are already out there,  look at the leading
edge of learning and cognitive  disciplines, cooperative learning basically,
where teachers are faciliators, everyone learns and everyone teaches, etc
ideas are already out there, how to make establishments change their view of
themselves, and society to accept the changes, may be pointing to a
different problem space
It would be great if people on this list who seem well clued in could come
up with a paper or other project to contribute to the shift

Most of the things your write below are exactly what I wanted to say but did
not have time to articulate, in relation to the role of unis and lecturers
quick comments
1.hopefully they have open boundaries, meaning that we do not have to 'go'
to interact with them
2. learning pertains to life, and the fact that you are not an academic does
not mean that you dont know someting about academica, academics tend to be
ver narrow minded cause they know extremely well their domain, and are
totally ignorant of many other things
3.i do believe in self directedness, but I would continue to emphasise the
need for becoming acquainted with the body of literature. I mean, i would
expect anone who is learning a topic to familiarise themselves with
everything that there is to know about it, including the standard sillabus.
however what I see is that today professors and all tell their students what
*they* consider the version of the truth, thus leaving the student under
tthe impression that everything elese dos not matter or is false. I hope in
the future students will be able to put together what their professor says,
and compare it with what other professors say, and then become self directed
in what they consider sould be pursued further
4, I see change happen from the top, but a lot is 'wasted' due to systemic
reasons, of which I would like to discuss in more detail when possible. i
see web based technologies already in place offering the greatest potential
for change from the bottom up, and people not using them. looks to me that
the processes and procedures need to be revised

HI Pamela
thanks for your interest
It's very complicated, coming from a multidisciplinary background, and with
years of work experience in different fields, (and never made money really)
I consider myself as always learning most things , and occasionally teaching
something along the way.
When I taught software engineering, my students could teach me PHP
programmeing, for any thing that I can teach, there are ten things that I
can learn from others,
however many institutions are still set up to prevent knowledge sharing ,
with their silly and redundant organisationa, bureaucratic and social
structures, they are just  pretending  nobody asks the right questions, and
nobody answers them
 I work as a lecturer and researcher, and now doing a phd (I enrolled a
couple of months ago, back to being a student and have mixed feelings about
it)  . My field is 'systems engineering' and one reason I love that, is that
it encompasses everything. ahah, blows my mind too, yes, systems, and
systems of systems..... haha ... everything
There is a lot that I would like to share about the topics of discussion,
maybe one day we should have a multiconference and
speak on video to one another. sorry If I am not participating more actively
in discussion, topics are improtant and v interesting
I see HE should be more seen as CE (continuing Education) better still
continuing learning,  I regard learning as
a) knowledge transfer, which needs processes to be enabled and supported,
that is the role of unis in the future I think, as well as b) personal and
social experiences that expand one mind and consciouness
where do I fit? you tell me......

In which case I would agree

job that her brother did
The good thing is that one can learn everything from everything else, if the
hunger for knowledge is there
nothing will stop it, thanks to public libraries, and today, thanks to the

very important question
and somehow links to a thread I did not have the time to reply to, about a
useful site from national geographic (if I remember correctly) which to some
seemed like 'goood idea, too bad its done by a private company.
I think that what Marc suggests is that some initiatives dont necessarily
need 'investment' from a capitalistc view point, for example such a service
could be provided by a community effort with minimal return (sustainability
model), for the benefit of the community alone, and not for profit
I still believe there is a role for investment, - but the problem that I
have (and maybe others)- is that  traditionally the role of the financing
business is designed to provide much higher returns to the investor of
capital, than to those who provide other factors of production, such as
'labour', or other resources
I hope for an economic model where all the factors of productions will yield
even returns, and social capital will be valued at par with financial
capital, then the role of investment will be less speculative (providing a
resource) and the nature of businesses and the economy could be healthier,
less greedy,
more considerate and sustainable, where capital should be allocated where it
is really needed for human development and quality of life, rather than
solely for accumulating marginal bucks
which  indirectly leads to waste

DEADLINE EXTENDED TIL FEB 28 2009, PLEASE CIRCULATE!
     Web Based Human Collective Intelligence
     Chair - Paola Di Maio ? University of Strathclyde
* Web based communication is creating unprecedented opportunities for large
scale knowledge aggregation, and new challenges for technologists and social
scientists who are working to develop organisational systems and
infrastructures.  The proliferation of easily accessible and intuitive web
based social software tools and environments is enabling multitudes of
people to connect, communicate and exchange information and knowledge in
near real time, thus exploding the potential for 'collective intelligence
'to take place.  While a universally accepted model and definition of
'Collective intelligence', has not yet emerged, examples of web based
collective intelligence,  can be found in different disciplines (from
learning to economic development to governance), Although a few
authoritative initiatives have been started in this direction, such as The
Centre for Collective Intelligence at MIT, ( books and
blogs are being written, CI still remains  undefined and elusive,  it is
exposed to scepticism.
This track aims to promote a sound interdisciplinary framework for the field
of CI, harnessing from different areas of research, grounded in the
respective scientific theories, and capable of encompassing different
perspectives: socio-political, technical, scientific.  We encourage inter-
and multi- disciplinary approaches that cover more than one aspect of CI and
encourage original and quality contributions as follows:
-    Domain definition of collective intelligence (what is CI?)
-    Evolution of CI - practices, case studies, work examples
-    Tools and techniques to support CI (programming and designing of
-    Social and behavioural dynamics related to CI, within the context of IT
-    Impact of CI on advancement of interdisciplinary
-    Impact of CI on other disciplines
-    Impact of CI on all other human activities
-    CI Projects and results
-    CI risks and aberrations (cyber-mobbing, wisdom of the crowds
transforming into mobs)
-    Theories and Scientific Methods pertaining CI
-    Knowledge aggregation
-    Expertise finding

one can see things through a polical lense, and stick to them an ideological
label,  or one can simply consider ideas and stances from a philosophical,

I am not asking anone to chose, just contrasting

thanks for picking up on issues
indeed, many questions come up from unpacking the thread.
more than I can physically handle
I am glad you see that possibly we view the world through a karmic lens, and
it is in light that I try to minimize my attachment to ideas and words
When I was a teenager someone read to me a citation of I dont remember who,
i think claude levy strauss, discussing how words ending in -ism and -ist
tend to portray a certain type of idea, an exasperation of a concept,
roughly as mentioned below
If someone knows what i am talking about and could send pointers would be
I dont know where we mark the line between idea and ideology,
and I am sure there is an interesting discussion there
I think we see how politics and religion are manipulated, how politics
become a self sustaining machine and just a self feeding beast,
depends where you want to direct your energies toward
hard to tell what is and what isnt, but  everything can be labelled as
anything else to serve a purpose, and become an instrument of propaganda.
i think the questions asked earlier, we need to define what we mean by the
terms we use. I am afraid that these good people actually are pretty that
they are communists, and I will leave that to you to work out
yes, power strucutre in any system is interesting

we have to be careful
assuming your example, if i dont use my coat in the summer someone could
take it away from me, or my spare computer while I use my newer one,
thats how potentially good ideas can become dangerous nonsense
and I am glad that today there is a law to protect my private property
although I dont own much, and I think there is faar too much
but what about having a collective coat bank, where all your unused coats
are left for others to use, and you in turn can go and pick up an odd jacket
when you need one?
that would presuppose that everyone would expect the same level of care,
cleanliness, respect for the goods, then yes it could work
the big thorn is land and real estates, already enforces a right called
usucapione (transfer of ownership, which derives from usufrutto (use of the
fruit)... uti dominus perhaps?
remember feudalism, when labourer would work the land in exchange for a bowl
of rice at the end of the month?
it would be enough to increase the return of the labourer to a fair
percentage, or fair share of returns, then the same system could work
I am sure there is a lot of scope for improving the way resources are used,
and hopefully some way that would make everyone happy

from what I see, some does, and some does not
people should choose freely what they can share or co-own (I also move
around a lot, and my target ownership level is what my parents and friends
can store for me)
I only own approx 30 medium sized crates of stuff, but would like to boil
everything down to less than ten
thats great, but cannot always work, and not for everbody, but it definitel
works when done on a voluntary basis
in fact we dont need a regulatory change to change, to share is free and not

I agree with your concerns, Patrick
 I need bits of personal property like my mug, my books, my sanctuary and
sacred space where I feel safe and where I am absolutely free, etc etc
I agree that the notion of property may need  to be revisted a bit, (my
children, my boyfriend, to what extend we own things? isnt everything just
passing, and we do really is take care of things, or use things)
just controlling things for a purpose may not necessarily imply ownership as
we know it
but I feel it would be more productive to articulate a discussion around how
to increase the benefits of certain kinds of private properies by sharing
its usage and maximising the circulation of resources, or something

actually, I am not sure about replicability
Having seen a few original masterpieces, and their copies, a very special
energy and strenght emanates from the former
My definition of a work of art is that it is a unique, and communicates some
unique in a unique way
this is why, I think, they are placed in public galleries where everyone can
enjoy them,  I will be interested in contrasting abundance vs uniqueness in
art, and maybe we could organise an exhibition one day about it

@_author: paola.dimaio@gmail.com 
@_subject: [p2p-research] the abundance of art 
I think I know what you mean, that due to our human nature we attach a
higher value to an original, than to its copies even when absolutely
perfectly the same.
For me though, an original piece of art is not just the product, the
exterior visible shape that we can see, but an intention, a 'first' a
breakthrough of logical scheme perhaps, a step that has never been taken
before, a way that reality has never been conceived or seen as before, and
as such ti vibrates at a unique frequency. A real original piece of art, and
I have seen only a few, has an essence that is not reproducible, because it
was generated by unique circumstances, in a unique space/time conjunction,
which was expressed in a unique/unprecedented brilliant form, and captured
sculpted or painted and will stay there forever. So what I am trying to say
is that the original and the copy are definitely not the same for me, even
when the latter is perfect. I would be interested to  explore the
possibility that its all in the mind though.
Abundance is perhaps donating it to a foundation, making it accessible free
of charge to everyone forever and having chairs next to it so that people
can actually sit nearby, and allowing copies to be made and circulated.

Lemme traduce for the non german speakers
the essence of the passage is
us trend forecaster Rushoff is convinced that complementary or parallel
curriencies will boom in the near future, the logical next step in the
evolution of money, as reported by Portfolion online magazine, one such
example is craigs bucks,  the currenc of craigslist

@_subject: [p2p-research] the abundance of art 
"it" IS all MIND
possibly. But all the pain, the personal sacrifice, the effort, the time,
the frustration, the suffering that go into creating a piece of reality that
did not exist before, make in my eye an object unique and thus worthy of
such, and a copy will always be a copy of that
Once a friend of mine, great creative genius and profoundly disturbed, used
to make a piece of art of any object he touched. He polished roots of trees
picked up by reiversides and made the most beautiful ornaments and artifacts
of them, for example. But given the amount of work required for each, their
true price would have been too high to be sellable,so he only gave his works
of art away or destroyed them after creation when he had nowhere to store
them and nobody to give them to, while making a living with temp jobs like
pushing trolleys in hospitals and sweeping streets for the city council.
a great person, and a self declared madman by choice.
 He once punched a clock into pieces, and disassembled every single piece to
single components, then stuck them onto a canvass with glue rearranging them
into a pattern that suited him better
 it was amazing. not that anyone couldnt  do the same, but it would be a
different clock, a different assembly pattern. a different reason for
punching it down, and the result would be a differently unique piece.
it could well all be in the mind though

very important questions indeed
but  scarcity and uniqueness and rarity are not synonms nor are semantically
equivalent, imho
same as
value and price are not synonyms
a unique piece of art is of no practical use really
 when hungry or thirsty, its trade value that can generate
a breadcrumb, and I agree, thats where the whole economic mechanism builds
on and distorts the real value of things

yes, but we dont necessarily need it either
I can live very well with a few things only, and grateful for public
libraries and galleries
(but a lot of what they call music art and literature  is really depressing
stuff, i dont know why)

Think so , i definitely need chocolate
no blame. by cultivating our uniqueness, we can make marginally more
meaningful contributions to the collective
if each of our posts was not unique in its own way, there would be no point
iin having mailing lists

I think both are distinct ways to know the world, possibly different parts
of it, and for different purposes, but I would definiltey agree that there
is some scope for complementarity
I should have mentioned that the mother of the artist in question who owned
the clock, which after the creative transformation had lost its intended
functionality, was not interested in uniqueness as such

@_subject: [p2p-research] scarcity of water 
example of induced scarcity:
when I arrive in Scotland long period in Asia
at the airport I looked for a water drinking fountain
I was surprised that there is not dringing water
if you are thirsty you buy water at a bout 1.65 per small bottle
Horrified I tried to fill up by bottle from the tap in the washing room,
which was full of chlorine.
In Scotland the quality of water is very high, just that in public places
there is not access to water, nor in schools, nor in public buildings

thanks for additional comments
just a thought
I can undersand why someone with a certain belief would associate the social
model above with what inspires them most, but somehow I would be reluctant
to label the above with any ideological affiliation.
I come from a systems engineering point of view, and we would call the above
a holarchy (unhiererchy of sorts)
 I would not call what described above  as communism, but I would not object
to other people calling  whatever they want if that makes them happy
to a hammer everything is a needle, thats why a communist would associate
any ideal modeal to what he believes in
isnt that so?

Michel and all
Just to inform you that today I assisted to a talk by Manzini, and after
listening to him , I thought a lot of what he
says resonates, sounds familiar, do you know the p2pfoundation  btw and Yes,
apparently you are already in the same loop
the flyer about his talk here
I must say that I had to switch off the email to digest (which I rarely get
to read anyway) cause of email overlord
so if any direct replies to this msg pls cc my email offlist
Very weird things are happening, many of us  are working to  'connect'
people, but  what we connect on the one hand, gets disconnected by some
We talked about this during the public lecture too
two quick points:
a) how can we make sure that people working on related initiatives around
the world are connected
through this list  or other p2p group (are we all on facebook?),
b) can anyone working on a lecture/seminar/other activity on related themes
try to connect with local people to create some synergy
and maybe ping someone
is anyone on this list in Scotland? (apologies if I asked this q before)
and btw how did the seminar in Manchester go?

Sam, and all
I am chairing collective intelligence track for an IEEE DEST 2010
(please do not judge this too poorly cause they have a bad website, thats
it would be great to have a paper if you could write something up (quickly,
deadline is Feb 1st or soon thereafter)
Please do let me know if you plan to submit something

Thanks for reply
what  you suggest would be great, my experience in writing papers on
converging topics
is that they end up resulting in a soup
if you find a way of rationalising the convergence into
one topic that makes sense (ie that does not sound as if written by a
lunatic)  it would be great
if you dont have research results (unless you can whip up your research
really quickly) some positions papers
woudl be fine, I suspect you may benefit from the collaboration of
experienced researchers to make sure
the papers are technically sound, other than that we welcome any novel
this seems significant effort, I am following with great interest whatever I
can read
Unfortunately  there are no bursaries for conference proceedings that I know
of, but if your paper is accepted I
can ask the organisers if they can help you locate some resources  to
register the paper to enter the proceedings,
apologies for not contributing to the list, working on tons of stuff
Look forward

I too work mainly for humanitarian/not for profit, and work day jobs (like
being a lecturer) to finance my research interests
This project is very valuable, and it would be great if you could find some
connections in your network who have funding
I d love to read the paper
I can anticipate that if the connection does not fail us, we can easily set
up your virtual talk (or I can download it
on my laptop if you send me the link before I go there) so physical presence
is not required to present, however registration at the main conference is
required for the paper to be presented (I know this sucks but thats the way
these things work, I have been doing this for a couple of years)
