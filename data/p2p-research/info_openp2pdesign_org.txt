Dear Michel (and Eric and Nikos, nice to know you),
I was about to write an e-mail to you tonight on this subject!
I've published two posts in my blog (with a third one scheduled for  today) about the Open Source Building Alliance Operation, so I can  write a post resuming it for the P2P Foundation blog in these days.
Best regards,
Massimo Menichinelli

@_subject: [p2p-research] universal design 
I'm not so sure that we can actually link Universal Design (as it is called in the USA) or Design for All (as it is called in Europe) to P2P I studied it about 10 years ago but I remember it's not about participatory design or design for enabling p2p dynamics or open models. Though it is very important, it is about designing products, services and so on in a way that they are proper for disabled people and "common people" at the same time. No more "special" products for disabled people and "common" products for everybody else: Universal Design proposes to design all the products as if they were to be used by everybody (hence the "universal" name).
It's about considering ergonomics (but not participation) in the design process. I don't see it as P2P, it is a way to design better products for everybody.

I should be in Milan in December, so I can participate in it too.
By the way, when are you going to be in Milan Michel? Where are you going to give your lecture? If you tell me where it is I can start spreading the news here in Italy ;-)
See you soon,
