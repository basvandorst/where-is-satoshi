@_subject: [p2p-research] Forban : Presentation given at Breizh Entropy 
Hi All,
I gave a talk at Breizh Entropy Congress about Forban[1] :
This explains a bit more about the background around Forban and
how the protocol is working.
Kind regards,

IMHO, the license is just another proprietary license and by so
limiting potential relation in an networked information economy.
The restrictions mentioned in section 4[1] is excluding everyone
as NC (non-commercial)  terminology is just impossible
to be carefully defined.
I don't know what's the "added value" works are but I would
suggest to see how those works are in the perspective of
the Chapter 4, "The Economics of Social Production" from
the book of Yochai Benkler and see really if the "added value"
works really need a proprietary license or won't be more
beneficial for the foundation to release them as free works.
Just an idea,

@_subject: [p2p-research] preparing the transfer to the new email list 
What about the current archive? This is indexed and might be good
to keep the links valid over time.
For the export, as you are currently using Mailman, you'll just need to do:
cd $MAILMANHOME
./list_members > email_of_subcribers.txt
and you'll need to import the list back into your new list.
What will be the new mailing-list?
On the wiki is still mentioned the listcultures.org one:
Hope this helps,
Kind regards,

@_subject: [p2p-research] Forban - a simple link-local opportunistic p2p free 
Hi All,
I made some experiments for a having a simple gossip-like p2p protocol
in my local area network. The free software implementation is called Forban :
Forban works independently from Internet and use only the local area
capabilities to announce, discover, search or share files. Forban relies on
HTTP and he is opportunistic (meaning replicating any files seen in
his proximity or interest). The current implementation is written in Python.
The Forban protocols are minimalistic to ease the accessibility to
build independent Forban in any decent language or even in shell scripts
(using tcpdump and wget for example).
Forban operates in different modes, the opportunistic mode is the default
and working as a gossip protocol to disseminate data with any Forban
in his proximity. The main concept is to provide persistence for the
disseminated data even on periodic or unreliable communication.
This is just an experiment but it works as expected. If you have any
ideas or feedback to improve the protocol or the software, just let me know.
Kind regards,

@_subject: [p2p-research] Being autonomous, 
Dear Michel and p2p enthusiasts,
When I see the current discussions around p2p concepts and our societies,
there is always a common requirement that would allow more p2p activities
between citizen : this requirement is the autonomy of each element in a
p2p networks (in our societies or in the non-physical world).
To be autonomous, you need two important concepts:
- (1) The ability to control your tools to be autonomous and
- (2) also getting the benefit of running autonomous.
(1) is what's called by Ivan Illich the "tools for conviviality"[1] where he was
already making a definition of free software[2] in the seventies. Everyone
must have the control on their tools (e.g. technologies, information
tools,...) and
be able to use them without the need of a monopoly.
"A convivial society should be designed to allow all its members the
most autonomous action by means of tools least controlled by others."
(2) is self explanatory, if you can't get a benefit/reward (either
direct or indirect),
the incentive to be autonomous is very low.
Looking at the past discussions, it seems sometimes that we could
be afraid to jump into a "DoOcracy"[3] because some risks exists but
I think the risk is higher to give up and ask "large organization" to do
the next tools for the next years. We will then loose the control of the tools
and won't be able to be autonomous.
That's why when doing something to render people (and/or machine)
more independant, we need to keep in mind (IMHO) that the system
must be simple and convivial for everyone willing to use or modify it.
Just a small comment,
Thanks to all for your work.
