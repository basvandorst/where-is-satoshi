Dear Suresh and all ~
By far the most important book I've read on what is now needed related to global
systems change is Not-Two Is Peace: The Ordinary People's Way of Global Cooperative
Order by Adi Da. The book is available entirely online here:
All best wishes ~

Dear Michel and all ~
There is indeed a great deal of confusion about Adi Da and his life.  As in most
things, a cursory examination is sufficient to create fear and doubt, but not at
all sufficient to result in understanding.
In my view, the book Not-Two Is Peace is inspired. For those who are concerned
about where we go from here and how we get out of this mess we're in, it is an
essential read.
All best wishes ~
