Michel, you have my full trust of course, and I believe that you possess the vision and devotion necessary to fulfill the promises of this network. I consider the task of managing people the toughest job of all, not to mention a community that is growing this quickly. So I greatly laud your efforts, and no one should take anything away from you in this I believe there must be a genuine misunderstanding here. Being the non-techie I am, I must admit my inability to fully grasp what is happening here. But may I suggest that further discourse on this will only seek to pursue a peaceful solution, one that will be accepted by all parties?
As Thomas Carlyle once said, every noble work is at first impossible. So while things may seem difficult now, I believe it also presents an opportunity for us to look at things differently, and grow in our depth of understanding what may/may not work in our community. Let us all pursue a resolution with the goal of growing this productive community.
