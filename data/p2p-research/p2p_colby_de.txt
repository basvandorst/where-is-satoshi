the second part of the Robin Good Interview on the blog is the same as the first part. Thought I let you know..

============================== START ==============================
Dear list members,
I think that this topic is very important, and even though the project mentioned is already quite interesting, maybe there is the possibility to get a broader scope on it.
What if we engange in a global "mapping of peer-production / alternative economy" ?
I quote Gibson-Graham ("Postcapitalist Politics"):
"[The practice of seeing and speaking economy differently] encourages us to make visible the hidden and alternative economic activities that difference [..].
If we can begin to see noncapitalist activities as prevalent and viable, we may be encouraged here and now to actively build on them to transform our local economies."
So I indeed think that it is important, to make these structures this should not only be restricted to p2p urbanism.
Doesn't it already exist?
Of course there already exist many specific lists and maps, for ecovillages, for fablabs, for hacker spaces, for social institutions etc. But what if we manage to link them, to connect them, to make visible that they share a common identity?
How can we achieve that?
I know that P2P-Foundation is meant as a place where this can happen, and the P2P-Foundation wiki probably tries to achieve just that and I think it is already a great ressource.
As it already happens in some Wikipedia articles, it would be great to add coordinate-base data to the projects listed in the P2P-Wiki. A database of P2P-Projects marked with geographic data can be the raw material for building a real map of P2P-economy. Instead of Google, the best platform to connect it with is OpenStreetMap, since only there it can truely stay Creative Commons.

@_subject: [p2p-research] Mapping P2P, 
Dear Michel,
we should reflect what the goal of mapping can be.
1. Of course the basic idea of maps is to give "coordinates" about places that fulfill a certain task. Like a person hiking in the mountains, happy about the shelter he finds on his map. For this reason it is good to have topic-specific maps.
2. In the general public discussion, you might find reports about hacker spaces, fablabs, ecovillages etc. Seldom you will read that they share a common ground, that they belong to the same idea of creating an alternative economy (each in its own way). Even inside these projects, the notion of a common ground is restricted. A broader map could create just that, the knowledge that there are "more out there". To create a common struggle for a P2P economy.
I think these two goals can be combined perfectly. A well-designed mapping architecture could offer topic-specific maps, as well as the possibility to blend them, to merge them.
3. The information that we map should be Open Access, it should be a commons. The best legal construction to guarantee this at the moment is GPL or Creative Commons. None of these are compatible with Google Maps, so any P2P mapping project should be created with OpenStreetMap, where this licensing can be achieved.

Hey Tino, Michel and everybody,
my own programming skills are very limited but I contacted a befriended programmer of mine, and he is willing to help with putting it up. It won't be more difficult to enter data than in Google Maps. I can't tell yet if it is possible to import KML directly, but we can try.
Of course nothing is wrong with putting up the Map of P2P Urbanism as planned parallel.
It is no problem to show one or more layers of information and to put them together when needed.
If we really manage to get it filled up with data, it can be a great source of information.
It will be possible to see the data in two different modes:
1. Map View: filtered by information layer (category)
2. Table View: sometimes it is more convenient to see something like "all fablabs in the US" in a table view.
The data can be exported as XML / CSV file, so people can use it for their own purposes.
I will come back to you as soon as there's something to show.

@_subject: [p2p-research] Update on mapping P2P 
Hello everybody,
I'd like to give you an update about the P2P Mapping project. Even though there has been quite some programming going on, it is unfortunately stuck at the moment.
The main problem is the privacy discussion. The programmer I'm working with refuses to build a platform where everybody can enter information about somebody's else projects. The prototype-example we were discussing about is some ecovillage, that prefers not to be listed in the internet. Opt-out after being listed was not an option in this case, because of the argument 'what's once in the Internet stays there..', especially for data under Open Licenses, which I think is true.
The other option left was to build a platform where P2P projects can enter their own data (so more like a "Yellow Pages"-concept). Of course by taking this way it might be much harder to get enough projects On the other side, the preferred effect of establishing "links" between the projects should be better, since by entering their data, they're more involved in building up the website.
But we found it very problematic to find an umbrella identity, where all those projects we would label as "P2P", would find themselves. For example here in Berlin there are many projects I'd label as "P2P" or "Community Economy", like collective bicycle repair workshops, while they'd never see themselves as such, but rather as "left(radical) grassroots project".
And I think it's similar with many projects that see themselves as Community Economy, Solidarity Economy, Alternative Economy, P2P Economy, Open Source Economy, Gift Economy, Cooperative Economy, Non-capitalistic Economy etc... (or not even as "economy" at all)
The  privacy issue might be hard to understand for non-German readers, but here it is a really big topic. Especially now with Google Street View, where even Government has intervened, and all German property owners and tenants now have the possibility to "opt out" before Street View starts in December (the house will be blackened out).
If you can think of any good solutions, we're happy about suggestions and ideas.
I still think it would be great to realize this together with OpenStreetMap.
There already exist some great layers for OSM ( but I would say that until now it's still a bit complicated to enter data for most people, so a good interface is needed.
For browsing OSM I can recommend  it is much faster than the original openstreetmap.org and easier to use. (nice feature: "ticker" shows real-time-contributions to the map).
Kind regards,
