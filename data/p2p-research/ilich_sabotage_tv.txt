hi neal,
i completely agree with douglas rushkoff there. in 2005, a webhosting company that i will not name gave delete.tv the refund of a whole year of service, even though 6 months had already gone by, because some "anonymous" users didn't want to have their info hosted at the same company where the borderhack project was being hosted... of course, no one at the time believed us, as the idea was the internet was a place of freedom. so yea, being evicted lead to us start the possibleworlds.org and spacebank.org operation, but that's another story...

Going over what Miguel Said says:  i jwanted to point out to an example in north america: the work of the EZLN Zapatistas. not only they have commonalized farming and agriculture, but also government with their juntas del buen gobierno.  and they even do international trade with collectives from the so called west (which funny enough happens to be towards the east since 518 years ago)....  i don't see them pushing the issue of ownership or even caring about it either... actually legally they don't even own the land where they live, but obviously they are descendents of persons who have been there much longer than those who came with col?n and cortez to reactivate the economy in their kingdom.
also they are part of an oral (and alive) culture where intellectual property licenses (including creative commons) don't make much sense and haven't had much echo...  so there you go, we have one example... strong and autonomous and economically sustainable.

hi michel, friends from the list,
i'm sending out this announcement of the digital maoist sunflower, a digital currency being launched this midnight for people using spacebank.org or who are working on the diego de la vega cooperative media conglomerate network .... i'm sorry the english version is not developed as the spanish one, but as you know, time doesn't stop... and most people on that particular network speak spanish.
from denver,
