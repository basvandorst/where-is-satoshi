In most workers co-op members are both paid a wage and receive a dividend
(share of profits) relative to how much work they have done.
Mondragon has been criticsed in the past for doing just this, i.e.
outsourcing some manufacturing etc to cheap overseas labourers who are not
members of the co-op.

Er, no.
Take the example of The Co-operative Group in the UK.
They are technically owned by the Consumers. Anyone can become an
owner-member for ?1.
Profits are re-distributed to members as dividends in proportion the amount
of transactions they've had with the Co-op over the year.
The fact that prices are above costs helps the Co-op survive on a day-to-day
basis since it improves cash flow. (some) Members are happy to pay higher
prices because they know any surplus can be redistributed at the end of the
year (should they decide that is the best thing to do at the AGM).
Consumer Co-ops are the solutions to your problems Patrick. I am forever
perplexed as to why you continue to bang on about profit and don't just
spend your time promoting co-ops! :P
Personally I don't agree that everything should be owned and controlled by
consumers though. I prefer organisations that are stakeholder owned and
governed, i.e. workers, consumers/ service users, investors - as is made
possible by the "Somerset Rules"

I was thinking of whacking something up on  which
IMHO is the best all round quick and easy crowdfunding platform at the
In fact, I actually starting doing it but got stumbled by the fact the
minimum that you can ask for is $500 and we only need $200 to keep the Ning
Now I've just read their FAQ I'm not sure this $500 minimum actually matters
"What happens if my project does not reach its campaign goal?
"IndieGoGo still disburses the funds the project raised upon expiration. "
However, perhaps this $500 minimum is actually a blessing in disguise...
We can say we're raising $200 to keep the Ning online for another year and
we'll use the other $300 towards the costs of building an open source
alternative using Drupal.
If we raise less than $200 we can ask the contributors what they'd like us
to do with the money instead.
Shall I just go ahead with this idea?
* there is a cheaper Ning package, but we can't go for that because we
already have more than the 150 members that allows

OK, will do my best to get IndieGoGo page live on Monday morning.
Because I think the rough consensus is that it'd be better to have a nice
open source home for it instead. I've not caught up on his messages yet, but
it also looks like Alex has already started doing some work in that
direction too...

@_subject: [p2p-research] Hello this is my email 
Jonas, thanks so much for your generous offer! :)
I set-up the Ning so its probably easiest that I pay for the subscription
myself using my account.
If you have a UK bank account (although I'm assuming you don't) then the
best way (i.e. incurring the minimum charges) to contribute is probably
directly into my bank account. If you do have access to a UK bank account
then let me know and I'll give you my bank details.
Otherwise you can pay direct to my United Diversity's paypal account which
is linked to my josef at uniteddiversity.com email address.
Or just contribute via IndieGoGo  - I assume we'll receive slightly less
this way because IndieGoGo will take their cut but it might also be the most
effective way to encourage others - and, actually, at present IndieGoGo pay
a 5% bonus on any successful campaigns so: on balance it probably works out
best to simply pay through IndieGoGo (to encourage others to contribute
more, and to make it more likely we reach our goal and get that 5% bonus)
Thanks again,
Big smiles,

As I write we're now up to $520 :)
 and then publish a status report at the end of five days?
Yeah, it will automatically run and keep accepting donations until the 5
days is up.
I have to admit, I'm now very slightly regretting having gone and paid Ning
for a whole year since it probably wont take us that long to build a new
home, but c'est la vie. Live and learn I guess. I think I perhaps got a
little carried away with the excitement of it all!
However, since that is what I said we'd do on the fundraising page I guess
it's only right that that is what I did.
We can also discuss with the list, how to use the extra money,
My proposal is to put out a bounty for someone to write a script/ web app to
make it easy for both us and other communities to migrate from Ning to free
software solutions (e.g. wordpress, drupal, etc.)
In fact, since we've got a whole year to play with, I'd quite like to try
another funding drive to raise an even greater sum, both to fund this bounty
and for a big fat new server for the new network as well as existing blog
and wiki.

One thing I think that needs further explanation/ elaboration:
How are Phyles different/ distinct from co-operatives?
who take better advantage of the networked age than most co-ops do.
Also, what, if any, is the existing relationship to the wider co-operative

What is the way forward for the co-operative sector? Commissioned by
Co-operatives UK, Robin Murray ? a co-operative innovator and key thinker
behind Fairtrade, Twin Trading and much more besides ? has produced a
radical vision of the how the co-operative sector can expand in the 21stCentury.
*Co-operation in the age of Google* shows that we are living at a time of
profound transformation. The information and communication revolution,
widespread concerns about private sector greed, public sector finances and
impending climate chaos present a wide range of possibilities for
co-operative expansion.
But Robin says the co-operative sector is not yet in a position to make the
most of these opportunities. It needs to be more innovative, more
integrated, more internationalist, to get better infrastructure and to find
?the idea? that can mobilise support for co-operation.
The review proposes a series of practical initiatives for 2011 and 2012 to
strengthen the co-operative sector.
In true co-operative fashion, a ?beta version? of this review is now open
for comments, alternative suggestions, improvements, counter-arguments,
examples and photos.
The beta version can be accessed online at bottom of this page. It can be
viewed by everyone and commented by members of Co-operatives UK. Comments
are open until 12 February 2011.
   - What do you think of the practical initiatives proposed to develop the
   sector?
   - Do you agree with the areas where the report suggests co-operative
   expansion is most likely?
   - What are your suggestions for developing co-operatives and  innovation?
   - What is ?the co-operative idea??

Sounds a bit like the Radical Routes network here in the UK. In my
experience are a real community too.
But I'm not sure how you are defining a "real community"?
Not all co-ops are local. I'd imagine there are quite a few transnational
web development co-ops out there.
OK, so by that definition I'd say Radical Routes is a real community too. In
part, because to become a member co-op you have to attend at least 3 of
their quarterly gatherings where you meet and get to know people face to
Fair point. Lots of co-ops aren't very radical/ forward thinking/
co-operative! :P
But some are.
Could you elaborate on the growth and community differences?
BTW, I've not read it yet, but just came across this that sems very relevant
to this discussion:
Co-operation in the Age of Google

still :)

My pleasure. And no need for apologies.
I think people on this list really ought to comment on that Co-operation in
the Age of Google doe ( ) because it seems to
me that they don't really have a deep enough understanding of p2p
As for Radial Routes, I think they are quite different from Las Indias, but
they are a large distributed (around the UK) community of people who live/
work in co-ops and in my experience really do practice what they preach and
are an example of real solidarity/ community in action :)
BTW, would Las Indias be interested in helping to turn a bit of land near
Cuenca in Spain into an eco campsite and permaculture project? And can they
help me set-up a Spanish co-op to whom I can transfer the ownership?

Whilst that is indeed how they describe themselves on their website, I can
assure that they ARE a real community of persons.
This difference has consequences both in deliberation and in social action.
Like I say, in my experience they ARE a real community. They do have a
deliberative processes and a real sense of identity.
- Coops are localy oriented, and probably if you ask them, they will call
I'd say that is certainly not true of the (mostly activists) who make up the
Radical Routes network/ community. Many of them are very active in actions
outside of the UK. They are very much a part of the much larger community of
what I guess could be described as anti-capitalist anarchists.

As you've probably noticed, so far every time I've agreed to do something
like that I've far failed to do it! (I'm terrible at blogging because I get
all perfectionist and seem unable to just whack something down like I can in
email threads etc!)
Perhaps just publish this page, which is a synopsis of the report? :P
Whilst I think its great they've gone to the trouble to write it (although
they do point out it was done in quite a rush), and are asking for feedback,
I really think they need do some feedback from the people on this list. To
me it seems they don't really fully understand p2p stuff very deeply.
