FYI - please circulate
Sorry for crosspostings,
---------- Forwarded message ----------
We invite contributions for our upcoming special issue entitled ?A critical
view on Peer-to-Peer energy production and distribution?.
It can be argued that a shift to a P2P-based, sustainable society would be
based on a set of inter-related infrastructures:
   - A distributed communication and coordination infrastructure with tools
   for more transparent governance.
   - A distributed money infrastructure that might be based on open money
   systems.
   - A distributed agriculture and manufacturing infrastructure which has
   been emerging with open design communities.
   - ?nd last but not least, the energy production and distribution
   infrastructure i.e. P2P energy: the ability to produce energy in a
   sustainable way at a hyperlocal scale.
This issue aims to shed light on this dynamically evolving subject of P2P
energy production and distribution, and identify the challenges that lie
ahead. Hence, we are interested in any article that would discuss the
potential, the challenges and the applications of P2P alternative modes of
energy production and distribution.

Thank you; although my English pronunciation is more than harsh (however,
the result is satisfying if considering my stammering problem :-)
Finally, I cannot make it (initially I had booked even air tickets for that)
and physically take part in the conference, as I could not take a generous
leave from the Army. I will participate with a poster of my paper and this
video. After the conference all the material (papers, videos and posters)
will be uploaded at the website of the conference - I will let you know.
Of course, I will post something in our P2P blog, maybe tomorrow.

?Capitalism [?] is approaching an apocalyptic zero-point? (Slavoj ?i?ek).
What is the role of communication in the general situation of capitalist
The global economic downturn is an indicator of a new worldwide
capitalist crisis. The main focus of most public debates as well as of
economic and policy analyses is the role of finance capital and the
housing market in creating the crisis, less attention is given to the
role of communication technologies, the media, and culture in the world
economic crisis. The task of this special issue of tripleC is to present
analyses of the role of ICTs, the media, and culture in the current
crisis of capitalism. The seven papers focus on the causes, development,
and effects of the crisis. Each paper relates one or more of these
dimensions to ICTs, the media, or culture.
