@_subject: [p2p-research] p2p resource pooling 
I think this is a great idea: it will offer a way to give
institutional and some financial stability to our activities, making
the p2pfoundation something more than a blog. Is the idea to invite a
number of supporters/subscribers? Each of these pay a sum per month?
In that case I think some people might be prepared to pay more than
?10- maybe we can stretch it up to ? 50 for some? (That's like having
a second cell phone..) Do we want corporate members as well ? In that
case what kind? Small companies , start ups? We could charge them
just some rants
