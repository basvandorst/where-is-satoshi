@_subject: [p2p-research] Google gets into the DNS business 
The same way we make any government a good one. Destroy it via
obsolescence. Ironically, Google has been expanding increasingly into p2p systems, but
making them effectively not p2p. They've started doing mail, now DNS,
XMPP, other stuff (Wave) over XMPP, etc.
It would be interesting to make a sort of "P2P Google" manual, detailing
how to negate your dependency on Google by setting up all of the things
you use it for on an autonomous platform.

I would rather spend time creating p2p infrastructure then trying to
reform fascist infrastructure.
Probably, a good thing to look into is 802.11s[1] (mesh networking), and
ways to easily and cheaply deploy that. Some people have already created
very wide-reaching wireless networks, such as the Athens Wireless
Metropolitan Network[2]. The next thing that would be necessary is devising ways of long-range
transmission (high-frequency radio? LEO DIY comsat stuff?) and p2p
variants of protocols which are now hierarchical, such as DNS and TLS.
This seems doable, although very difficult. It remains to be seen if the
amount of will that is necessary for these efforts to succeed can be

I don't have the time to read through that right this minute, but I
will. From the glance I took at it, I think I can spot a few things you
might have missed.
I don't disagree with you wrt the infeasibility of totally replacing the
current hierarchical internet with a p2p/horizontal one. However, it
does seem very feasible to grow local networks that can supplant the
current structure _locally_ -- for instance, the Athens network, or
Freifunk. The article is also more than a year old now; maybe it's time
for an update ;-)

I'm certainly interested, but cannot respond because of the massive
effort it would entail (reading in full every email and every referenced
article in a given thread) and the intimidation factor (being hit by a
massive response is not a friendly way to welcome newcomers).
I think that I like the ideas that this list collectively espouses, but
they're presented in such an inaccessible way that most of the time,
this list is just noise to me. I would definitely appreciate an effort
to make accessibility a priority.

I don't understand what you mean by this. Do you intend to say that you
do not think that making this list more accessible is a feasible goal?
All I really know about the purpose of this list is:
There does seem to be a very high volume of relevant content posted on
that topic, but most discussion seems to take place among a clique that
has a lot of internal knowledge for the purpose of making blog posts or
what-have-you. This may be the actual purpose of this list (generating
blog posts), and if it is this, not discussion of the political,
economic, and social dimensions of peer-to-peer networks, then I'll
gladly sit down and shut up and maybe tweak my filters to be more
aggressive about pruning large threads.
By the way, everyone, thank you for your concern, but I don't need to be
CC'd in mails because I am actually on this list and get every message
sent to it (to my knowledge). Doing so is a minor inconvenience, because
when I get the message from a CC instead of from the list, it doesn't
have the right headers for my filters to catch it, so I'd appreciate it
if people could just send to the list instead of to me, if it's all the

The number of responses isn't intimidating, what is intimidating is the
general method of response involving pages upon pages of text and
article quotations, not even bringing the referenced articles into
This is a fine conversation for me to participate in, because there is
virtually no danger of this occurring. There is no way for me (or, I
presume, any other p2p neophyte) to respond to the type of message
described above, so I cannot participate in the vast majority of
conversations on this list, though I do have interest in doing so (which
goes against a previously stated view that people who do not reply have
no interest).

I use evolution's reply-to-list feature. The key binding is C-l, for
other users.
Do other clients not have such features? I seem to remember something in
Thunderbird that was similar...

Presumably, this would cause approval to happen only once every few days

I've heard a lot about Google Wave, but I haven't yet seen a client
that's free software. It seems like it wouldn't make much sense to
discuss p2p on a proprietary platform; does anyone know if there is a
free software client for Wave so that we could try this out?

How is this a "different side" of p2p, exactly? Freenet seems to me to
be a p2p network like any other, though I suppose you could say that it
isn't "pure" p2p or something because it is sometimes f2f.
Using peer-to-peer networks for privacy and anonymity seems to be a very
common side of p2p, though that may just be my perspective...

If you consider bandwidth and disk space a "good", then Freenet is a
commons constructed of shared goods.
If we assume that things like free speech are axiomatically good, then
those things which protect free speech are also good, thus anything
Freenet does is good, because all it does is allow for anonymous (and
thus free) speech.
I assert that the morality in both situations is neutral, since no
action is taking place between agents. I find it hard to judge morality
when there is only a single autonomous being involved, doing nothing to
anything but itself. You could say that the network is committing a
moral action by transferring data to the requesting party, but since the
network is just transferring encrypted bytes, I don't think any moral
judgment could be made on it.

You should consider plugging your gmail account into a desktop mail
client, like Evolution, Thunderbird, or even mutt, if you're so
inclined. With IMAP, you can use the web interface when you're away, but
you'll have a local copy of your mail on disk and will not be using
Gmail's non-free software web app. And you'll get nifty features like
built-in OpenPGP support and reply-to-list.

You don't have to use Thunderbird for your RSS reader, do you? I
certainly don't.
What features are you missing? If there isn't a way to get them in
vanilla Thunderbird, there might be an addon you've missed that you can
use to get the same functionality.

I believe Andy was referring to human behavior, rather than corporate
behavior. Humans display some self-interest, but also display mutual aid
and compassion, and it's debatable which motivates behavior "more".
Oligarchic banking powers don't. As such, it's unfair to use their
behavior as evidence for a statement about human behavior patterns.

Who is qualified to say what is "natural" and what is not? Is there a
way for natural beings such as humans to take action in such a way that
is not participation in the natural world? What is the nature of this
"connection"; how is it formed or maintained, and what effect does it
have on the endpoints? Where are the endpoints?
I don't see the distinction you're making between "religious belief" and
"spiritual experiences". Presumably, religious belief is a subset of
spiritual experiences, where spiritual experiences are any experiences
involving some sort of extra-natural majick-y phenomena. It seems to me that I am one of these atheists that you are
"critiquing". I certainly do not see irrational, evidence-agnostic "life
systems" like most New Age or imported Eastern beliefs as a part of
"human experience" that is to be desired. I certainly have my own
reasons for my opinions, as you do for yours, but I don't see how my
opinions are in any way misaligned with the desire for a peer-to-peer
society. It seems to me that you're implying this; is this indeed the
case? If so, why?

I don't see how you can do this in the email after you admit that a tiny
minority of humanity lives in the countries that benefit from capitalism
while billions live in poverty.
I guess you could argue on the "than anything else", but that doesn't
respond to the previously-cited anthropological evidence that life
before capitalism was much more enjoyable by a wide variety of metrics.
There are some "objective" metrics you could use to claim that even in
the Global South, industrial life is better than what preceded it, but
at least then, the poor could breathe clean air.
It's very clear that capitalism has succeeded for *you*, and for *me*,
and probably for all of the people on this email list. But capitalism
has failed most of humanity, in very clear, demonstrable ways.

Would you consider the public-key cryptosystems that make secure
communication over the internet possible "valueless"?
If "pure research" into number theory and prime numbers was quashed
years ago, those cryptosystems would not exist, and our world would be a
noticeably worse place.
I don't see why you are assuming that neo-liberal capitalism in any way
values creativity. Capitalist incentives are a horrible way to create
creativity, and the "creator"/"consumer" dynamic that capitalism aims to
achieve despises creativity.[1]
This is what neo-liberal capitalism has optimized for. The current
system does not value a population of creative, productive individuals,
it values brain-dead wage slaves.
