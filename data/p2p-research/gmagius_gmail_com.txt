a trangsressive MASS practice. That's the real important aspect. It
has to do with the social norms creation: when a social behaviour is
possible to replicate without difficulty, it tends to self-affirm as
norm. And for sure technics helps to replicate social behaviours.
Imho there's also an education aspect. File sharing educate masses to

Autonet is a project to create a wireless, global internet that can
provide more reliability than corporate phone companies by being
community based and freely licensed.
The cutting off access to The Pirate Bay by BT in the UK (
 ) is
just another sign of the beginning of the end. The fact that the Great
Firewall of China exists signals that the internet is already obsolete
and that the Great Firewall of the US is just around the corner. While
moves against net neutrality began years ago and have been fought,
nasty laws such as HR4437 and the Total Information Awareness program
have a way of coming into existence later in the future, slightly
modified, under different names. The internet as we know it, as a
place for free exchange of information, as the center of what has been
called a second 17th century with new ideas, creativity and innovation
emerging daily, is rapidly coming to an end. We must use these last
gasps of freedom to route around the disaster and create a truly free
How? Advances in wireless technology such as ubiquitous wireless
routers, community mesh networks which are easily expandable and
self-healing as well as long range wireless efforts such as HPWREN
indicate a possible future for a community based internet free of the
centralized control of telephone corporations and governments. While
this is definitely a fork, more forks are to come and we can only hope
that a few networks will emerge which can be broad enough to span most
of the globe.
Major questions remain to be solved, such as speed issues, routing
issues, DNS control, splits and neutrality. The Autonet, or Autonomous
Internet project seems to begin to address this rapidly changing
situation, where today Germany (
 )
has installed internet filtering as well and more countries are to
come. While today those cut off are defying copyright laws, tomorrow
any other political issue may be the cause for being denied access to
global networks. While today the FBI is content to steal servers from
information providers like Indymedia, perhaps tomorrow they will not
be happy until indymedia is completely cut off of the network, or
other open sources of information such as blogs, twitter accounts and
social networks of dissident groups.
The popular revolt in Iran and subsequent disruption of network access
by the Iranian government is only a glimpse of what is to come in the
US and around the world, where the first line of attack against
political resistance is to cut off network access. By establishing a
community based, wireless, global network we can allow groups of
individuals, not corporations, to maintain freedom of communication;
We can create out right to communicate instead of asking for it, and
continue to route around obsolete intellectual property laws which
restrict our dreams and our creativity. Join this effort by going to
 and contributing to this research, lets start
outlining the problems, finding the technical solutions and work out
the issues, collectively, as a Free Software / Open Hardware project,
using open licensing.
Another urgent reason for Autonet is one that has motivated Free
Software hackers for so long: Technological progress without a
reliance on corporate support. Given the current financial and
economic crises, how long can we expect dinosaurs like phone companies
to survive? If one of these crises turns into disaster, the
consequence is likely to be the disruption or collapse of the global
networks on which we rely. I am not ready to give up what has been
gained from these networks, including a worldwide communication
between political actors empowered through fast information flows. We
must start this long, difficult project today so that we may be ready
for unexpected dangers which threaten our capability to communicate as
a multitude, globally.

@_subject: [p2p-research] Open source is a company; social media is a country 
by Chis Anderson (Wired)
image At the Sourceforge breakfast this morning we got some questions
on what the organizational differences are between open source and
social media. Here?s my answer:
One of the paradoxes of early 20th Century management was the
observation that companies are best run as dictatorships, while
countries are best run as democracies. Why was this? Management
theorist Charles Barnard, in his theory of the firm, proposed that it
was because organizations existed for a common ?shared purpose?.
Countries, on the other hand, existed only to serve their people.
Shared purpose required singular vision, leadership and top-down
control. Serving the people, on the other hand, benefits from
bottoms-up recognition of needs and collective decision-making
Many people mistakenly think that open source projects are emergent,
self-organized and democratic. The truth is just the opposite: most
are run by a benevolent dictator or two. What makes successful open
source projects is leadership, plain and simple. One or two people
articulate a vision, start building towards it and bring others on
board with specific tasks and permissions. The best projects are the
ones with the best leaders.
Social media, on the other hands, doesn?t exist for a shared purpose.
It exists to serve the individual. We don?t tweet to built Twitter, we
tweet to suit ourselves. We blog because we can, not because we have
signed on to a blogging project.
Seen this way, open source projects are like companies. Social media
is like a country. Benevolent dictatorships rule the first; democracy
the second.
The point: the nature of participation is very different between open
source and social media, even though people tend to lump them together
into "peer production". Open source is hierarchical by design, while
social media structure is simply ruled by popularity.

Hi all,
about exporting Ning.com community members' emails, are you aware
that's possible to export them in .CSV format from Ning group? Here's
how to do:
about creating a new community website different from the Ning.com
one, it's also possible to use the existing blog @
 , adding to it community features'
module. Infact, cause P2P Foundation blog uses Wordpress, upgrading it
at the last release, is possible to use the Buddypress module:
After Buddypress installation, you can batch upload the Ning.com
members using this plugin:
Imho using Buddypress on the existing blog is better than creating a
new site, cause in this way is possible to easily create a community
around existing blog contents, instead of making a new website with
their duplicated contents.

2010/4/19 Alex Rollin :
Imho cause actually there's not an app with all the features needed,
perhaps could be better to have many apps with a shared users'
database. And perhaps the "center" could be the wordpress P2P
Foundation blog, where resides the most updated contents. Around
wordpress is possible to connect the mediawiki users' from the
existing P2P Foundation wiki (using an integrated authentication
plugin for wordpress) and also the  community users coming from the
abandoned Ning.com platform (using the Buddypress plugin).
Exactly. The Ning.com website is not wired with the blog website. Imho
that's the reason why their features are not so used. Is better to use
the existing blog, using the community features to connect users with
the main website, giving them i.e. the feature to comment the
Wordpress articles through the Buddypress integrated forum, or the
feature to add videos to be showed on the blog..and soon.
Sure, Drupal has the most of the features needed, but imho not at an
excellent level as in the specialized apps like Wordpress and
Mediawiki. The better thing could be to have "all" on an unique cms,
also the wiki contents so to easily integrate i.e. wiki pages with
blog articles.
All depends on how many geeks want to dedicate some time to the P2P
Foundation ;-))

Imho there's a big problem in that approach. The power structure
actually is based on unequality. And to change this, you need to "use"
the power of enemies, because you have no much power to oppose to such
strong enemies. That's the lesson from GNU/GPL.  Freesoftware is a
winner because the license could be used by the little independent
coder and at the same time by the big corp. But both need to respect
the license specifications. And both can contribute if they
redistribute the code freely. So the power of the big corp is
collectivized. If you restrict the access only to them with ethical
guarantees, you loose the "brute" power of big corps. You probably
know that Linux powers both medical tools to save lives and weapons'
systems to kill them. A big contraddiction perhaps. But based on the
analysis of unequality of power.

The Kitegen project has nothing to do with "free energy" projects as

high altitude winds' energy and transform it in electricity. It's a
project working on strong scientific assumptions developped in
collaboration with Politecnico di Torino, an high accademic italian
center and also funded by European Community (the vessels' branch). A
similar system abroad is funded by Google. It's a "real" non-scarce

about 2,000 TeraWatt when actual need of all mankind is about 14

Samsung, Intel and Cisco to spread the WiMax technology. But we could
go forward. The patents' owner is interested also to contribute with
these assets as intellectual capital to create a Foundation that will

in a business model that works.
