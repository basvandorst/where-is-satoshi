Hi all,
 Michel it would have be essential to know what sort of mails did
paypal send which invoked better response then the ones you sent.
Another thing see if possibly google checkout should give a better
service. The charges are lower then paypal while do also do know that
not many people know about google checkout as told by Valentin.
While not really relevant but one of the things would be to network
with something like the "OLPC" project as well for they are also
having same/similar questions although there target is children,
learning, semantics, constructism and so on and so forth. There is
lots to be gained there as well as far as understanding and the issues
For e.g. I'm looking forward as to when the open80211.s draft is
ratified and can have products so I can buy a lappie (maybe OLPC
itself at that time) which is 100% free of binary blobs.
I do hope you do succeed in your fundraising activities.
