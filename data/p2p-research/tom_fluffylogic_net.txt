@_subject: [p2p-research] CatBot...and an introduction. 
Hi - I have recently joined the list having seen Michel speak in Bristol, UK and become inspired by the work of the p2p foundation - so I I am currently doing a PhD at the University of the West of England looking at the cross-over points between evolutionary theory and p2p.  The idea grows out of seeing p2p file trading technology survive attack upon attack by the music and film industry and thinking; "this seems like the mythic Hydra - when you cut off one head, two new ones grow." and then realising upon closer examination it was much more than this:  What is clearer to me now is that the opposition of the music and film industry have created a kind of 'survival of the fittest' environment for p2p technology where the more vulnerable systems get legally taken out, but less vulnerable ones - more decentralised systems - survive and produce new generations of their technology.  Ironically, the better the music and film industry have fared in the courts, the more interesting the technology this has developed.  At least that is where the thinking is now...
As part of all this, we run a project, CatBot - this is looking at the idea of building a simple to use p2p torrent system for universities and other such institutions to allow easy publishing of material to the public.  There is much more about this project here;  and there is a news mailing-list to keep up-to date with the project at; Myself and my colleague Ana also blog at plugincinema -  - a site about film and the internet, and also the subject of Ana's PhD research.  As part of this we wrote the first book looking at Internet filmmaking, which you can download for free/buy from here; Thanks for taking the time to read all this, and thanks for all the interesting links and information you all post to the list!

@_subject: [p2p-research] The Pirate Bay Trial, some feedback... 
My analysis of the Pirate Bay, based on my research thus far is at best it
will be a pyrrhic victory for the prosecution and at worse it will still
further damage them.  To elaborate, I believe that p2p follows the pattern
of evolution and any prosecution/legal change acts as a new environmental
hazard - some forms of p2p will be impacted by the change and others will
be immune and survive, then thrive in the gap left behind.  Just as
'species' is an attempt to place a classification around an always
changing pattern of life, 'copyright' is an attempt to place a legal
boundary around an always changing pattern of ideas.
There is another factor to consider that some are reporting as
significant, the drop in Swedish p2p traffic when the law changed to make
it easier to presecute individual illegal file traders
( which in an article in
the International Herald Tribune is being seen as part of a series of
victories against piracy that might mean copyright can win.  It can't. However this, like the Pirate Bay victory, is no more than an single
change to a single environmental factor and the mass of p2p will simply
evolve round it using other techniques (IM or virtual hardrives as in
S.Korea) and betters p2p software such as encrypted and dark-nets (as in

Interesting points and to add a further point to this; the idea of 'sharing without caring' also assumes that the sharers, by doing so are not benefiting the content creator. I am not sure that this can be assumed. I can see how many cases the sharing has a promotional value that would add to the wealth potential of the content creator, e.g. a band who's song are shared becoming more popular via The Pirate Bay and so selling more concert tickets, t-shirts etc. This would apply under any business model where the content creator is selling a scarcity that needs to be purchased.

I could not agree more. Some aspects of the current system (e.g. carbon trading) seek to simply turn the problem into another market and I can't see that working, however other aspects of the current system are evolving technologies, ideas, practices that will give us routes out of this mess - assuming we are smart enough to apply them.
My other worry with the idea of a grand ideological narrative that 'fixes' the problem is that espoused by philosopher John Gray who argued that all such grand '-isms' from communism to neo-conservatism are paved with roads of dead on the way to their utopian vision.

@_subject: [p2p-research] about those old android phones for 3rd world 
I think this is an excellent analysis of Google and how they operate.
I would add the other thing Google does is that allow peer interaction; we
can debate the degree to which they do (and it varies from product to
product) but over all there is often a more open approach to technology
(than their commercial competitors) and it's use, perhaps underlined by
their long term vision?
Indeed, it was the first talk I saw by Michel that opened my eyes to this
when he pointed out that Google nothing more than a service built on top
of the sum total of our (often) peer-produced interactions. (I hope I got
this right!!)
Their greater openness (than their commercial competitors) to change
allows them to ride the waves of technological evolution rather than be
battered by it.

On the subject of climate change I am finding the whole issue very depressing.  We seem to have a p2p model in operation to deny climate change as well as a p2p model in the protests for action - yet the denial/delay camp is gaining group.
It is a plus that science is being opened up with data being released etc so it is not a closed shop, but the abuse of the data by those with a regressive political agenda is very depressing.

"Heretical Thoughts about Science and Society" by Freeman Dyson
  "I am saying that the problems are grossly exaggerated."
There is a whole swath of denialism posited by Dyson - and all of it (plus other links cited) falls into the creationist 'god of the gaps' argument that goes something like; there are areas of uncertainty in climate science and it's methods/conclusions, therefore they don't know it all, therefore my argument is correct by default.  I've never seen any convincing science (not opinion) that shows that the threat is overestimated.  What is to say the the uncertainty means it is underestimated?  As the research progresses and we find out that carbon sinks are loosing their effectiveness and the impacts are happening faster that anticipated, if anything it looks like it is going to be worse than predicted.

And, in fact, that's exactly what happened with the Netflix Prize. The first "team" to break the 10% finish line, BellKor, was actually a merger of a few separate teams, allowing them to combine different pieces of different approaches to actually leap ahead. So, rather than trying to hoard the idea for themselves to claim the entire prize themselves, they realized it was better to team up to make the real

@_subject: [p2p-research] Collapse 
I am reading Jared Diamond's book Collapse: How societies choose to fail or survive.
An interesting read, which in the section on what we can do to aviod collapse there are some interesting points re commons and peers.  The points he makes are;
- If people perceived that the commons, far from being common is somebody else problem, then they won't act effectively.  But where people feel a value of the commons and know the impact, they can join an act more effectively.  So the climate, a commons, but people don't see it as such?
- Even if people know that an action (e.g. overfishing) may damage a commons, if the perception is that somebody else will do the damage if that individual does not anyway (so if fisherman A does not catch the fish worrying about overfishing, then fisherman B will), they there is a personal loss to them while there is no change in the overall health of the commons.  (I have seen examples of this issue being overcome, i.e. if a fisherman catches a pregnant lobster, it is kept alive and taken to a holding area to give birth then claimed by the fisherman, but the young are still in the commons)
- the consumption end is potentially a good force for positive action, but they would need to be unified to act - a point for peers perhaps?
Anyway, it is an interesting book!

So here in Bristol a community cinema had Feral Trade, as in the cinema got coffee from a group of farmers directly and the cinema's trust was used to validate the products as 'fair' trade.

I understood that currently there is only 40 years of Uranium left - now if we assume better technology will uncover more and use it better - but on the other hand the loss factor is that more and more countries are planning a 'dash for nuclear' which will squeeze supplies:
"However, a recent report by the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada said that there was likely to be a 45,000-tonne shortage of uranium in the next decade, largely because of growing Chinese demand for the metal. Prices for uranium have almost tripled, to about $26/lb between March 2003 and May 2005, after being stable for years."

@_subject: [p2p-research] The difference between anarchism and 
Speaking as somebody who until very recently was very involved in the UK anarchist movement, and to a large extent still share many core believes with anarchism, I agree with the proposition that centralisation is not the future. However I feel that the anarchist notion of economics has a couple of core issues that it must overcome;
- Human nature; this was always a tricky one for me as I believed once you removed oppressive hierarchies (such as the state) from human relations, we could move to mutual aid. I have had this belief knocked from two angles; First evolutionary psychology's view of in and out-group behaviour, as in how we behave towards people who we consider part of our 'in-group' and 'out-group'. There are huge differences (both positive and negative) but ultimately it makes our knowledge human interaction much more complex that 19th century theories of it supposed; humans are both co-operative and combative, irrational and logical. To quote Stephen Pinker; "As a young teenager in proudly peaceable Canada during the romantic 1960s, I was a true believer in Bakunin's anarchism. I laughed off my parents' argument that if the government ever laid down its arms all hell would break loose. Our competing predictions were put to the test at 8:00 A.M. on October 17, 1969, when the Montreal police went on strike? This decisive empirical test left my politics in tatters (and offered a foretaste of life as a scientist)."
- John Gray's work, a British philosopher, who identified a number of 'isms' as being secular branches of a religion, with a creed and a utopia at the end of a struggle. He mainly takes aim at neo-conservatism and communism in his excellent book 'Black Mass' but the belief in a heaven-like state if certain (sinful) conditions are removed, also applies to anarchism. His ultimate and most devastating charge is that all utopian political experiments leave behind a vast wreckage of human lives; the 'democratising of the middle east with the Iraq invasion, the Great leap Froward etc. - When anarchist ideas emerged a couple of hundred years ago, the function of the state in most people's lives would have been an oppressive. It enforced taxes to the rich, enforced monarchy etc, it is easy to see at this point how it's removal would have benefited most people. Now however, as we live in much more complex societies with a greater population, the state no longer has an almost entirely oppressive role. For me it offers the a national health service, and having been though a tough week when a close friend has died, the involvement of a semi-centralised system providing ambulances, emergency rooms and staff that tried unsuccessfully to save him, showed me that the solution to human relations can forgo all centralised structures.
Though I must stress that anarchism offers many, many valuable tools to help us progress; it's critique of the current system, it's enlightened struggle for equality and it's questioning of how the state monopoly on violence works - all valuable stuff!

I think that while evolutionary psychology has a way to do, it is not sufficient to dismiss either it ideas or larger narrative on the basis that it contradicts our own bias of what we'd like to be true.  There is an interesting audio of Pinker defending the position of evolutionary psychology here: Since my days doing psychology and linguistics in university, I was persuaded by the arguments of Chomsky and the rest that humans were pre-wired for language.  On that basis it seems to me that we will also be pre-wired for a number of other things - social relations included.

As a games designer, I can put a few comments in here!  First is that games are approximate simulations of reality with a crucial difference; the rules of a game are set, in reality they are fuzzy.  If we designed a game where the rules changed, the player could never learn strategies that allowed them to progress and as such they would loose interest.  In life, rules changes, logic is fuzzy so the models of strategy we build to deal with the world need to be fluid too.

I've always felt this is a major hole in capitalism; that all companies aim for monopoly, which destroys competition. In addition while competing against other companies using better products, price and services is one method to achieve this monopoly (and the one in theory companies are supposed to use), once a company reaches a certain size, other options become open to it; competing using legal and financial muscle, so 'buying' legal influence to alter the business environment to favour you and disenfranchise your competitors, buying then closing competing companies and dramatic temporarily price wars to knock the competition out of the game.
In a post-capitalist economy where much of the wealth resides in a commons; I guess it could be the commons that has the monopoly position, thereby fixing this problem?

This a point my research inter-locks with.  In essence, I'd say that yes, open source design can and often is inferior - but - and this is a huge but - because the OS design process throws many more design solutions at the problem and because it has an ongoing iterative, evolutionary structure to it (the fitests design are adopted and so developed more in general) and to the best ideas are taken further and re-designed and re-built and so on, the while OS my produce a bad design initially, once the process of evolution gets underway, better design emerges than the commercial alternative.  So compare the usability of Linux circa 2000 to windows 2000 - then compare ubuntu 2009 to windows Vista - where will ubuntu (or another) be in 10 years and where will windows be?

As the design and adaptation in the process are cumulative, all it needs is one or two developers to have a user interface 'itch' and start the development down that path.  The motivation is thus no different to the motivation to write any other aspect of OS software.  Plus the end result is not coordinated by the commons, it is selected by the commons - thus the users and developers become akin to the environmental factors in ecology; selecting the version of an operating system that is 'fitests' for their needs; which will include aspects of usability and

I broadly agree with the discussion of freedom of speech and it's abuses/limits - but what technologies like Freenet offer is the decentralisation of the decisions of what constitutes free-speech.  So in Burma, the junta decide what it is, whereas if they can't control it, then there is more of a sense of the society al large deciding by their participation/non-participate in content creation/consumption.

A really interesting post - thanks for that.  And I've also come across Moore's Law in p2p systems too:  After writing about, not the 'why' of new laws aimed at curbing piracy online, but asking about the 'if' - I was very interested to read in the current issue of MCV (556) a quote by Namco Bandai UK marketing manager David Miller;
"As a publisher, the reflex reaction is to support the [new French online piracy] legislation, but do we really still believe that it's either realistic or in the best interests of an industry (and a world for that matter) going though a genuine revolution?  I think we are becoming aware of two uncomfortable truths.  Firstly, the upsurge in the infrastructure of piracy, fuelled by Moore's Law, the ubiquity of broadband, the proliferation of peer-to-peer and torrents, increasing storage and general access and ease of use.  And secondly that Generation Y is growing up in a culture that feels differently about media consumption.  Is it right to criminalise young people for that?"

Iain M Banks's Culture would seem to fit this bill - he sci-fi writes of a hyper-advanced cosmopolitan anarchist culture of many forms of life, but the most dominant are machine AIs - self-replicating, self-deprecating machine-minds.  If you've not read his stuff I'd recommend Consider Phlebas, The Player of Games or Excession. Also Peter F Hamilton has the idea of 'Bitek' in his work - growable technology - where spaceships can be 'birthed'.  On a slight tangent you can also see the idea of post-humans where we evolve our form to create a new race adapted for life in the stars in the excellent Hyperion Cantos by Dan Simmons.

@_subject: [p2p-research] p2p in action: how about a peer book award? 
There are lots of book awards, the Booker springs to mind - so I was thinking how would a p2p book award work (and if this is a good idea, I'll turn the discussion into a post...)
I guess from a starting point we could have an award for a book about p2p
As a second there is the selection and judging process - which naturally would be done by p2p...
So here's an idea;
Criteria - fiction and non-fiction; any format ebook, PDF (though how do we judge difference between a long article and a book - and does it matter?), comics must be published or re-issued within last 12 months.
Selection - people propose books for the first round.  To pass into the second we'd take the book that are 'seconded' by the most number of people in the group.  This would give us say 5 books in each category that go forward.
Judging - then other people who have not proposed, seconded or read the finalists get a copy of the book and read them then come to a consensuses of the winner...
What do people think?

All good points and ideas - I would suggest there are 3 main aims;
1. to promote good books that have interesting p2p ideas.
2. to promote the p2p method, by using the p2p method to run the 3. to promote the p2p foundation.
So the structure of how we go about doing it is as important as doing it - so how can we have a 'competition' that produces a meaningful result in that it has peer-merit and yet is not the same popularity competition (or a 'who's in the know?' thing) as existing competitions.
Am open to suggestions....I see this, like with the arguments of restructuring money - how can we restructure a book award?

@_subject: [p2p-research] An Initial Proposal for a p2p Book Award 
So how can we merge the often top-down literary prize method with the p2p personal-recommendation approach? How would a p2p book award work? I guess from a starting point we could have an award for a book about p2p As a second there is the selection and judging process - which naturally would be done by p2p?
Starting at the start, here is what I would suggest that we could get out of the award (in order of importance):
1. To promote good books.
2. To promote good books on p2p ideas.
3. To show p2p in action via the p2p book award?s process.
4. To promote the p2p foundation.
Fist off, those who want to take part must register. We could use an existing social network to make the process easier and to guard against people using sock-puppets to skew the process.
Criteria for Inclusion
The next aspect of the process that is decided by the registered participants is the criteria for the year. We have a few broad categories; fiction, non-fiction and p2p and ask people to propose subcategories for these to narrow the field a little more.
We could, each year revise and evolve the categories from ones you might expect such as fiction and non-fiction, to the format; ebook, comics, PDF (though how do we judge difference between a long article and a book - and does it matter?) though it would seem best to keep a time-category in that the book/item in question must be published or re-issued within last 12 months.
At first people propose books for the initial round. Then at a pre-set date we?d stop taking new entries and then move to the next round. This would consist of books being ?seconded? by the most number of people in the group; hoever people who proposed a book in the first round, cannot second it. We would then take the top voted 5 books in each category that go forward.
Then other people who have not proposed, seconded or read the finalists get a copy of the book and read them then come to a consensuses of the What do people think?

Does evolution apply to technology? A couple of people have suggested it does; most recently was W Brian Arthur writing in New Scientist. I also think it does and my PhD is trying to find the evidence for this idea. We are used to seeing family trees in biology. But how about for software? I think it is possible for us to look at family tree of forms of digital media too, so have been working on a method to build phylogenetic style family trees for BitTorrent software. The method is phylogenetic style rather than based abound the idea of torrents; The key reason that this is akin to the phylogenetic method is because the linkages are based on relationships of the source code (read: DNA) and not upon the meme-layer (read:idea). A similar exercise but around the meme-layer would produce very different results. Anyway this is the beta of my research and feedback and comments on this would be welcome!

@_subject: [p2p-research] Never Mind the Policy: Can Filtering Technology Stop 
Source: There is another story in the media about the ongoing debate about what (if anything) the government should be doing in response to online piracy;
A rift has opened between music's creators and its record labels, with a broad alliance of musicians, songwriters and producers fiercely criticising the business secretary Lord Mandelson's plans to cut off the broadband connections of internet users who illegally download music.
What I find interesting about the coverage is that there is little to no discussion about if such measures are possible. By that I mean, is the technology there to accurately stop piracy ? so, assuming you had robust legislation giving a clear definition of what was to be done ? is the tech there to do it? There is no doubt that some technologies exist, but I suspect that there are serious limits to what it can achieve. For starters, any technology solution would need to have some or all of the following to be practical:
* Easy to implement ? The network ecology that this technology is coming into is dynamic, thus if the technology takes time to implement, then the conditions may have changed and rendered the tech obsolete.
* Low bandwidth ? if the process of checking all the traffic is taking too much out of the network, it is going to impact on the service that people will have paid for ? as well as penalising all users, regardless of if they are indulging in non-legitimate uses.
* Discriminatory - Able to discriminate between legitimate and non-legitimate traffic accurately. If it targets the wrong people, it is going to cost time, money and reputation for the ISPs involved.
* Decryptory ? There has been marked rise in encrypted p2p technology of late. This means that any system will need to deal with not only encrypted peers, but also encrypted packets of data.
Now those are the 'easy' points ? the obvious ones that the technology would need. From the p2p research I've been doing, I would suggest that there are a couple of other ones of note too:
* 100% Effective ? One key thing about internet ecology is that it is very, very easy for users to change p2p software. Users can also communicate virally, so can pass information on about holes in any system rapidly. The exploitation of the loop-holes will also be viral. This means a 99.9% effective system upon implementation will rapidly become a 0% one.
* Psychic ? The other issues is that once a flag goes up, there will be many, many people trying many many methods to by-pass the system. This will be continuous and will consist of lines of attack from new directions. The system implemented need to anticipate and head-off these attacks to stay in-the-game.
I am being a little provocative in the points above, but I feel they are valid. I think you see what I am saying ? stopping online piracy is very, very difficult. Some may point to the Great Firewall of China as a successful example of internet control ? forgetting that it is backed by an authoritarian state and might not be effective for all we know ? became its failings are not going to be publicised either by the government there or the users who've found a way though.

Another point never considered by those who think copyright lockdown
can be achieved by a technical fix:  sharing by "sneakernet."
People can burn copies of any CD they own and give physical copies to
their friends for the cost of a blank CD.  It's far more feasible and
less risky than the kind of photocopier samizdat that circulated in
the old USSR, and could easily play a role under corporate proprietary
information lockdown directly analogous to what samizdat played under
communist information lockdown.
Back in the pre-Internet days, the record companies complained of
people duplicating casettes for their friends--and they were
completely impotent to do anything about it.  We can do the same thing
today with CDs, with incomparably superior levels of fidelity, just as
easily.  How do those filth plan to stop that?

What if our efforts of developing communications technology followed a hidden script written by evolution?  New thinking suggests that that might just be the case.  Coming out of a PhD research project looking at networked forms of media, specifically p2p networks, this talk looks at the research findings which show a strong correlation between the cycles of technology development and evolutionary theory we normally associate with biology.  This talk looks at how generational changes in technology development fall into patterns akin to natural selection and then expands this point to help us to understand how the process of change impacts on the whole process of technology.  What impacts will that have for future development of communications technology?

@_subject: [p2p-research] shots in the dark/p2p article 
Hi - before I start I need to state I don't know a lot about the vaccine controversy.  However the article posted on the p2p looks a little like denialism - while I don't know enough about the vaccine controversy, I have been involved in long-running attempts to combat creationism and global warming denialism.  Here's a few examples of what I mean:
- Claims of wikipedia bias - you also find this constantly with creationism and global warming denialism.  In my experience there is often a narrative that when an argument goes against one side there is a temptation to blame the moderators of the platform rather then re-examine the argument itself.  That is not to say it does not happen, just to say that such claims need to be backed with evidence.  For example the wikipedia page on the foundation linked in the p2p article is also in dispute - for the opposite reasons; - Links to 'institutes' with grand sounding names - National Vaccine Information Center - sounds like an official body but it is not - it is a campaign group - nothing wrong with that except if  they are a campaign, they should be honest about it.  Again you find this all the time in global warming and creationism, e.g. Biologic Institute - sounds official but is a front campaign group for Intelligent Design.
- For example the article suggests that the mainstream view is incorrect, fine, then posts links to the debate, but the p2p article only posts links to one side and so looks less like an analysis of this issue and how it has gone viral and more like a propaganda article on this issue - which I am uncomfortable with.  My concenrn for things like this is they bleed into to well documented denialism, of which one of the most potent exposes I have read of late is Gen Goldacre on AIDS denialism...

I saw the author of the article speak at the Glastonbury festival this year - next door to the 'healing fields' - so had plenty of oppositional people in the audience - in the ensuing debate he returned to the same point over and over - that beyond the placebo effect there is not a single well designed study that offered proof of homoeopathic remedies.  In the debate plenty of studies were citied but upon examination they always lacked a good design; missing a control, tiny sample size, designed to generate a false positive etc.
Again, homoeopathic stuff is not something I know anything about, but I do think, while the peer review system has it flaws (and again the author is merciless in exposing them and medical science scams too) we have to have a method that allows us to evaluate ideas beyond personal conviction, anecdotal evidence and/or media article.  Anything else edges towards denialism; we see this in global warming denial and creationism where advocates seem to think that citing opinion polls and petitions signed by 'scientists' equates to truth.
All I am arguing for is rigour of approach and evidence .....

Actor - Taking this from Actor-Network Theory, Latour remarks that it is not so much as a term referring to a source of action, but that which is enacted upon, thus playing a role ? much like an actor on the stage. So actors are those entities that play a role within a network to help it become what it is.
Agent - An entity that is capable of having a more independent role than an Actor, is something that can enact it's own decisions - it is said to have Agency; Agency is a concept used in philosophy and sociology to refer to the capacity of an agent to act in a world.

@_subject: [p2p-research] Red Tories 
This is a write-up of an event I attended in Bristol recently. I've added this to the blog scheduled for the 6th May...
The event was a discussion around the idea of a Red Tory  (Tory being the common term for a political conservative) between the author of the book ?Red Tory?, Philip Blond  and the political philosopher John Gray .
The talk began with Philip Blond stating his position: The Red Tory position is that of economic radicalism and social conservatism. The political Left has failed the poor because individualism favoured the educated. The political right has failed because monopolised markets dis-empower people. A Red Tory is opposed to state centralisation, to looks to allow people the ability to create institutions. However if we are against state authoritarianism then we must also be against rampant individualism. The political Left and Right have both brought into individualism. Both positions oscillate between extremes of power to the state/individualism and ignore, indeed lead to the breakage of human and local relations. Blond said that religion is a force for cohesion around the shared values of the ?transcendent?. A Red Tory allows people to create institutions that are non-profit, to run services (however they could be passed to private companies
Then went to a conversation between the two?
John Gray asked the question about if Blond?s ideas were realistic to reverse not only the post-1945 Labour settlement (that established the welfare state and the National Health Service) and also the legacy of Thatcherism ?
Blond replied that this is the only way. The current methods have failed. Both the state and monopolised markets have failed so the market of groups is the only solution.
Gray then asked that if we reject current politics are we not also rejecting who we are? We are a society built on differences but with a shared tolerance.
Blond replied that too much diversity leads to atomisation. That we need shared values to stabilise us. Real liberty comes from common believes.
Gray said that Blond?s suggestion of religion is a binding concept, how would this work as Britain is a post-Christian society?
Blond replied that transcendent is about that which can?t be known so in the unknown lives diversity. Universality is in our cognition. The idea of a common good can be shared by secular world.
Gray remarked that he is confident that nothing of this program will happen. That it is just a rehash of old ideas of redistribution.
Blond countered that it will. The Tories have adopted it as policy.
Question from the audience about how the Red Tory would approach Climate Change. Blond stated the the biggest opposition to action on climate change came from the poor. He then suggested the example of individual carbon accounts for people as solution for climate change which gives the poor an asset that they have never had. Assets are true source of wealth: while recent report on inequality put income at 10:1 while asset difference is 100:1.
It is hard to see how the Red Tory would avoid the monopolised market from creeping into the the people-created institution, thus creating a new phase of privatisation in the mould that has already been shown to fail are helping the poor. In addition the opposition to action on climate change, I would contend that most opposition comes more from existing vested interests (e.g. coal, gas and oil industries) than from the poor. However the concept of the current structure of the welfare state dis-empowering people is something worth more thought.
Jonathan Raban was very scathing of the idea in a recent review of the book :
    Stripped of its obscurantist rhetoric and foggy sermonising, Red
    Tory issues a moral licence to government to free itself from the
    expensive business of dispensing social services and to dump them on
    the ?third sector? of charities, voluntary organisations,
    non-profits and the like. It won?t make Britain a more virtuous,
    civil, courteous or moral society. It certainly won?t restore us to
    that happy state of grace and comity in which, apparently, we all
    lived in medieval times.

@_subject: [p2p-research] =?windows-1252?q?What_Networks_Are_=28and_What_The?= 
I've added this to the blog to come later this month...
In Alexander R. Galloway; Exploring New Configurations of Network Politics, he suggests that the fascinations with networks that has entered into so much critical thinking is not all it?s claimed.  That networks, by definition are asymmetric constructs and those using them as tool of understanding are failing to grasp this:
"It is common to talk about networks in terms of equality, that networks bring a sense of evenhandedness to affairs. It is common to say that networks consist of relationships between peers, and that networks standardize and homogenize these relationships. It is not important to say that such characterizations are false, but rather to suggest that they obscure the reality of the situation. Networks only exist in situations of asymmetry or incongruity. If not no network would be necessary? symmetrical pairs can ?communicate,? but asymmetrical pairs must ?network.? So in addressing the question ?What can a network do?? it is important to look at what it means to be in a relationship of asymmetry, to be in a relationship of inequality, or a relationship of I?ve got to take issue with his initial definitions here:  Networks are constructions of two basic units ? nodes and links.  The number of nodes and links is a very different matter to any power accrued by the node/s or bandwidth of the link/s.  Put simply Galloway is seeing power-relations in shadows and missing ones in plain sight.  Being a Peers in a network mean having the ability to form (and break) links ? again it is not a reading of the links power/bandwidth.  If one node has many links, then it may lead us to conclude that it is a more powerful node than others, yet if that node is not a peer ? i.e. if others can form links with it, but it cannot choose to deny them ? then it?s power is illusory.  The same applies where two nodes are talking ? what is to say they are a symmetrical pair?  Nothing.  In short, networks create tendencies ? if you can create links, then the tendency is towards a less hierarchical structure.
We also see Galloway?s misinterpretation of tendencies as absolutes in his discussion of the Robustness Principe:
"The so-called ?Robustness Principle,? which comes from RFC 761 on the transmission control protocol (TCP), one of the most important political principles of distributed networks, is stated as follows: ?Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others.? This is called the Robustness Principle because if a technical system is liberal in what it accepts and conservative in what it does the technical system will be more robust over time. (But of course wouldn?t it ultimately make more sense to relabel this the Imperial Principle? Or even the Neoliberal Principle?) This indicates a second virtue of protocol: totality. As the Robustness Principle states, one must accept everything, no matter what source, sender, or destination."
The Robustness Principle is a tendency and not a command.  It does not force a node to accept everything.  Each node has the will have the capacity to interpret the principle differently ? not as they are ordered to by any protocol.  Thus the parameters of operation are set by via each node, resulting is a a tendency towards non-hierarchical structures.  Protocols are methods of intercommunication ? they are not structures of totality ? for example, a node can use them to communicate with other nodes, while adhering to different protocols within its own communication.  Protocols are structures of common agreement underpinned with practical agreement ? nodes who struggle to use a protocol will disengage from it, so reducing it?s use.  Whereas nodes that are conversant with a node will be taken up and used, so growing the network.  As such the action of the node is needed to make a protocol work ? and as such it has a tendency towards a democratic method of

The iPod began with DRM - I'd suspect pushed by the major labels before they'd agree then as the users began to get annoyed with it, there was a slow unwinding of the DRM.  Perhaps the most tacit admission that DRM was not adding value was the adding of 30cents per track to remove it:  - suggesting that DRM was lowering the cost of the experience.
So while it has died on music, it is is still very active in many other areas of Apple's business.  - again I suspect that the companies who they were dealing with demanded some kind of DRM before they got involved - which I except to see erode away over time.  Thus far with the net what happens in music has then tended to follow into other areas of media - film, games etc.

So here it is...I've scheduled it on the blog for about a week, so feedback welcome! Thanks.
The Democratising of Science: Research in the p2p age & Why the climate email hack may turn out to be a good thing
The hacking of emails written by scientists at the Climate Research Unit has produced lots of comment and copy about the efficacy of climate science and seems to have done damage to the reputations of the scientists and sciences involved. However the response to this incident ? an opening up and peering of science that should be the response to this incident, will benefit us all.
I?ve always felt that science is in essence, quite a democratic idea ? this may seem the opposite of how some perceive scientists to be; cold, logical and aloof people getting their perspective from laboratories far from the real world. When I did science (and to be fair I was not that great at it) the concept that you could do the experiments to find things out for yourself rather than simply accepting what was written in the text books was, well?punk. The scientific method has at its core some very democratic principles: First is that when something is correct ? it is so because that?s what the evidence says and this is regardless of the status of the person advocating and/or the view of society to the point being made. When Copernicus suggested that the earth rotated around the sun, it made those in power very unhappy ? but the democracy of the evidence pushes the point regardless of the discomfort of the Catholic Church. Second is that you have to back your claims with both evidence and method ? this in turn drives transparency and peer-involvement. It is the essence of peer-review; that others need to be able to see behind the curtain of your claims. This is also a democratic principle because when making claims in science you can?t rely on your position in society, your wealth or your power; you have to lay bare the foundations of your ideas for inspection and in doing to open them to challenge.
Now these are all lofty claims ? the reality is often very different. The scientific method has noble ideas and claims, yet where it meets human nature, it often gets a little lost. Scientists are very human; they can, and do, get things wrong. They can, and do, make mistakes ? and then sometimes try to cover-up those mistakes. Politics and not data can corrupt findings either by influencing the process or burying unfavourable outcomes. This is both a limitation and the main point of these democratic ideals. A limitation because it imposes by human flaws into how the system operates. The main point, because the requirement to share method and data ? to open it up to your peers ? is one of the ways we seek to iron out these flaws.
There is another process within science that is also important to understand; it?s interpretation. When I was taught science in school we were told that the idea behind the layout of an experimental write-up (abstract, introduction, method, results, conclusion etc) was structured as such so that anyone with a good grasp of language and maths could read it and understand it. Again, this is another noble and democratic ideal that often flounders in reality. Most areas of science are so complex that you need a better grounding in the specific area than the paper?s introduction may offer in order to set the correct context. The maths used in research has developed significantly since Copernicus and are the methods available require much more than basic maths to understand. As such most people outside the field rely on an interpretor to locate important findings, translate them into normal speech and summarise them in an accessible way ? this function is most often done by the media. But just as scientists are very human; they can, and do, get things wrong ? so are journalists. They can, and do, make mistakes ? and then sometimes try to cover-up those mistakes. The politics of a media outlet can and does corrupt findings either by influencing the selection of reports and interviewees or by twisting outcomes to that media outlet?s narrative into favourable shapes.
This is where the changes in communication technology come into the story. First, science now has the opportunity to add many more peers into the process; it is much easier than ever before to collaborate, exchange data and ideas and discuss methods. We can all become peers; reviewing papers, performing experiments. We can control for the problems in the complexity of the process by aggregating resources and allowing people to focus on the aspects that they are most equipped to do. An example of this is the SETI at home project ? where people can aggregate their efforts in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. There are various levels of involvement to the project from the most basic entry level of installing the software (that uses downtime of people?s computers to analyse data) to assisting with the development of the software itself (called BOINC). This is not a perfect example of a fully democratic project for a number of reasons, for example the code for BOINC is not open source and getting direct involvement with the small handful of people coordinating the project working for Berkeley is hard; but it is a start.
Second is that changes in communication technology allow much more scope for scientists to communicate without the middleman of the media. We?ve seen a proliferation of science blogging ? some amazing while others are poor ? but all allow direct communication on a level not possible a couple of decades ago. This is key, because from my experience of chatting to scientists they are not cold, logic, aloof people getting their world-view from laboratories ? but human beings who are totally engaged in the real world ? and know how messy it is. It is often the media interpretation of their work that likes to cull the complexities to make the research fit an ongoing narrative rather than report it, warts and all. Climate science is a classic example of how this is happening in practice; while those unhappy with the consensus on climate change have plenty of outlets and blogs ? so we see more and more and more of the scientists themselves weighing in to speak directly with the public. Realclimate is a great example of this, where not only do the climate scientists post articles about the latests research and news items, but they also answer people?s questions in the comments sections.
However there is a downside to this; it does mean that people will try to use the data to arrive at pre-determined positions that are unscientific. They will do this anyway and so this is a danger, yes. It means people will abuse the data and process in all sorts of horrendous ways to suit thier political agendas. This is also a danger. Yet the same peer-principles that allow this abuse are also the key to de-bunking it. Let me give an example ? the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN). This is a datset of temperature records from 1880 to the present day. It is simple to download the data and then do as you will with it. One user published a paper that purported to show that global warming was not happening as was claimed and that the adjustments made were distorting the picture - while another responded to this claim with another use of the same dataset displaying the changes applied by the scientists to the raw data in a simple graph to show how little change was going on. This graph is a simple and powerful refute to the obfuscation of the facts and is all the more powerful because it was developed independently of those who generate the data. Without this data being available and without the peer analysis of the data, the claims and counter claims lack any objective ? and verifiable objectivity to them.
What has become apparent to me in the aftermath of the hacking incident is that is that the broad response (but sadly not all) to the hacking has been to both open-up the data and source-code being used to drive climate science, but also to also force more scientists involved to spend more time engaging with people in regard their work. It is going to be harder and harder for scientists to keep data private by default ? which is good ? and I would hope we move to a position where this is both best practice and the norm.

@_subject: [p2p-research] ABSOLUTELY VERY IMPORTANT TO WATCH THIS or we... 
The top video on the list is one by Alex Jones.  I have to say I am very, very, very wary about anything he puts his name too - he is convinced there is a conspiracy by the new world order to impose world government via climate change and considers the UK conspiracy theorist David Ike a 'visionary'.  David Ike thinks giant lizards control the world.
This is not the same as saying that corporate interests are not looking to shape the net for their perceived needs - I don't doubt that all all - but that discussing such an important via via the rantings of a paranoid ultra-right-wing conspiracy theorist who has been proved wrong time and time again seems a bad way to go about it.
I thought that we were aiming for high standards of scholarship, debate and transparency - Alex Jones represents the opposite; shrill, paranoid and deceptive politics.

I've been thinking that the whole climate change thing is interesting has it moves science into a p2p realm.  Take the example of the weather station monitoring data.  Far from simply being told "this is the way it is" we are now getting the raw data released to the public domain ( which is good) so people can do with it as they will.
So some try to disprove global warming with it; While others use it to disprove the attempted disprove; (Summary of this here;  Either way, the release and use of the data into the public domain means p2p science is on the way...

They do feral trade at the local volunteer cinema in Bristol, the Cube; they do it with coffee, buying the cinema's supply of coffee direct from a small ground of Nicaraguan farmers.
Also there is a larger business, Hotel Chocolat - a retail outlet that gets all it's cocoa from one village - I wonder if that is also feral trade?

US Intelligence planned to destroy WikiLeaks
 This document is a classifed (SECRET/NOFORN) 32 page U.S.
counterintelligence investigation into WikiLeaks. ``The possibility
that current employees or moles within DoD or elsewhere in the U.S.
government are providing sensitive or classified information to
Wikileaks.org cannot be ruled out''. It concocts a plan to fatally
marginalize the organization. Since WikiLeaks uses ``trust as a
center of gravity by protecting the anonymity and identity of the
insiders, leakers or whisteblowers'', the report recommends ``The
identification, exposure, termination of employment, criminal
prosecution, legal action against current or former insiders,
leakers, or whistlblowers could potentially damage or destroy this
center of gravity and deter others considering similar actions from
using the Wikileaks.org Web site''. [As two years have passed since
the date of the report, with no WikiLeaks' source exposed, it appears
that this plan was ineffective]. As an odd justificaton for the
plan, the report claims that ``Several foreign countries including
China, Israel, North Kora, Russia, Vietnam, and Zimbabwe have
denounced or blocked access to the Wikileaks.org website''. The
report provides further justification by enumerating embarrassing
stories broken by WikiLeaks---U.S. equipment expenditure in Iraq,
probable U.S. violations of the Cemical Warfare Convention Treaty
in Iraq, the battle over the Iraqi town of Fallujah and human rights
violations at Guantanmo Bay...

A while ago I wrote about the technical difficulties of implementing any reasonable solution to stopping people from using p2p to download copyrighted material ? I notice that the French government is adopting methods very similar to that of China in an attempt to control p2p use;
"French Internet users could soon be asked to install spyware on their PCs that tracks their surfing habits and analyzes the applications installed on their machines in order to prevent file sharing piracy. Plans for this type of surveillance surfaced this week when a paper authored by the French Hadopi agency, which was put in place to police the French Internet and prevent copyright infringement as part of the country?s three strikes legislation, leaked online."
You may remember early 2009 a policy emerged in China that would require all new PC to come pre-installed with government spyware with the appropriate name of ?Green Dam? ? under the guise of protecting the youth from dubious morality. However, Professor Jonathan Zittrain, of Harvard?s Berkman Center said:
"Once you?ve got government-mandated software installed on each machine, the software has the keys to the kingdom? While the justification may be pitched as protecting children and mostly concerning pornography, once the architecture is set up it can be used for broader purposes, such as the filtering of political ideas."
Indeed. What is interesting is that it appears that there is no easy technical solution to the laws that politicians have passed ? and I can?t see how their will be, unless you can impose some very draconian system, but even then there will be ways round it. I suggest this is doomed to expensive failure ? consider the $84 million the Australian government spent developing a filter system, also to protect youth from dodgy material ? only to have a 16 year old hack it in 30 minutes.
