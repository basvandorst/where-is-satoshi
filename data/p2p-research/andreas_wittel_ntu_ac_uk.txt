@_subject: [p2p-research] Capital and Class issue 
Hi Phoebe,
I don't think that I received your first email, so this one comes a bit as a surprise to me. It seems like your plans of a Capital & Class special issue are already well developed.
I remember you mentioning this possibility at the workshop, but don't recall that there was a general agreement to have C&C as first publication choice. Also this would somehow collide with my idea to make a book with most of the contributions. No publisher would accept a book proposal with contributions that are already published somewhere else. As aleady indicated in several emails preparing the workshop my first publication choice would either be an edited book or a special issue with a well recognised journal, and we have aleady an expression of interest from TCS, which does have a much broader reach than C&C.
For this reason I am still keen on a discussion about core issues emerging from the workshop (in terms of relevance) and about issues where participants had different perspectives, standpoints, and arguments. This debate has not really started yet and after paternity leave I will sure make some comments on this. For me this debate is crucial as it will define which theme(s) should be put at the forefront of a publication.
Hope this makes sense,

Hi all
After my call for papers for the special edition emerging from our workshop on p2p production at Nottingham Trent, I have received 5 abstracts, three papers, and 2 possible inclusion statements, many thanks to all of you. If you haven't submitted one to me, please do so and I'll include you. Please include a short bibliography as well.
In the special issue I want to put the question of 'ethical economy/ies' at the forefront because I think this discussion brings up a lot of important points as well as questions regarding measurement of value, and exchange relations 'outside' of capitalism, and so far I have been given both proposals that critique, and advocate p2p as an arena for these possibilities. The proposals so far represent the discussion that is taking place more broadly and Capital and Class will be an excellent forum for this discussion.
The AGM for the journal is tomorrow and I've 'warned' them of my intention to create this special issue. I'll be in touch with you after the meeting with more details of what will be required. At this rate, the papers will not need to be very long and I'd probably make a deadline for next March or so (just something to bear in mind).
Many thanks

This is a interesting question. As I have hosted the workshop in Nottingham, I 'd like to share my experience with Nottingham Trend Uni. I asked the IT people to set up a wiki and was told that this is not possible as NTU wanted control over content. Obviously the result was a dead web site, suitable for information around the time of the conference, and dead later. I would suspect that most unis have this policy. Should Hull be more open, and open to a wiki, and willing to fund the site, then I would welcome this and take advantage of it. However if Hull has (1) similar concerns about wikis as NTU, and (2) does not fund a non-Hull website for the research group, I would follow Ryan's suggestion to set up the p2p research group without uni affiliation.
Basically we dont need uni support to set up a research group. But we do need uni support (in terms of funding) to meet for conferences and workshops.
One more thing. Ryan said ealier. On the other hand, lists of  "researchers" meaning people at academic institutions who write papers for journals seems a failed model As much as my academic heart agrees with this due to all kinds of frustrations in this world, I find this a dangerous statement as it puts universities in the realm of history. Are you really suggesting we dont need unis any more? How about newspapers? Art? Literature? Sould all this (which is under serious threat atm) be allowed to be swept away for non-insitituational knowledge work to succeed? For those interested in the relevance of history in the information age I'd recommend Alan Liu (2004), The Laws of Cool.

Basically I agree with this critique but would offer a twist. The university as secret society model is rapidly vanishing and making space for the university as business model. Where university knowledge formerly has been hidden away, it is now opening up to all kinds of so called effiencies such as auditing, quality control, usability, just in time delivery, customer service and so on. Not sure what is worse.

It seems to me that there are at least two ways institutions can be judged successful:  First, they can be viewed as survivors in an ecology.  To succeed, they need only continue.  The second way to success is in serving some purpose well.
Monolithic knowledge has few supporters these days.  So if one opts for the second and more human purpose, there needs to be a mission beyond "veritas".  Teaching does not seem to be the mission of most institutions; it is a byproduct.  Few who study teaching find universities to be particularly good at it, and teaching is rarely studied as a pursuit in universities outside of the discipline of education.  Boosting people into competencies is a plausible mission, but even there, universities are hardly efficient or effective.
I think universities had two symbiotic purposes--one to imbue students with associative identity and institutional prestige--with a byproduct of some learning, and the second, more elemental mission was to earn that prestige through "scholarship."
So the real question of the worth or failure of universities comes back, it seems to me, to the meaning of scholarship.  P2P modes exist (spontaneously?) for efficiencies of minimalizing institutional burdens--bureaucracy, identity, prestige, norms, hierachies, etc.
My condemnation of universities is in finding their definitions of scholarship to be (too often) solipsistic, removed from relevance and, more generally, exclusive.  They failed by hiding their product from transparency.  Instead, they chose to form guilds and to perfect trade secrets, normative rituals, and to act more like secret societies than service entities.
Regardless, knowledge is useful and universities contribute almost in spite of themselves.  Learned individuals do the right things--perhaps as Athina is doing--just because they embody the very desires for meaning, value and efficiency that are at the heart of the p2p ethos.  In a sense, p2p success at universities requires fighting the conventional institutional overhead  When the two blend, the academy washes out the authenticity of p2p through institutional machinery that simply can't be abandoned by most.  People need the church acoutrements that Marc suggests exist.  p2p is thus potentially lost in the very mechanics it innocently undermines.  Like water against a shore, it will bounce back and meld in because its dissolving power is very microscopic--at the level of the person...it is not aggregated to the perspective of people who view the world from institutional eyes...as land and sea.  But sometimes there are storms and rapid shifts, to extend a metaphor way too far!

Hi Ryan,
not sure if I understand your question. If you do think that universities should not be businesses (as I do) why think about examples in history that show a successful transformation from non-business to business models? Are you indicating with your question that this change of unis to corporations will ultimately fail?
The primary function of universities in one sentence? Perhaps to contribute to the production and dissemination of knowledge? Obviously there are other players emerging doing the same thing, collective intelligence etc. So there is competition, whcih has to be a good thing.
I really dont think that p2p will wash away capitalism and all institutions associated with it. I'd rather think of this in terms of mergers. Any idea what universities would look like if they would go p2p instead of business?
Sent: Mon 20/04/2009 03:00
Hi Andreas,
Here's a question...a sincere one, not a rhetorical one: Is there any institution that has, in history, internally reformed satisfactorily by adopting a business model when no such model existed from the outset?  I think of New Public Management in government/public affairs as a minimally successful (and still highly controversial) model.  I'm sure there are numerous others.  Universities, like governments, are not businesses.  Businesses exist to optimize their own survival and to control percentages of ecological carrying capacities that enrich managers and shareholders.  Governments exist to achieve stable advancement and protection of normative social values.  Universities exist to....???
One can add many predicates.  What is disturbing is that one cannot think of a defining predicate...particularly one that doesn't entail prestige and identity enhancement...thinks seemingly at odds with sharing usable assets optimally.
I contend p2p exists to simplify and optimize distribution of resources...it replaces capitalism, institutions, socialism and several other approaches that aimed to deal with distribution of resources.  p2p is a form of economics that makes the money component of value subordinate to efficient distribution with, through, or in spite of money.  Its ethos is sharing usable assets without creating persons or entities unwilling to share usable assets. It does this by minimizing overheads associated with the delivery of sharing.
Universities were p2p 1.0.  Time to envision 2.0.  No need for the institutional components.

Hi Ryan,
thanks for sharing your ideas about p2p unis, Ryan. Interesting stuff. I don't have any suggestions, just hundreds of questions about knowledge production (research) and knowledge distribution (teaching). It seems that this is an issue worth thinking about a bit longer, perhaps in the p2p research group?
Sent: Mon 20/04/2009 19:31
Hi Andreas,
I think your answer was right on the money with regard to what I was getting at...universities are unlikely to succeed by being more "business-like" because that is not their mission.
Efficiency is a reasonable objective, but is it achieved by being more business-like?  I doubt it...unless your mission is to do the things businesses do--make profits, take market share, satisfy "customers."  A student isn't a customer--just ask any teacher, and if education is a product, so then is a degree.  Things earned are not sold to the earner.  This is far more than a game of semantics; it speaks to organizational aptness for a given mission.
Universities drive themselves to extinction by becoming businesses.  They are increasingly irrelevant that way with products and strategies that corrode and disintegrate.  By being more p2p, they could slip away from institutional rot, and become far more conceptual...and more powerful.
I do disagree whether p2p is going to wither away capitalism; I think it might.  Here's why.  Capitalism requires a debt-based economy--that was Keynes' insight really--the difference between how he saw the creation of money versus the classical economists.  To achieve a debt economy, you need investments in capital that can support future cash flows.  Now in the case of p2p, I think such investments are far fewer and declining.  It is fairly easy to fragment industrial production into the world Kevin describes in some of his writings...
Most p2p firms--an intermediate animal in my view--exist by leveraging investment in knowledge creation--what you say is a plausible mission of universities.  Google, for instance, or Craig's List or Ebay...all p2p to one extent or another.  Facilitating p2p is not a likely long-term facility for garnering cash flows because efficiencies of knowledge arise.  That is why Microsoft is starting to die...they didn't anticipate cloud computing and more p2p models like the evolution of Linux.
Institutions were efficient by enabling norms (like how to write a dissertation) or by exercising bureaucracies.  Neither of those is very efficient in a p2p world.  So the same sort of institutional melt so many of us (Michel and Kevin notably, but also panarchists, knowledge management gurus and e-learning folks who dominate the blogosphere of knowledge work) Universities have a choice.  They can become more p2p--and some are--or they can die like the institutional dinosaurs they have become.  What would a p2p university look like?  It would have open degree validation (like Wales) or some of the Open/Free Universities, it would implement peer-reviewed degrees for research, it would commit to use and produce open ideas that are not bound in paid journals or behind high-tuition walls.  It would dissolve its barriers to entry and to scholarship--working instead to facilitate fellows and associates more than tenured faculty.  It would cast a cold eye on formalism in scholarship in general, and in identity-building scholarship in particular.  Public access, service learning, learner-centered models and use of social media would far outstrip classrooms, halls, buildings and walls--both physical and mental.  It would have research in distant lands and partnerships with facilities around the world interlinked by electronic nets.  It would grant status and prestige to a Clay Shirky, Harold Jarche or many similar net-based scholars as quickly as it would to a nose-to-the-grindstone assistant professor who publishes some trash in the Journal of Mumble Mumble and gets an editorship on the equally esoteric (and closed) Journal of TweedleDee.  Harsh, but the reality is, most of us have stopped listening...and being heard is the p2p currency...as it is the currency of all thinking.
I believe even in science the tinkerers and DiY guys are coming on strong--in bioinformatics, genetics, robotics, transhumanism.  Soon perhaps they will be there in medicine and physics.  Long ago the best social science moved out of the academy.

Ryan says: Under what circumstances could we envision systematic collapse of universities on a large scale?  And if we cannot imagine them not existing, what is it about them that gives them such heroic sustainability?  Good question Ryan. I think we need to separate issue of education from the purchase of a degree programme. I'm looking at this with a fairly cold eye. this is my experience as lectuer in a BA Media degree programme. The vast majority all students don't give a damn about education anymore. They are only interested in the marks of their asessments, and in improving these marks. They only care about the final degree and the results they get.
The instrumentality of knowledge delivery started by unis has sure spread to students. Now everybody is instrumental about it. To put it provocatively: there is no other institution around that can sell degrees. For unis to disapprear the degree culture would have to disappear first. I can't see that happening. Its not a heroic sustainability, but a pretty strong one.

I doubt my own expertise, categorically.  But lets spin the tables.  Under what circumstances could we envision systematic collapse of universities on a large scale?  And if we cannot imagine them not existing, what is it about them that gives them such heroic sustainability?  In short, what model of higher education is sustainable?
I imagine a market model failure is the only thing that could endanger the system.  That means the economics of earning university credentials must be undermined and research budgets would need to have a sustained period of decline.
If Hakim Bey's idea of universities as research monasteries was to ensue, then the teaching side would need to fail financially.  What is certainly true is that the cost of college has exceeded the inflation rate in growth for a number of years.  That seems unsustainable, obviously.  My scenario would be that large numbers of the middle classes who entered the academy in the 1950s and especially the 1960s might be priced out.  That could happen during this financial downturn.  Student debt growth is enormous.
Under such scenarios, it would be hard to show increases in research funding which has been also growing steadily in recent years (in the US).  Politically, universities would be perceived as elites and no amount of athletic boosting would likely turn that tide.
State budgets in the US will be crushed for at least five years--possibly a decade or even two.  That will pressure endowments as will market investment losses and low bond rates.
If universities reach a point were they are not economic engines for localities...based on trims along the edges, they will lose that element of support as well.  That would be the last straw I'd think, because it is a great deal to have a university concentrating cash in your town.
So, you might ask can universities cut costs, keep relevant research, finesse state funding, fend off e-learning and open validation threats and still deliver a product.  I sort of doubt it.  I'd guess it isn't sustainable.
First faculties will grow top-heavy as the big grant earners hang on for long careers and few replacement slots can be freed up.  Next, market innovations will clip market share both in research and degree earnings.  No amount of certificates and non-degree programs will offset this in my opinion.  Life long learning doesn't fit the university model all that well.
Part of market innovations will be p2p education and research facilities.  It is already occurring albeit not at a 2020 threat rate.
Still, it is easier to envision higher ed collapse than healthcare collapse, and no few people are predicting the latter.  The trends are similar and often interrelated.

This could be an opportunity to develop a vision for the future of universities, something which could be considered to be a position associated with the p2p foundation. Is there some interest for collaboration? Andreas THIRD WORLD UNIVERSITIES FORUM Davos, Switzerland     9-11 January 2010           Inspired partly by the success of World Economic Forum in hosting global conversations about emerging issues of economic policy, the World Universities Forum (WUF) was created in 2008 in the belief that academe must better engage today's most crucial questions, and that higher education itself must be included as part of the wider discussion of global change.  The Forum encourages the participation of university executives, administrators, scholars and research students, as well as journalists, policy makers, business and political leaders, and others who understand that the importance of the university extends well beyond campus. While WUF encourages conversations about all aspects of higher education policy and practice, the keynotes for the third WUF have been invited to consider issues of the current global economic crisis and its implications for universities.
Keynote speakers include: * Professor Eva Egron-Polak (International Association of Universities, France)     * Professor Jonathan Jansen (Rector, University of the Free State, South Africa)     * Professor Simon Marginson (University of Melbourne, Australia)     * Professor Nigel Thrift (Vice Chancellor, University of Warwick, UK)     * Professor Pandhyala B.G. Tilak (National University of Educational Planning & Administration, India)     In addition, the Forum will also include numerous paper, workshop and colloquium presentations. We would particularly like to invite you to respond to the Forum Call-for-Papers. Presenters may choose to submit written papers for publication in the refereed Journal of the World Universities Forum. If you are unable to attend the Forum in person, virtual registrations are also available which allow you to submit a paper for review and possible publication in the Journal, and provide access to the online edition of the Journal.
Whether you are a virtual or in-person presenter at this Conference, we also encourage you to present on the Conference YouTube Channel. Please select the Online Sessions link on the Conference website for further details.
The deadline for the next round in the call for papers (a title and short abstract) is 14 May 2009.  Future deadlines will be announced on the Forum website after this date.  Proposals are reviewed within two weeks of submission. Full details of the Forum, including an online proposal submission form, may be found at the Forum website -   .

This is perhaps the most interesting approach to understand the crisis of capitalsim I have come across.  Rick Wolff says it's not a financial crisis, the core problem is not money, interest, speculation etc.. It is also not about neoliberalism and deregulation of markets, the core of the problem is the classical Marxist take of the tensions between owners of means of production and workers.
All very well explained. I am not an economist, but the analysis is convincing.

Kevin, I agree with your first comment about the problem of mischaracterising the views of others, that is why I explained that there never was a general equation of anti-finance with anti-semitism. This is the point I wanted to make. The radical German left in the 80s and 90s sure had many flaws, but it didn't get that silly.
You then continue and write about 'descriptions of objective reality' and 'Inaccurate perceptions of reality'  and then you bring in this email the Nazi-numbers-example. The point with reality is that it is always subjective, there is no objective decription. One doesn't have to be a social constructivist to ackknoeldge that different people see and experience different realities.
Furthermore, reactions to injustice are always moral reactions, and moral reactions cannot be measured in terms of numbers or other forms of accuracy. In my view severe forms of injustice should produce severe reactions. I'd prefer this to moderate reactions (e.g. this is how the UK deals with its colobial past, which is pretty disguting to say the least). The attempt of the radical (Anti-german) German left to bring to light and then attack all forms of anti-semitism (and get it wrong sometimes) was not some mad overreaction, but a moral necessity.

Hi Michel,
this is probably the wrong place to discuss the history of left
movements in certain countries and I don't have a theory that can
explain why there were cases where the German radical left got it wrong.
I simply object that your method of using one quote and then making
generalisations is particularly helpful. IMO the German radical left
becomes unfairly discredited in this version.
If I remember this right, the debate between you and Stefan started with
a disagreement about the relationship between the financial markets and
the general economies, with a disagreement whether this is a financial
crisis or a crisis of capitalism. For me this is THE most important
issue at the moment, and I will post a few comments on this in the next
few days when I've got a bit more time.

@_subject: [p2p-research] labour, capital and p2p 
This is an attempt to revive the debate without using the poisonous apple tree metaphor any longer. Let's start instead with the sun and earth example used by Christian. In his reply Michel says:
'This means that the financial and monetary systems have a real relative autonomy and a real influence on behaviour and choices. If this is true then financial and monetary regulations and design make a difference, both in observable reality and in the unseen structural rules.'
I would argue that this is what we all thought before the crash. We all thought that financial markets are (1) relatively autonomous from the realm of real production, and (2) anyway much more powerful than real production.
But the financial markets crashed and suddenly it becomes clear that both, their strength and their autonomy was a bit of an illusion, similar to the idea of the sun turning around the earth. Financial markets proved to be unsustainable on their own. In order to avoid the collapse of global finance, taxpayer's money is needed. Suddenly capital seems to be very dependent on labour.
The question is how this illusion has been created. In my view Richard Wolff comes up with a convincing explanation.   For those who don't want to see the full video, this is what Wolff says in a nutshell (focusing on the US but this would also be true for large parts of Europe): This crisis did not start with banking, but with something else. From the 1820s until the 1970s the workers enjoyed a rising standard of living, meaning: rising real wages. For these 150 years the growth of productivity corresponded with the rising level of real wages. This changed in the early 1970's, when a steadily increasing gap opened between these two graphs. Real wages stopped rising, while productivity continued to rise. Consequently workers had to borrow money and accumulate debts. The workers were given loans. For business however the last few decades have been like paradise. The gap between rising productivity and stagnating wages created spectacular profits. These profits were the precondition for financial markets becoming increasingly powerful. At some point interests from loans became financially more productive than the production of commodities, and so on.
If we accept this story, we have to conclude that the increasing domination and independence of the financial market has one main cause: the exploitation of labour power. So why tinkering at the edges of a monetary system, why creating new ones? How could new monetary systems stop or even diminish the exploitation of labour power? If they can't, why bother? Of course I am not suggesting that work towards a new monetary system should be abandoned in the p2p community. I just don't see the point. I would like to focus my inquiries on the question how the p2p community can contribute to a fairer system of monetary exchange for labour (= value)
I don't have any ideas at the moment (or better, I have abstract ideas, e.g. basic income for everybody, e.g. ownership of organisations by the workers and not the shareholders, but don't have a clue how to work towards realising these ideas). I hope that other people in this list have a lot to say about this.
To be completely honest, I have some doubts that this goal (a fairer system of exchange) can actually be tackled in the p2p world alone. Open source and p2p communities have achieved mind-blowing results, but so far these are limited to non-rival goods (the digital stuff, software, music, ideas, news and so on). These achievements have been possible because open-source and p2p communities were able to operate largely outside the economy. Two reasons for this: (1) the means of production and distribution for non-rival or digital goods are available to many. (2) So all that is needed to produce and distribute digital things is the value of labour (Marco I know you disagree, I am merely simplifying this to illustrate the difference with material things). Open source and p2p communities are full of enthusiasts who are willing to contribute with their labour to the changes we have experienced, social changes, economic changes, political changes. This labour mostly is free labour.
But how far can we go with free labour? As soon as it comes to the housing market, we can't do open source and p2p any more. We need to approach banks and ask for loans and live with debt and pay them back. I am not really sure where I am going with this: For me open-source and p2p represents a new form of resistance, a very constructive resistance, one that is not any more defined by public protests, and banners, and strike and opposition lone, but simply by doing things without asking anyone for permission and thus changing the world. (This would be my contribution to Ryan's p2p manifesto). But, as said above, this mostly refers to non-rival goods. A fairer exchange system for labour power, I believe, cannot be achieved with a new piece of software and a p2p community of several hundred (or even thousand) enthusiasts that uses this new software tool. For this to happen we need to develop strategies which are aimed at societies at large. Actually this comes across far too opinionated. It really is a question.

Hi Michel, thanks for this reply, I agree with many things obviously, but do have some questions and need some clarifications. I have not read Carlota Perez, it is on my to-do-list, and your introduction to her work makes a lot of sense to me.
Maybe it is not important if the dominance and relative autonomy of the financial markets was an illusion or a reality for the last 4 decades that has come to end but could be resumed sooner rather than later. Basically we all agree (I would suppose) that this relative autonomy of the financial markets is a very bad thing. So how can we prevent this? My answer at the moment: by establishing a fairer system for the value of  labour on a global scale. I have a huge amount of respect for Obama, but he does not seem to willing to engage with this issue at all. And if he doesn't, nobody else of those in political power will do so.
You say: 'But the point is that the specific way that the financial, and money systems, are organized and designed, is crucial for the way the production system is organized. If we want to  have a more 'fair' labour system, even within capitalism, we need to tackle the financial system.'
This is a point I don't understand. How can new financial and monetary systems (do you make a distinction between financial and monetary?) lead to a closing of the ever increasing gap between the rich and poor? And what would these strategies look like? And how could these 'small and emerging' p2p strategies compete with the hegemonic financial system in place? Sent: Fri 15/05/2009 04:24
(Hi Andrea (Fumagalli), I was wondering if you could forward a copy of this discussion to the 2 russian authors, as they might find if of interest how their analysis inspires our own community)
Hi Andreas (Wittel),
Let me first say that I completely agree with your analysis. Of course the financial system is rooted in the exploitation of labour, it is a specific way of extracting value from it. That's actually what relative (not absolute) autonomy means, that it is interlocked in a complex feedback loop with the other sectors. But the point is that the specific way that the financial, and money systems, are organized and designed, is crucial for the way the production system is organized. If we want to  have a more 'fair' labour system, even within capitalism, we need to tackle the financial system. (not alone of course, as part of an integrative strategy)
I'm not sure how familiar you are with my own take on the different cycles of capitalist development, but I recently updated my insights after reading the following, i.e. one of the essays in the journal I sent you yesterday, and which I already commented upon here, see The essay is:
Badalian L., Krivorotov V., "Technological shift and the rise of a new finance system  : the market-pendulum model", European Journal of Economic and Social Systems, Vol. 21, No. 2, 2008, p. 231-264.
And here are my own thoughts, on how 'p2p' is connected with such a transition to a new wave of development:
The authors continue the work on understanding 'long waves', pioneered by Kondratieff, continued by Schumpeter and recently summarized and updated by Carlota Perez.
The important thing is this, every long wave of appr. 50-60 years has been based on a combination of 1) a new form of energy the UK domination = coal, the US domination is oil); 2) some radical technological innovations; and 3) a new 'hyperproductive' way to 'exploit the territory'; and 4) an appropriate financial system. An important insight in the latter, is that what enables growth in a first phase, becomes an unproductive burden in the second declining phase of the wave.
Each wave has been dominated by a particular great power as well. And each wave ends with a Systemic Sudden Stop (3S), like the one we are in now. (and, each transition needed a war, as this seems impossible today, it will probably the global struggle against the climate change catastrophes that will mobilize the global energies).
So we have to think, what new combination is in the works now.
For energy, in the context of Peak Oil, it can only be renewable energies, like solar and wind etc... New technologies: essentially it will be based on the global internetworking, augmented by what it enables (bio, nano, etc..). That much is clear, but then the question is: how can we more efficiently 'exploit the territory'.
What we will loose in terms of 'gross power' that we had with oil, will have to be compensated by IT-generated greater precision, in the application of that power, once we  have renewables. In other words, the engine of growth will be the systematic integration of artificial and human intelligence in our productive activities.
They also say that a post-3S transition, the cost of the transition is to high for the market and requires state intervention.
So now my take on this. What global internetworking enables is open and global design communities. This means that information is no longer physically constrained, but can flow 'anywhere', and this is crucial, be used by local communities. Second, the same technological developments lead to more precision manufacturing, that can be done in a distributed fashion. This means again, that the cost of capital is dramatically declining and becomes affordable for the 'periphery. Again this empowers local communities. Finally on the energy level, distributed energy machinery can also empower the local communities. And finally there is the new financial system, and here is where the peer money movements come in, to create flows of financing right where they are needed, and not just in the unproductive casino capitalism that enriched the current oligarchy.
Each long wave is also marked by a changing of the guard in the kind of institutions and the kind of ruling elite.
Each wave was also based on more inclusion, for example the integration of labour in the Fordist system was much broader than in the 19th Smithian system, BUT, in the declining phase, the social contract breaks down and this is what Richard Wolff described as what happened under the neoliberal financial system.
- renewable distributed energy
- distributed manufacturing (linked to much more distributed ownership modes)
- an organic farming revolution based on high info input instead of high petrochemical input
- new stakeholder oriented global institutions
- a new elite of netarchical capitalists
- a new social contract based on broader inclusivity that will be beneficial to global open design communities
- a new financial system, based on a redesign of the monetary system, a diversity of localized and affinity-based community currencies,  a new credit commons and hopefully: a basic income (nobody by the way is suggesting 'tinkering' on that level, it needs a radical reformation)
- a geographic shift to the periphery, i.e. East Asia as the newly dominant power of the next ascending wave
Many of the above things are strongly related to what we talk about under the name of 'p2p' or distribution. I don't expect this to be dominant, but I expect that the new social contract will have to accept a major upgrade of inclusion to achieve its hyperproductive aims, while in a later stage, a phase transition may occur to a fuller p2p regime.
A crucial aspect is the combination of global open design and knowledge communities, to the more distributed modes of precision manufacturing, which because of their more distributed aspects (much lower capital requirements), are favourable to the self-aggregation of smaller businesses, which could be organized on a new basis (cooperatives, solidarity economics, etc...).
But can all this be tackled by 'p2p alone'? and you doubt rightfully that this can be done.
I think it needs a combination of three movements:
- the specific p2p movement for open and free exchange of innovation (tackling artificial scarcity in innovation)
- the environmental movement, tackling the negative externalities creating biospheric destruction
- the social justice movement (labour, agricultural, knowledge workers and precariat), fighting for inclusion
It is the combination of these 3 social movements, and their mutual interpenetration and infusion, which can have the necessary force to obtain  change and a new more favourable and inclusionary social contract, in combination with the efforts of the netarchical capitalists. This sector of capital is both friend and foe, depending on specific contexts, but I would suggest that such an alliance is crucial for success. They are going to be at the core of the next 'accumulation engine' (the concept used by the authors above to denote the full integrated system).
These 3 movements need each other, and need to be fused in one global effort. They can't win without p2p, and 'p2p' can't win without them.
None of the above is automatic, and the transition to a new ascending phase is complicated by the global energy and climate crisis, but it has a realistic chance of being achieved, which also depends on us, as the p2p meme is a crucial variable in the success of that transition.

Hi Marco,
thanks for making me aware of POCLAD. I have not heard of this inititiative before, it sounds very interesting, similar to the core critique of 'The Coproration'. I would agree that corporations (or some of them) are too powerful, however this would not be my main concern. The core concern is that the power in large corporations resides in the hands of few people, the power to make decisions about future strategies, and the power to distribute the profits among those who work for the corporation.

I confess that I too, sometimes (out of highly unscientific gut
feeling and almost nothing else) fail to see the point in working on
some theories. That's why I usually just sit quietly in a corner when
these discussions happen, trying to learn something interesting. I'll
take advantage of this comment from you, and from these doubts, which
I also share:
to ask all members of this list something I have wanted to investigate
better for years, since the first time I encountered it online. What
do you think of the POCLAD proposals ( as a way to
arrive to a "fairer system of exchange", as Andreas calls it?
Simplifying a lot, what they say, or so I understand, is that if
everybody focused on asking on abolition of corporate personhood
privileges, many of the problems you're trying to solve via new
monetary systems and so on or would either disappear or become of a
much smaller size.
The advantage I see in such an approach is that is something that (as
unreal as may seems) may very well be simpler and faster to achieve
than basic income, p2p money and so on, and in any case could make
transitioning to those other schemes much simpler. Above all, those
proposals have a huge practical advantage alternative monetary systems
etc... they're very, very easy to explain to everybody, including
people with very poor education. They're much easier to gather popular
support for. As Einstein put it "everything should be made as simple
as possible, but not simpler".
Does it make any sense? Please explain gently :-) , I'm just a newbie
on these issue.
Changing argument now:
:-) no problem, really, I understand why you're saying it. Still, I
have something to say about this:
"over 70% of all kernel development is demonstrably done by developers
who are being paid for their work... The Linux kernel, then, is
largely the product of professionals, not volunteers".
the same is true for Mozilla/Firefox, OpenOffice...
Just a few days ago, I found this comment on slashdot:
"there's also an awful lot of good free software too" - "No, there
isn't. There is a minuscule amount of good free software. Especially
when compared to the total amount of free software. The good/bad
software ratio is heavily in favor of commercial software."
I do not really agree with that comment, but it is a fact that a not
negligible amount of flagship FOSS (the "good free software") is and
above all **remains** "flagship" quality exactly because someone,
somehow, stepped in and regularly brings in enough money to sustain
full time, well paid work.
Replace "exchange system for labour power" with "society", and I fully
agree. That's why I was really fascinated by the POCLAD proposals and
really want to study them in detail some time: maybe they're wrong or
ineffectual, but they're sure damn easy to explain or sum up on
protest signs and T-shirts :-)

There are many terms in Greek and Latin vocabulary which are still relevant today. So what is the problem with this? Yes, trems like capital and labour are probably not part of most people's worlds, and actually they never have been. They remained in the realm of concept/model/theory. That is not great. But that is not really the point.
I have used these terms to describe a widening gap between the rich and the poor. Most people who dont use these these terms still worry about this development. The terms might be old, the problem is contemporary. Would you agree that this increasing gap of inequality is a serious problem, Ryan?
Also, I really don't think that the left is unaware of how knowledge changes the game, all the debates on immaterial labour show that knowledge is today's battleground. But this does not mean that knowledge operates outside of capital and labour. Let's not talk about terms, let's talk about the organisation of production (and knowledge production) in capitalism

I believe the seemingly absurd idealism of the European left is useful to the world.  Whether it leads anywhere or just gives fodder to the right that the left is silly remains to be seen in the voting booths. But my own interpretation is that it is useful for pushing collaborative, open inquiry types (I hope like myself) to further question and reflect on their own equivocations.  Most of the discussions seem better set in 1880 than 2009.  Terms like "capital" "labor" "management" seem to me to belong with terms like "steam engine" "railroad" and "factory."  They aren't even seriously part of most people's worlds.  The battlefield today is the mind.  Can its produce be free?  Can there be justice in allocating knowledge and the expansion of knowledge?  Who wins when knowledge is expanded?  Knowledge isn't a conventional capital like a gear or machine tool.  It is very different.  The left seems unaware of that.  Is there a left that open to post-capital social arrangements?  Or maybe I'm it.

Ryan, the intensification of income differences is not something that happened in the 19th century, but in the last four decades.
Are you suggesting, that knowledge and information-driven production will somehow undo this development? If so, how would you explain the following parallel: Exactly at that moment when information and knowledge became the motor for economic development (from the 1970s onwards), the gap in income differences opened up significantly.

As I understand it, capitalism is the accumulation of capital to control means of production.  Who or what does that now?  Name five "capitalists" who matter.  Most either parlayed intellectual property rights into fortunes, or they invested in large financial engineering schemes where debt was the leverage to create huge cash flows.    Very few successful firms actually produce things with capital--that is all in China and Eastern Europe and such places.  Like I said, it is like discussing the 19th century.  Not sure what world this is that people are discussing, but it isn't the one I live or work in.

Hi Ryan, now things are going a bit funny. Of course technology does not cause inequality. If you reread my first email you will notice that I did not talk about technology at all. I was using this parallel in my last email to argue that technology in itself is unlikely to undo inquality. As you were not very specific in your last emails what it is you object to I was trying to figure it out and came up with 2 messages: First message: Inequality will be overcome information technologies. On this I disagree. Second message: There is nothing wrong with inquality. Reading this email from you ('If you hate inquality') I assume now that you dont hate it.
Fine by me, we have different values here. But there is no need to start a rant against Marxism just because someone sees inequality as a severe problem and uses Marxist terms to explain the problem. I really dont to want to talk to you about Marxism as this just can't turn into a productive conversation. Let's just leave this please.
Let's talk about p2p instead. You see p2p as an alternative to capitalism and socialism. You like practice and dislike theory. P2P stands for practice, for doing things. A specific form of practice (collaborative, inclusive, distributed, constructive). I have a lot of admiration for this, but wonder (as I did in my first email) how far this mode of production (oh dear, another Marxist term, sorry) can reach. And if we consider a famous football star who earns in a day what a cleaner/small shopkeeper/nurse etc. earns in a year, I would assume that p2p systems and p2p modes would neither reach the football star nor the nurse. Should this be correct, then there are limits in the reach of p2p production, and due to these limits p2p cannot replace economic systems at large.

So the argument goes that technology caused inequality?  How about the rise of graduate management education?  Or the rise of statistics tracked by compensation consulting firms?  My own view is that the real reason that income inequality has increased is that the "understanding" of value in processes changed.  We have lawyers, accountants and management professionals pointing out value contribution and negotiating who is actually contributing value in processes--and it generally isn't the exploited worker who is easily replaced by someone in a poorer country.  That wasn't capitalism...it was professionalism in management, marketing, law and accounting.  Social norms against high pay for managers fell for numerous complex reasons--mostly based on new management value theories.  And there was an argument that capitalists ought NOT to be the winners--shareholders who paid for their shares didn't do that great compared to managers who made options to purchase cheap stock and took away big salaries.  Take professional sports where in the 1950s players barely made a living.  Now they are lavished in tens of millions of dollars...at the behest of their own collective bargaining actions.  Owners lose money and own teams for prestige and fun.  Where is the capitalism there?  The story is complex and to frame it is rather simplistic Marxian terms isn't helpful in my view; it is just absurd and loses credibility amongst anyone who actually deals with global business and production systems.  Marx was incredibly wrong.  His ideas have been a source for endless misery.  Invoking him is a source of lost credibility for the left that wants some vague utopian state that neither makes any sense nor is it even remotely feasible.  The discussion here is about voluntary participation in lives of contribution, service, balance and tension--not some utopian rubbish that has been tried, failed, rejected and justifiably now ignored by the masses.  If you hate inequality, spread education, advance normative values of sharing, responsibility and trust.  Work for microcredit systems (which charge interest) and which work incredibly well.  To say otherwise is sheer ignorance--like arguing with people who think God is touching their daily lives--there really isn't anything to say to that level of nihilism and anti-truth.  If you want to understand development economics, read Bill Easterly and others who know that you can't do big things through big governments or big NGOs which will go corrupt and that development works when people are free, empowered, taught to build their own systems and to not rely on help from above.  The answers come from the grass roots--not in organizing vast labor or governmental systems that go corrupt, but in their organizing themselves into small sustainable processes and systems that advance P2P opportunities.  That's what P2P is about.  It isn't anti-capitalist.  It isn't pro-socialist. It is pro living sensibly.  That doesn't have any systematic economic philosophy.   It is inherently anti-system...anti hierarchy.  That's why we keep coming back to anarchist mutualist histories--like Proudhon, like Streeter, like the LETSI people in a much more modern and viable sense than Proudhon ever was.  With technology, those systems can lead to happy, reasonably fair and reasonably sustainable lives--and should.  If you want a mantra to align your life to, then I propose that we don't organize hierarchies, we should rather organize modes of sharing...P2P.
And, to my mind, spare us the silly Marxian critiques (interest is inherently evil?--just absurd) which are unworthy of further discussion because they will never happen and shouldn't happen.     Ryan Lanham

Hi Michel,
this four-tiered currency system sounds terribly complicated. My first reaction: not very practical. Most people I know would cry out in pain if they'd been forced to deal with currencies simultaneously. Rather than simplifying exchange this would go in the opposite direction. It would force us to endlessly translate between these currencies, it would put our minds to stuff that nobody I know really wants to think about. The main reason why most people in Europe welcomed the Euro was not an economic reason. It just made their life easier, especially travelling across boarders.
Woergl: well, yes it worked. However it worked for one year only, and these were different times. Would it still work in a globalised world? Possibly. However I see one big problem. A circulation charge would not change anything, as those 10% of the population who own about 50% of all wealth are just unlikely to join these alternative local currency systems. Why should they? If they dont, the whole exercise is a bit pointless in my view.
I fully agree with the question that Stan raises:
if we don't have equitable ownership norms or standards or laws
or rights, why would we expect money or finance to be fair?  How could
we even tell if it was?

Hi Andreas,
This is a complex issue, but I follow Bernard Lietaer's lead who proposes a four-tiered strategy, that includes the global, the regional, the national and the local level. See On the local (and internet affinity level, which is global), we can institute local currencies like the Worgl, which have shown substantial results in reviving local economies, and can follow different rules than mainstream bank-debt money, see  A circulation charge, also proposed by ATTAC (Tobin Tax) and neo-marxists such as Yann Moulier-Boutang, would substantially slow down 'hot money' and make it less interesting to invest in the speculative economy, and could free a major part of the tax burden on workers (boutang has calculated that a minuscule circulation tax on financial flows would already replace the totality of the income tax needs in France). Don't forget that it is essentially capital circulation of hot money (capital flight) which has made social policies impossible in the last 30 years. Breaking hot speculative money is therefore a very important, strategic, part, of any pro-labour policy. Think also about Obama's fundraising, showing how more inclusionary financing, outcompeted traditional funding, to show the power and possibilities of 'social money' approaches. A socially engaged social lending scheme, or credit commons, could direct money in entirely different ways than current banking priorities. Or look at sovereign wealth funds, which unlike multinational bank money, favours public goods and social goals. The more we can strategically integrate financial and monetary reforms, the more we can diminish the power of finance capital, and favour labour. Today, if labour strikes for better conditions, capital simply moves out seeking better conditions for itself, but if you diminish that capaticity, that one-sided fluidity, you change the balance of forces. Labour still needs to fight on many other fronts, but it can do so in much better circumstances.
I think there is indeed a difference between the financial system and 'money as such'. For example, Obama's measures for the transparency of hedge funds, or tax heavens, does not touch the logic of money as such, only offers new rules for existing money. But the Worgl shiling and the hundreds of contemporary alternatives, change the very functioning of money.
The logic is simple. If you have compound interest (and usury levels), accumulation is favoured, as it becomes interesting to hoard money, which invites short term planning and speculation. Interest is a tax from the borrowers to the lenders, from the poor to the rich.  But with a circulation charge, or demurrage, hoarding money is expensive, therefore discouraging speculation, and stimulating everyone to invest in the productive economy. See for example the high medieval renaissance which used such money and could invest, through the crowdfunding of the time, in Gothic cathedrals which took decades to build. This high growth of 3 centuries collapsed when the kings introduced central currencies after the defeat of the Cathar rebellion.
Now, I'm very well aware that if we are too weak to tackle the macro-system, i.e. your hegemonic system, we are missing crucial power, but that is why we also have to start at the local scale, and internetwork to scale globally, until we are strong enough to tackle the global system. Now of course, if a global movement emerges which can tackle the global system, so much the better, but we would still need to cover the local needs.

Hi Marco,
On a related note, I wonder if collective ownership can ever really
work or if it makes sense at all unless an organization is quite
small, surely much smaller than todays multinationals.
Ownership is good when it corresponds to real possibilities for every
owner to make informed decisions and real possibilities to make things
better with your own work, otherwise it may be more hassles than
advantages. Both conditions are very hard to achieve for everybody in
a big company.
I completely agree that it is difficult to establish a real collective in big companies. There is no plan on the table how this would work, and I suppose we'd see many failed attempts before a model evolves which might work. However what intrigues me about this strategy is that it would be bottom-up, it would be about emergence, and in this this respect, it would be similar to opensource and p2p worlds.
The only alternative to this is the basic income idea, in a way a very beautiful idea. But it has one downside. It owuld involve the state to sort this out. It would be top-down, and actually I don't think that one state alone could afford to go ahead with this in a globalised economy. It would open a can of worms, as all sorts of differentiations would need to be introduced (e.g. life in rural areas is less expensive than life in urban spaces etc etc.)
POCLAD's suggestions (limited life span for companies, size regulations, laws against the purchase of companies) are all strategies that need to be implemented on the state level, this makes me quite sceptical.
Top down had its days in my view. Time to give emergence a chance.

I did not mean 'you' but the 'hypothetical you', i.e. everyone or most people. We all have limits! even the insane among us have limits (which they've probably surpassed and, hence, the insanity)
But I do think that efficiency (of a given decision making process, e.g. in economics) can be synonymous sometimes with scarcity of alternatives... since the number of solutions in the search space or the breadth of the search space is inversely proportional to efficiency of finding the right/optimal solution (for the given constraints)
So I do think that efficiency and scarcity overlap in our thinking and as we seek efficiency we are also seeking scarcity in the number of possible solutions.

I like the idea of tagging the subject line.
I also like the idea of themes. Yesterday Ryan has suggested some possible themes:
"I am starting to think three fundamental P2P Foundation Projects are in order... 1. A discussion on the nature of value.  2. A discussion on the relationship of property to value.  3. A discussion on the relationship of money to value and property.  All of these are basic modern social ideas.   Breaking with those social ideas leads rapidly to nonsense in trying to interact with a modern world. "
I would add a forth theme: 4. the relationship of value and labour.
It should be easy to translate the themes into tags, e.g. for theme nr 1 the tag would only be 'value', for theme nr 2 two tags, 'value' and 'property', etc.
Sent: Tue 19/05/2009 11:01
you can tag the subject line with standardized words e.g.*Money*, *General* etc, that we agree to as a group (and can be added it, amended) so that people can setup filters (e.g. in gmail) to filter in/out messages with specific tags

It's called netiquette but it is essentially an agreement between the vocal minority to enforce rules of behavior on the rest of society. I don't share what is supposedly a 'mass agreement' when it comes to communication. I have my own agreement, and it goes like this:
If someone cannot bear to read what I send due to the style or content they can set a filter in under 3 seconds to junk my replies.
If someone wants me to adopt a supposedly mass agreement called 'netiquette' that I did not sign on to they are being coercive. Join the herd . Join the herd because the herd knows better. I don't agree. I think retaining all threads in the same message as new replies come up is easier for me since I always want to see all threads of a reply in one place. So it's not just a matter of wanting to rebel against 'the herd knows better' falsehood (see Unwisdom of Crowds  ) but it is a logical thing for me to want to have all replies to a given topic in the same message. My brain likes it better that way. Are you going to argue against the methods I've developed for navigating my world? Again, if you don't like it or it does not work for your brain to have all replies in one message feel free to set a filter to junk my replies. It works well for me and the other method does not, and only incentive to adopt the other method is coercion by the herd and peer pressure, which is a dangerous pattern. If something works well for an individual and the herd can live with it (by setting a filter) then why should the individual go out of his way to accommodate the herd? If the herd wants to reject the individual because the individual does not obey the herd rules or the herd taste then that's a herd mentality the individual should not be wasting their time arguing with.
Again, it works for me and it does not hurt the herd to filter out my messages, nor would it hurt me, as I'm hear for the experiment behind the experiment, not the experiment itself. And so far it's  been pretty mediocre, nothing shocking or unexpected. But there is always more to learn.
The herd can live with me using a way that is optimal for myself. The herd can filter me out or kick me out of its body. But I won't change a way that works for me to accommodate others when others CAN accommodate themselves (by setting up a filter or agreeing as a herd to ban me) Either way is perfectly fine, but i suspect it's all just bitching and moaning since they can setup a filter but they'd rather complain to have me change what works for me. What a brain fuck that is!
So the answer is still: NO.
Give me a better argument, or setup a filter.
It's totally ridiculous that this is happening in a p2p research group.
Critical thinking re: group vs individual? where did that go? isn't that part of the foundation of p2p theory? or is everybody assuming this is about the herd? like it is everywhere?

very interesting comments Andy:
1) I would not worry too much about the final crisis problem. This remains to be seen (and the interesting argument of Boltanski/Chiapello that capitalism has always gained in strength due to the criticism directed against it is well supported with historical evidence.) But this crisis won't be over with the bailout policy. The patient is still sick. And there isn't even an idea for recovery.
2) I can agree with his position of non-violence. Why not discuss this in terms of efficiency? Violent protest just hasn't been very successful lately. It didn't change anything. Maybe somethings is emerging that is more effective There is another form of resistance happening atm, kind of post-Seattle, it is quiet and growing. People dont protest, but do things in their home and outside the market, and they connect and become effective in hurting the market very badly, e.g. Pirate bay etc.
3) True it is not clear at all where the lines of conflict are. I don't think it is about immaterial labour against the rest. There is a big and growing conflict within cognitive labour (what Pasquinelli calls the immaterial civil war), e.g. creative industries labour against more autonomous creative labour. But this seems to be a difficult question atm (who are the allies, where is the line of conflict?

Actually I think it's very clear.  Though, you have to have read Deleuze and Guattari to make sense of his use of "singularity".
It's similar to Hakim Bey, or Colin Ward:  "communism" is the proliferation of free activity through difference, in which spaces of otherness involving intense, non-replicable connections occur at many localised sites, producing a world which is (locally) no longer subordinate to the logic of capital.  As these spaces are also self-organised, self-reproducing, networked and produce reconnection in the ecological, social and psychological fields, they are generative of other ways of being - specifically, of inclusive affinity-networks without hierarchy.
I found a lot of the article inspiring, but I'd challenge three things.
1)  can we really be sure this is the final crisis?  Marxism seems to find a "final crisis" every few decades - capitalism wasn't supposed to survive the First World War, the Second World War, the 70s crash, and the current reference to ecological disaster was formerly focused on the threat of fascism, then the threat of nuclear war...  If the system is going to get out of the crisis, it would have to be by doing something as yet unknown, unpredictable and new.  Which is how it got out of the other crises (e.g. Keynesianisn after WW2).  But, by definition we cannot know if it is capable of doing something as yet unknown, unpredictable and new.  The thesis of final crisis is based on the observed capabilities and actions of the system, whereas the possibility of systemic survival is based on the unknown, as is the possibility of antisystemic transformation.
2)  why has Bifo suddenly become so conflict-averse?  Why avoid confrontation with the conformist majority and the state?  The original hypothesis of autonomism - the necessity to vigorously defend spaces of autonomy to aid their proliferation - has never been falsified; it seems that, as autonomism got its fingers burned in the crackdown in Italy, it lost the courage of its convictions.  (That, and a lot of them became academics).  3)  there is a weird attachment to ideas of "general intellect" and "cognitive labour" - modern-day correlates of the old Marxist working-class - at the same time that resistance is theorised as minoritarian and as anti-conformist.  Why is the emergence of proliferating difference in radical opposition to the system deemed to have anything whatsoever to do with forms of production?  I think this is a shadow of aufhebung, the "passage through", the gravedigger created by the system itself, reasserting itself even as aufhebung is explicitly rejected.  Rather, I would argue that alternatives and resistance emerge from the "stars that fall out as the system tightens its grip", the emergence of entire strata of people outside the dominant system or marginal to it / alienated from it, hence the figures of the autonomous, the excluded and the indigenous (all of which are aspects of the "social principle" or affinity-network form as alternative to capitalism).

The Robinson Crusoe story is interesting and in many ways a real
eye-opener. However Gesell's core argument that interest is
intrinsically linked to money is not persuasive in my view. I want to
point out two things.
First, it is true that objects in general lose their value over time.
What Gesell does not mention however is that the value of objects which
are used deteriorates quicker than the value of objects which are not
used. A pair of shoes that stays in the cupboard for three years clearly
has more value than a pair of shoes being worn on a daily basis for the
same period of time. Gesell does not reflect at all on this issue.
The second point is more important. Gesell's theory can only work in
small and local settings. If two people on an island develop exchanges,
they do not need money or any other mediators to measure exchange. Thus
they do not need to implement interest. However they would have to
negotiate by when Robinson is supposed to get back the clothes and the
sacks of wheat that he gives to the stranger. If they don't talk about
time for reciprocity the stranger might decide that he could return
clothes and wheat 40 years later, and til then keep borrowing things
from Robinson. In an extremely localised setting (two people on an
island) this negotiation does not need to be formalised, it would sort
itself out eventually (at some point Robinson would stop lending if he
doesn't receive anything back.
Let's assume a non-local market, where control over all transactions and
exchanges becomes impossible for the individual participants. Let's
assume they don't have money. In this setting the framing of reciprocity
with respect to time becomes very important. If it is not established by
when the clothes and the wheat given to a person should be returned,
individual participants (with no interest in fair trade) could play the
system, and borrow clothes and wheat from person A in one year, and
froom person B the next year, and keep going borrowing without ever
returning. As this non-local situation is not a commons (with the
possibility to control the behaviour of all people involved)
participants would need to establish rules that guarantee reciprocity.
They would have two choices. They could either set up a deadline by when
the clothes and wheat has to be returned, or they could introduce the
notion of interest. The first possibility is not very practical as this
contract would have to established for every single transaction. The
second one (interests) is much more practical. It would make sure that
the one who receives goods makes sure that he or she returns them as
quickly as possible. Interest in this non-monetary system would work as
an incentive to give back sooner ratherv than later.
Interest, I would argue, is not intrinsically linked to money as such,
but to the idea of measurement. Any model of exchange that operates on
the basis of measurement (of the commodities and of labour) is bound to
end up introducing interest. The problem is that there is no just way to
measure the value of individual labour. Only those economic models that are established on the idea that
everybody should contribute with as much labour as he or she wishes to
donate to the commons could avoid operating on the basis of interest.
Obviously in this economic model individual participants could also play
the system. But would they? This is a question about human behaviour.

This is one the most destructive traits of money, real wealth can not be
stored at no cost, or actually negative cost (positive interest), to the
owner. Such a form of wealth can only extend from granted privilege,
most likely enforced by state violence.
This feature of money, money as a store of value, is esentially a
transfer of wealth from future producers to current owners.
This theft of future value from it's producers is among the sources of
the great inequality of the world, and any form of exchange based on the
ability to "store" consumption at no loss or risk would perpetuate
That is why Gessellian "friegelti," i.e. stamp scrip, has demmurrage (negative interest) as a feature.
I'm jumping in late, so appologies if this has already been covered.

Hi Martien,
Point taken. So this can't be generalised, it depends on specific
objects, which makes this issue even more complicated.
It is of course possible to see this not as interest but as rent. But
time plays an important role. In terms of practicality it seems nearly
impossible to make these arrangements for every single transaction,
every single item that is being borrowed.
Again: it is not practical to make formal agreements for the exchange of
every single good.
Apart from that, Gesell claims that this form of rent is unnecessary if
exchange is not based on money. You take something, return this item
later, not matter when. This is where the problem lies with Gesell's
claim. As soon as you include the idea of rent, you need to measure the
time and the value of this time between the transaction and the return
of the action. (So where is the difference to compound interest?
I am not saying that a system without compound interest will fail. There
is a long history of economic exchange before the invention of
capitalism, and they have worked. So clearly interest is not needed.
I am merely questioning that interest is instrinsically linked to money.
But there is not much disagreement between our views. Yes, it is linked
to money systems. And what else are money systems than systems of
measurement, systems of quantification. As soon as measurement becomes
important in exchanges the idea of interest is unavoidable. You can
develop alternative money systems, but they will all be based on
attempts to value labour and value goods, and this is the core problem.
Here we disagree: IMO you can think about this problem as much as you
want, the value of labour is beyond measure. Qualities cannot be
transferred in an objective way into quantities. Different people value
different perceptions. One football fanatic might argue that football
stars deserve to earn what they do. Another one might argue they should
earn significantly less, but still more than a bin man. And someone with
no interest in football might argue the labour of a bin man has higher
value (as it is socially relevant labour) than the labour of a football
But there are plenty more argument: Innovation, ideas, creativity can't
be measured in an accurate way. It is just impossible. This is why many
great artists died in poverty. Or: Should we assume that the labour of someone like Britney Spears is
more valuable that that of all members of say, the London Philharmonic
orchestra just because she has a bigger audience?
If we cant measure the quality of labour, could we find a way out
measuring the quantity of labour, that is the hours and days we spend
working? Again this does not work. It is increasingly impossible to
separate work from leisure, not just for artist but for most people. Agreed. However this still doesn't lead to a solution what people should
get paid...

Hi Martien,
Yes I have read your suggestion regarding the VAX standard. You would
measure labour in time. One hour spend working is valued with x, and 2
hours with 2 times x. This would be a far better system than the one we
have today, but again, it would not be a fair system imo. This system
would not take into account the quality of labour. Some people might be
more focused and more productive, and get things done quicker. If they
work less hours, they would get punished.
Also I think this VAX standard would contradict what you suggest later
in your response, that it is ok to mesh work with leisure. How do you
want to measure the hours then?
I remain convinced that Toni Negri is spot on saying that the value of
labour has become immeasureable (affective work and conceptual work will
always escape 'objective' forms of quantification. Any monetary system
would be based on the idea of quantification, thus I don't have much
hope that alternative monetary systems would get us very far.
I'd be interested in thinking about something else. Could we imagine an
economic system that leaves this form of measuring behind? A system
where 10 sacks of wheat do not have to returned exactly with 10 sacks? A
system of producing, contributing, sharing, and using without absolute
forms of measurement? This would have to be based on trust, on the trust
that most people are more interested in making the commons works than
abusing it.
Have you read my previous suggestion regarding the VAX 11/780 standard
for MIPS? In that general direction.
as you want, the value of labour is beyond measure. Qualities cannot be
transferred in an objective way into quantities. Different people value
different perceptions. One football fanatic might argue that football
stars deserve to earn what they do. Another one might argue they should
earn significantly less, but still more than a bin man. And someone with
no interest in football might argue the labour of a bin man has higher
value (as it is socially relevant labour) than the labour of a football
So it's whatever someone wants to pay for it, or can afford. I agree. If
you can pay the price, than you are also able to deliver value to others
(your employer?) to be able to afford it. There must be a dynamic
balance between what you consume and produce. 'You' in this case scales
from individual to large companies or even countries.
out measuring the quantity of labour, that is the hours and days we
spend working? Again this does not work. It is increasingly impossible
to separate work from leisure, not just for artist but for most people.
actually something that you do with pleasure because it matches your
talents and passions, and that it helps your self-expression and
authenticity. Our current monetary systems enslaves the majority of
people because they have to bring up the ever growing interest and
shortage of money. It's a trait of the system.
