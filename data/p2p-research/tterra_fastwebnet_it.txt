thanks stan for intervening on this
i was troubled by this posting for all the reasons that you mentioned and more. Yes in the short run, the sudden population decrease in the countries mentioned could create problems, but isn't a decrease actually a good thing ecologically speaking for a while? Can we go on growing forever? Or maybe our cosmic destiny as a race is use up the planet and then start colonizing the universe? Wasn't Einstein who talked about the population bomb as the next most devastating thing after the H bomb?
Second, is it me or there is a lot of scaremongering about Moslems taking over by breeding more than ??? (Christians???? Shintoists? Buddhists???? Jews?????? As in Israel, where this kind of talk about the Palestinian breeding rate is rife?). So we need to go back to Christianity to start breeding again??????? I found this very disturbing, it constructs 'Moslems' as a horde ready to take over the world thanks to their women having more children (maybe to save the race, Japanese, European and Northamerican women should start having more chldren as well, work less, take care of the family etc? This reminds me of Mussolini?'s policies in the 20s...)
Finally I thought that a peer-2-peer society would also be about ways of living, which could overcome the current crazy arrangements where the rhythm and paces of paid, subordinate work make having and bringing up children with love, care and time a heroic struggle., especially for women, but also for men.
Michel, are you the author of this, 'cause I find this a bit shocking....
