Ryan: If I could find a world where people are responsive to demand, but
to share, I'd be very happy.
Sasha: I've found it and use it every day. It's called linux. And with
Ubuntu 10.04 I can say it is much better than its corporate made competition
windows 7.

"Ireland funds a 1.2 million Euro contest to crowdsource paths for economic
recovery "
Does anybody here have an P2P / open manufacturing idea which could be
submitted to this contest? Not that I delude myself that it would be
actually implemented, but perhaps it could gain some exposure to P2P / open
manufacturing concepts and ideas.

@_subject: [p2p-research] P2P car sharing 
"If there was any doubt that peer-to-peer car-sharing is an idea whose time
has come, surely those fears can now be put to rest. After reporting on the
emergence of such services in the United
Statesand then
Australia , we were interested
to note recently that a similar offering has just launched in the UK.
Much like the other contenders we've seen, WhipCar
enables London car owners to rent out their
cars while they're not using
them. There is no registration fee to use the site's online booking system,
and owners set their own prices. WhipCar notifies owners by text and email
when there is an approved driver in their area who wants to use their car;
both cars and drivers are screened by WhipCar before a booking is completed.
Every trip, meanwhile, is fully insured through a comprehensive insurance
package that temporarily replaces the owner's existing insurance for the
duration of hire. Following the end of a rental, both owners and drivers
have the chance to rate each other.
By matching up car-owning
transumers  and others who
don't have their own, peer-to-peer car-sharing services seem to be creating
a win-win for everyone involved. Entrepreneurs in other parts of the world:
how about you...?
