Dear all
I am sorry for this current situation and really hope that peace will return
to the P2P foundation. I can not imagine a P2P foundation without Michel
Bauwens and can imagine this will not happen, so let me hope you find a
reasonable solution sooner than later

Ah yes, the sword of ownership comes down...
Maybe you are wrong.
I think of text and code as the same.  Why treat them differently?
Both must be parsed to be acted upon.  Code is only different because
it must follow much more strict rules.  And that is only true because
computers are not yet capable of dealing with ambiguity and mistakes.
If the modularity is done carefully, then this is not true.
And even when it is true, all you need to do is copy/paste the text
for that section into the place where you want a contextualized
version and then make the changes.
But in your most recent push against modularity you removed the
'section' markers at
These markers are used by the wiki software to know where to pull
content *from*.
They are not damaging in any way, and have no effect at all until
someone uses them.
But since they were already in use, what you did was similar in nature
to renaming an 'include' file - breaking the codebase wherever that
content was being included.
Your approach does not scale.  What you are doing is digging a pit for
yourself and for anyone who intends to maintain the wiki in the
For programmers:  Imagine a project where all the text for every
library was copy/pasted into the files that would otherwise that text.  And imagine every call to every function were eliminated
and all that text were copy/pasted in-place so that in the end all you
were left with was assembly language opcodes.  It is good to let the
compiler do some of that work so you can get on with describing and
solving higher-level problems.
For non-programmers: It is good to let the wiki-software do some of
that work so you can get on with describing and solving higher-level

@_subject: [p2p-research] finding cc license for classical music 
Hello, this might work for you too:
There are a couple of experimental australian labels;
 -          Topology (Brisbane-based group) -
-          Secession Records -
And, you might want to check Jamendo?s site, they have a lot of CC albums
that classify themselves as classical ? are any of them on recognised
labels?

My best wishes for Michel?s recovery. I can not promise a weekly blog post
but I can promise one or 2 in the comming weeks... is someone going to
coordinate this volunteering (should I do it??) so that we can have a
calendar and do not overlap efforts? what do you think?

We have not yet payed the ticket... but we could try to switch it for Europe
doing other arrangements
Michel, do you have a phone number? if Bahia is not on the road will your
trip be only Rio and Bogota? who else from this list is affected? i might
have a solution... but need to have more details
