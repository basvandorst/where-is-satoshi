2010/1/2 Ryan Lanham I don't think we can consider Facebook or Twitter as examples of P2P
tools, since they don't establish distributed networks. Both services
concentrate information and they are not based on free software
I think P2P is about distributed, open and non central controls.

2010/1/2 Ryan Lanham :
Wikipedia is free and open but not distributed. Is one of its mayor problems.
I know there is not full consensus on what P2P is, but the network
model it represents is pretty clear (since Paul Baran's diagrams).
Just take a look at the schemes:
Both Facebook and Twitter are based on a centralized network. If your
idea of "peer to peer" is reduced to the possibility that a peer
contact another peer, then you should add almost every kind of
technology to your list, even e-mail.
It's clear to me that Facebook and Twitter don't create an horizontal
network of information, beyond they are private corporations,
vigilance systems and so on :-)
I think it would to know others opinion on this issue, since defining
a common basic understanding of the P2P it's essential.

@_subject: [p2p-research] P2PU Call for Courses - August / September 2010 
The Peer 2 Peer University is gearing up to launch its third cycle of
courses this coming September, and we?re looking for new faces to join
the community. Do you have an idea for a six week course? Whether it?s
Physics 101 or Poker and Strategic Thinking, all ideas are welcome.
You can propose a course here (deadline is August 6, 2010).
If you?ve never designed or run a course before, that?s okay, too.
P2PU is running a Course Organizers Orientation for newbies to
introduce organizers to the practice of online facilitation and
provide support while they build a new course. The orientation will be
three weeks long and will enable future course organizers to:
Experience open social learning first-hand
Distinguish peer-2-peer learning from formal online teaching
Navigate the different features of the P2PU site
Design a course on a topic of their choice on the P2PU site
Learn how to use different synchronous/asynchronous platforms effectively
Review and provide feedback for others; revise and refine syllabi for
their course
Weekly video conferences will be held to discuss important aspects of
community building, course design, finding and creating course
content, open educational resources (OER), and troubleshooting.
Conferences will be recorded and posted for those unable to attend.
The orientation leader will also post office hours to provide
additional support.
Building on the feedback from participants and organizers in the last
two cycles of courses, the P2PU community realised that many potential
course organizers had reservations about some of the technological and
pedagogical aspects of running courses online. This orientation aims
to address these concerns, as well as help organizers become an active
part of the P2PU community.
The P2PU community consists of a diverse group of people. They are
writers, teachers, designers, doctoral and alternative grad students,
artists, copyright specialists, scientists, and blues guitar players.
Above all, they are learners?peers working together to learn from each
More information, including how and where to sign up, can be found on
the P2PU wiki: wiki.p2pu.org/orientation You can submit course
proposals until August 6, 2010.

Third CopySouth Workshop
International Conference on Copyright Issues
 ? copysouth.rio2010 at gmail.com
The CopySouth Research Group (CSRG) invites you to attend and join in
the debates at its three day
international conference on copyright to be held in Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil at the end of June.
?It is an important moment to discuss these issues. Around the world,
the antiquated assumptions of copyright law
and ideology are again being questioned and new conflicts are breaking
out. In Brazil, for example, more than 500 musicians,
writers, academics and others signed an open letter in late May
calling on their government to reform its copyright laws so that users
can have more access to music and books. Meanwhile, the well-financed
campaign against so-called copyright ?piracy?
has become even more vocal and threatens us all, except large
corporations. Although three of the most important countries
in the global South ? China, India and Brazil ? were not even invited
to the talks, a new anti-piracy treaty called ACTA
is about to be signed by rich nations in North America and Europe, as
well as Japan and a few smaller countries.
As we meet, a list of long-standing and complex questions is demanding
new answers. Do most musicians benefit from the copyright system and
the current way that the music industry is organised? How can we
promote far more access to educational materials in the countries of
South America, Africa and Asia than already exists? And, speaking of
access and sharing, why do so many ideas and so many cultural products
flow from the North to the South and so few flows the other way? Can
we justify the current economic logic of the global copyright system?
And what are viable alternatives to the current system?
To address these questions and many more that you may want to raise,
the CSRG has assembled a group of
leading critical researchers, musicians and activists from around the
world to come to Rio and to speak on
seven panels.?The speakers are from Brazil (7), Chile (1), Bolivia
(1), Cuba (2), the United States (3),
South Africa (2), Ghana (1), the Philippines (2), Switzerland (1), and
the United Kingdom (2).
We expect some strong opinions to be voiced and some good open debates
to occur. So we extend an open invitation
to all people interested in these issues, such as students,
librarians, teachers, researchers, musicians
and information activists, to attend.
There will be simultaneous interpretation in Portuguese, Spanish and English.
Hope to see you in Rio on 28 June.

3? Workshop CopySouth
Confer?ncia Internacional sobre Direito Autoral
 ? copysouth.rio2010 at gmail.com
O Grupo de Pesquisa CopySouth (GPCS) convida voc? a assistir e
participar dos debates promovidos nos tr?s dias
de sua Confer?ncia Internacional sobre Direito Autoral, a ser
realizada no Rio de Janeiro, Brasil, no final de junho.
O momento ? importante para discutir essas quest?es. Os pressupostos
antiquados das leis e da ideologia
do direito autoral est?o novamente sendo questionados em todo o mundo
e novos conflitos est?o acontecendo. No Brasil,
por exemplo, mais de 500 m?sicos, escritores, acad?micos e outros
profissionais assinaram uma carta aberta no final de maio,
pedindo que o governo reforme as leis de direito autoral para que os
usu?rios possam ter mais acesso ? m?sica e aos livros.
Ao mesmo tempo, a campanha bem-financiada contra a chamada ?pirataria?
se tornou ainda mais habitual e amea?a
a todos, exceto as grandes corpora??es. Embora tr?s dos pa?ses mais
importantes do Hemisf?rio Sul ? China, ?ndia e Brasil ?
nem sequer tenham sido convidados para as negocia??es, um novo tratado
anti-pirataria chamado ACTA (Acordo
Comercial Anti-Contrafa??o) est? prestes a ser assinado pelos pa?ses
ricos da Am?rica do Norte
e da Europa, assim como pelo Jap?o e por alguns pa?ses menores.
Enquanto nos reunimos, uma lista de perguntas antigas e complexas
exige novas respostas. Ser? que a maioria
dos m?sicos se beneficia do sistema de direito autoral e do modo como
a ind?stria da m?sica est? organizada atualmente?
Como podemos promover um acesso bem mais amplo do que existe hoje a
materiais educacionais nos pa?ses da Am?rica do Sul, ?frica e ?sia? E
por falar em acesso e compartilhamento, por que tantas id?ias e tantos
produtos culturais fluem do Norte
para o Sul e t?o poucos fluem na outra dire??o? Ser? que podemos
justificar a atual l?gica econ?mica
do sistema global de direito autoral? E quais s?o as alternativas
vi?veis para o sistema atual?
Para abordar estas quest?es e muitas outras, o GPCS reuniu um grupo de
importantes investigadores, m?sicos e ativistas de todo o mundo para
vir ao Rio de Janeiro apresentar suas ideias em sete pain?is. Os
palestrantes s?o do Brasil (7), Chile (1), Bol?via (1), Cuba (2),
Estados Unidos (3), ?frica do Sul (2), Gana (1), Filipinas (2), Su??a
(1) e Reino Unido (2).
Esperamos debates abertos, onde algumas opini?es fortes se fa?am
ouvir. Assim, estendemos nosso convite a todas
as pessoas interessadas nestas quest?es, como estudantes,
bibliotec?rios, professores, pesquisadores,
m?sicos e ativistas compare?am ao evento.
Haver? tradu??o simult?nea entre ingl?s, espanhol e portugu?s.
Esperamos encontr?-los no Rio em 28 de junho.

3? Workshop CopySouth
Conferencia Internacional sobre Derecho de Autor
 ? copysouth.rio2010 at gmail.com
El Grupo de Investigaci?n CopySouth (GICS) le invita a asistir y
participar en los debates que tendr?n lugar durante los
tres d?as de su Conferencia Internacional sobre Derecho de Autor, que
se celebrar? en R?o de Janeiro, Brasil, a finales de junio.
Es un momento importante para debatir estas cuestiones. En todo el
mundo, los supuestos anticuados de las leyes
y la ideolog?a del derecho de autor son una vez m?s cuestionados y
nuevos conflictos est?n surgiendo. En Brasil, por ejemplo,
m?s de 500 m?sicos, escritores, acad?micos y otros profesionales han
firmado una carta abierta a finales de mayo, pidiendo
al gobierno para reformar las leyes de derecho de autor para que los
usuarios puedan tener m?s acceso a la m?sica y los libros.
Al mismo tiempo, la bien financiada campa?a contra la llamada
?pirater?a? se ha vuelto m?s habitual y amenaza a todos,
excepto las grandes corporaciones. Aunque tres de los pa?ses m?s
importantes en el hemisferio sur ? China, India y Brasil ?
ni siquiera han sido invitados a estas negociaciones, un nuevo tratado
contra la pirater?a llamado ACTA (Acuerdo de
Comercio Anti-Falsificaci?n) est? a punto de ser firmado por los
pa?ses ricos de Am?rica del Norte y Europa,
as? como por el Jap?n y algunos pa?ses m?s peque?os.
Mientras nos reunimos, una lista de preguntas antiguas y complejas
requiere nuevas respuestas. ?La mayor?a de los m?sicos
se beneficia del sistema de derecho de autor y la forma c?mo la
industria musical se organiza hoy en d?a? ?C?mo promover
un acceso mucho m?s amplio que lo actual a los materiales educativos
en los pa?ses de Am?rica del Sur, ?frica y Asia?
Y hablando de acceso y distribuci?n, ?por qu? tantas ideas y tantos
productos culturales fluyen de Norte a Sur
y tan pocos fluyen en sentido contrario? ?Podemos justificar la l?gica
econ?mica actual del sistema mundial
del derecho de autor? ?Y cu?les son las alternativas viables al sistema actual?
Para responder a estas preguntas y muchas m?s, el GICS ha reunido a un
grupo de destacados investigadores, m?sicos
y activistas de todo el mundo a venir a R?o de Janeiro para hablar en
siete paneles. Los altavoces son de Brasil (7),
Chile (1), Bolivia (1), Cuba (2), Estados Unidos (3) Sud?frica (2),
Ghana (1), Filipinas (2), Suiza (1) y el Reino Unido (2).
Esperamos abrir debates donde algunas opiniones fuertes sean
escuchadas. Por lo tanto, nosotros les extendemos
la invitaci?n para participar en el evento a todas las personas
interesadas en eses temas, como los estudiantes,
bibliotecarios, profesores, investigadores, m?sicos y activistas.

Standards

  -   - AMSTERDAM, The Netherlands -- Tuesday, October 26, 2010 -- The Free
Technology Academy (FTA) and the Free Software Foundation (FSF)
announced today their partnership in the FTA's Associate Partner
Network. The Network aims to expand the availability of professional
educational courses and materials covering the concepts and applications
of free software and free standards.
The FTA consists of an advanced virtual campus with course modules which
can be followed entirely on-line. The learning materials are all
published under a free license and can be accessed by anyone, but
learners enrolled in the FTA will be guided by professional teaching
staff from one of the three participating universities. The FTA aims to
enable IT professionals, students, teachers and decision makers to
undertake accredited professional education modules in free software
One of the FTA objectives is to establish a strong relationship with the
free software community and to turn the FTA course materials into an
essential reference. The FTA seeks to educate and promote the adoption
of free technologies without losing sight of the free software
community's core purpose of freedom and social transformation.
Wouter Tebbens, president of the Free Knowledge Institute and director
of the FTA, explains: "We are building this master's programme on free
software with the support from relevant organisations and community
members. And in this sense it is an honour for us to have the support of
Richard Stallman and the FSF. We hope to be of use to the community and
we invite the community to participate in our courses and review our
Richard Stallman, leader of the free software movement and president of
the Free Software Foundation, said, "The FTA course materials teach
people to use GNU/Linux; more than that, it teaches them to recognize
why this is important."
Details of the Partnership:
      * The FSF will provide special video guest lectures in FTA courses.
      * The FSF will encourage volunteers to collaborate in the
maintenance of existing materials and the production of new courses.
      * The FTA will provide the FSF Associate Membership
( with 30 discount vouchers for FTA
courses each trimester.
Enrollment for 2011 courses is now open, and students can register at
== About the Free Technology Academy ==
A Consortium formed by the Open University of Catalonia (Spain), the
Open University of the Netherlands and the University of Agder (Norway)
and led by the Free Knowledge Institute (FKI), the FTA has started up -
with support from the EC's Lifelong Learning Programme - an
international educational programme on Free Software. The courses are
taught completely online in a virtual campus based on the Campus Project
interoperability framework.
Following the Free Software and Open Educational Resources movements,
all learning materials are freely available through the Internet. The
use of Free Software (also referred to as Open Source software or Libre
Software) is rapidly expanding in governmental and private
organisations. However, still only a limited number of ICT
professionals, teachers and decision makers have sufficient knowledge
and expertise in these new fields. The Free Technology Academy aims to
address this gap by providing high level courses that fit into larger
Master Programmes at the participating universities.

The Free Software Foundation, founded in 1985, is dedicated to promoting
computer users' right to use, study, copy, modify, and redistribute
computer programs. The FSF promotes the development and use of free (as
in freedom) software -- particularly the GNU operating system and its
GNU/Linux variants -- and free documentation for free software. The FSF
also helps to spread awareness of the ethical and political issues of
freedom in the use of software, and its Web sites, located at fsf.org
