@_subject: [p2p-research]  Hermit Nation: Does Tech Boost Social Isolation? 
Just responding to Paul D. Fernhout's post from Friday, the most
insightful thing I've seen on the topic is John "Megatrends"
Naisbitt's aphorism: High Tech, High Touch.
My experience is that the more active I am on Facebook and Twitter,
the more events I go to and the more people I meet.  Tech-induced
social isolation is an oxymoron in the day of the tweetup!

I've been wanting lists fo a long while, just to make my columns
portable between apps like Tweetdeck and Seesmic Desktop.
I dallied with Twitter in 2007, but it's only been this year that I've
gotten serious about it.  In terms of reach I've found it superior to
IRC, but in terms of depth of engagement and conversation it still
trails IRC.
I frequently live tweet from events like  from my cellphone.

2009/11/8 Ryan I have toyed in the past with the idea of building a Nomic-based bot
to help govern groups & organisations.
However, I really disagree with the idea of political AIs as the
solution to the agency-principal problem in our political systems.
The agency-principal problem is inherently endemic to representative
democracy. ?The only solution is to go beyond representative democracy
to participatory democracy. ?There are arguments to be had about which
forms of participatory democracy are to be implemented, but lets at
least start off from a more appropriate place.

Hmm, that's a different issue.  You're now talking about a need for a
sentient rights framework which will definitely need to be sorted out
during this century.
Sentient rights or not, representative democracy has come to the end
of its road.  Information revolutions drive political evolution.
Participatory democracy is what's
next.

I've known about the VSM for years.  There's a whole bunch of work
I've been meaning to do for years around organisational design for the
I've been very fortunate to be exposed recently to things like the
Business Model Canvas, Capital Conversion Model and Change Labs which
I'm looking to incorporate into a framework for the design and running
of "Social Businesses" - For profit businesses that have a positive
social and/or environmental impact.
I'm sensing a growing readiness for this stuff and feel a need to
strike while the iron is hot!

2009/11/12 Eugen Leitl :
Using Twitter has massively enlarged the number of people I know and
engage with.  My reallife social network in London & elsewhere has
greatly benefited from my Twitter presence and I've been followed by
some very influential people who are actively taking an interest in
what I tweet about.  I've been offered work via Twitter.
As a medium, Twitter is indeed ephemeral.  The relationships I'm
building through it aren't.
BTW, I don't appreciate being called ephemeral.  If you knew me, you'd
know I'm anything but.

@_subject: [p2p-research] The Age of Asperger: modern society is autistic! 
Speaking as someone who sometimes obsesses over community-level ownership
& sharing of resources in my own (high-functioning autistic?) way, I
think you have a point but perhaps a slightly overstated one.  It's
not so much that we don't know, but we haven't established widely
spread institutions and cultural norms that enable and/or facilitate
such ownership & sharing.
A publication that looks at various ways of sharing is The Sharing Solution:
There is a blog to go with the book:
A non-affiliated site that seems to be a good source of information
re: sharing is Shareable:
Agreed with a caveat, got back this week from the Africa-Middle East
Regional Microcredit Summit in Kenya.  What was undoubted the most
interesting phenomenon was Jamii Bora, an organisation started in 1999
by 50 street beggars.  It is effectively a Mutual Aid society that
employs peer support and mentoring to bring its members out of
poverty.  It helps them learn to create their own livelihoods.  It has
been so successful, that it has had a full banking license as of the
30th of March 2010 and it has enabled a bunch of members to build
their own town so that they can move out of the dreadful Nairobi slums
they've been living in!  This shows what can happen when people
cooperate to create a culture of accomplishment.
The caveat, attended a session at the summit on Social Business where
there was a discussion regarding profit.  The problem with profit
seems to be twofold, firstly where it is maximised at the cost of the
customers, society and the environment.  Secondly where the profits
are distributed almost solely to the shareholders and executives.
To have a viable self-sustaining business, you absolutely have to have
full cost recovery.  If you have profit on top of that, you can afford
to invest in the training and development of your people.  You can
afford to invest in equipment and other useful resources.  You can
improve the compensation of your people. You can afford to employ more
people.  You can cross-subsidise the cost of products and services so
as to make them affordable and accessible to those who would not
otherwise be able to use them.
So I guess a key issue is whether businesses are attending to the
triple bottom line of Planet, People and Profit.  Profit maximisation
to the detriment of Planet and People is something our society can no
longer afford to sanction.  I am however, unaware of any changes in
company regulation in so-called developed nations that addresses this
issue in a mandatory (not voluntary) manner.

Quickly skimming through this article, this is useful and relevant
stuff.  The fact that it wasn't tolerated on Wikipedia shows that
Wikipedia's unfit for purpose.  Some of us realised this years ago and
this is a perfect illustration of why.  The so-called Neutral Point of
View in practice is almost always the Mainstream POV, which often is
actually wrong or at least debatable, although those who adhere to it
think otherwise.
I for one am glad this valuable content has been rescued from Wikipedia.

Speaking as someone who got involved with WikiLinks years ago at the
behest of Lion Kimbro, I totally agree.
I'm starting to get interested in Application Wikis again, with a
particular interest in TiddlyWeb having used TiddlyWiki in the past.
What attracts me to TiddlyWeb is being able to extend it with
Python-based plugins.

Hi folks,
Just thought I'd share this blurb, about one of our activities, those
of you in and around London might find it of interest:
On Tuesday June the 15th, London Creative Labs (founded by London
Leader Sofia Bustamante) will be running the first ever Social
Startup Labs in Vauxhall, South London. Participants will learn by
doing how the community can work together to create and grow social
businesses that provide or enable much needed employment opportunities
for all and make their neighbourhoods better places to live, work and play!
Thanks to sponsorship by the London Sustainable Development Commission,
tickets for this event are free.

At London Creative Labs, we are well aware of Red Toryism and the Big
Society agenda.  We are starting to engage more in the Big Society
debate as it provides a context which makes our approach more relevant
and viable to policymakers and decisionmakers.  Indeed, we have
already gained the attention of ResPublica (thanks to a bit of
judicious blogging), see the third paragraph here:
It is our intention in due course to engage with ResPublica & other
relevant organisations.  We will also participate in the Lambeth
Cooperative Council effort, despite previous bad experiences with
Lambeth Council.
The concern over whether Big Society is a front for cuts to public
spending are justifiable and shared by myself.  However, LCL is taking
the tack that it provides an opportunity to advance its agenda that
should be taken.
Right now, our immediate focus is our first major event the Social
Startup Labs which is taking place this Tuesday in London.  We believe
that this is a prototype for a innovative, powerful approach for
addressing challenges related to Welfare-To-Work and community

@_subject: [p2p-research] Lambeth Co-operative Council Wiki 
Digging through the comments in response, I found this particularly
noteworthy one from lespetroleuse which I reproduce below (slightly edited
for grammar):
I recall reading a history of industrial democracy in 3 slim volumes back in
the early 1980s produced by the Institute of Workers Control.
One was called, I think, "Schools for Democrats".
As mass party membership in the trade unions and the cooperative movements
have declined, we have lost experience of institutions that are part of our
common heritage.
Without participation in such institutions where are the individually
powerless to learn the potential of the collective, the mechanics of
democracy and the skills of participation in it?
Unions and coops provided the political education that once put miners,
dockers, and shopworkers on the green benches.
Whose interests are served when we are made to feel powerless to effect
changes we seek whether at work or where we live?
The approach of those in Lambeth may not succeed, but there is a much
ignored UK tradition of self-improvement, and mutual aid.
If it seeks to carry that on I wish them well.
