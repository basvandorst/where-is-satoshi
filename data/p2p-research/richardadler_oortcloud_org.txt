@_subject: [p2p-research] Two new university presses and a 'co-publishing' 
There's an interesting piece in today's 'Inside Higher Ed' concerning the
newly founded Webster University Press and Lee University Press:
Collaboration may not be an entirely new phenomenon among university
presses, but a term like 'co-publishing' raises interesting possibilities in
the current publishing environment.  While their vision is not what Paul
Hartzog and I have in mind when we speak of 'social publishing,' it might,
at least, suggest that some in the world of traditional publishing may be
more open to alternative models than they would have been in the past.
