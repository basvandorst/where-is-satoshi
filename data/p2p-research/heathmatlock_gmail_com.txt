Maybe I'm not asking the appropriate questions, be my guest to correct me.
What amount of change in the political and social landscape can be expected
if Factor-e-Farm or a similar group receives $500,000 USD? What about
$1,000,000 USD?
Can we quantify in some form of currency what the tipping point is.
What is the tipping point exactly?

@_subject: [p2p-research] Metacurrency Mailing List 
Yet another mailing list!... a few of you may be thinking. I'm the same way,
but I was shocked that it hadn't been made, so here it is, a mailing list
specifically dedicated to discussion of open money and the metacurrency
platform (   ).
Most of the chatter takes place via Skype or online forums, and if you are
like me, email is much more convenient. I figure it can be the general
discussion for anyone interested in these topics.

@_subject: [p2p-research] Yacy search engine 
Speaking of p2p search engines, has anyone used Yacy?
A friend and I had done some initial work on converting it to Python
(since we weren't fans of Java), but he got a job in Chicago and I
went onto school. Anyway, it's a nice piece of software, so check it
out if you get a chance.

We were going for a p2p anonymous search engine, because paranoia both
had us in its grasp. So were only porting some aspects of it.
You want to visit  , and if you don't speak German,
punch that in at  . From there, you'll want
to look at the "Network Statistics" link and also the "Peer Table". I
went ahead and emailed a developer those questions, but I don't expect
a response. That was another reason we decided to fork the work, the
devs never responded to our inquiries, nor are they active on the
 channel on Freenode.
Anyway, on average there are about 55 peers hosting a yacy instance,
and about 1 billion links indexed and available. There are more peers,
it's just 55 is the average available. It's supposed to scale to an
infinite number of nodes. It's slow, being that it's based on http
requests. Query response time depends on peers, the default timeout is
at 3 seconds at the moment. There aren't any statistics for this
available right now. "YaCy knows 5 different ways to acquire web
indexes, find out detalis by downloading it and going to
