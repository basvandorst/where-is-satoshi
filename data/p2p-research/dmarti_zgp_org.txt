The tasks are very different from free software
development.  Typically they're things like "identify
the type of business shown in this photo" or "select
a category for this directory listing."
(You can't split up a software project into abstract
work units.  The industry has been trying to do so
for decades.)
And so far, none of the so-called "bounty systems"
for paying rewards to fix bugs or add features in
collaborative projects seem to have caught on.

mainly want to see inbound links from sites they
recognize, to show that the organization is relevant.
The easiest way to beat the case for deletion would be
to (1) ask the people who have contributed articles
or acted as reviewers to add links to the TSI site
(2) add their pages mentioning TSI to the references
on the Wikipedia page.

As soon as you get a "remote control" antifeature
on privately owned computers, you also make them
vulnerable to a patent attack:
  A software patent case against the supplier of some
software on your system could result in a remote
update that disables features or "bricks" the device

Good essay.  Stallman comes from the USA, though,
and some of the basis for treating information
monopolies differently from property seems to come
from the Constitution.  The US Constitution puts
patents and copyrights into Article I, Section 8, the
miscellaneous powers of Congress section, along with
"post roads" and "letters of marque and reprisal".
All of that section is stuff that Congress is
_allowed_, but not _required_, to do.  Under the
Constitution, I don't have the right to a patent,
a post road running past my house, or permission
to raid enemy ships--Congress has the right to give
them to me if it wants.  Actual property rights are
separate, in the 5th Amendment.
If the Framers of the Constitution had wanted us
to have property rights in the exclusive use of
information, they could have put them in as rights,
not as one of the economic development programs that
Congress has permission to run.
The language of private property rights has powerful
appeal in the USA, so many seekers of government
benefits put their appeals in that form.  So the fact
that someone who wants a patent from the government
calls it "property" is probably not a strong argument
for calling it that.
