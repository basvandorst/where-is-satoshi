The question is, can something produce value at the level of capitalism in a

I find your sophomoric labeling of Ray a great deal more offensive than his

@_subject: [p2p-research] newsweek on The Creativity Crisis 
IMHO, there is no single (simplistic) cause as would be suggested by TV or
the internet. Since I don't know what is happening in other countries my
remarks are confined to the U.S. alone.
Several years back TCFIR commissioned an ethnography of a kindergarten class
in a metro Denver, CO school. What was evident from the qualitative
narrative was learning core skills was less important than management and
social control. Staying on task and within the behavioral boundaries was
primary to exploration and discovery. OK, I know that one observation does
not make a good predictor. (One swallow doesn't make a summer). On
investigation we found that this style of pedagogy was pervasive across
schools and districts. So some generalization is possible.
To the point: For creativity and innovation to survive and thrive there must
be climate where being right or wrong is less important than the process of
discovery. Rigid social control trumps this process. In the U.S.,
standardized testing has (right/wrong) taken priority over measures of
critical thinking. This is the subject of great national debate and little
T.A. Bells (former secretary of Education) set this trend in motion with his
1983 book, "A Nation at Risk". By the 1990s the effects were in full bloom
in U.S. Education and then cast in concrete by the passage of HR-1 (No Child
Left Behind). This law made standardized testing the instrument of academic
and social control.
The Newsweek article simply described the effect of this law and what many
have know to be the ultimate consequences.
What horrifies me is that many nations are following the U.S. over the
precipice of rigid standardized education.
Please do not think I see this as the only explanation. I truly appreciate
the complexity of this problem.

Michael, and others, do you have any specific idea of why creativity started declining in the
90's, and not before?
seems to me that it is too late to blame TV for this, and to early to blame
the internet which only became in full usage in the late 90's
changes in the school system?
otherwise, of course, Ryan's comment that the death of creativity is "good
news for socialism", is baffling,
first, because as you correctly point out, it occurred in the era of
neoliberal dominance, so following the policy prescriptions of the free
market ideology, secondly, because historically, socialism has been about
extending creativity for all .. while I think Stalinist systems were
counter-creative because of their enforced collectivism under the umbrella
of a bureaucratic state, the historical record of social-democracy in
extending aphabetisation, schooling, and creative education for all, has no
parallel ... it stands as a major achievement of humanity ...
who could consider scandinavian states as non-creative? they have a very
strong record of technological innovation, and unlike Silicon Valley, they
do not achieve this by a brain drain from the rest of the world, but by
internal dynamics,

In the best of all possible worlds, a redundant and distributed storage of the Internet (cap ?I?) is both theoretically possible and desirable. However, as suggested by Raphael, is an important criteria, but ?relevance? is also the sticking point. What is ?relevant? is individually determined. Therefore, ?parts? of the Internet are necessary they are not sufficient unless you can provide the infrastructure to reconstruct the whole.
Raphael suggest that a semantic web would be a remedy. However, semantic web is most useful when applied to the whole data set rather that a subset unless the subset is connected to a whole with infrastructure and connected logics. In addition, semantic technologies increase overhead on infrastructures. Also, semantic rules are socially determined with sanctioned inferences.
Providing ?relevance? in searches is the holy grail of search engines as evidence by the rash of new technologies like Wolfram Alpha, Bing, Correlation based search, and new Google technologies etc.
Additionally, even Google has not been able to index all things Internet. Its spiders, while highly efficient, fall short by some estimates as much as 30%.
Finally, the Internet is not organized geographically and therefore ?local? does not have the same meaning.
As I often tell students, all thing are possible on the Internet if you have sufficient money, infrastructure, and will. Open-source (P2P) often lacks the first 2.
BTW, the wizard, Rabbit, Treasurer system is an excellent theoretical framework for such a project.

Michel, The Social Cloud [1,2] concept that have been posted in this list and at the P2P blog [3] a while a go could act as a backup network. Maybe with some difficulty for intercontinental data transmission, but at least could provide local communities with a resilient data management and communication system, even in case of major disruption of centralized services. Indeed, it would be possible to cache parts of the web on local storage devices and provide the locals with remote content in case of failure, using a mesh network, but I believe that keeping alive digital communication within local communities can be as, or even more important than having the whole Internet content available, but I agree that caching relevant portions of the Internet can be a good idea.

from With optical cables being cut in the Middle East impeding internet traffic in some geographical areas and a recent court action resulting in WikiLeaks being taken off line, it becomes clear that access to the net may not be as assured as we tend to think.
While the basic architecture of the net does protect to some degree against these dangers, I believe we might profit from developing a way to "back up the internet" so that, even if there are major disruptions, we still have a workable means of communication, data storage and exchange of ideas.
My dream is a p2p application that uses some of the free hard disk storage space on our personal computers to redundantly back up the net and allow work to continue more or less seamlessly in the event of a major catastrophe.
Would such a thing be doable? What do you think?

Why should it not be doable? I'm thinking that the current protocol may not be sufficient, because the idea of unique urls as the Internet is designed, maybe should be abandoned, or accompanied with some metadata.
I'm not an expert in networking, but I was thinking about this problem last week as well.

I see that there are lots of transatlantic fibres from the graphic you posted. Much less overland - or perhaps the overland connections do not show as much as they weave a finely distributed net.
Now the idea of a backup is not only for the connections but also for the content.
Connections are normally pretty good, but the cable cuts in the Middle East show that this is not to be taken as always assured. If we had some catastrophic occurrence, many of those cables could be disrupted, and as eggy says in his post, there could also be a political decision to cut us off. So on the connection side, probably a combination of cables backed up by satellite or some other long range means of communication, plus mesh networks for strengthening the local connectivity would be desirable.
For the data side, I envision distributed storage of a backup of data that would be immediately accessible in case of an emergency, where even a severely hampered net could still reconstruct much of the data from local copies. Actually the internet should be a bit like a hologram with its information content distributed in a redundant way on our own computers. There is a lot of unutilized disk space in personal computers that could be used for storing at least some of that wealth of information.

I too have concerns, however perhaps a bit different.
The cables cut would be like the T lines necessary for "our" internet being destroyed. That is purely a maintenance project, we can not personally replace these lines ourselves. This is a physical problem.
But other dangers exist. With the present self made unitarian executive, the internet could be taken away by policy. The next president will have all the power the present unitarian comrade does. I fear this more than physical sabotages. We must establish our "People Power" of this Nation so the government is subservient to the people.
Of course back up your sites on to your personal computer or get an extra drive for backups.
Another necessary back up would be to keep alternative methods to contact key people, who would store alternate addresses for our groups. In this way we could remain in contact by postal mail, fax, telephone, cell phone, pony express etc. Presently, to find boohoo or makaface (alias) out in the real world would be impossible. Of course this information needs to be confidential, however the owners of a site already have this information, on site. If the owner has this information on their home computer as a back up for instance, (secured) they could conceivably contact everyone by alternative method. If these key people were connected by alternative communication we could restore our "network" even if the net were broken, stolen, or taken from us.
You can trust the government, just ask any Indian. History reveals that many governments over rule of the people. Indeed our US Constitution provides for the people to eliminate the government and make new because this danger was forseen. So please do not except the delusion presented by the powers that be that we are secure. We make our own security, lock our own doors.
So let us begin to network, without the net.
Peace and security

I'm sure it can be done. I'm sure it will be done. Sooner or later. It's just so obvious and natural to do. FYI, a couple of years ago I wrote up a conceptual protocol that exactly does what you mention: storing redundant copies of every bit of information fully distributed over the net. I called it the Wizard, Rabbit and Treasurer. The Wizard is the illusionist, serving you your information in a smart way so you have the perception that it's always there.

I see you have done a lot of work on this. Much more than I ever imagined had been done. Need some time to study.
I hope others go see your Wizard, Rabbit and Treasurer pages, as well as the   Armillaria Project.
Thanks so much.

In the best of all possible worlds, a redundant and distributed storage of the Internet (cap ?I?) is both theoretically possible and desirable. However, as suggested by Raphael, is an important criteria, but ?relevance? is also the sticking point. What is ?relevant? is individually determined. Therefore, ?parts? of the Internet are necessary they are not sufficient unless you can provide the infrastructure to reconstruct the whole.
Raphael suggest that a semantic web would be a remedy. However, semantic web is most useful when applied to the whole data set rather that a subset unless the subset is connected to a whole with infrastructure and connected logics. In addition, semantic technologies increase overhead on infrastructures. Also, semantic rules are socially determined with sanctioned inferences.
Providing ?relevance? in searches is the holy grail of search engines as evidence by the rash of new technologies like Wolfram Alpha, Bing, Correlation based search, and new Google technologies etc.
Additionally, even Google has not been able to index all things Internet. Its spiders, while highly efficient, fall short by some estimates as much as 30%.
Finally, the Internet is not organized geographically and therefore ?local? does not have the same meaning.
As I often tell students, all thing are possible on the Internet if you have sufficient money, infrastructure, and will. Open-source (P2P) often lacks the first 2.
BTW, the wizard, Rabbit, Treasurer system is an excellent theoretical framework for such a project.

Michel, The Social Cloud [1,2] concept that have been posted in this list and at the P2P blog [3] a while a go could act as a backup network. Maybe with some difficulty for intercontinental data transmission, but at least could provide local communities with a resilient data management and communication system, even in case of major disruption of centralized services. Indeed, it would be possible to cache parts of the web on local storage devices and provide the locals with remote content in case of failure, using a mesh network, but I believe that keeping alive digital communication within local communities can be as, or even more important than having the whole Internet content available, but I agree that caching relevant portions of the Internet can be a good idea. It would be much simpler with a semantic web. Regards, [1]  [2] [3] Em 23-07-2010 00:43, Michel Bauwens escreveu: if this works, I'll continue,
sepp thanks for telling me how this arrives in your mailbox,
otherwise, any advice on how to do a clean copy would be appreciated,
from With optical cables being cut in the Middle East impeding internet traffic in some geographical areas and a recent court action resulting in WikiLeaks being taken off line, it becomes clear that access to the net may not be as assured as we tend to think.
While the basic architecture of the net does protect to some degree against these dangers, I believe we might profit from developing a way to "back up the internet" so that, even if there are major disruptions, we still have a workable means of communication, data storage and exchange of ideas.
My dream is a p2p application that uses some of the free hard disk storage space on our personal computers to redundantly back up the net and allow work to continue more or less seamlessly in the event of a major catastrophe.
Would such a thing be doable? What do you think?

  Bas ReusPermalink   Reply by   Bas Reus on February 19, 2008 at 6:28pm Send   Message Delete   Sepp, I definately agree with you. The Internet should be a decentralized network, but clearly this is not quite the case. There a too few connections between nodes worldwide.
Why should it not be doable? I'm thinking that the current protocol may not be sufficient, because the idea of unique urls as the Internet is designed, maybe should be abandoned, or accompanied with some metadata.
I'm not an expert in networking, but I was thinking about this problem last week as well.
Cheers, Bas

I see that there are lots of transatlantic fibres from the graphic you posted. Much less overland - or perhaps the overland connections do not show as much as they weave a finely distributed net.
Now the idea of a backup is not only for the connections but also for the content.
Connections are normally pretty good, but the cable cuts in the Middle East show that this is not to be taken as always assured. If we had some catastrophic occurrence, many of those cables could be disrupted, and as eggy says in his post, there could also be a political decision to cut us off. So on the connection side, probably a combination of cables backed up by satellite or some other long range means of communication, plus mesh networks for strengthening the local connectivity would be desirable.
For the data side, I envision distributed storage of a backup of data that would be immediately accessible in case of an emergency, where even a severely hampered net could still reconstruct much of the data from local copies. Actually the internet should be a bit like a hologram with its information content distributed in a redundant way on our own computers. There is a lot of unutilized disk space in personal computers that could be used for storing at least some of that wealth of information.

I too have concerns, however perhaps a bit different.
The cables cut would be like the T lines necessary for "our" internet being destroyed. That is purely a maintenance project, we can not personally replace these lines ourselves. This is a physical problem.
But other dangers exist. With the present self made unitarian executive, the internet could be taken away by policy. The next president will have all the power the present unitarian comrade does. I fear this more than physical sabotages. We must establish our "People Power" of this Nation so the government is subservient to the people.
Of course back up your sites on to your personal computer or get an extra drive for backups.
Another necessary back up would be to keep alternative methods to contact key people, who would store alternate addresses for our groups. In this way we could remain in contact by postal mail, fax, telephone, cell phone, pony express etc. Presently, to find boohoo or makaface (alias) out in the real world would be impossible. Of course this information needs to be confidential, however the owners of a site already have this information, on site. If the owner has this information on their home computer as a back up for instance, (secured) they could conceivably contact everyone by alternative method. If these key people were connected by alternative communication we could restore our "network" even if the net were broken, stolen, or taken from us.
You can trust the government, just ask any Indian. History reveals that many governments over rule of the people. Indeed our US Constitution provides for the people to eliminate the government and make new because this danger was forseen. So please do not except the delusion presented by the powers that be that we are secure. We make our own security, lock our own doors.
So let us begin to network, without the net.
Peace and security

As you say, Josef, there is little progress with respect to implementation. Also, I don't think that the idea of a distributed internet data backup has been touched upon in the ESP material.
Alas, we'll have to start from scratch, it seems.

I'm sure it can be done. I'm sure it will be done. Sooner or later. It's just so obvious and natural to do. FYI, a couple of years ago I wrote up a conceptual protocol that exactly does what you mention: storing redundant copies of every bit of information fully distributed over the net. I called it the Wizard, Rabbit and Treasurer. The Wizard is the illusionist, serving you your information in a smart way so you have the perception that it's always there. Anytime, anywhere, any device. The Rabbit is the one locally serving the Wizard and other, remote, Rabbits. In fact, the Rabbits implement the peer-to-peer infrastructure for volatile data. The Rabbit uses a local Wizard to permanently store data on non-volatile media.
For the protocol proza, please see   I also think that Sun's ZFS contains many pearls for implementing what you describe. Simply connect the storage devices through a network rather than through USB, SCSI or IDE. Must fix the timing (latency) issues of course.

I'd appreciate a definition ... feral makes me think of cannibals and such?
 FERAL TRADE
Feral trade ? the movement of goods within social spheres ? is a push
against not only our notion of art but against the paradigm of
global commerce.
see They do feral trade at the local volunteer cinema in Bristol, the Cube; they
do it with coffee, buying the cinema's supply of coffee direct from a small
ground of Nicaraguan farmers.
Also there is a larger business, Hotel Chocolat - a retail outlet that gets
all it's cocoa from one village - I wonder if that is also feral trade?

Until today I had never heard the term "feral" applied to trade. My response
was a guess. On that note, "free trade" refers to trade without tariffs,
taxation, or preferential regulation. In my mind "feral" trade would be
beneath the radar of all authority. For example, a carpenter builds a
cabinet and sells it for (unreported) cash or does an in-kind trade.
IMHO, smuggling could be considered feral trade. (just a guess)

This sounds very close to definitions of "Free Trade".  I wonder how
it is different?
Are "Free Trade" advocates against income-tax and sales-tax since they
inhibit (punish) exchange?
What about "Feral Trade" adherents?
