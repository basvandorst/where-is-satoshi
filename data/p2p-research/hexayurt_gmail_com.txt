Just while we're here, please don't conflate the hexayurt and the  cube (which, well, always had six sides.) The cube has twice the  materials use per square foot, half the surface-to-volume ratio  (giving much less insulation for a given R value of wall) and no  meaningful internal triangulation which will cause all kinds of  structural issues if you work in lighter materials.
  It's not an equivalent structure, nor even a related one. If you  want to insulate with fiberglass there are reasons for building the  cube, but (as I've said elsewhere) my strong preference is for  reflective insulations like reflectix on hexayurts.
