I long for the day when nation states are obsolete.
A time when where you come from what faith you have are irrelevant.
As a poetess rapper friend of mine Angel says:
"mother earth is the place of all our births"
To me global population will very obviously fall as availability of energy
falls (until we've all got our own open source solar concentrator CHP unit
of course!).
The only reason there are so many people on Earth now is because we've been
able to use massive amounts of fossil energy to help grow massive amounts of
food. More food, more people. Or more energy, more food, more people.
Of course, its not just our fossil energy supplies that are depleted either.
Fresh water (used mainly for agriculture) is increasingly scare. Soil
erosion is a massive global problem. With rising temperatures and falling
water supplies, grain harvests are falling. In recent month both India and
China stopped exporting grain.
As for energy, I just read this excellent article by Rob Hopkin's:
The Art of Falling Apart: do we ever learn from our mistakes? (Grangemouth,
peak oil and catastrophic hard drive failures)?
I highly recommend his book, The Transition Handbook

Hi Michel,
I think we chose ning because it is simple, free and featureful and
therefore we've got nothing to loose.
Ideally it would be open source too (its not, although they do let you
download your source if you want).
I think the biggest reason is: why not?
After all, I've already learnt lots more about some of the faces and people
behind the e-mail addressses on these lists, and if we're all going to work
together to build a p2p world (which we are) then we need to know who each
other are and start building trusting relationships :)

Hi all,
I think all this talk of profit/ economics etc. is a distraction (certainly
for the average person on the street - they don't care about nor need to
understand this stuff) and that this point above - about how to formally
agree to share stuff -  is far more interesting and worthy of discussion.
Your work on this complements Chris Cooks ideas very nicely and I'm
implementing them :)
(but, I do agree with you Patrick that profit should rightly be considered a
investment by the consumer because that is exactly what it is -- although in
the present system it is more like a coerced donation. I often wonder why
those who campaign for lower taxes don't also campaign for lower profits too
- to me they are essentially the same thing)
At last years Big Green Gathering here in the UK I was telling people about
plans to get a bunch of people to start pooling the time, resources (e.g.
Solar panels, wind turbines etc.) and money, to invest in more shared
resources/ infrastructure.
People were generally positive and keen to get involved but almost
universally said that the hardest thing about it would be deciding how to
store, maintain and distribute stuff efficiently and fairly (both existing
resources people are willing to share, and new resources purchased
Say a group of people pooled some money in order to purchase a mass dvd
duplication machine. Where would it live? Who would be responsible for it?
Under what terms would people be able to use it? What happens if it breaks?
etc. These are questions that are both hard to answer and often not
transferable to other goods and services (e.g. storage of a large vehicle
would bring different challenges).
A group that is working on this stuff in a very practical way is the newly
formed "Activist Tat Collective":  - inspirational stuff
Cooperative consumer ownership is quite rare today
Thankfully not that rare (in fact, co-ops globally employ far more people
than multinationals) and there is a massively growing amount of
co-operatives at the moment (especially in Latin America) :)
(BTW, I don't personally believe in either consumer nor worker ownership. I
believe in stakeholder ownership -- e.g. consumers AND workers AND suppliers
etc - anyone who contributes or is effected).
Indeed, when I was in Caracas for the World Social Forum (I was part of an
international team flown out there to help organise and run a free software
festival see  ) I gave a talk about The Open
Co-op  and was inspired by the response; here in the UK (and
probably even more so in North America) even well educated and well meaning
people tend to assume that co-operative stuff just won't work or isn't
efficient. In Venezuela I found a much more refreshing response; to them
cooperation is simply obvious common sense that clearly works and is clearly
better (I think this is in part due to their indigenous culture that is very
much based on solidarity and mutually).
The same day I gave my talk about The Open Co-op, I met a Venezuelan friend
of a friend whose job was basically DOING what we were dreaming about.
In Venezuela they have TWO economic Ministries; the standard one that is not
much different from what we have in the UK or US but also MINEP the Ministry
of Popular Economy. This is who my friend of a friend worked for. They run/
organise courses in socialism and cooperativism. After completing the 10
week course pupils are then asked to choose a trade they would like to get
into. Pupils are then put on apprenticeship and after that are encouraged to
set-up a co-op. Its great! :)
Another example is shared ownership of a vacation house.  The
The most common version of this is of course Housing Co-operatives.
I live in London's longest running Housing Co-op ( )
and benefit from ridiculously cheap (compared to the rest of London) rent
(less than ?50 a week including all bills, council tax and broadband)
because there is no landlord taking away profit - collectively we are our
own landlord and effectively pay ourselves rent.
Moreover, our ridiculously cheap rent is actually more than our costs.
There, when I moved in a couple of years ago we had amassed a surplus of
over ?500,000!
This has recently been spent on the Carbon 60 project (an effort to reduce
our Carbon emissions by 60%) and we've become the first whole street in the
UK to ecorefurbish (we've not got cavity wall and loft insulation plus solar
water and woodchip boilers for hot water and heating)
I've got lots more relevant thoughts and experiences to share, but I'm not
too good at writing; it takes me far too long to write coherently, because
my mind just doesn't work in a linear way and texts are linear.

No, I was just saying that people don't need to understand economics and how
to treat profit in order to participate in (or even initiate) news systems.
Like Sam, I'm less interested in discussing economics (did enough of that at
LSE and since) and more interested in practical experiments and projects.
Personally I think the most basic assumptions of economics (e.g. that humans
are all greedy short-term selfish thinkers and actors) are idiotic and
therefore it is not at all surprising that present day mainstream economists
come up with idiotic systems and solutions.
That is not actually true.
By far the biggest Co-op in the world is the UK's Co-operative Group that is
a consumer co-op owned by its customers. It has a turnover of over ?9billion
a year and grew out of people getting together to  bulk buy food together.
Sadly the Co-op isn't anywhere as radical as it could be (and most members
and workers don't actually feel empowered in any meaningful way)
Also, in the US and Ireland for example, by far the most popular form of
co-op (in terms of the number of members they've got) are Credit Unions, not
workers co-ops.
OK, so perhaps believe wasn't the right word to use. I don't think truth is
There are no absolute truths.  At least that is my take on it.
And even if there are theoretical truths, theory is a distant cousin of
I agree a person may contribute with either money or work or maybe in
Heh, nice examples :)
I don't think the plumber should gain partial ownership of the house, no.
At least not directly.
But they should be partial owners of the land the house is on and the house
owner should be paying ground rent for the land the house occupies into a
community fund that is distributed as a basic income. Or something like that
anyway :)
Yes, as Sam has similarly said, I think we agree about theory and how we'd
like to see things set-up. Let's set things up and see how we go :)
Sanford has no set way to deal with these issues and tends to deal with them
on an ad hoc basis.
In the case of the "Carbon 60 project" majority agreement was sought and
gained a number of times but that isn't the kind of divisible control you're
talking about.
However, as part of the project we're getting all our kitchens re-done and
one house has decided it wants to do its own kitchen.
They put together a some good designs and a decent plan and now have simply
been allocated the same amount of money that was going to be spent of their
kitchen as a budget to manage themselves.
In another recent case some members argued against the Co-op giving a ?1000
budget to the Permaculture group to build some quality raised beds to grow
food in on the basis that they wont provide enough food for everyone - "Why
should we contribute towards something we're not going to benefit from?"
Other members quickly pointed out it was just a start etc. but also that not
everyone benefits from the plays the theatre group put on, nor even the
annual street party but they both get budgets. The Permaculture group got
the money and we've not got some fantastic raised beds :)

Most people I know who are p2p advocates (including me) get around
this by assuming that it is totally within the realms of reality that
(before we can print anything, if we ever can) a large co-operative
venture (perhaps between small local p2p producers) could actually get
a state-of-the-art factory like the Fab36 quoted in the article.
We might not agree with the tax system that generates funds huge gov't
projects (for much of it is utter madness) but there is nothing about
reality that stops large communities of people mutually agreeing to
pool money/capital/time/resources on a similar scale.
Mondragon might not be as p2p as some would like:
but they are 7th largest business group in Spain and have their own
Universitys etc:
In 2007 the Co-operative Group in the UK had an annual turnover of
?9.4bn and 87,000 employees serving around 10 million customers a week
through food, healthcare, travel, funeral care and financial services.
These examples might not be pure p2p, but there are very much closely
aligned and demonstrate to me (in the same way linux and wikipedia do)
the scalability of co-operation :)
But since I'm tired and I think I'm replying to off-list cc's and wiki

Yeah, it could generally be made easier.
Saying that, the first time I used it was within Thunderbird e-mail
client (which has an rss reader built in) and so it was essentially
exactly like e-mail (with any rules I had set-up working pretty much
exactly the same)
Some forums even let you reply with e-mail to, but not often enough in my book.
So, yeah, what said about having to go to many places to reply is
sometimes a problem (although its getting closer to being solved with
stuff like  and similar tools)
And I appreciate people thinking about use of scarce resources. Bytes
and bandwidth don't just cost money, they cost real resources like
energy too.
But saying that you should never ever use html when sending to lists
as a bit like saying you should never ever use non-energy-saving light
bulbs. Yes, it makes perfect logical sense. But in the overall scheme
of things it's not a big issue.
As for checking mail and the web on your phone a) slow down ;) b) that
is what mobile versions of apps are for, to automatically cut out the
bits you don't need.
I've not actually used it, but I assume mobile gmail and similar
services are pretty good at this (in the same way gmail automatically
doesn't show you the non-snipped stuff unless you want to see it).
Someone I know recently got upset when I didn't really care too much
about the fact a small UK record label has got the word "aboriginal"
in their name, but do nothing to help aboriginal people (nor do they
purport to).
I asked him why he hadn't e-mailed be about biopiracy if he cares so
much protecting aboriginal intellectual property (which is what he
said he was doing by denouncing this record label).
So, if you care so much about wasteful use of resources, why have you
not yet e-mailed the list (or have you? sorry, can't be bothered to
check the online archives, ;) ) about a banking system that discounts
the future and incentivises pillaging of the Earth! :P

Hey all,
Bit by bit, the Plexnet dream is being realised =)
Some of you may know about Mozilla Ubiquity:
* It's a Firefox extension that allows for commands to be written quite
easily in Javascript -- a peer-to-peer application framework (based on
doing mashups of web apps). They are still a way off but the core idea
is pretty sound -- some of you may recall it as what I used to refer
to as creating a command line for the internet...
Then, earlier today, Google announced a new web browser (Google Chrome):
* * It's a pretty decent browser which uses Webkit (the same rendering
engine as used by Safari/Konqueror/iPhone/new iPhones), a new
super-fast javascript engine called V8 and a nice sandboxed feature
which means that if one tab (web app) dies then your whole browser
doesn't crash.
Now, I was going to code up a minimal "Plexnet Browser" based on
Webkit. But Chrome takes it a lot further -- including porting Webkit
to Microsoft Windows. Ironically, they've only got a Windows build of
Chrome available atm -- the Linux and OS X builds should appear before
the end of the month.
And, given the added features that Chrome offers, I'd like to shift
the Plexnet Browser to take advantage of this. For simple reasoning,
just check out the crazy performance advantage:
* Whilst I can do minimal wrapping of Webkit in Objective-C, I'm not a
C++ coder, so am never going to be able to pull it off. Which is where
you come in =)
I need your help to do the following:
# Add a Minimal Extensions support
I spoke with Aaron Boodman -- the dude behind the GreaseMonkey Firefox
extension. He's one of the main guys at the Google Chrome team
responsible for Extensions. In his words, defining the Extensions
framework for Chrome is wide open...
Mozilla Ubiquity is a very simple extension -- it uses very little of
Firefox's extensions mechanism. It's mainly just running some
"chrome-privileged" javascript and interacting with the DOM. So from
the Chrome Extensions support, all I really need is:
* Sandboxed Extension execution -- check out the Sandboxed Plugins execution
* Loading of "chrome-privileged" javascript
* Access to the Renderer's DOM and making URI calls
* Simple preferences pane for the Extension in HTML
# Mplayer Plugin
Native support for the Mplayer Plugin:
Webkit's support for HTML 5's  and  elements needs to be
hijacked to be supported by all formats supported by the Mplayer
Plugin's (or any plugin's for that matter) Javascript API. I'd be
happy to work on the JS bit...
# Removing of Bookmarks
I find it surprising that they kept bookmarks -- it's like including
floppy disk drives in today's computers! With Ubiquity and the
capacity to dynamically add functionality like this -- e.g.
integration with delicious, I see no reason for legacy bookmarking
# Removing of Gears
This is not a priority, so feel free to skip it. But, I'd like to have
it removed if it is just sitting around wasting memory needlessly.
Gears is in some ways a competitive element to some of the Plexnet
protocols. But, sadly, it's a shit competitor. It's not defined in a
peer-to-peer way at all. I spent a few days earlier this year trying
to make it useful, but sadly it doesn't do anything that wouldn't be
better enabled by the Ubiquity-esque extension support making calls to
a local HTTP server.
# Multi-Platform Build
Chromium (the open source code base behind Chrome) should build on OS
X and Linux in the next week or so. I'd like to have a build for the
iPhone/iPodTouch as well -- incorporating any elements of the
multi-touch events that might be missing from Apple's iPhone Safari
implementation and Google's Android Webkit modification.
A little bit of rebranding needs to take place for all builds as the
"Plexnet Browser". By default, all builds should start up a Plexnet
node in the background if one isn't already running. This is a Python
2.6 application that I will provide.
Let me know what you can do for this -- every line of code would help.
Thanks!! *kiss*

Just a quick note to let you know that I've started a new blog about the
global financial crisis and how I think we need to respond:
If you're interested please subscribe to the RSS feed for new entries and
leave comments to get some discussion going.
All the writing is inspired by the Green New Deal, a report recently
published by the New Economics Foundation (authors include NEF directors and
the Guardian Economics editor). The Hub Kings Cross will hopefully soon host
an event where the Green New Deal will be presented/discussed.
