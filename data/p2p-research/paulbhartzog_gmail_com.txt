*****  To join INSNA, visit   *****
           2nd Workshop on Social Aspects of the Web (SAW 2008)
                            in conjunction with
 11th International Conference on Business Information Systems (BIS 2008)
                            Innsbruck, Austria
                            May 5, 6 or 7, 2008
                         Deadline for submissions: January 12, 2008
In recent years, the Web has moved from a simple one-way communication
channel extending traditional media, to a complex "peer-to-peer"
communication space with a blurred author/audience distinction and new
ways to create, share and use knowledge in a social way.
This change of paradigm is currently profoundly transforming most areas of
our life: our interactions with other people, our relationships, ways of
gathering information, ways of developing social norms, opinions,
attitudes and even legal aspects as well as ways of working and doing
It also raises a strong need for theoretical, empirical and applied
studies related to how people may interact on the Web, how they actually
do so and what new possibilities and challenges are emerging in the
social, business and technology dimensions.
The goal of this workshop is to bring researchers and practitioners
together to explore the issues and challenges related to social aspects of
the Web. We want to facilitate discussion on topics including theoretical,
empirical and applied studies related to:
TOPICS OF INTEREST
* Users in the social Web
    * User identity/identities on the Web
    * Activity patterns
    * Privacy / intimacy in the social Web
    * Psychological aspects of acting in the social Web
    * Analysis and reduction of the socio-technical gap in social software
* Communities on the Web
    * User roles, leadership and interactions
    * Conflicts and their resolution
    * Social norms and their enforcement
    * Trust and reputation in communities
    * Relations of on-line and off-line communities
    * Social discourse and decision-taking on the Web
* Large-scale social Web mining and empirical studies
    * Social network analysis
    * Associations mining from social network
    * Large-scale behaviour patterns and anomalies' mining
    * Moods' / opinions' / social problems' analysis
    * Experts finding on the social Web
    * Mining formal semantics from social sources
    * Methodologies of Web-based social macro and micro studies
* Social Web and business
    * Social Web as a source of business information
    * Social Web as a business communication channel

@_subject: [p2p-research] discussion on Capital and Class issue 
I definitely agree with what has been said by others (George, Sam, etc.)
1) all this interest is a GOOD thing
2) I have submitted an idea to the Capital and Class project that is
different than what we spoke about at the workshop and more in keeping
with their themes
if Theory, Culture, and Society is interested also, then Rick and I
would probably do something more along the lines of Social Publishing,
although, to be honest and up front, we ARE working this material over
the next year into a book project (non-academic).  Any leads for
publishers/editors/etc. would be greatly appreciated (we are thinking
along the lines of a publicly consumed artifact like The Long Tail or
Smart Mobs; smart but easily accessible).
A "P2P World" book (as Andreas suggested) is also feasible.  I see two
crucial concerns in all of this:
1) retention of copyright(left).  I flat out will not publish for a
journal or book project that does not let me retain copyright(left).
2) non-duplication.  I really don't want to publish the same piece
with slight variations in multiple places.  I would rather see clearly
delineated themes in these various enterprises and be able to target
my writing/contribution towards the appropriate theme.
my 2 cents.  other thoughts?
all in all, very glad to be included :-)
much thx,

@_subject: [p2p-research] disagreement by deletion/addition 
conversation starter:
Deletionism, or Disagreement by Deletion
long time ago in my naive days
Sunir Shah and I got talking about what was good about wikis.
one of the key things was:
1) disagreement by deletion
2) disagreement by addition
DbD was the old-school political philosophy of exclusive practice,
i.e. deciding who is "in" and who is "out"
DbA was the new-school of pluralization, pluralism, and conversation,
i.e. including perspectival acknowledgement as part of the process
I actually used to lecture that this was a KEY reason why wikis are
politically revolutionary, which is that by using DbA they
1) mesh with a multivocal world
2) function on inclusion instead of fragmentation (echo chamber)
Now we see the "new" spaces, turning into "old" spaces
by adopting the same rules as the old.
Is this a historical inevitability.  Will new open spaces that emerge,
ALWAYS become co-opted by the old rules systems?  Will they
ALWAYS be forced (as they scale?) to adopt the old rules?

thx Frank
my only "addition" would be related to I have maintained for some time, that what a network culture practice
like open-editing actually does is make chronically apparent that our
desire for a comfortable distinction between "facts" and "opinions" is
(and always was) hopeless.
Facts are simply statements supported by widely held opinions about
methods of validating facticity.  Large scale cooperative knowledge
construction puts this dilemma right out in the open (whichlike).

At the very least, we have a lot of literature and history of
engagement in political theory with the paradox of tolerance:  to
tolerate the intolerant?  whom to tolerate?
(e?)valuation and exclusion of those without pants ( ;-) )  toleration
always ressurrects the basic political problem of inclustion/exclusion

perhaps an interesting scholar/work
James D. Herbsleb
Associate Professor, Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon
Open Source Ecologies
Abstract --
Open source software communities, once primarily the realm of volunteer
"hobbyists," have become a powerful mechanism enabling cooperative
construction of public goods.  Firms, volunteers, foundations,
consultants and others participate in a wide variety of ways, forming a
complex network of relationships -- an ecology.  In this talk I will
describe preliminary results from two studies that seek to shed light on
how these ecologies function.  First is a qualitative study of how the
Eclipse ecology solves the problem of allowing competitors to
collaborate over distance in the creation of a common platform, while
simultaneously building competing products on top of the platform.
Second is a study of the how the ongoing influx of commercial developers
affects volunteer participation in the Gnome community.  Our results
show that the influx tends to drive volunteers away from the particular
modules the commercial developers work on, but "well-behaved" commercial
developers actually attract new volunteers to the project.  I will
conclude with a few conjectures and open problems.
Bio --
James D. Herbsleb is Associate Professor of Computer Science and
Director of the Software Industry Center at Carnegie Mellon
University. His research interests lie primarily in the intersection of
software engineering and computer-supported cooperative work, focusing
on such areas as geographically-distributed development teams, open
source software development, and more generally on coordination in
software engineering. He holds a JD (1980) and a PhD in psychology
(1984) from the University of Nebraska, and an MS in computer science
(1991) from the University of Michigan.
After completing a post-doctoral fellowship at the University of
Michigan, he moved to Carnegie Mellon's Software Engineering Institute,
where he led an effort to empirically validate the CMM for Software. He
then joined the Software Production Research Department at Lucent
Technologies, where he initiated and led the Bell Labs Collaboratory
Project, which conducted empirical studies and designed collaborative
technologies and practices for global software development. He is
currently PI on two NSF-funded projects investigating various aspects of
collaborative software engineering. His research interests are in
geographically-distributed software engineering, open source software
development, collaboration over distance, and tools and technologies
that support coordination.
The Collaboratory for Research on Electronic Work (CREW) is composed
of students and faculty who are interested in the novel ways of
working made possible by new information technologies.  Once a month,
CREW hosts a public seminar. All are welcome.  For more information

@_subject: [p2p-research] Fwd: arguments against applying open/free to 
Just a quick chime in here....
Even if it is true that artists couldn't make a living in the
industrial era infrastructure (or even if we just allow that it was
harder), the economics of the long tail change everything.
All that is required is to make enough money to sustain a practice and
that has always meant simply reaching enough sources willing to funnel
money to the artist.  This has been greatly facilitated by
technologies of cooperation.  Most of the sustainable music on sites
like Rhapsody is in the long tail.  The 'hits-based' curve is history.

@_author: Paul B. Hartzog 
@_subject: [p2p-research] CoLiberation 
Although I never coined 'coliberation' (which I love)
I DID make the case a few years back
that there are kinds of cooperation that
1) constrain you
2) but enable new possibilities
and that if the benefit of the new possibilities outweighs
the cost of the constraint, then the two parties are "liberated"
The key is in understanding that they were ALREADY BOUND beforehand,
but that they were bound to a system in which they did not cooperate.
Again, it is a choice between being constrained/empowered by what you
are doing now,
being constrained/empowered by doing something else (cooperating).
To make the point I used TCP/IP but any language will work.  It goes like this:
BEFORE inventing a language that enables communication, two parties
occupy a "space of possibilities."  AFTER inventing a language that
enables communication, the two parties occupy a NEW space.
The crucial point is that communication DOES NOT simply mean that they
can now cooperate on things that they were already doing individually
before (like farming).  What it means to be in a NEW space, is that
now they can contemplate, design, and execute things that were not
even considerable before, and which would never have even been thought
of (like building cities).
To make THAT point, I have used symbiosis of plant roots and fungi.
It is NOT the case that the fungi were doing their thing, and so were
the tree roots, and they teamed up to do it better.  Symbiosis enable
the new tree/fungus hybrid organism to consider utilizing (eating)
resources that were not even possible before.  For example, now the
fungus can metabolize a substance for the tree that the fungus itself
would never have metabolized before (because it had no use for it),
and the tree can do the same for the fungus.  It's only in combination
that they see the new resources.
An economic example would be producing a product for which you have NO
use, simply so you can trade it with someone who DOES want it, for
something that you want, that they are producing and do not use
themselves.  (Globalization has brought this to the fore, as factories
produce items purely for export to regions of the world other than
where the factory is located).
hope that helps,

@_subject: [p2p-research] Of possible interest? 
Bearing in mind that I am embedded in my own biases and academic
circles, but a cursory look suggests that this paper lacks a number of
what I consider vital references.
The paper mentions a variety of topics: robust networks, network
warfare, epistemic communities, and global governance.  Oddly, in each
category it fails to cite major works by definitive authors.
For example, in robust networks there is little or no mention of
Strogatz, or Newman, or Watts, or Barab?si.  A typical citation could
have been:
Network Robustness and Fragility: Percolation on Random Graphs
Duncan S. Callaway, M. E. J. Newman, Steven H. Strogatz, and Duncan J. Watts
In "net-centric warfare" they do not cite anything from the large
corpus of authoritative works by Ronfeldt and Arquilla (all available
for free from RAND).
The only citation for Barab?si is his popular-press book "Linked."
In epistemic communities only P. Haas. "Introduction: Epistemic
Communities" not other in-depth sources.
The only citation for Newman is: M. E. J. Newman. Detecting Community
Structure in Networks
While they do cite Casti, it is obscure.  Also they do cite S. N.
Dorogovtsev and J. F. F. Mendes. "Evolution of networks" which,
although good, is I believe more like a textbook than a good source.
Hope this helps.  It is a very interesting paper after all. :-)

in these networks.  I we could somehow mobilize broader scale
cooperation, we might cross a critical-mass threshold.  I think one of
the key reasons none of these players HAVE crossed those thresholds is
that they are keeping a sort of "walled garden" based on their own
evolutionary histories etc. (I know I have been guilty of this for

@_subject: [p2p-research] THIRD WORLD UNIVERSITIES FORUM 
I think the structure of future education will follow the same pattern
as other architectures Sam Rose and I have been developing:
Inputs --> Accreditors/Imprimaturs -->  Outputs
Multiple sites of production/learning provide individuals with a
variety of acquired "codes" i.e. buckets of knowledge.  Constellations
of these acquisitions can be "officiated" or endorsed by a variety of
institutions who are willing and capable of so endorsing (there's a
political process to decide who gets to endorse).  These
constellations are manifold, overlapping and interpenetrating:
studying anything in isolation loses meaning under panarchical network
culture.  The outputs (blogs, micros, journals, etc.) are simply a
plurality of venues/streams which the learned are expected or at the
very least permitted to channel their intellectual products.
The institutions that find a good balance between accepting not too
many but not too few kinds of learning, and can provide the most
useful constellations and route their proteges' work to the widest
variety of "quality" outlets (yes, that's a hedge), will become the
"universities" of the 22nd Century.
To be concrete,
A "university" that recognizes scholarly and mass publications as well
as social media presence (blogging, YouTube-ing, open courseware-ing,
etc), and is willing to let their faculty publish in open access
journals, retain copyright, remix, etc. will attract the most
interesting (and therefore "learned") network era intellects.

As usual Sam is right on the money here.
In Kevin Kelly's 'New Rules' book he points out that projects that
succeed will do so because they will 'feed the network first' i.e.
they will be part of a successful ecology of producers.
I wish we could get more small businesses and cooperative workgroups
to realize that in order to succeed they need to first seek out the
others in their ecology that constitute complements to their own work,
producer bigger feedback loops, and more sustainability.
Tough road though.....

interesting that you should say this,
as I was just saying the other day,
that I am increasingly finding the following to be true:
1)  younger people treat my arguments as if they are self-evident and
so trivial as to be not worth mentioning
2)  older people treat my arguments as if they are data to be fought,
resisted, and thwarted
In other words,
the only audience for my arguments is people for whom these truths are
not self-evident
and who aren't really interested in listening anyway.
ironic, no?
