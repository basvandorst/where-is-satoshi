@_subject: [p2p-research] Links for article on Creative Commons Ecosystem 
I just got a commission to write an article about (copying straight
from my assignment letter):
"The Creative Commons Ecosystem: what websites there are,
what communities there are, what great remixes there are, etc, for
music, art, and so on"
I'm going to quote  of
course, and use the links provided there, but if anybody here has a
relevant link he or she would like to see quoted or just share here on
list, please tell.
Thank you in advance for any pointer,
      Marco Fioretti

@_subject: [p2p-research] text as code 
Sorry, no.  Those who look down on people who can't or don't like to
code are RMS, the Free SW Foundation and everybody else thinking in
that way. My work and much of my writings go exactly in the opposite
I do NOT look down etc etc . I have only explicitly, specifically said
that what is perfectly acceptable and without consequences for the
average Internet user who makes one Wikipedia entry per year or one
short blog post per month or some short chat on Facebook, sooner or
later becomes an handicap for that one in 10000 person who wants/needs
to do the specific heavy work you do 24/7. And added that in general
it may be in YOUR interest, because of YOUR specific profession and
needs, to do something about it, both to save yourself from future
stress and to become much more productive in the long run.
? Have you realized that I said exactly the opposite in my previous
post, agreeing that if this is what is happening in this specific case
you're right to dislike it and to ask that it stops?

@_subject: [p2p-research] On Alex Rollin stated intentions to expel me 
These are just hypotheses of mine:
regular wikipedia contributors are wonderful people... that have
freely decided to waste huge amounts of their own time fighting
against trolls that continuously rewrite andvandalize pages for the
fun of it, just because everybody must have write access. And endure
heartburn from that and many other causes. It continuously amazes
me. So I guess that this specific feature, if really is so heavily
used, is the last of their problems.
maybe it was included in the software simply because in the very first
days there were so little users, all good guys and knowing each other,
that nobody thought seriously about future issues like scalability,
trolls, astroturfing and the like. Just like it happened to email,
which eventually led to spam.
