I *hate* deletionism. Arguing for deletion of articles on net theorists because they have mainly published on the net is madness. Though, maybe, it is mostly young males influenced by natural science and just learning the skills of using references who represent the tendency. Hate the sin, not the sinner, eh? I would love to see a ultra-inclusionist wikipedia from which nothing but advertisement and illegal stuff would be deleted.
In any case, I tried to improve the article by adding a little bit on the CTheory article.

@_subject: [p2p-research] discussion on Capital and Class issue 
Hello all,
I do remember that Andreas mentioned in an early e-mail that a journal was interested in the possible papers of the seminar. I think he might even have said something on this in the final discussion. I didn't react then or later 'cause I didn't perceive any conflict of interest. As I understood it, Andreas had in mind a publication of the papers of the seminar, with possible influence from the journal, while Phoebe's idea was more a special issue around the themes. In any case, I myself expect to keep on writing on these issues and any number of possible publication venues is fine for me. So, the proposal I sent to Phoebe involves a second author, a colleague of mine, and would tilt things toward capital and class, and my seminar paper "as is" is still looking for a place to be published...

Hello all,
Next friday I'll be taking part in a small seminar organised by Demos Helsinki on "Climate change, intellectual property rights and technology transfer". The idea is to discuss models of technology transfer to combat climate change and how ipr are standing in the way and how open/p2p models can help. I would be very grateful if you could point me to some examples and cases of open/p2p technology transfer/co-operation especially between the north and south.

@_subject: [p2p-research] [P2P Foundation] From Citizendium To Eduzendium 
The cure to this in F/LOSS is forking. Seems to me this should be soon done to Wikipedia; not necessarily changing much of the rules or settings, simply just forking. I would love an super-inclusionist fork, where only advertisement and spam is deleted.
The advantage of a inclusionist-Wikipedia fork over Citizendium would be one of knowledge-production. I agree, Citizendium is probably the model for creating a reliable encyclopedia. But an i-Wikip would give a possibility to freedoms that might bring about new types of knowledges -unpoliced, unauthorised, street-level knowledges. This is what is always missing from an encyclopedia, and, sadly, the Wikip has been veering to a direction that will miss it, too. The power of a good Wikipedia is precisely the fact that there are more artciles on Pokemon than on Sociology.

@_subject: [p2p-research] Health implications of wireless 
I have been following these discussions with one eye after having been involved with some neuroscientists doing studies in Sweden (Antti Revonsuo, Sakari Kallio).
Last week, we had a discussion in my place of work, a university dept, over the placement of wifi routers. A colleague had measured top emissions of over 1000 milliwats from the routers at peak bursts (over 100 times more than regular mobile phones). If some people get, allegedly, trouble over mobiles, then the wifis are much more of a problem. (We decided to move the routers further away).
The main problem, as I understand it, is that the official standards (like the IEEE or the Finnish ministry for health regulations) are based on fairly old research that looks only/mainly at the temperature elevation. What the people found in Sweden & other places in the late 90's/early 00's was that mobile radiation (not talking to the phone) had an effect on *cognitive* function. There are also the effects on *biological* function, discussed in this thread. Now the problem is that the known physical effect, i.e., elevated temperature, has no known causal link to either the cognitive or the biological effects. This means that the radiation is doing something (the cognitive, biological effects), the causal mechanism of which we do not know, and which, accordingly, is not taken into account in the standards & regulations.
The whole is complicated by the fact that all of this (mobiles, wifis) is waves, producing real-life interference phenomena that are very hard to study in laboratory conditions. (Imagine an airport bus after a plane has landed and everybody switches their mobiles and laptops on at the same time -- the waves are bound to interact in messy ways.)
Well, what left the most profound impression on me was that none of the neuroscientists I knew allowed their children using mobiles.

Dear peers & peeresses,
We have finally published the open access book entitled "Wikiworld -
Political Economy and the Promise of Participatory Media" that has
already been mentioned on the list earlier. We hope that you find it of
interest in your work. Please feel free to download (pdf) and link the
book from Political Economy and the Promise of Participatory Media
In the digital world of learning there is a progressive transformation
from the institutionalized and individualized forms of learning to open
learning and collaboration. The book provides a critical view on the use
of new technologies and learning practices in furthering socially just
futures, while at the same time paying critical attention to the
constants, or ?unmoved movers? of the information society development;
the West and Capitalism. The essential issue in the Wikiworld is one of
freedom ? levels and kinds of freedom. Our message is clear: we write
for the radical openness of education for all.

This sounds great. Also here various co-ops & local economies were a big part of the landscape before WWII; then in the 80's and 90's everybody went crazy with the market boom and finally even the co-op banks and local stores collapsed. Now we have to learn those things again, too.
Yeah, and ideologies suck, anyway. The thing that first got me interested in Free Software and stuff was precisely that Stallman & co didn't just complain when they saw what was happening (altough they did that too, and engaged in "resistance"), but rather started writing a free operating system from scratch. It took 20 years, but they did it.
I guess a part of the reason why Juha & I want to use the term "socialism" (apart from trying to be provocative) has to do with "owning up" to what one is doing & being aware of a tradition. Just the other day Juha found in one of Eben Moglen's essays a sentence that is directly lifted out of the Communist Manifesto, with no indication or reference of that, of course. While I understand that Moglen, Stallman etc. don't want to be pigeon-holed in a negative way, the situation for us is quite different, and avoiding the "s" word would feel awkward.

Or then it may not. Given current knowledge, it is possible - indeed the 'received' view in the physics community, the Copenhagen interpretation - that individual quantum phenomena are genuinely random. It is also possible that there are quantum phenomena that are relevant for the functioning of the human nervous system (e.g., the retina reacts to a single photon; exocytosis relies on quantum tunneling, etc.). If these quantum phenomena have some cognitive/experiental relevance (and there is very little reason to say that they don't, if we already accept that the nervous system and cognition are somehow coupled), then there is a very natural way that genuine randomness may be a part of human cognition/experience, and also behaviour.

No? What about Bohr contra EPR? At least Einstein found that argument sound, even though he tried to find holes in it for years. In fact, some people have claimed that Bohr's argument for complementarity is one of the most beautiful & precise arguments in the history of natural science. Some of those people are mathematicians.
If you mean that randomness was forced upon physicists by empirical results, and that there were no pre-existing strong theoretical arguments, then I would agree (maybe). But after the fact, after the experiments like black-body radiation, double-slit interference etc., several rigorous theoretical arguments have appeared, out of which Bohr's and Heisenberg's are only the best known. (The funny thing is that Heisenberg was trying to device a counter-argument, which turned out to be an argument, after all.)
 From the perspective of
Oh but it does. The whole point of Bohr's argument is that quantum randomness is of a different kind than classical ("deterministic but not measurably so in this universe") randomness. Quantum randomness is not an effect of dependence of initial conditions, but a physical "brute" fact. Therefore whatever your interpretation of quantum mechanics (the mathematics of it), you are bound to have something non-classical in nature (complementarity, incompleteness, uncertainty, many-worlds, or what have you). One place where the difference appears is, for instance, the question of whether quantum particles have a unique path from source to finish in the double-slit experiment. In the classical "deterministic but not measurably so in this universe" view the path does exist, but in the non-classical view such a path does not exist.
Occam's razor cuts both ways. QM is probably quantitatively the most precise theory we have, also one of the best corroborated. So why not say that the apparent deterministic nature of classical theories is, in fact, a result of the idealizations and approximations in those theories, and that the simple explanation is that nature is random.
The Copenhagen interpretation & Bohr's complementarity are such further explanations. Again, you are probably right that most working physicists don't care one way or another, but that does no mean that randomness would not have been fully theoretically embedded.
What non-local deterministic model do you have in mind? Bohm's?
The determinism is externally *produced*, by introducing idealizations & No, it can not, if the unpredictability is of the non-classical kind. This is pretty much the reason why QM exists in the first place.
Again, the measurement is performed in a way that makes sure that quantum effects are idealized away & canceled out (otherwise we would not get it to run the algorithm we want). It is small wonder then that they look the same.
No it is not. Like you pointed out at the beginning, one crucial question is which way Occam's razor is supposed to cut. If one would want to argue for the view that the razor should cut away classical determinism, one supporting observation could be that the behavioral predictability that you speak about does not exist, other than as an idealization. So the claim about full deterministic predictability is exactly the kind of unnecessary complication that Occam is talking about. We can do science, more simple science, without the claim.

Teemu, who, btw, is a member of the foundation's advisory board, replied in Finnish that he does not see/recognise a problem with regard to democratic governance.
 "I am not aware of the possible democracy gaps in Wikipedia besides the obvious problems relating to the epistemological questions of specific article topics (what is worth knowing, what information gets through as a WP article etc.), and some stupid censors (a.k.a admins). But all and all, I hope that Wikiversity will develop as a true grassroots movement, that is, as much as possible as a bottom-up endeavor. What else that means in practice than that those who participate share some common elements of .... decency, honesty, openness etc. (Marxist tells that she is a Marxist as well as Christian I really have not much add to Juha.

Certainly, I agree completely. However, I think with this solution (which I believe will be inevitable, and is already underway in several places around the world) we will find ourselves functioning at a much lower level of energy use than the current 85 million barrels per day. This is also because we will not be making solar panels, much less nano solar panels.
I also want to add re: Marc's point "It's simple demand-supply math. If gallium is about to run out in 15 years, those who produce it would be complete idiots not to raise its price." that while this is a nice ideal, it does not work in reality. For example, currently the price of oil is driven down by a wedge: it is too expensive for users (because of the economic downturn) and too cheap for the producers (who are *shutting down* production and *delaying* or *abandoning* new production because of the low price.) This might very well result in more oil being left in the ground despite the fact that it at the same time relatively "runs out". All of this is happening despite the fact that everybody knows that oil will run out in the time of some decades.

Dear all,
I'm requesting your help. The eCars Now -project  ( is  entering a new phase. A prototype is ready and some sort of "mass  production" has to be started next. The problem is: this implies Open  Source Hardware production (especially with regard to the electronics;  the motor & batteries can be bought ready made). Now the community  needs to make some decisions about the road to be taken. One  possibility is to keep all the interfaces of the electronics open and  hope to attract several companies as producers, another possibility is  to outsource the electronics development to a company that probably  will want to close some parts of the boxes. Both possibilities contain  severe risks and potential for failure. In order to make a better  informed decision, the community wants to prepare some sort of list or  table of comparison between the differences between os software and  hardware development. It would also be very helpful to know examples  of failed and succesful open hardware projects. (Like, e.g., why  OpenMoko is not taking off). I made a quick try:
All comments and input are very welcome! Especially insights with  regard to the two possible roadmaps.

Quoting Ryan Lanham :
Indeed, as many scholars interested in ideology critique would  emphasise, ideology has its finest hour (peak ideology) in exactly  those moments where we think that we behave "naturally" or "free from  ideology". Some would go so far as to define ideology as "that which  comes naturally/without conscious ideology". (This is, as can be seen  from the dialectical definition, the Hegelian school).

Here's a great table on EROEI:
The crux of peak oil, as I see it, is that when we compare the EROI of fossils (oil, coal) to the EROI of solar and nuclear, we see that in order to gain the same amount of energy profit that we get from fossils (EROI upwards of 20, even historically close to 100), we will have to devote a huge amount of labour to solar/nuclear (EROI much less than 10, mostly less than 5). (I know, the EROI calculations are very shaky and the EROI of solar can improve.) I personally believe that the EROI of nuclear is below 1, i.e., it is a way of using, not producing, energy; if we have to store the waste safely for millenia, the EROI goes through the floor. (Plus the massive amount of concrete and steel needed to build a reactor housing pretty much destroys the supposed positive effect on climate change). One estimate is that we would need 2500 nuclear power plants running without  interruption for a year to replace oil, alone, for a year. Given that it took over 15 years to complete the last reactor that came online, in 2007, the task seems practically

Call for papers (open until May 15., 2010):
Dynamics of Knowledge Creation in Wikis
A session in The 2nd International Power & Knowledge Conference, Tampere, Finland. September 6-8, 2010
The collective knowledge creation on various wiki-sites, including the massively popular Wikipedia, is having a profound effect on the social and epistemological conditions of public information. Distributed collaboration, possible anonymity, radical equality and global reach of wikified information lead to a situation that at the same time democratizes knowledge production by leveling hierarchies of expertise and increases the postmodern condition of reflective uncertainty. Everybody knows that the Wikipedia can not be trusted in the same way as, say, the Encyclopedia Britannica, yet over 100 million people utilize the Wikipedia daily. The 'edit' and 'history' buttons ever present on wiki pages are already starting to exert pressure on information presented elsewhere. For instance, the negotiations on what information to include and how the information should be presented in various Wikipedia entries constitute a huge experiment in the use of public reason ? la Kant. Consequently, the dynamics of collective collaboration also bring out questions on the nature of rationality and plurality of knowledge. Wikis provide ready made windows into the dialectical interplay between knowledge creation and issues of identity, social inclusion, authority, and the interface between information and The session invites contributions discussing these themes through theoretical reflection and/or empirical case studies. Abstracts should be between 150-200 words of length.

@_subject: [p2p-research] Concerning wikiworld and its use of socialist 
Hi all,
well, there are several things here.
First of all, I want to say that the discussions and reservations on the words "socialist" and "communist" presented on this list and by participants elsewhere have not gone unnoticed by Juha and myself. Indeed, the historical connotations do give me pause, in two ways: i) the atrocities perpetrated by people calling themselves communists and ii) the tendencies toward fixation on persons (Marx etc.) and the theories presented by them. (I like David Graeber's point that the difference between socialists and anarchists is evident already in the fact that the factions of the former are identified by proper names (Marxists, Leninists, Trotskyists, etc.) while the latter are identified by ideas (syndicalists, libertarians, communalists, etc.)). These discussions have made me more reflective and careful in using those terms; I'm thankful to you all for that.
However, I still do use those terms, and we decided to keep them in Wikiworld. Why?
There is the general point that I think that we should not give language and words up too easily. "Anarchism" is maybe even more a case in point than communism. To the man in the street "anarchism" means all that is wrong, and this is the result of a conscious and purposeful campaign of meaning-change by the enemies of anarchism (including factions of communists, to be sure). I'm not sure we should just abandon a word that is willfully poisoned; that would keep us running forever. Having said that I have nothing in principle against new words and names, just as long as they are good ones. :)
So are the words "socialism" and "communism" worth trying to save? Well, the wager here is that they are. First, communism is a very "obvious" idea to which no Marx or no China has a copyright. Think about certain primitive societies: there is no party or coercion there, but certainly communism. Second, there is an inspiring new wave of thinking about communism in the post-communist era; I'm thinking of people like Zizek and Graeber ("communism is what you do naturally when you co-operate in a family, a village, etc."), for instance, and especially the indianismo-movements in Latin America that combine socialism with anti-colonialism. Third, and most importantly, I'm personally familiar with a form of communist/socialist politics that was not blind towards Stalinism, that was not violent, not subservient to "Marxism", and that did produce real, tangible results. My grandfather was a part of a communist generation after the civil war in Finland that started their political activity underground. With the industrialization of the country, especially after WWII, the communists and socialist were very popular in elections; my grandfather was a representative in the municipal council for decades. The main goals for him there were free education and universal health care; both of which were achieved. There was a very direct link between his socialism and the school next door; the "reds" wanted it, the reds built it and made sure everyone gets in. The reds had their own co-op shops, banks, sport stadions, etc., indeed a relatively autonomous and self-reliant economic sphere that is even hard to imagine now. This is the "concrete utopia" I have in mind: the little money the reds had never entered the stock exchange, they collectively owned food production and processing chains that also made possible improving on working conditions, they had their own independent non-Hollywood culture. This was, to be sure, to some extent parasitic on the growth of the capitalist system (fossil fuels), but I see no in-principle reason why it could not have been made more independent, had they been aware of the energy-environment facts. (There was, indeed, a local municipally owned water-powered electricity station, too, that was torn down as "ineffective" later). (I would have to admit, however, that violence ? the threat of violence ? did probably have its role. The fact of the civil war and the proximity of the Soviet Union forced the hand of the right in granting major concessions to the left.) At the same time, he was very critical and non-naive about the Soviet Union, having visited it several times and knowing already from the 30's about what happened to Finnish communists that moved there (they were killed). To sum up: this was not Don Quixote, this was not ideological blindness, but a very nitty-gritty and down-to-earth day-to-day grind that did eventually over the decades produce concrete results, most of which have, alas, been lost. I just don't have the stomach to say that he was wrong in calling it "socialism" or "communism". ("Welfare-statism" would be one possible alternative, but that has its problems too, since while welfare was an important goal and the state an important tool, equality, locality and internationalism would override both welfare and statism in his thinking and action.)
Maybe the conclusion, then, is that when we want to envision, on one hand, a world of education that for its freedom needs also the collective/common ownership of the physical infrastructure, and, on the other hand, want to see this model take root in physical production as well, it would actually be dishonest to call it something else than socialist or communist. We know more, we have better tools, so it will not be the same; if we can come up with a better name, I'm in. But at the same time, there already exists a significant body of thought and praxis on these things that also helps to situate current developments in context, so why invent everything from the ground? (This point is not only academic: in my day job in the university I talk about p2p and open hardware and so on, which might be tactically right, but gives me some trouble with my conscience, because I know that it is "communism with a twist" I'm talking about and I suspect the students can see that, too. So why not say it?)
One last point: I suspect that with peak oil and the financial/debt crisis, certainly the right and possibly the left will in the foreseeable future turn more and more authoritarian. So the decisive political divide will more be on the authoritarian - anti-authoritarian axis than on the right-left axis.
