What a small world it is. I recently became introduced to the work of
JidduKrishnamurti just days ago after recently reading 'In My Own
Way', an
autobiography by Alan Watts. It would be nice to turn whatever dry writing I
come across and convert it into Watts prose.
The film seems to suggest the monetary system be abandoned altogether. I
don't see how the Venus Project has the resources to carry such a burden
unless more people understand the ground will soon be too fragile to support
life and jump into an Apollo Project to create abundant everything.
I would suggest a Basic Income as an intermediate step, one that can pay the
bills without necessarily going into the workforce. That would make
available time for those to willing participate and create an abundant world
and formulate a way to measure resources in a material based economy.

Hi Kevin,
Don't mind if I do?
Thanks for the extensive reflection. I believe this is a document in which
to place P2P/Open Manufacturing into a theoretical framework for community
organization, applicable to existing communities.
OSE already provides the model for the toolset and production standards. The
semantic web interface and basic income platform will encourage global
networking to build a variety of designs to meet each community culture or
personal preference.

80s. Each forward was less and less hopeful of realizing post-scarcity. No
doubt he'd be thrilled with the discussions today. Funny, I only read the
forwards. I'll take another hack at it.
So then could we competitively have mini-mills and metal molds fabricated on
demand at a local fab lab?
That makes sense. Labs therefore need to replicate to meet demand as it is
made practical.

@_subject: [p2p-research]  simpler way wiki 
Looks like some useful stuff here to build Intentional Community 2.0
So many proposals start out this way. I don't like the approach. Michel may
quickly point out, with fewer words, this method fosters extrinsic rather
than intrinsic motivation which potentially subjects  reliving the ghost of
scarcity: even if the practice proposed is of greater material benefit than
before. No matter how good or how much better--if it is motivated by
guilt--this community cannot be considered abundant--even if 100% of all
wants and needs are personally produced at 0% labor time.
Asserting the world we WILL live in is an approach I suggest to prop makers
everywhere--with a disclaimer that no matter how flexible, it may not be for
you. But yet, what other alternatives have we not mentioned that are better
than these?! This suggests an open proposal based on a core value structure
or aim, blending all methods in order to develop closer to the described
core ideals. And even then we need to be careful: using a theist analogy:
all paths may lead to a false god or gods.
I suggest pointing out the problem only before the solution. Or, state a way
of doing differently than existing problematic practices. I would like a
proposal to start this way:
"Present ways of living work poorly and put our lives at risk.
[1][2][3][4][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14]" Hah! Well, perhaps not so
condensed, but I hope you have the point.
Production: Personal vs. Community
There is a juggling act in proposing production foundations in two areas: 1)
personal and 2) community production. Using technology already available
will require the insightful use of both. Careful observation of the most
off-grid, self sustained communities can weed out best production processes.
These productive approaches then, to work best, match personality profiles
with members of complimentary manners as a reference at least before meeting
with all members of the community for a potluck.
Personal production benefits without being a time or material expense to
other community members, ideally, but this can fail without automation in
the chain to do the work of several people. Community production in the form
of "momentary mass production" is more practical, when say, planting is to
be done to feed the community. With only a tractor attachment to till soil,
hands-only personal production of planting takes longer than a community of
hands. The community production approach in this case prevents individuals
toiling seperately in personal production methods or can generate available
time to develop personal production models further. The community approach
also gives a reason to co-exist and ensures everyone learns how to farm and
better appreciate food.
Based on the knowable options, if community production benefits a
member--that is done. If personal production benefits the member and the
community--that is done. This means that when ascerting personal or
community, the best manner of practice is considered first, even if the
surface quality is less visually appealing than mass production or digitally
assisted techniques. Ascerting at least two core production approaches helps
to consider why we do stuff to make stuff to begin with.
Unpleasant company: The food may be the best in the world, but you have
found yourself unable to measure up to the never ending expectations within
a group of particulars. You are permissable only for moral reasons alone:
you are hungry and hunger is bad. This creates an anxious setting for the
visitor, regardless of how 'friendly' the words may be from this sort.
Though you may be 'welcome' to share a meal with your hosts, the food
doesn't seem as great as it may otherwise. Given food is abundant, the
visitor would rather share a meal of lesser quality than with the snobbish
To play on an old phrase: material cannot be made into happiness.
2.  From "Local Currencies":
Skilled labor will become more valuable as production returns to the town in
the short term.
Community and personal production standards will be made, adjusted for
foreseeable novelty to reduce human labor. This assumes by the time this is
a widespread movement without a proper social network to share various
community living designs and instructions on how to build them. Until then,
people will continue to have exchange value by learning skills. Knowledge at
some level will remain scarce until robotics can perform the physical
activities which tap the same network to execute the activities, if but
converted to machine language.
A social network will be formed to provide the knowledge tools to do
whatever tasks have been done before. Physical areas are found or built to
house materials warehouses to store discarded materials, known in practice
to scale well in terms of discarded housing materials in Huntsville, Texas,
a city of 35,000. I am told this facility circulates a lot of stuff without
seeing a dumpster. With an easily accessible web application in place, you
then follow instructions. Knowing the benefits, the human mind will catch on
similarities and become more independent from the instructional program of
archived designs created by communards globally.
I believe we'll look back and liken exchange value to theft. Even suggesting
it: a playful threat. It is a form of slavery to the almighty concept of
standardized value. Evil; okay?
At the barebones minimum, a tent city on cheap land organized along the
Thanks for suggesting this as a viable alternative. I was encouraged to
revise the source you mentioned.
In terms of housing, there's plenty of waste in building materials to build
homes for those with few monetary metrics. While this waste stream exists, a
social network must link with businesses to discard the home building waste
to a local freeconomy warehouse. Due to working with the materials
available, labor time in building a house is high, but financial costs to
building a home are reduced by half at least? That is productive recursion
in practice.
I learned of this during an Earth Day event at Stephen F. Austin University
during a presentation by Dan Phillips about his experience in home building
from discarded materials, how to make beauty from the industritus, and a bit
on the business model. Referencing activities in practice like this makes
for a stronger proposal.
Phoenix Commotion
Though it is novel and the market for this will expand as incomes deplete, I
do see an end to this model rather quickly. If we take the formula as
practiced and apply it to every Industrial town, it will quickly turn waste
materials into scarce goods with a price tag. This is similar to biofuel use
in San Francisco persistent enough that restaurants now charge for discarded
Regardless of this foreseeable pitfall, the Phoenix Commotion model can be
tweaked over time to continue an abundant setting by generating the means to
produce materials personally or communally. The trick, of course, is to do
this in a manner that uses less personal time than preceding mass models in
a manner that's constructive without ecological destruction.
The YMCA approach you mention is also very useful when considering living
space for the 50% of folk living in urban areas. I disagree with the name,
Quadruple Alliance, as these three organizations I consider community
ventures outside the home environment. Because the home I prefer to keep in
the personal realm, I do not consider that an official community space. This
arbitrary separation ensures personal vs community growth. Also, I believe
the Fab covers the construction of living environments. The fab lab title
covers the other structural areas of concern to meet the objectives of the
lab: materials generation or recycling (a farm, from food to aluminum),
retrieval (using people/robots), and storage (warehousing, expected to
dwindle over time).

@_subject: [p2p-research] OpenKollab: Process & Platform 
Hi Sam,
I'm well rested now. Thanks ;)
OpenKollab needs an open architectural base so it can support a variety of
small group developers already at work on specific projects such as your
own. Now we need guys like you to focus on creating that center from which
all varieties might flourish. I am now creating a process model with this
group as a template to begin to see what people's needs are in forming
projects outside organizational boundaries.
Matt Cooperrider began a subproject within OK to create a
meetup.comOpenKollab group.
platform that builds face-to-face meetings, but a project tool as well, with
virtual conference features and such. My recollection of meetup.com is a few
years old, back when it was just a face-to-face tool. From what I gather,
Matt is forming this to surface a core team of developers for the OpenKollab
process and platform to better distinguish between discussion and
development. Matt has a contact within the meetup.com development team. That
should be helpful.
There are a few coders in this project, I just need to get in touch with
them directly to see what they want to do.
I also need to get in touch with everyone that wants to develop the process
And artists as well...
I have learned from constructing web based learning systems that the way you
OK must meet the niche and the entirety of the long tail of needs. The
models I am attempting to build with this community will simply be an open
template to inspire the do-it-all web-to-DIY to come. I'm only attempting to
get the ball rolling on presenting a better way to link everyone into one
open interface where everything is socially networked (people, interests,
projects, designs, land, materials, ecologies, ect). I really hope my
intentions are becoming clearer. I just want to see where you might fit into
this, because it seems what you're doing now, like with FLOWS, is vital to
OK without altering much of what you're already doing.
What this means is that you'll need to decide whether you want to dedicate
Both. I hope that is now clear.
I agree. Like in terms of the consensus assumption I posed, groups should
decide whether consensus is necessary or not or of what form of governance
they want with each defined process. A consensus approach might be (a
potential 'is') default setting or template created by another community.
I really think we're on the same page here, Sam, it just seems I need to
better express the openness for a decision path after describing each
process. I've made the assumption the reader can pick or add to each
described process. I'll be sure to clarify this as we move forward. I
suppose in a way I have by describing these models as sessions. (See:
 The OK group did a process
session before I arrived previously titled spec and changed to Process Model
Session 1, so now on the wagn three sessions are listed. I hope this
representation will demonstrate the flexibility of the model without getting
lost or leaving something without a direction at all.
I hope you might attract some readings that relate to systems or process
modeling and development so that can improve that design if necessary. I'll
add them to Resources.
I don't want this group to end up like the Open Manufacturing list. This is
why I came aboard quickly while the iron is clearly hot, because I know
after a measure of time people will fall into assumptive traps and stagnate.
This is not to say I think the OM list is a failure or that the people there
are inept, quite the contrary. It is a really great list in terms of other
lists that came before it. Brilliant people are discussing brilliant things
and posting news and other media that relate to the subjects we've
discussed. Its now well established as a learning community and discussion
group with just a handful of highly active participants like Paul and Bryan,
(that may well have kept the list alive) but now as the group has exceeded
200 subscribers, more folk are coming into the discussive mix. The ideas I
wanted to pursue at the time when forming the OM list were too vague to be
of much help to anything like OK if it were to start then. By the time I
developed a pretty good idea in the direction OK is pursuing, the group had
already settled into a pattern that many other discussion lists have. What
I'm coming to understand by watching the OK community come alive is that
without "real time engagement" links within the group are diminished from
each other and the results are what you find in the majority of e-mail based
discussion lists today. I'm glad I started the group, its a great group, and
it will continue to add to the theoretical work now being applied to OK.
Now is the chance to note to Matt that a general discussion about this area
is already available and that we can keep the existing OK list development
focused. If we do sense more general discussion surfacing, we can start new
lists that distinguish between the two. I say this from experience, when
Bryan Bishop tried to establish a development discussion group for OM it
flopped. I could go into why, but that's fodder for another discussion, one
I'd rather have at OM. I'll start one if you're interested, but I'm more
interested in developing OK with you. ;)
I agree. Let the user's drive the needs, then develop solutions. In this
universal architecture there must be a series of "project templates" or
solutions that are stored in a user friendly directory to use and revise
when needed. These revisions then add to the template repository. This
process can apply not only to projects--but all things--anything imaginable.
So long as we keep it an open, transparent, and as gift economic as possible
I'm very confident the "anything imaginable" will be a good thing for more
people than what platform or "conditions creators" we have available today.
The 'people' >> 'interest' >> 'project' >> 'design'  >> 'resources' as a
process formula (or something like that) will found the pursuit of the many
aims to come. Its just a matter of "what do you want to do and how can we
apply that to the OK platform." The user is maximized by OpenKollab--this
vital link--which connects the person to the world that person may have an
interest, and in easily pursuing these interests, when using this platform,
the actions benefit the world. We're already seeing this development in the
many process outlines that have come before as, Sam, you've mentioned--from
Memex before to Facebook and Deepqa today. If we, even as a small group,
keep our heads up, our eyes clear, and have an active sincere interest in
one another, the trust from within our group will spread to others to better
develop the OK platform as we call it presently, and so we have ourself that
little everything module in no time--safe and sound. ;)

@_subject: [p2p-research] Fwd: On Silliness and Sassiness 
On Silliness and Sassiness
Absolute Individualism <<< Sassiness <<< Equilibrium >>> Silliness >>>
Absolute Society
Reflective Cognition <<< Emotion <<< FLOW >>> Emotion >>> Reflective
Sassiness rises and falls based on near arbitrary notions such as
physiological, environmental, and rates of communications exchanges. Simply
put, the rate of sassiness depends to what extend boundaries real or
imagined are tightly or loosely adhered to. When boundaries are rigidly
held, sassiness rises. When boundaries are loosely held, sassiness
diminishes. Boundaries vary depending on the ability to recognize them. This
is why sassiness varies within the artifacts of the personal construct or
another depending on a subject's area--generally speaking.
There are some correlational or causal conditions that cause the sass
factor; past memories and metabolic states also factor; but we'll ignore
these presently fuzzy instances for the sake of perfect mathematical models
and practical and immediate application.
When sassiness is encountered by the subject (ME DAMMIT!!) one's tolerance
(another factor to excessively model) is tested until the said threshold
(presently left unsaid) is met at which point the media is hijacked and
silliness is administered to alleviate--and in some rare cases cure--sassy
states or conditions.
Silliness destroy any models that may attempt to capture it, therefore it is
merely identified as silliness. Of course, you could model this silliness,
but to do so would be--well--silly. To even attempt such feats would require
vast amounts of computational capacity to quickly revise the models. Yet,
when the model is observed or reflective cognition is introduced, silliness
is no longer presents; a remnant of the silliness rather than the silliness
itself. Therefore, silliness cannot be adequately modeled to secure the
state of equilibrium our research suggests.
After sassiness and silliness are mastered: that which only is: occurs. This
'is' is neither good nor evil, but "good" as a matter of course. Therefore,
such distinctions between good and evil are superfluous within this
described, optimal, equilibrial state of being.

Hi Sam,
You're welcome to repost any messages I send from Facebook--if that's what
you mean.
What questions I've left unanswered, you have either exceeded my ability to
answer them with your answers or they are outside my knowledge areas and
better answered by our friends on this list.
4. Although, for open source frameworks and platforms, groupware,
I hope, when you have time, you describe this point more clearly. There's
lots of unnecessary cognitive lifting involved. It sounds as if you've made
some monumental breakthroughs and now doing your best to describe the
practical applications the code sets intend in a short amount of time. Your
work sounds really exciting, Sam. I look forward to seeing you and Paul
describe how it works more clearly.
I'll present a demonstration story below; one I can better understand; that
you may want to consider applying in some way; and sooner than later; as the
p2p foundation becomes able to fund projects like yours.
FLOWS in action? Even with implementation of this protocol translator, there
will remain a great deal of work to do, but this will save a great deal of
work toward higher level functions and for great self sufficiency.
It would be good to know the exact processes of the meeting in Nov.
Once we know our speaker/panel line-up we'll have a detailed outline of the
meeting. I'm doing my best to work with Phoebe and Michel to get the most
out of this one day event. Suggestions are most welcome. ;)
Its about time as far as I'm concerned. And it looks as if the time is
I really appreciate Phoebe and Michel for performing those particular
academic autocracies I lack tolerance in facing on my own. Phoebe is lifting
a majority of the autocratic weight, so we might want to thank her most of
all when giving appreciation for the workshop setting itself.
So Sam, get your story cap on and imagine how you might apply this
demonstration to your own work:
   - We're at a conference taking place inside an auditorium.
   - Everyone can see projected how you are accessing a graphical interface.
   - You go to a search page and type the name of the event you are
   attending.
   - A page for the event is accessed.
   - You find a 'dynamic' blueprint or map of the very room you are
   presenting from.
   - From this map you are able to see what objects you can access to
   manipulate in some way.
   - A mobile robotic arm in set upon a desk. A sheet of paper is nearby on
   the desk.
   - From the map you are able to locate the sheet of paper from your
   screen, select it, then use the cursor to fold it into a particular shape.
   This is a new design, never before virtually shaped in this way.
   - After confirming your entry, the robot arm, with that information,
   folds the paper to your specifications.
   - Demonstration complete.
When things of this sort become common and seamless, it is imperative that
we make theft obsolete! That cannot be stressed enough! It is for reasons
such as this I have described open manufacturing in a positive rather
than neutral manners: positive in the sense that it must also render
everything  'gratis' or free to have at no monetary cost, but also without
sacrificing lives, our own and the ecologies that sustain us.
After Sm?ri's jaw dropping presentation of Industry 2.0, I hope achieving
such an aim does not seem so daunting.
Is it ok to repost your email to via facebook to this list?
I have a couple of questions that will help me prepare for coming to
this conference
 :
1. What are the existing open source software platforms that are being
developed, or commonly used?  I am aware of
 (wagn) Media Wiki, GNU Mailman
listserv, WordPress, Drupal, and a few Prowiki and OddMuse wiki users
(Redmine is the basis of Open Pario for open source tech dev ). Any
others that I am missing there? Are people using Trac?
2. What are the commercial services being used among networks of
people interested in this discussion? I am aware of Google Groups,
Facebook, Twitter, Ning, identi.ca, Skype, FriendFeed? anything else?
3. most importantly, what are the existing open standards that are
usable among both open source platforms and commercial services? The
open source platforms are obviously potentially unlimited, so this
question is really about the commercial services.
4. Although, for open source frameworks and platforms, groupware,
applications, etc, We can look at how existing objects within
applications (like dates, identities, keywords, content objects, etc
etc) can be output in plural ways, under a diverse array of standard
output ways, to allow for wide re-use. This does not have to be done
by tedious extension of the native application. This is an overlooked
but extremely important design choice. The amount of effort that it
takes to extend an application that was not designed to do what you
are trying to do is exponentially more than creating the simple
mechanisms outside of the application, and giving the mechanisms
secure access to the data within the application. An example: Media
wiki was not originally designed to be a content recommendation engine
that works with K-means clustering algorithm. So, if you design this
functionality as a non-commercial service that lives outside of media
wiki, and adapters that let it read from and write back to media wiki,
the service is also available to potentially all other wiki engines as
well, and the amount of work to make it compatible with Media Wiki
software is far, far less than if the Media Wiki scripts themselves
have to do the heavy lifting and processing of the new functionality.
The external service need only be able to access data from media wiki
(either via a RESTful service or directly from the database) and to
write back to Media Wiki in a way that MW is expecting to see pages
and content (when it is deemed necessary to programmatically write
content to MW).
Number 4 above is a new approach to design, and extends to
collaboration platforms that are being used for open source hardware
collaborative development, too. Even most commercial services now do
this. (All of the above named work with some kind of standard save

We believe an approach is needed that does not care what application
you are using, what programming language it is in, nor even what your
processes are (although knowing all of this helps), but only minimally
requires that you output in some way that is a standard that can be
mapped against. That output is where Paul and myself have created a
standard, which is a way to abstract above the common existing
barriers between web software applications. We have code that works
with Wagn now, that will allow for this abstraction, and we'll have
several demos for Nov.  We have even extended this to microcontrollers
like Arduino, and will likely provide a demo of this, too.
It would be good to know the exact processes of the meeting in Nov.
Will this be presentation based? Or, some other format? Either way, we
will be able to show some actual code demonstrations connecting wagn
with other open source apps, services, etc. Plus, we're ready to talk
about the underlying theory that drove us into this direction as
Thanks, Nathan, Phoebe, and Michel for putting this together. A really

Hi Michel,
OpenKollab's content is presently managed with wagn.
I hope you might setup an account there and play with it.
We'd love to have you, particularly in terms of the Information Resources
That is, if you have time...
Hi Sam,
Thanks for that example.
Right, we might say that the paper folding is stored so other folk or bots
might fold the paper in that same configuration later on.
You may not have paper and want to make it yourself? Okay, there's your
representation, here's where the materials are located. No bots in the area?
No problem, all of this is in walking distance, and other folk may be
interested in your project to help place those needed items closer to your
That would be fantastic if you could... Then all we need to tell folk to
promote this thing is something like, "Watch a robot fold some paper! How is
this p2p you ask?! Okay! Present how to fold this paper to your peer group
with the best way you know about folding it; then the other folk change the
folding in a way everyone can agree on if everyone agreeing on something
is necessary. Then this paper fold approach is left in a repository, tapped
by FLOWS whenever another paper folder starts tinkering with paper in a
similar fashion. In this story, what has been done before will be presented,
unless the user wants to work in ignorance as not to stifle that creative
The folding robot in my fantasy world is a general bot, a bipedal bot with
two arms, legs---the kind most folk think of when thinking: robot. We just
need to bring some robotics folks that already spent the dough on the
equipment to apply our integrated platform. These guys are speaking our
language as well with interest in agreeing on standards and speaking in
terms of 'robots collaborating with other robots' at one conference in an
article Ryan sent to this list.
I've collected that and two other sources here:
'Search and Retrieval: 'Hard''
I assume the bot then can scan the room and identify the paper in the room
using something or perhaps this: LabelMe I learned of this image recognition app, which shows other uses, from:
Precision Agriculture: Sustainable Farming In The Age Of Robotics
If Sm?ri has presented this--OX?--that is not the one I'm referring, but
instead to the revised presentation of the work he and the fab lab peeps are
hacking, which I suspect will cover all the essential bases for comfortable
life support with little or no money involved.
If the only difficult task is to render a 3d object digitally; we know that
is done already. I hear CAD standards are not yet compatible with CAM and so
forth. (FLOWS solves this, right? ;p) So, perhaps you mean rendering a 3d
object so that instructions for folk or robots can create the rendered
object successfully after easily retrieving materials from the web to
procure it?
See the work of Hans Moravec. There's video on his page of a bot
successfully zips through a room and renders the entire space. Moravec has
worked in machine vision for years... Its much like Photosynth (closed
source and therefore evil), but better, because you can send a bot to
photograph what images are missing in the model. Revisions of the visual
model are only needed for objects known to move around, change hands, or
diminish with use. . . .
and because the robotics would only need a connection to the
Right. Dat bot can afford wifi cuz eaits free.
This demo would be an awesome display for sure. If all of the above
Let's do it Sam!! :)
How 'bout EMC? Fenn forwarded this info to the OM list.
The goal is to do anything remotely!
I hope Zach (cc'd) you might have something to say on this with his work in
CAD repositories (Thingiverse) and distributed manufacturing. You're coming
to the workshop, right? ;)
It would be best if this aspect were automated, via rates of selection, 'do
you like?' input requests, or some other automated selection criteriori.
Yes. Redudancy where it counts, just in case a server or two crashes--the
mesh gots you covered.
Sounds as if that would be a practical implement you can charge these
proprietarians for royally so as to put the reserve notes to better use:
meaning: less. ;)

Yes, I'm with you there Sam, but an elderly population like Japan in the
coming decades, assuming workers are not imported, these things must be done
remotely, then automated.
Folding paper is just one example...
Perhaps people in the hackerspace or fab lab community would present
something like this since they have the ability to pool more resources.
I'm rather disappointed that no one thus far finds such a demonstration all
that important. We need robotics to do tasks people would rather not do to
keep essential functions so it is practical to apply peer production
universally, where it is possible to manage all affairs asynchronously.

Yes, and so be it, but the problem is they are forced into rote tasks to
'earn' a living. I'm for robotics networks that can perform these already
obsolete tasks to the point it overwhelms the classical economy to the point
it is obvious labor as market value is obsolete.
Thanks Sam for clarifying the workshop outline. I'll pitch this link as the
workshop is discussed:
Hi Alex,
Thanks for jumping into the conversation. ;) I'm delighted to hear you think
the paper folding session would be a worthwhile demonstration of what a
collaborative robotics network will be like.
Many of these things are being done, such as remote piloting of planes or
drones fully automated... An upcoming Hollywood film is taking this idea
further with the concept of remotely controlled people... this same theme is
found in 'Running Man' ... and to some extend in the novel, 'Frankenstien'.

I assume Sm?ri's research in presenting Industry 2.0 will cover these topics
in full--as much as one presentation can possibly. I suspect between the
cognitive capacities of Sm?ri, Sam, and Paul F. the vital infrastructural
aspects would be well represented, discussed, for further integrated
development. I mention these names as not to suggest anyone's views would be
less comprehensive, but because I know theirs to be so in my view.
This is the present draft I presented; written before the conversation went
in this direction here; for Michel and Phoebe to final filter:
 Media Ecologies: Workshops on Collaborative Platforms, Social & Material
*Panel Questions*
What are the best known solutions or resources to solve the issue of...?
   - Water
   - Food
   - Energy
   - Housing
   - Transport & Distribution
   - Urban and Suburban Regeneration
Now that we've determined the solutions or resources to place our attention,
what standards can we come to consensus on? (This may include agreeing on
more than one standard per category.)
How will we manage and distribute resources as they become increasingly
common property, unable to use mechanisms of exchange trade such as wage
labor, barter, or currency?
   - Life must be a right. Therefore, the inability to 'earn' a living must
   not prevent anyone from living a comfortable life, as our moral duty ensures
   everyone, at minimum: access to neutral Internet, the ability to personally
   create or possess more than adequate water, food, housing, and protective
   clothing with the means to sustain them in a way that nurtures planetary
   ecologies and human sincerity.
I hope we make a variety of contacts to nurture during and after this
workshop to plan for the week long conference to come; which will discuss
what areas our developer network has created and used in practice: how areas
were integrated with the projects (and related networks) presented at the
workshop and the variety of others areas to secure these various
For those not immersed in this topic area for years as many of us have, it
will be easy to get lost, and I suspect much of what is said will be
difficult to translate in such a short amount of time. So long as we keep
the interest in our neighbor's projects before and after the workshop and
conferences to come, we'll no doubt make lots of mistakes and
misinterpretations, but since I can already see clearly enough the outcome
of these events from the personal discussions and from the talks at p2p
research and the open manufacturing community, I believe we'll make it just
I would be overly optimistic were it not for my recent run-in with the
authorities at the university campus (known as Stephen F. Austin State
University) I befriended this past year or to do out-of-enrollment study.
This activity has finally caught up with me, as I was given a criminal
trespass warning for occupying the music building, enjoying the gifts of its
air conditioning and wifi. I was accused of "setting up residence" and
"lying about being a student" because as I was told 'I know what being a
student means' after occupying that space on the second night, from the
officer's perspective and that officer and sargent's consensus view. After
asking, I was told even if I were a student, I would be asked to leave that
space at night. (Although I doubt that would have been true in practice) So
now I'm unable to enter this campus without proving my case for the chief of
police to revoke my occupational impermissibility. I've had chats with the
philosophers at the university when I first arrived, with some
disappointment as they seem or act too busy to discuss anything, and I got
to know a librarian rather well. . . So I'll ask if these folk can help me
at all.
I'm open to going elsewhere that might better appreciate what I'm doing. I'd
imagine that its probably a struggle enough caring for yourselves. . .
Just when I've become comfortable being perceived as scum in this world. . .
someone with a badge decided to act on it. . .
I apologize for not appropriately separating my personal experiences from
creating an integrated collaborative platform. I only hope such a personal
story can relate to your own similar incidents and further express the
drives that fuel our works.

@_subject: [p2p-research] Remote Assembly, Economy, & Work For Its Own Sake 
Its a pleasure having conversation with you Sam.
If we do not have to secure living standards via rote tasks, we can better
enjoy what we do, highly repetitive or otherwise, for the gift from the work
itself. In this way, what we do becomes rendered more meaningful and sincere
for more genuine personal and communal reasons (such in learning and keeping
the skill, so we or neighbors might admire, or so these skills can be taught
or shared with family and friends, ect)
To request a payment is a resource acquisition method for a society unable
to scale productive activities properly. The 'Remote Assembly' (paper
folding, ect) demonstration can show in one viewing how these productive
activities can scale to generate more wealth than before without waste,
including the waste in financial instrumentation you describe in a previous
message. I'm going to describe the assembly process further below.
It can be all of them; individuals can then choose what they want to do. If
that is 'nothing', so be it. Socialization will be pick up a majority of the
'slackers' and will likely reduce this occurrence as freedoms increase and
people begin to treat one another better as consequence.
Yes. Share the information, land use, materials, assembly steps and the
potential for DIY increases. In other words, expand the circle of sharing
and the personal circle of self sufficiency expands in kind.
Right. As we discussed directly, basic life support systems must be easily
transferable for rapid fabrication in times of rapid exchange trade decline
in a manner that requires less ration units than before in anticipation of
and development toward zero ration units for access to these basic needs
globally. And this must happen very quickly...
You're digressing into a financial approach here. I'm sorry to hear this
clogging up that cognitive capacity of yours. Maybe you're just attempting
to refine a theory of money mechanism.... So here's how I see it...
Money is only able to capture value by the way products are produced and the
rents received for labor to acquire them. Bankers are probably the best
predators of all; as they capture rents from the entire capitalist
enterprise itself. It will be a relief to see money used without bankers and
their institutions. I'm curious how efficient that would make resource flows
or at what prices products are reduced to in such a 'free money' market
economy. Those high rise buildings would make great indoor farms and fabs.
Wrong. If we back money with anything, that will only work against us, as
interests will only work to secure that backing whether is it (energy, gold,
natural forces, ect) is scare or not. Therefore, money must be based on the
subjectivity of scarcity itself. In other words: only backed by trust that
an item is scarce and must have something of relative scarce value in
exchange. That's 'old world' and will soon be difficult to secure such lived
horrors, however.
So if a currency were backed by something abundant as you're describing, the
money would then be worthless...
Heh. "Profit?" you might ask? "Well, sure, but here's a phrase you want to
better affiliate yourself with." ;p
These works can add to a trust platform I call a cohension engine, a bag of
tricks that secure bonds when they are needed to complete protocols...
Thanks for the invitation. ;)
Yes. without ration units, but certainly with other checks and balances...
Do you have a page just loaded with various examples? That would be helpful.
Cradle to cradle. Right. Zero waste.
Have reading suggestions in this area?
I've kept notes on all the ones you've previously mentioned on
Now to describe an ultimate Robodemo in a few steps, beginning with the most
complex example, built from refining and adding to the foundation: the paper
folding bot.
3) A robot network is able to successfully fabricate its own parts and
assemble them remotely from the web. The presentation focus is on a general
fabrication robot (fabot) on stage to handle and assemble materials given to
him by distributor robots (distribots) from the other fabots off stage,
ideally located a few square miles away at most, all of which observed
remotely if wanted.
   - A general mobile fabrication robot is sent a revision of itself to
   fabricate. All materials are fabricated on demand in fabritories nearby in
   the town of the conference area or in the area itself. We can watch video of
   the materials accessed from one land area to another as a distribot
   transfers the packet to its storage unit for the fabrication network to
   construct until meeting the final assembly point.
   - The final result is a robot that constructs on stage a revised
   duplicate of itself.
   - They shake hands (in memory of the Open Manufacturing logo)
   - Then the newly built replica proceeds to give the parent bot the same
   revisions that were given to it.
2) A robot can assemble a replica of itself with parts already aquired
through the mass production and transit means we presently toil within.
1) A bot folds paper in a novel way with our p2p or collective intelligence.
   - We're at a conference taking place inside an auditorium.
   - Everyone can see projected how you are accessing a graphical interface.
   - You go to a search page and type the name of the event you are
   attending.
   - A page for the event is accessed.
   - You find a 'dynamic' blueprint or map of the very room you are
   presenting from.
   - From this map you are able to see what objects you can access to
   manipulate in some way.
   - A mobile robotic arm in set upon a desk. A sheet of paper is nearby on
   the desk.
   - From the map you are able to locate the sheet of paper from your
   screen, select it, then use the cursor to fold it into a particular shape.
   This is a new design, never before virtually shaped in this way.
   - After confirming your entry, the robot arm, with that information,
   folds the paper to your specifications.
   - Demonstration complete.
So in regard to fabricating these near possibilities; some admixture of the
fab lab and hackerspace community can work collaboratively to create such
demonstrations in practice.
Phoebe recently made a strong connection with the fab lab community in
Manchester. That's one door to knock. I'm willing to play an advisory role
and that of a student to the extent my patience and interest allows of the
various code and mechanics it will take to develop and integrate these
curious varieties.

@_subject: [p2p-research]  The criminalization of using the commons 
Hi Dante,
Thanks for sharing your experiences of Europe. I've had my mind in this
curious place for sometime, without much investigation. Hackerspaces are the
most rampant there; for starters; which probably means it has the most
potential to nurture the seeds...
Hi Paul,
What an excellent subject title. Thanks for sharing your insights and
experiences in such depth. They are a treat. ;)
I am now recalling the few occasions where me and lawyer references were
mentioned. A letter I wrote to my mother, read by her husband, who said , as
I recall my mother recounting, ?He writes like a lawyer?. I?m honored that
you are making such attempts to help me find an area my mind may rest. From
writings of your own, this sounds like the path you might best pursue if you
were my age with the same lack of obligation.
I could tell my intelligence was making the persona nervous? In another
reflection, of ?myself? in the moment, we might say was a disturbed young
man, haunted in ?real time? with the looming histories his night time
activity attempted to avoid, only here to persist in attempting to divert
the endless despair surfacing and resurfacing with each insistent of the
antagonistic persona--knowing my autonomy, discontinued--combined with a
life experience of intolerance. I look in the mirror and see a young man
that is physically attractive, but so too was Lucifer? To avoid the phantoms
that live this collective nightmare; I was confronted by a legitimized
product of this nightmare. To overcompensate his answer to ?if I were a
student could I stay here??, with that answer being a hasty ?no?, in
addition to his repetition of acting more antagonistic in framing the
?lying? about my position as a ?student, but not enrolled? at the
university, this was immediate grounds for the criminal trespass warning
issued. After the instigating officer and sargent had a private discussion,
that decision was made without any negotiation on my part, grounded in the
?lie? I had held. Your trust is all I was asking from my line of reassertion
and questioning; in response you fabricated conditions of distrust for
security sake as a reaction to each of my reassertions and questionings. I
failed to make a personal connection, to relate him to me somehow, for
reasons that will become better understood.  I must become able to make a
compassionate connection with each encounter, but as you say, Paul, my
compassion was fatigued, at first with the sudden outburst in my direction,
perhaps an attempt to render me complety submissive, and this fatigue
continued as he grafted, without much reflective thought, the angle in
framing ?me? as invalid. I refused to sign the document; but no matter with
an excited pleasure from the sargent in stating this fact; the position
remains the same. History repeats itself, if but differently.
So too was the decision as swift and unquestioned like a similar occurrence
in 8th grade when three girls claimed I had threatened their lives. The
story of Columbine was the primary social fuel, and my deep quiet depression
was well visible from my daily experiences attempting to avoid my dying
father living in the room across from my own when he had lived up till that
year in nursing homes and half-way houses. So that further ensured I
represent that stereotyped target. To show kindness toward the weak in that
culture was to become the weakness itself; and antagonism follows such
behavior; therefore I became weaker; quieter; baring the time and insult,
including to myself to cope, so I might relieve it with the sensual
distractions that were to await. He was living noticeably less and less each
day---that cough a haunting memory that resurfaces with other coughs I hear
like it---compounded by my mother?s highly sensitive, reductive, fatalistic,
and unpredictably explosive tendencies, and my physical breakdown after too
much sugar; not enough healthy food; and layers upon layers of guilt and
stress the summer before entering my 8th prison term. Experiences from
brilliant teachers for terms 4 and 5 are the exceptions; even if their
approaches too were ?just-in-case?. They did the very best they knew how.
This breakdown in my health months before I was interrogated for hours
without my mother?s knowledge by a county detective, came to a climax when
my father was in the same space, as we had just attended his sister?s
daughter?s wedding, my ingrained mother?s fear of him for reasons it would
seem too melodramatic to mention, preparing for a week in church camp, my
persistent allergies and asthmatic reactions from cat dander and poor air
circulation, that last dr. pepper on an empty stomach, the depressing film
on the television? These fragments accelerated a whole that lead to my
physiological shock. My body was preparing to shut down. That is a fear I
have yet surpassed. Were it not for my mother?s concern, the cold air
conditioning in the car, and my desperate prayers to remain alive, I would
have died that early morning. I have yet to fully recover from that night?
How far I have come, since? Perhaps?
So yes, Paul, I am deeply disturbed by an experience that would have made
other mortals an antagonistic plaything to reinforce such spectral role as
executioner? His reward was sweet; what sick joy I could see in his eyes; a
bum taught a lesson; my seeing the ?win? in his eyes furthered such twisted
pleasures. If this group that saw my leave had thought what they were doing
was an act of compassion, there would not have been so many of them to see
my leave. It only remains in my fantasy that such a potential man walking
the campus would have a role more as a councilor than executioner of curious
Now you and our research and development group--call ?it? what you like--can
see here more clearly what fuel--what sinders long to be set free after
wanting to command: I AM JUST!! I refrain from this approach, knowing this
only creates negative reciprocity in kind, however less just it may be: as I
have learned well, to a fault: the flame will only surface more fire until
the original flame is destroyed. My mental medicines are many and not at
all, but we might call some of them the over-corrections represented by this
use of English language; and the fruits of constant musical imagination to
stave the burn that would otherwise lose control, spread, and further
reinforce and legitimize this rigged and built-in and universalized
destruction. What come of these explanations are of the sort that render me
often times immersed in the welcoming depths of fairy tale with each insight
into our living nightmares?
We must do more than type at keys in our silos. We must create a system of
right action and we must live these actions first as we tell of them. We
must demonstrate how much better our offerings are and describe each step as
best we can within our dear platform development group so as to convince the
rest of the world it is a better in practice, a more preferable truth than
before. No matter that many of the assumptions in it are opposed to the ones
we have learned. Many of us have had to learn how to react to a nightmare
with a wide array of distractions and antagonisms and chemical indulgences
that secure any hope of sanity within its predatory assumptions. We must
look clearly at why it is we have distracted ourselves, why we are
antagonistic toward others and ourselves. With such reflections, we can
better work  to solve the most glaring structural problems that create and
reinforce these insanities as ?global practice?. It begins, with the
approach or a way of thinking about thinking; and it must not require
thought at all at times, especially under great stresses, so to better think
and act. The result can be stated simply: secure the necessities of life by
the one living it with a system created by the few that care; or placed
another way, help others secure their own livelihoods without want to
destroy others; in other words, present a general approach to share securely
so others may live personally secure. These words must ultimately become
grounded in practice for it to have any hope of improving our lives in some
I know things about this department that are constitutionally unsavory. This
is not to suggest an avenue for revenge, as it might seem, but to outline
this corruption within that which exists to manage the scarcity of its
institution, by its very practice, a creator of scarcity, as Paul, you often
repeat in many ways. Keep restating the argument as the opportunities
surface, never mind how crankish this approach may be, as it can very easily
surface again and again with the critical thought of our sort, in view of
every proprietary activity in practice. So, for that example: here?s some
dirt: when students are in violation of parking protocols, the fines are
taken from student accounts without permission, whether the student has
observed the citation or not. That ain't legal. I only know this because I
had a chat with a highly gifted prelaw student I will send your way. He was
home or unschooled, by the way.  I suggested he join the student government
association, crowd source the message, and pursue with the students to
attenuate the UPD?s corruption. If we might have attenuation of this sort an
underlying amplification must secure the livelihoods of UPD for the better
for this to be an act of compassionate governance. To even consider such
activity, however, would only work to dissolve the image of the state
institution of its black box or unquestionable or proprietary superiority
over the ignorant and therefore sinful child it knows best how it--whatever
that may be--though it is nothing at all in itself--is to best instruct and
for the mass to follow? So this curious prelaw student with his interest in
morality and inventing and innovation would better match Ghandi?s raw gifts.
So what is my role as so many long to have stated for themselves? My
father?s last words as I recall, ?Just be somebody? Just be somebody.? This
came from a man who saw his only son plunge from one distraction to another,
from television to computer game. I remember seeing when he knew this would
be the last to see me; he could barely speak then; cancer; the fear in his
eyes repeated the same message? Of course there is a great deal more to be
said from the last look a father gives to his son. I can only imagine what
this must have been like for him; what he might think of me now? He would be
so very proud.  My issue with this pursuit of ?someone? is that I enjoy the
autonomy in being indescribable? I can describe ?the world?, 'others', and
?my place in it?, but these are more fuzzy descriptions toward unfulfilling
repetitive pursuits as my madness reminds.
You and I are pieces; our arrangement can form many wholes; my part in
fabricating such views are to ensure descriptions of whatever ?mostly
unknown? I might find of interest at the time with whatever it may be? Call
me or it or you and what it is you, do and are, what you want? Doesn?t that
feel better?
P.S. What but of re-reflection, an adherence to a tone, but as best a craft
of music or poetry?
I wrote this while in a tent in Nacogdoches where I have lived for over a
year now; this my second camp during this duration; as part of a frugal
lifestyle of at least two years?

Paul Fernhout. We need you in person at this workshop. Clearly, you can see

away carefully worked out ideas are amusing but not very helpful."
I'm assuming here you are indirectly insulting what I previously wrote. The
uncertainty of this I find most aggravating (after I read it, but no longer)
than if you had used my name, because you are not directing that demeaning
comment to any particular individual, but you are still evoking a rhetorical
slam that seems to describe what I wrote. This is not polite whether you
admit to insulting what I have written generally or not. It is a very poor
use of our time to play implied insult games and in action invite the
terrain for more insult that we must put aside to create something better.

Hi Kevin,
It would seem you did not sleep through 'The History of Political Economy'
class in grade school! If only we had the luxury to sleep through such a
Labor, given a productive technology remains static, can be measured more
easily than a material resource. Yet, because someone, somewhere, is
ingenious enough or has access and interest in the production knowledge to
want to tinker with the productive technology in a manner that captures
labor value, it becomes difficult to measure a labor's worth over time. I
also think it is difficult to assess labor's worth because of the
subjective, or better, the varied absolute sentiments of value itself from
person to person within an environment. As an example, we can take clean air
and water for granted when it is abundant (when scarcity is unquestioned),
because value generally is viewed through the lens of reduction or scarcity.
So when air or water is abundant, it is taken for granted, without a metric
that measures its value, because creating a metric for infinity is not only
difficult, but in this case, invalid. Another question comes to mind: "Would
the labor plus the productive technology that captured and continues to
capture it be factored as labor value?" Perhaps this tricky question to
answer is the reason marginal value theory is used in place of labor value
theory, seemingly, to avert the issue of labor value vs technological
capture and (perhaps?) the right to possession this serious developing issue
To provide a rough estimate of labor value, might we refine this into a
formula: demand vs scarcity. Demand can be measured rather accurately.
Scarcity in labor terms can be reduced to: "At what percentage does a
populace lack in this specific productive knowledge?" Increased demand may
well provide the factor for scarcity of applied knowledge, yet to ignore
scarcity would mean to acquiesce to continued conditions of scarcity. I'm
curious to know what labor theory you would put stock in, Kevin. I am
largely ignorant of the giants that dwelled in this territory.
To reduce the scarcity of knowledge, given this is the basis of all
scarcity, I suggest a concerted effort to extract labor knowledge by placing
it into further means of self assembly by both 1) a machine that performs
all tasks a labor once produce and 2) reduce assembly knowledge into
segments at the comprehension level of a child in a manner that can assemble
the machine mentioned in point one. Both means applied to a product over
time with application can mean: no cost: free resource: a common good:
unless the abundance generator is usurped by excessive use. That may only be
the case when one is dependent on another (person or machine) too heavily or
does not possess the means to produce the artifact used: ignoring how a
productive technology is constructed.
It would be an interesting exercise to say, "Okay, what if energy where
free?" If the aim is to capture the Sun's abundant energy to power devices:
free energy is the result. I'm curious to see how this would affect current
costs, even with the misappropriations, divisions, monopolies, and the egos
that insist on being depended on for productive knowledge.
Ponderousness aside, this brings up a discussion between Marcin Jakubowski
and I that largely relates to this conversation. Let's introduce what I call
"efficiency through recursion."  The test subject for this model is: Open
Source Ecology: Global Village Construction Set: Compressed Earth Block
Press: melting and casting from scrap metal vs purchasing caste parts. This
process can be called a form of "productive recursion," an open source form
of production from the bottom-up, produced more efficiently to generate more
value than top down proprietary methods. The "efficiency through recursion"
theory assumes a 5:1 ratio of value generated to labor used in the
theoretical case presented. This may mean more labor time to produce an
artifact than purchasing assembled materials elsewhere, yet the financial
cost (waste) saved means less toil or wage labor in the long run to generate
the same item: therefore: a recursive acceleration in production efficiency.
In theory, this will mean more leisure time as a result when proven in
practice: for one that chooses to construct the item oneself at a community
generated Fab Lab or when purchasing the same item from an agent that
applied similar methods of production. This means the time to manufacture a
product through community supported manufacturing or personal fabrication,
whichever is most efficient, will receive highly significant productive
increases, and when proven by results, will become adopted. This theory can
be proven many times over when communities can easily acquire the knowledge
and materials to assemble the meta-tools or Open Source Fab Lab to generate
productive tools that reduce toil and increase leisure. Inspired by our
e-mail conversation and my stay at Factor e Farm, Marcin developed a working
formula to test the theory of "efficiency through recursion" here:
As these methods of recursive production acceleration are determined viable
and applied, economic growth in the financial (waste) sense will then
dwindle rather than accelerate. Agents that compete with one another to
reduce cost to zero play a game I call "zero-point competition." Because the
work of community supported manufacturing and personal fabrication
accelerate this form of competition, I am in support of it. Debts, as it
were, will become paid. If we are to remain alive on this planet "living
well," I believe the present "mixed" economic model (monopoly government vs
monopoly free market) must power down rather than move forward.
Clearly, Kevin, we would both agree we must abandon presently accepted
economic models altogether over time, however increasingly questioned, as
inefficiencies of the proprietary means of production and its subsequent
regulational methods are opened, translated, and rooted out. It can be put
this way: The best form of management does not require a manager. Therefore,
the most stable economies do not require external force known as government
as presently understood due to the self regulating nature of localized and
personal economies.
I assume built-in responsibility and accountability will be generated from
personal ties generated by local and personal economies. This is nourished
from empowered methods of labor, less abstract and alienated, to give deeper
reason for one's activity and that of members of a personally committed
community. If this assumption is correct generally, it reinforces self
regulation as economies become localized through local production, thus:
external governments power down as previous economic growth models power
down. The new form of economic growth will be in a new form of centralized
production: personal fabrication. All the roads I observe seem to be
threshing toward this destination. The result: effortless economy.
The theory of "efficiency through recursion" will be far more significant
once it is proven by the developments at Factor e Farm, or other community
supported manufacturing methods, or once fossil fuels become too costly and
force local and personal production into action. It will likely be a variety
of influences that bring production inward where it began. I'm sure, Kevin,
you've already noted the trends that demonstrate the in-source (P2P)
movement of production.
of some benefit to a degree. The insecurity that comes of a deskilled person
demands and has generated machines to do what one cannot. The great issue
with alienation (other than violence) however is a lack of knowledge to
understand how these tools are used to appropriate leisurely livelihoods.
This may be why doomsday scenarios are so avidly distributed in Industrial
societies: 1) to keep people dependent to generate higher rates of exchange
value for a self, and 2) the classical model in general is taken for granted
as the only model available with its disastrous consequences at least
intuitively felt enough to generate the feelings of anxiety, dread, and
finally: DOOM. That is, if "certain death," a lifeless notion, can be felt
as a most extreme form of a lived emotion.
I'm certain this issue will be alleviated when communication technologies
like the web are used to present productive knowledge in a manner most can
easily understand. The technology is already available today to accelerate
this knowledge transfer. I briefly outline a method for transferring this
technical knowledge here:
The argument for localized production would be deeply enriched by your
knowledge of political economy as applied to the working theory of
"efficiency through recursion." If you are interested, I would like to your
comment on this posted to that wiki or by e-mail.
Joseph, I hope you are jotting this down and making some sense out of this.
Robert Theobald, a futurist I admire, called community supported
manufacturing: Consentives. He however thought at the time of writing the
word, leisure generated by a Basic Income would propel collaboration: that
giving would generate further giving. Yet, as can be noted, those making a
concerted effort at this are propelled by toil in pursuit of leisure.
Fortunantely, we have enough leisure time to generate greater forms of
leisure. A world consumed in toil would not know better; many still do not.
Now to show them...

@_subject: [p2p-research]  Wikivision 
Thanks Michel and Martien for the support!We have Michel to thank for
the initial encouragement and description of this design.
My project, I hope here to recruit to do likewise, is placing information
into tables and adding contacts to each p2p network we have a category for.
Michel and I are rather thrilled with this effort in spite its simplicity.
Forthcoming, the wave format will be used to automatically convert this
material to Twitter or Facebook channels, or the personal social network and
microblog platform to replace them, which may well be the wave format itself
or whatever replaces that term later.
Re: Semantic Wiki. One semantic or automated quality useful for this project
is to have an aggregator or crawler understand what subjects are categories
and subcategories, capture unaggregated information on the web, and
structure them into categories and subcategories into elegant design forms.
In this case we're working with topics and subtopics in mostly text as it
relates to p2p. If IBM is announcing it's machine, DeepQA, will compete in
Jeopardy, this must mean the ability to auto-aggregate information as
described already exists.
This is edging closer to a more accurate automated question-answer tool:
This list only requires a few lines of code.
For now, like a beam of light in the darkness, we have passionately diligent
analog crawlers like Michel that helps to better network separated groups to
come toward a common aim we all can agree on, if at least in action, to
create a medium integrating all media that can adapt into almost anything we
The wiki design under discussion puts over twice the information into a
single viewing space before scrolling down by dividing the information into
two tables, a left and right, placed into one topical box within the box
that is a wiki page. The ones needing this information the most will likely
be using small screens on netbook equivalent equipment, like the XO. Text is
good, because it is easy for a computer to digest. A particular song on
"ticky-tacky" is now coming to mind. (Regarding "the box": It may remain
experienced as an iron cage of reason, but at least with our adaptive
communications, also material, we are finding ourselves better able to
revise this iron cage relative to circumstance.)
I've done manual copy/paste of code to recreate the tables. Those of you
that like this design can apply this code to your areas of interest at the
p2p foundation that have high content volumes of resource links. This code
was snagged from the homepage wiki: (within the double quotes ;)
{| style="font-size:90%; padding:5px 10px; background:
<---MAIN TOPIC HERE--->
black;padding-left:1em;padding-right:0.5em;" width="50%"|
<---SUBTOPICS ON THE LEFT HERE--->
black;padding-left:1em;padding-right:0.5em;" width="50%"|
<---SUBTOPICS ON THE RIGHT HERE--->
Most of the time is spent judging what is to be a topic, subtopics, and
which side the subtopics go. Inputting the code itself involves simple
copy/paste routines. To make this process faster, I've divided the code into
three sections, highlighted and set aside for instant copy and pasting. You
may want to use that trick unless you have a better alternative.
I like seeing the photographs of those involved in each topic category.
Putting people together shows in itself community potential. I'm working
with Michel to identify those working in these subject areas and adding them
to our team, whether they know it or not. Michel contacted me after sourcing
effortless economy--and look what happened!--peer production, greater than
zero, which would not have been had I not written on effortless economy or
had Michel not existed so diligently.
Here's a code example to apply, showing the images and bio/contact info of
people that are known to best represent a topic area. I happen to be one of
them in this example:

To add new images, write the image file name after "Image:", save the wiki,
then click the red link, where prompted to upload the image. Click back to
the wiki and refresh the page to see the image. There's a good deal of
manual abstract work here, from locating images, e-mail addresses from the
web, knowing abc's, and renumbering the entries when revised.
This code groups the section into 12 entries max. To reduce personal bias,
I've arranged the names in alphabetical order by last name, from left to
right, top to bottom, in the Western tradition.
Thanks for pointing us to semantic wikis, Martien.
So now the question is: where is the semantic wiki code to reduce these
mentioned redundancies?
May you succeed where I have failed.

@_subject: [p2p-research]  Google's wave ends email? 
This buzz arrived just as I've pieced together a pretty clear general view
on how we might go about creating an entirely post-scarcity environment.
What timing! Wave is the sort of hyperaggregator that can adapt to what I
have in mind--in part expressed below. 'Wave' is a useful term to describe
"collaberative design" in one word--fab.
Conversations are easier to track in Wave. It is backwards compatible with
e-mail, so a conversation in a wave can remain sent as an e-mail. When it
becomes a better tool in practice, and folk continue to speak well of it, we
may be witnessing here the last of e-mail conversation.
What I'm most interest in is Wave's ability to port in user generated
programs, like software and hardware design ware, and view within the
wave--from birth to the very moment--who made changes to a design and how
the design changed over time. By viewing a design history, we might find
something worked better previously than existing. Photo sharing or
collaborative essay writing are simple examples, but I'm more interested in
seeing how this tool is used in collaborative infrastructure or systems
design itself.
An infrastructure map might begin with the layout of NYCResistor's
hackerspace graphically represented as a floorplan after a wave search for
"NYCResistor." This layout is itself a series of waves, one wave for
'MakerBot' another for the 'Lazor X', ect. The waves 'MakerBot' and 'X
Lazor' may be generated without knowing about NYCResistor at all, but
because NYCResistor uses these tools, the established waves describing the
MakerBot and X Lazor are more detailed and adopted with a special wave layer
for Resistor's particular tools. The devices then, based on user
preferences, communicate with the wave to report a tool's activity.
Something like that would aid Resistor's collaberation with our friends at
Skynet--I'm all for that.
This program will help encourage collaboration by enabling the place for any
variety of app useful to generating a collaberative design. It will
encourage competition for reputation by enabling users to observe design
progress. The aggregations of these apps into a single program means more
potential for the cross pollination mentioned in the NYCResistor example.
Ryan says:
This is a very smart move if we look at Google's stock price decline over
the past two years. What I see Wave affectively doing is managing Google's
risk by open sourcing the ware, making it a general enough app to add user
generated widgets, including Google's apps, so when the firm fails, the tool
remains usable under increasing post-scarcity conditions.
I see this program being used to locate a variety of previous discussions
here and on other lists formed into functional programs inspired by the
verbiage: like Michel's F/OS Fridge. ;)

@_subject: [p2p-research] The difference between anarchism and libertarianism 
Thanks for sharing this rant, Sm?ri.
Keep in mind that this does not contradict the right to privacy. If you
Yes, but if people are unable or unwilling to create material autonomy
personally within their communities, they will clamber for their property
and insist that states enforce it. This challenge to anarchy must be better
addressed or rivalry without property or ownership without property cannot
effectively exist.
After doing a search on "ownership without property" and "rivalry without
property" I'm astounded no essay or volume has such a title. And the
immediate results have little to do with this challenge. If there's an essay
addressing how folk can create and how they have before created boundaries
such as "home" without property, I'd like to read it. I've developed this
argument internally, and have expressed these assumptions throughout the
sketches found online, but have yet to illustrate it formally. If you would,
address some readings on that topic, or better, in aggregate at the P2P
Foundation that talks of the abolition of property. This argument must be
better made, with some historical and present day examples, to overcome the
hurdle anarchism has for major acceptance.
Any political view which stems from the suspicion that people will
inherently do ill toward others is only going to reinforce that which it
views as a threat by creating a state or property for defense. This means as
long as the wide spread belief that others will only have a toddler-like
interest in themselves, this will only exaggerate toddler-like attitudes in
others. This is a view held by many political views--including Left and
Right. A majority of folk presently insist we must have a state or property
for the sake of order or protection. Like you've addressed, a tremendous
majority have bought into the Hobbsian fallacy that no one can manage
without a broadcast medium directed from above to instruct and deem what is
appropriate or not. Viewing others as 'others' instead of a 'friend of the
community' - meaning - 'your friend', in addition to the social
infrastructure to reinforce the friendship with those you do not know, can
we ever hope to live in a manner an anarchist's moral superiority might
approve of.
Its important to note that these political ideologies you or anyone might
state is an attempt to create material autonomy and personal kinship in some
way. At least, if that's not the goal of politics, it has already failed.
The reason I've stayed clear of political ideology is that it seems but a
fuzzy reflection of what is happening. Its important to have simple models
to understand the world, but politics as I've encountered it hardly
addresses the issues or how to live well in any distinct way. This may be
because politics in most cases are used to reinforce the state and property
which prevent liberatory knowledge--as this would become a threat to needing
YOU to prowl around like a bloody toddler! Of course, I'm giving to much
credit in asserting this disposition as being self conscious. If those that
behaved in such as way, knew so and its affects, they would be kinder
Its the approach that matters. I've abandoned reason and approached
'strangers' as (rather than 'like') friends, and I've received the same
approach in kind in most cases. The problem, however, is the pervasive
infrastructure of property and the state to reinforce alienation, ignorance,
and the belief that everyone is stupid, however--you--yes--ONLY YOU--are
special-- superior! Descartes' silliness supposition that "ONLY I EXIST"
persists to this day. This means being kind is difficult to maintain under
our present Industrial conditions. So most folk, even in my small town,
present themselves as unapproachable--austere--at least to those they do not
know. This may be done as a simple protective mechanism, but this method
usually only reinforces alienation and more reason to take defensive action.
This approach is so profoundly destructive, but these assumptions we call
culture are hardly questioned. One reason is because folk are just too busy
to think much at all!
The infrastructures are theoretically more mailable than ever. Transaction
costs for communications are free after that one time purchase many do not
pay at all, or at least, externalise. Tax payers, parent's of students and
students, and businesses--among the other abstract methods to producing and
maintaining stuff--have paid for my privilege to deliver this massage: it is
written from a university using Google, which holds the data using equipment
and energy paid for by business advertisement. So though I do not pay a fee
to use a computer or the web, we still have work to do in order to make--or
because it existed before--re-make community in a way that continues the use
of lovely environments created in air conditioned space and computer
networks--that is to say--continuing present comforts of living.
With your experience Sm?ri, you can share with the world how to make a
better fabrication workshop. I hope to see a document of this sort from you
and your folk within the MIT fab lab network, one that insights the
collaboration and equality we strive for. That document must be a wiki and
its contents must apply and instill a change of behavior in a way that
empowers self and creates or enriches community so to come alive and expand
to reflect how its used in each unique community setting.
How might we create a better world? That's too general in itself, of course,
but we can apply this question to areas of interest and the organizations
that nurture them--like CSAs. So, how might we make a CSA work without money
while maintaining our comforts? The answer to that question I believe is in
'networked computing power'. Now how might we use social networking tools to
create an understandable and replicable collaberative design that represent
physical activities, beginning with the CSA organism itself? This design can
show a CSA's operations elegantly, request needed materials to members known
to have them, and select volunteers to work when they wish to work. It looks
as if Google Wave just might have the potential to aid in this coordination
even moreso than social network sites and wiki pages alone. I've already
described 'waves' beyond the present scope of Google Wave's project. I hope
people can imagine for themselves how wave as collaborative design might
look, beyond the scope of written text and images--rather--in text and
images that represent existing activities, express needs, with a community
network to meet them in freeconomic fashion at best, the food itself
money-free at least. Because the community can see who contributes and who
does not, the free rider problem is alleviated and "competitive
collaboration" is encouraged.
So your interest, Sm?ri, might be in creating a collaborative design for a
commons environment for open source fab labs and the hackerspaces and other
community spaces that build and use them. Once the tool designs are
available and physically established, how might we retrieve these materials
as without monetary metrics, while simultaneously forming a community fund
to decrease costs for individuals while fab functions subsists on producers
that use finance? These are just some of the many questions to ask for the
design to answer. If folk are faced with paying more for less and seeing in
the other: better with less: the feedback loop is on in our favor.
Here are a few collaborative design stubs we can work on:
What do you have in mind? What's known to work or what's working so that we
can apply this in practice?
We need a collaborative design (like Google Wave) and web aggregator (like
Wolfram Alpha) to better address our physical surroundings to make better
use of them.

@_subject: [p2p-research]  A basic income guarantee versus peer production 
Basic Income and Peer Production are complimentary. A Basic Income will
encourage people to work collaboratively. I liken it to an umbilical cord,
nurturing highly coordinated modern-day gift economies. Of course, it may
add to the many umbilical cords presently developing the community
environment of the commons.
Why do we need a Basic Income? Its only necessary when depending on markets.
Labor is decreasing in exchange value expressed as income. Less income means
less profits. This has finally affected the market macrosystem after decades
of real income decreases in "developed countries." There's just not enough
negative reciprocity or market compromise to go around. The market can only
function so long as market compromise circulates with some measure of equal
negative reciprocity. We can view BI as a soft form of positive reciprocity
used to transform the exchange/property driven model to a gift/commons
approach. We might view BI as a link between the nodes of scarcity and
abundance, leaving the propulsion of artificial scarcity behind with room to
embrace more non-commercial self organizing and regenerative methods; to
know better what scarcities exist. Processes become public domain in this
spirit and everything becomes an accessible collaborative design. Here we
can expect incomes to diminish and eventually disappear as market exchange
systems become unnecessary.
The over-saturation of the centralized mass production model has left an
entrepreneurial gap in its wake, so now a final window remains for
increasing labor value by paying people to help communities build materially
autonomous local infrastructures in basic needs terms worldwide. Open Source
Ecology is an example of the first developments in this direction,
yet--rightly in my view--this community discourages paid labor. For some
historical background in this area, we might want to address the pros and
cons of the Paris Commune as to better understand how to approach community
living within crumbling institutions of the market and state. Another
approach is to encourage the most materially autonomous intentional
communities to document how they live so we might apply these techniques to
the common wealth.
A basic income will allow for enjoyable work done by those following
curiosities, leaving only the most time consuming, repetitive, or high
skilled tasks as paid. IBM recently announced a system, Deepqa, soon able to
compete on the television show, Jeopardy. (Who watches TV anymore?!) Tech
like this may dissolve labor capital rapidly, including the toilsome efforts
that may have required the extrinsic stimulation of monetary metrics, the
cheese at the end of the rat maze.
Basic Income is a form of post-capitalism in that it replaces weakened labor
capital. That view is an isolated systemic approach to compensate for a
decidedly reductive process, but when we consider the ability to do work
that gives meaning to our lives, we can better view the world in positive or
holistic terms as a reductive compliment. We can view our basic income as a
gift; and the spirit of the gift is to pass it on. Gender, racial, and other
cultural categoric issues will diminish further as we no longer must propel
the artificial scarcity of the ego for a once internalized profit
maximization. Cynicism will fade with the boundaries flexible, enabling
personal insights from curiosity in novelty or uncertainty. We're already
seeing rapid growth in the common wealth created by individuals within niche
interest communities, like hackerspaces.
You can see a grounded optimism clearly from this interview with Bre Pettis:
Video: Rapid-Prototyping - Interview mit Bre Pettis
Basic Income is the simplest way to compensate labor capital's conversion
into the commons. It can also reduce transaction costs considerably of
lumbering and hazardous state bureaucracies like the ones Alex mentioned,
while conveniently giving a means of support to those put out of work within
these defunct institutions:
   * Housing costs: US Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Fair
Market Rents and National Low-Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC)
   * Child care costs: California Department of Education (CDE)
   * Food costs: US Department of Agriculture (USDA) low-cost food
plan and ACCRA Cost of Living Index
   * Health insurance costs: Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS)
   * Transportation costs: U.S. Census and the National Association
of Insurance Commissioners.

@_subject: [p2p-research] Open Business Models 
This is my very first edit here at Appropedia. Wish me luck!
I am interested in understanding what an "Open Business Model" is because of
what I think they might be able to do for humankind, but have some
1.) Does 'Open' mean that the designs (such as mechanical drawings or
medicinal information (chemistry?)) of the products from such a business are
available under an Open Source license, or are Public Domain?
I hope so, for that is very important and good, since 'Closed' design is bad
for us as an entire species when it stops us from helping each other.
2.) Do you know of any person or group working on the 'complement' to this
important initiative? By 'complement' I mean ... whew, this is hard to put
into words ... I'm trying to ask about the "non-design" side of things.
If an Open Business releases the rights to make a product, then at least we
can avoid paying THOSE royalties, but the common person still doesn't have
the ability to actually MAKE any of those products because needed machines
are still too expensive.
What I'm trying to ask is: Does (or will) the definition of Open Business
Models  here at Appropedia
include some attempt to solve this problem of access, and if not, are there
any known initiatives that do address it?

Fab Labs used to give people further access as you put it.
By "Open" I mean Public Domain. No one is to get a financial return or
"royalty" for using an Open Business Plan, because that royalty is seen more
as a cost in the long run. Licensing is important here only to protect
Public Domain content from being taken and legally patented due to some
legal technicality.
We now need to look for a license that works in terms of Open Business plans
and make it clear just what the terms are. If a license for the topic under
discussion does not exist, we need to work with the communities that love
and know well the areas of intellectual property to write one with us.
So, once that definition of Open is made clear, the statement of an Open
Business Model is exceptionally revolutionary, because of the assumption
behind it. What we're (you, I, and others) saying by presenting an Open
Business Model is this: I'm using this model and I want you to use it too,
because it will generate more value for yourself and I in the long run if as
many people as possible put it to practice. That is practice in terms of
Abundance rather than scarcity.
So let's make an example out of this definition of Open and Business:
*I want to produce a Fab Lab to make 'almost' anything, but first need money
to build one, but I'm not interested in profit so much as getting these labs
up globally for abundant access so people can make what they want to have
(rather than purchasing it). In prospect, once these labs are ubiquitous, I
will ask "how can I make this?" rather than "where can I buy this?" Knowing
this foreseeable reality makes the presentation of Open Business plans even
more relevant*
*I then go to the market and see what's selling for a high return that's
easiest to make with as few tools and resources as possible. Once I've
reverse engineered (open sourced) the thing and simplified the production
process (potentially ignorant of patent law) I can now build it in our
feeble lab and sell it for a return (like on Ebay) in order to put more
tools in the lab which are then reverse engineered and resold to produce
more fabrication tools and so on until a fully replicable Open Source Fab
Lab is in every town around the world.*
Open Business Models are used with the understanding it is a race to the
bottom financially speaking and that this race is a good thing, because it
means abundance (real wealth) is generated in the process.
To better address your question, Open Business Models began to increase
rather than restrict access.
I will address this issue with the p2presearch discussion list and place a
link to that archive here once its generated.
With that said, here's some resources that can help our projects:
An Open Business hub which provides the two additional links to this small
list. OpenBusiness Guide 1.0
Community Blog / Resource for Open Business I wrote the content here mostly ignorant of how others define Open Business,
described in the resources linked.
In discussion we can better determine what resources to add to the Open
Business Model page at Appropedia to save the confusion you experienced.

Hi Patrick,
I've been where you are. I've concluded that it is far more difficult to
convince those at the top to make novel adoptions as you have mentioned. It
is not fleshed out enough and the evidence that your proposal works is
either scarce, out of context to present Industrial conditions, or
unavailable. In that case, the type of proposal you make must attract those
the hungriest (at the bottom) to move forward with the change you are
advocating: putting profit into production itself to reduce finance and
increase production power. (as I understand it)
I'm an advocate of Open Source Fab Lab development, which I believe more
directly addresses what we all would like to happen: access/possession to/of
a thing itself rather than purchasing what is wanted or needed. Fab Labs
increase this access by providing the tools and the web provides the
instructions people input to generate the thing for a greatly reduced price
tag -- to my knowledge only in theory at present. We'll see how long it
takes before my advocacy leads to my hacking of code or "busting out the
torch." For now, my fabrications are in the realm of ideas expressed in
abstract written language; however well or poor it may be. I hope not to
dissapoint my peers much longer once I'm satisfied enough with the GAME
A study of production within MIT Fab Labs could conclude if costs are lower
case by case compared to market cost in the constructs made. The conclusions
of this study can then draw attention to dissolve the problem areas by
further refining or amplifying the less productive fabrication processes
into more productive ones. I have no doubt Smari is nailing away at this
study! ;) Those conclusions can be presented from here:
Sam and I (and the OS Fab community) are presently developing business plans
for OS Fabs. These labs are under construction in Austin and Factor e Farm.
Let's work as a community to put business models, model resources, or even
model sketches here: At the time of this writing, I am half way through Neil Gershenfeld's 'Fab'
after hastily divulging over a 120 pages in one night, (I'm sure everyone on
the Open Manufacturing list has already read it in just a few hours or less
or MUST!) and I conclude based on my reading between the lines of this book,
the MIT Fab Lab enterprise, given Neil's spirit stays intact, will
eventually adopt much of what drives OS Fab Lab development once the
experimentations produce a model that works better. I look forward to
networking with the MIT guys only in terms of pointing them toward
organizers of the OS Labs themselves to use this "what works" with no
strings attached other than mutual benefit. It may be the rigid corporate
attachments that drive many MIT guys to the OS Fab platform before (less
evil?) corporate interests buy into the OS Fab platform, especially once the
methods are determined more productive and flexible. Smari I predict will be
the first! For now, he's more useful to us as a spy. ROFL!
In the meantime here's a food sharing proposal I call the Open Cafe ready
for deployment now:  I look forward to
developing the ideas there further with you (you may get to this before I
do) by attracting a partner network of community supported argicultures
(CSAs) to supply the food "for free." The Cafe is then a location to prepare
the food and host hungry people and revolutionary ideas! (that later become
conservative practice)
Right now, based on the experience from my CSA organizer friend, a
farmer/manager of a membership base of 30-40 people, its complicated enough
to get people to pay a farmer to produce food locally much less "work for
free," that is, work for the purpose of production itself rather than for
financial return. I believe that is mostly because many of us were
socialized poorly: to depend rather than empower ourselves within the
Industrial establishment. The return therefore must be well understood by
members: the return is in the product itself AND the product itself MUST
value higher when the work is done (by machines if you so choose ideally)
vs. the purchasing power of a currency: more product is then generated
ideally than can be purchased in the market. It MUST be that way or it fails
or is subject to failure or use of force to work, which in my view is
failure. If that ideal fails so too does that organization; the market takes
over as it were.
The market problem (oh my, I said it!) will cease when an organizational
approach facilitated by computing and the web provides more streamlined ways
of having tasks done (by people voluntarily and machines) in a more
leasurely manner. Costs are reduced when participation increases. If an
organization fails, it's poorly managed or the attractiveness of the
enterprise is not communicated well enough.
For the transhumanist/singularity people: when machines have an ability to
choose to do something else, they can make other machines that continue to
perform the functions we demand of them. That's my argument we can discuss
elsewhere among other cranks like myself and I'm sticking to it!
ROFL, we're almost there...

@_subject: [p2p-research] [Open Manufacturing] important appeal: social media 
Hi Michel,
Thanks for making this call.
What I have to present addresses the three questions asked by the author of
'Social Media vs. the Economic Recession'. Housing may need to be
manufactured out of Fab Labs at first until rent based vacancies are too
rampant, lowering prices down to practicality. Our contact to solve the
housing issue is Larry Sass. From
   - practical/financial (e.g. how do I pay the rent/avoid my house being
   repossessed?)
   - emotional/psychological (e.g. how do I face my friends? where do I get
   my identity from now I don't have a job?)
   - directional (e.g. what do I do with my time? how do I find work?)
Here's an idea package to add to the TO DO NOW list:
The Open Cafe / Community Supported Agriculture / Fab Lab Alliance
Open Cafes:
The physical hub for activity. A place where meals are prepared by people
for people to eat for zero money. Its hip and empowering to dine/work/have a
chat here.
Community Supported Agriculture:
Enough participants work in DIY gardens or community farms and donate the
produce to the Cafe and or from government issued food cards. (I play both
sides for the same aim)
Open Source Fab Labs:
Cafes align with OS Fab Labs to fill out the resource necessity gap to
further save financial cost.
Wikis provide only an example for the communications medium used until
better mediums are made: easy to use and easier to organize. For now, let's
work with the communications we have ready-made: e-mail and wikis.
Here are a few, but hardly all, hoops to jump through to make this Alliance
a reality. This is just to prime the creative pump.
The Cafe is the focus:
   - A space and resources are donated for this purpose by those that see
   the benefit. It can begin in your home and branch out. In urban settings, it
   can begin with what is already public domain, the local park.
   - Food and beverage donation. Donations for the day/week can be viewed in
   advance on the Cafe's wiki. Most everyone will want to participate in
   production because everyone can go here for free. There are no consumers
   here, rather, this is where producers are born willingly. There is not much
   difference between consumption or production here.
   - If money is needed, a wiki shows expenses that need to be met and what
   is generating them; those in the Fab Lab then have something to make to
   reduce or eliminate that cost.
   - Event planning. This too is done in wikis and is a place for people to
   perform or have specific discussions at the Cafe or elsewhere (like at the
   CSA or Fab Lab) to benefit the Cafe and the people that go there. The Cafe
   is our focus, because its where all of our interests can unite: in putting
   food literally on the table.
   - Elaborate and replicate the Cafe as needed from here:
   Other than crowdsourcing, here's another way the Trio can receive additional
funding until its less or no longer required. If one part of the trio has
more surplus funds than another, these funds are tapped by the Cafe or
Community Farm as needed based on the Open Source Pact or publicly viewable
and revisable mutual agreement. (when necessary) Ideally, this pact works
very well as a wiki. The establishment of a wiki contract shows in itself
how well the contract works.
The Sell Stuff to Get Stuff Business Model
I want to produce a Fab Lab to make 'almost' anything, but first need money
to build one, but I'm not interested in profit so much as getting these labs
up globally for abundant access so people can make what they want to have
(rather than purchasing it / bashing me over the head for one). In prospect,
once these labs are ubiquitous, I will ask "how can I make this?" rather
than "where can I buy this?" Later it will only be "where can I make this"
as desired. Knowing this foreseeable reality makes the presentation of Open
Business plans like this one even more relevant and necessary.
I then go to the market and see what's selling for a high return that's
easiest to make with as few tools and resources as possible. Once I've
reverse engineered (open sourced) the thing and simplified the production
process (potentially ignorant of patent law) I can now build it in our
feeble lab and sell it for a return (like on Ebay) in order to put more
tools in the lab which are then reverse engineered and resold to produce
more fabrication tools and so on until a fully replicable Open Source Fab
Lab is in every town around the world.
The Fab Lab is only an example presented in the story found in the preceding
two paragraphs. The basis of this model can work for a CSA and Cafe as well,
but I suspect OS Fab Labs will be the bread winner financially for these
groups, even if the bread comes from the CSA and made at the Cafe by real
people with real machines. I say OS Fabs will be the bread winners because
the stuff made there are more difficult than replicating Cafes or Farms.
Argument complete.
My presentation and prose may be a fault, but I believe the general ideas
are sound. If you disagree, its only based on my presentation. With your
help or without you even knowing it we will amplify and attenuate a version
of this proposal into practicality before generating something better. This
can begin by further refining the ideas described here to better assist:
viable application.
Support Michel and P2P Foundation, Factor e Farm and Appropedia, your local
OS Fab Lab, CSA, and start an Open Cafe. MIT, can you spare a dime? We'll be
fine given our persistence toward the aims touched on here.

have, thus, step into simpler terrain: food, indoors or outdoors. As I see
it, moving further with the specific initiatives we're working starts with a
good meal in an environment that embodies our ideals. If anything, learners
of history will find a display of information not related to their intended
Hacking code and hardware is important, we need to reverse engineer and open
source stuff and what makes the stuff in our lives to reduce costs toward
zero, but we also need to open source the basics: food and the places we
inhabit. If we can make a place to stay and food with no strings attached
universal, the rest will by default follow.
Now my task in this area is to find these social networks that may be
attracted to the idea of a Cafe commons. Its just a matter of finding the
groups that are doing this sort of stuff: community/DIY/gift
economy/p2p/open source. Those terms can be spared and made as simply as
this: the types that would rather not use money, but if necessary, make
frugal use of it. All groups that presently work in that general format will
be attracted to the proposal to be developed.

My hopes are that these environments help people thrive and support
independent living through community organizing. It would be a place to
network and learn skills that help to revise, add, or replicate various
parts most personally attractive based on the resource dynamic, like
available applicable knowledge and material resources. The intention is to
make the organizational approach transparent and self organizing.
I recently read Wallerstein's introduction to world systems analysis. I find
the approach very attractive. This view provides the empirical backing for
the effort.
First comes developing this proposal further into something adoptable.
A few points:
I will look into Ward and Hess for more background. My influences presently
are that of Factor e Farm and NYC Resistor. Factor e for more rural settings
and NYC for an urban model.
Local agriculture should place a premium on alternative water sources
The Vigyan Ashram has developed affordable methods of ground water
detection. For dry areas there are ways of condensing moisture in the air.
Desalinization can be used for communities near the sea.
Appropedia is a good hub for the various ways of water.
Fabs can support rapid fabrication for housing. I'll look into the YMCA
model. I can imagine hostel-like rooms for those that avidly work in these
In an urban area, one large multi-level building could provide all basic
needs. A floor for  hydroponicly grown food, the fab, and cafe. The
remaining space can be used for housing. The more sophisticated the fabs and
availibility of materials, the better conditions may rival or exceed present
middle class standards.
Vinay Gupta?s work on emergency life-support technology for refugees
Cafes and CSAs without fabs can draw from Vinay's work and that of Open
Source Ecology, particularly the Hexcube for rapid housing.

Belgian strike to hit Eurostar services
Channel Tunnel rail services from St Pancras will be badly affected by a

On Thursday there will be no London-Brussels services except the 7.30pm
train which will run through to the Belgian capital via Lille on the
assumption that the strike ends as planned at 9pm UK time.
Eurostar said the availability of tickets on the 7.30pm service is
"extremely limited".
The company added that its services between London and Paris would be
operating normally with some trains making additional stops at Lille.
Services between London/Ashford and Disneyland Resort Paris will also
operate normally.
Another British version. :)
Eurostar services to Belgium affected by strike action
Eurostar has announced the cancellation of all services between Britain and
Brussels on Thursday due to industrial action by Belgian rail workers.
All signallers and station staff will walk out on Wednesday night in
opposition to the restructuring plans being made within the freight division
of the Belgian national railway operator, the SNCB.
The strikes will begin at 9pm on Wednesday, continuing until 9pm on
Thursday. Nine Eurostar services to and from Brussels Midi have been
cancelled, along with all other domestic and international services in and
out of Belgium, including hi-speed TGV, ICE and THALYS trains to France,
Germany and the Netherlands.
A Eurostar spokeswoman advised travellers to make alternative arrangements
and confirmed that any passengers affected by the strikes would be allowed
to exchange their tickets for an alternative date or receive a full refund.
?Unfortunately the problem has not been resolved and we are now focused on
ensuring all passengers understand the situation,? said the spokeswoman.
?Although the last strike in Belgium was over a year ago, when industrial
action does takes place it tends to be nationwide.?

Mentioned was establishing two basic incomes simultaneously: one for the new
commons-based economy: and the other to soften the collapse of the State
onto a financial commons: weeding the kinks from newborn material wealth
generating ecologies: for the forthcoming: universal free use commons.
This way: one basic income can drop as production falls onto an alternative
and more strategic basic income as fabrication techniques are further
applied to workgroup organisations: once launched as a viable relatively
standardised model: very shortly after initiation: no income once output
exceeds use per outcome.
"L" or able labor, multiplied by, "T" or time, multiplied by, "D" or
demographic demand, minus, "P" or production technique, equals, "M" or
labor/market exchange value
(L ? T ? D) - P = M
To adequately argue for a post-scarcity outcome, one must prove: labor must
require zero time, or demographic demand must be fully met without labor, or
labor must not be necessary.

Ultimately this will produce a way we care for ourselves well without
exchange trade currency. That is important to remind ourselves when we begin
to feel as if one thing is an end or be all.
In addition: in terms of tax free basic income proposals grounded in
rigorous exchange trade monetary theory:
Richard Cook. Bailout for the People.
I suggest issuing a basic income similar to Cook's proposal by the State: in
addition: an alternative basic income, perhaps instituted and shared by
affiliated Hackerspace, Pirate Party, Global Justice Movement and other
alter-globalisation communities, tentatively limited by measured material
resources vs. workgroup or technical capacity.
Alternative basic income surfaces a financial commons when linked with known
limitations of productive output. Ration units or gifted exchange trade
currency is no longer required to surface an item within the wealth
generating ecology: when: output exceeds use per outcome (or product)
The hackerspaces community shows a hint toward a model whereby small
workgroups are self selected to ensure individuals within communities are
able to produce for themselves, a method to recognize as: distributed
personal (DIY) fabrication.

Care for yourself and you will care for me
If individuals are unable to care for themselves they are not likely to
treat others well. Therefore, meet individual needs by making them
manageable by small self selected groups, so many can remain unaware of how
the processes work if they so choose, near the point of need as
appropriate, beginning with the simplicity of the village toward the
complexity of the megacities of the world, while working to make these
habitats easily observable on the web. This vision, better explored
and applied by each of us, put to practice, is then protected from special
interest or proprietary monopolization and narrow professional
specialization by ensuring everyone access to how the world around them
works to meet the most basic needs onward, thus increasing the ability to
automate any function when it is known better how it works, and without
special interest insisting exchange trade and the veil of ignorance and
private property that must be achieved to continue such compromises. Most
everyone has the ability to revise these means if they are less than
adequate. Today that takes some work and imagination, but it is more than
He knew
Gandhi, even immersed in the overwhelming socialization of vast webs of
ignorance and tyranny, understood these ideas well, even if he was
distracted with vast arrays of autocratic protocol. Its unfortunate to our
history that his variety of other methods to achieve swadeshi or self
reliance as he lived them overshadowed the underlying, most fundamental
cause of civil rights: lack of care giving knowledge and the material rights
to meet most basic needs.
We have the ability to apply what works, better than ever
With affordable computers and the web they have helped to surface, after
endless hours of explored curiosity, we now have the ability to observe how
human operations work in a way that's easy to understand. It only makes
common sense to begin with basic needs: air, food, water, shelter, clothing,
and the ability to nurture what really matters to each of us. There's more
than enough adequate knowledge on basic needs on the web today, at least in
terms of the self sufficient village model, it is just a matter of
aggregating all manufacturing knowledge, including basic needs, to a single
point of web access and aggregating materials locations to that same point
to viably produce the outcome.
Legos and Wikipedia
We already have interface cues from Lego model instructions and Wikipedia's
political process on how to manage common property which can provide a rough
template to apply to design, manufacturing, architecture, and so on. Lego
instructions are simple: block A goes to block B, add block C, then block D,
and so on, until the desired outcome is achieved. Tyranny of the one-way
"Lego model" is avoided when we observe how Wikipedia works. (unlike Lego
instructions which are simple problem to solve, Wikipedia could use some
improvement, like in terms of better authenticating accuracies and
fallacies) So if a previous method is not in place you do not like how it is
going, can change it without affecting others that prefer a different
setting; but in doing so; the process must either be fully automated, self
maintainable, or have a community to support its complexity where it cannot
otherwise automate or self maintain.
The Challenge
This means in some cases, even if a preferable option is desired: like
having watermelons instead of apples: if no one in the community
wants watermelons but you, it is then up to you to grow watermelons yourself
and for the community to support your knowledge and the materials and
spacial rights for such novelty. We assume here that all the community must
do to support this is by not restricting access to how to
grow watermelons and the space, soil, sun, and water to nurture them; with
room as you decide for a few more in an attempt to persuade the community by
gifting the fruit of your harvest during a potluck. That approach may not be
achieved for every known artifact, infrastructure, or outcome world-wide,
but we can assume its safe to say individual choice in terms of the basic
needs outlined above can be done: we have Gandhi's self sufficient community
and many others like it to prove this.

community and
wore the traditional Indian *dhoti * and

they insisted on increasing. The situation was desperate. In

Gandhi established an ashram  there,
organizing scores of his veteran supporters and fresh volunteers from the
region. He organized a detailed study and survey of the villages, accounting
for the atrocities and terrible episodes of suffering, including the general
state of degenerate living. Building on the confidence of villagers, he
began leading the clean-up of villages, building of schools and hospitals
Gandhi expanded his non-violence platform to include the *swadeshi*

the boycott of foreign-made goods, especially British goods. Linked to this
was his advocacy that *khadi *(homespun

spinning *khadi* in support of the independence

@_subject: [p2p-research] Free Markets & Free Use Commons (Post-Scarcity) 
Let us assume, to make this problem area easier to address, that all
materials are infinite or adequately cycled above rates of demand; public
domain and free use. Let us also assume spacial boundaries are adequately
negotiated without exchange trade, state authority, or personal compromise.
Based on a free market environment founded on labor alone, it is assumed
people are able to earn enough to pay for goods, because prices are reduced
in accord to labor cost, since only money goes to pay for labor and no more.
Now to address some of the issues that prevent this outcome.
Labor costs will differ based on rates of able bodies per demographic versus
demand for output, itself grounded in best known practices of production
technique. This depiction means labor is paid per time per outcome based on
demands granted by a market area's labor earnings alone. To better represent
the variety, in theorem:
"L" or able labor, multiplied by, "T" or time, multiplied by, "D" or
demographic demand, minus, "P" or production technique, equals, "M" or
labor/market exchange value
(L ? T ? D) - P = M
The representation expressed by Paul Fernhout to make a similar point,
however, is more fun. :p
Jobs = (Demand + War + Schooling - Abundance)) / (Automation + Design)
Demand is limited (the best things in life are free or cheap).
War and compulsory schooling are evil.
Automation and Design are increasing.
Abundance is increasing faster than decay.
Given that, plot the curve of jobs. :-)
To adequately argue for a post-scarcity outcome, one must prove: labor must
require zero time, or demographic demand must be fully met without labor, or
labor must not be necessary. In essence, the synergies between labor and
demand have over time become production technique itself, as decline in
labor value since the 1970s indicates in the United States,[1] assuming the
labor value of those producing imports into that country also decreased, as
the present global exchange trade collapse seems to prove. Decline in labor
value alone is not enough to conclusively prove a post-scarcity outcome, but
at least we have reduced the problem area to labor as a scarcity indicator
before working to achieve universal peer production. (post-scarcity or free
use commons)
Given we define a free market appropriately as one based on labor exchange
value alone, and that it adheres to 'perfect information', and that too is
adequately grounded in the problem areas open manufacturing addresses, (up
for scrutiny in conclusion) these sorts of complications can be addressed by
any user and negotiated with the producer via the market until labor is
null. Once labor 'no longer equates' it is up for the user to decide based
on production technique alone. The free market that comes before this will
enhance competition to the degree productions rapidly trend toward full
automation or sole peer production (universal peer production) and therefore
'free use' status. Imports from one demographic to another may become an
issue as labor costs will differ based on the theorem above, so the
challenge is to produce as locally as possible to ensure economic integrity.
One production technique used for an outcome may require more able bodies
than demand can handle, but if we assume transparency of production
technique globally (perfect information), the best production standards can
be adopted as quickly as possible anywhere on the globe. This prevents
monetary inflation, whether by lack of demand (inflated to compensate
payment for work cycles or output without demand) or by excessive demand
(inflation due to scarcity of labor). Deflation, in post-scarcity terms,
assuming basic needs 'free use commons' are available, means a reduced rate
of income is a non-issue.
Free markets, however, do not in themselves adequately address those unable
or unwilling to participate in the market. To request free use of resource
acquisition of market produce would be to subject it to inflation. By
placing demands on labor without labor participation, each non-labor market
user is a blow to aggregate labor value and therefore a market's value.
Those able, but unwilling to participate in labor activity within a market
environment are often ostracized into the workforce or commit suicide,
socially or otherwise. Those able to work that choose willingly not to
participate in the workforce, but enjoy the fruits of the market, may be
interpreted as exploiters from a strictly free market perspective, yet as
populations in industrialized areas continue to reduce birth rates versus
the rate of elderly increase, this becomes unethical in practice, if free
markets ever were. Japan is the most radical example. Due to rapid birthrate
decline, the 'Information and Technology Research Initiative' (IRT) was
organised to meet these particular future demands. According to IRT's 'Basic
Organisation of IRT Research Initiative'[2], by 2025, 4.27 million workers
will be needed in Japan: many of them to care for elderly; others to replace
the jobs the elderly once occupied. By 2050, at present birth rates, nearly
half of Japan's population will consist of elderly. By this time the United
States and Europe will have demographics issues similar to that of Japan
decades earlier. This means that free markets in response to productive
demand is inappropriate in the long run. Backed by the University of Tokyo
and a plethora of corporate sponsorship, IRT intends to meet demands with
the deployment of 3.53 million general purpose robots. Based on this
information, it does not require much economic imagination to recognize that
if general purpose robots are made to perform "the problem of insufficient
labor," and we hope for obvious reasons the practices of producing these
devices become public knowledge, the need for labor at all and the work
ethic itself will come into further question.
Therefore, a basic income must compensate those unable to work, whether
elderly or replaced by advanced machinery like general purpose robotics, or
even for those able, but unwilling to work. In kind, since these funds are
going to a dwindling labor pool as demand for post-labor output rises;
workers; paid or unpaid, must quickly automate labor processes, with or
without general purpose robotics, to adequately meet these demands within
'free use commons', whether 'free use' is founded on full automation or
automated to the degree processes are peer produced without monetary reward
or state authority. (i.e. universal peer production) In a basic income /
free market fusion beyond state regulation, (i.e. financial commons) users
in concert with labor will have more free time to further perfect productive
processes used, which will increase the value of the exchange currency, due
to labor or task efficiency per product output?including (we hope) quality.
Increased efficiencies mean less need for labor, which is good, as able
bodies decrease over time, until 'free use' is attained. Without labor
required per outcome category, and given output exceeds rates of demand, the
item becomes 'free use' by default.

   - What product or outcome is required?
   - Why is something required in the first place?
   - How are novel or specialized processes standardized, modularized, and
   integrated or rendered cyclical or cradle-to-cradle for simplicity? Or, in
   other words:
   - How are the fundamentals of manufacturing processes better understood
      simply as functions, steps, or ingredients, so uncertainty or
novelty when
      encountered becomes an acceptable challenge rather than a protective
      deterrent?
   - What design is assembled?
      - What is the best way to represent the design for people and
      machines? (images, words, Braille, python, FLOWS, ect)
   - What tools applying materials are used?
      - How are the most basic tools made to make more specialized tools and
      vice versa?
   - What materials apply to product or tool?
      - How are tools made with what materials?
   - What are the materials needed for the design? (or)
      - What alternative materials when optimal materials are unavailable?
      - How are materials made from more basic materials?
   - Where are the materials?
      - How are materials made easy to log and warehouse or locate by
      anyone?
      - How is it observed at the location to ensure viability?
   - Who or what will assemble it?
   - How is it delivered?
   - How are materials or use of land or other spacial boundaries accessed
   or occupied without personal or global compromise?
   -
   What causes exchange trade? How is money made? Where is it going? And: If
   the points above are adequately addressed: Why money?

I think that "spectrum" could be intepreted by some people as meaning
"from one extreme to another". A finite range, with linear progression
from one end to another. And so, the inevitble question becomes "where
you you on this spectrum?"
I interpret spectrum to mean a 'balance between' in regard to personal,
moment-to-moment, contexts based on environmental conditions, which may
include other personal, moment-to-moment, contexts based on environmental
conditions, 'ad infinitum'. (unless you'd rather stay put ;)
Dante, you go into the philosophy of work. You would enjoy this read
immediately if it were publicly available online; perhaps you can check it
out from your library in Brussels, inter-library loan worst case, until me
and my hacker buddies solve the information freedom issue:
Why work?: the perceptions of a "real job"...
My definition of work requires a fair amount of argumentation to legitimize.
My mother recently remarried, before that, three years ago, I was kicked out
of the house by her now husband: one reason was he categorized my behavior
as 'bum', but that as I know was a front, as he heard only complaint from my
mother, and wanted to ensure the safety of his younger daughters, by
insisting I do work such as 'cutting fence line' he knew I would refuse. If
I were to say, I work at 'so and so', no argument to justify my work is
required. If I were to say I am a college student, no further justification
is required. To say I am an independent researcher requires a fair amount
of justification within this "culture;" and it has taken a fair amount of
time to develop what sounds acceptable here. If I am asked, 'do you get
paid?', I respond, 'yes'. The payment is not monetary, but it qualifies
based on my definition as payment, and saves further inquiry from someone I
probably do not want to know well anyway.
So I would say "work" is what activity valued in life and will depend based
on your personality and environment; nurture vs. nature; what the individual
within individualist culture (today often mistaken as "nature") is important
or founded on that of the community when the culture values the external
moreso. What I described was based on a perhaps: a p2p bias. Dante, might
'nurture/nature' be an umbrella "spectrum" to add to your model? And so too
with it, 'individualism' and 'community'. Here are some others you may want
to adopt/revise, which basically represent variations upon the same or
similar theme:
          >>> Attenuation - *0* + Amplification <<<
Boundary <<<*
Very Bad <<< Horrid <<<
<<< Absolute Society (the whole) <<<
Cognition <<<
At least here in the US, there is enough work for at least 40 years
just re-making the education system :-) Wait until experience some
more collapses of globalized infrastructure. There's enough work for
every human on the planet in recreating our artificially globalized
infrastructure into networks of local systems
Law enforcement in the form of a human career is a sign of the weakness of
narrow linear models produced by a world-view based on competition first,
collaboration second, if at all: propriety = lack of knowledge =
protectionism = prison. The person within a market culture live as linear
minds; reduction before induction; what's in it for me before I give a damn
about you; and so on. The p2p model is a reversal of sorts, nurturing a
cyclical mentality, where the most power is noted as produced from the
external world, and it is addressed first before reflecting on the internal
self that surfaces after. This may be what Paul Fernhout means by "maturing
as a society."
Once universal peer production is established by the socio-technical means
Sam, Dante, and I are developing with you (whether you know it or not), how
we ascert value in such an environment will differ somewhat from the
regulated marketplace that has brought us this far; but we will still have
values, a sense of right and wrong, even if those sensibilities are enhanced
in a culture where difference is more than acceptable, not like before where
the market society had difficulty in caring for themselves, resorting to
protective means of intellectual and physical enclosure for self
preservation within the reductive expanse.
I quickly grow tired of thinking; of writing; it is useful for a time; but I
do it more than what is healthy; but such is needed in these times; we must;
yet I'd much rather be the abstractions they themselves reflect upon.

What people are doing is important. Why people are doing what they are

economies they perceive that they are participating in.

@_subject: [p2p-research]  Metacurrency 
Hi Sam,
This is excellent:
The idea that the medium of activity dictates the "currency". Paul
uses the example of bittorrent: For users of bittorrent, the currency
of exchange is literally the "bit". You have to upload to download,
and you can upload more now, which will let you download more later
(thus creating a surplus within the whole system). These types of
exchanges are not "market" exchanges, like buying and selling. They
are commons-based exchanges, where participants have feedback about
how they are taking from and contributing to the common-pool resource
of bandwidth in the bittorrent system... Read More
There are also similar commons-based webs of exchanges between people
and natural systems that can follow a "code", and the "code" need not
be like a script on a computer.
Instead it can be more like an agent based model, where you follow
simple rules about how you act within a system. Achievement of
creating a balance between yourself and the system will usually
consist of what you take from system, and what you put back in.
The argument that Paul and I make is that you can also look at your
yourself as a fractal micro-cosm of the larger system you are a part
of. You can look at where you are getting inputs from, and where your
outputs go to. What you take in can be from the "waste" of someone
else ("waste equals food"), what you output could be the basis of raw
... Read Morematerial for other's "input". These are the simple rules,
the "code" for what I call a "wealth generating ecology" (wealth =
other kinds of wealth beyond just money) a system that can generate
surplus consistently even for one person, and can exponentially
generate surplus as more people enter the system. The catch is that
most of the resources end up being voluntarily or systematically
co-managed as a "commons": a resource that everyone who uses
recognizes as something that no one user fully owns, and so must be
co-governed somehow by users. (resource is not just physical object,
can be the combined time and attention of people, etc)
You are describing how to manage a free use commons once a financial commons
is no longer required?
A financial commons is introduced when a society clearly cannot care for
themselves based on a work requirement to participate in a market previously
generated by financial capital. Japan most severely needs to adopt this
approach to prevent further the exclusionary tactics such as racial and
national superiority. I look forward to working with Dante and his Japanese
friend in addressing Japan's issues, as they seem to need the approaches
Paul Fernhout and I describe more than any other industrialized nation at
the moment.
Will you write a detailed description with Paul Hartzog of this
monetary/materials system for the p2p blog? We can then discuss it in more
detail in November. What you describe to me sounds more like a
"sub-currency" than "meta," but that may just be an issue of semantics. I
view what you describe as a way to preserve a free use commons from
reverting to a financial commons, or worse, financial capital.

Because they mostly have air instead of grain, perhaps not in the service

by means of more advanced p2p methods. This means a new currency
infrastructure is needed, an alternative currency, in the form of a basic
income for demographics that are technologically saturated or unfit for

describes the largest full time corporates. That read is disturbing; for

Thanks for clarifying Ryan, I know you mean well. Thanks for your persistent
contributions to the p2p foundation. In addressing Sam's question, I hope
this might address some of the economic issues and assumptions you've
Sam's negative quadrillion dollar question:
Spend the least amount of money possible; everyone wants to do this as well
when they can even if this is ultimately a contradiction; which means your
labor value or profit earnings are dwindling as you are forced to do this
anyway. The trick is to have the same living standards with less and less
money. Smari and friend's fab lab developments implemented within the global
public sphere will help alleviate the need for money, and eventually, money
itself. It will not happen at once, and monetary and political economic
structures will need to transition incrementally downward--but from what I'm
seeing--this is going to happen very quickly. This is clarified by observing
the price floors plummeting on computers, wireless technologies, and digital
manufacturing equipment.
These developments will only accelerate further with the integrated platform
our media ecology workshop will begin to develop more collaboratively. This
platform will help the globe care for itself by better knowing what and
where people and things are and how to use them self sufficiently; which
will be more efficient than sending armies to enclose and destroy. If we can
present a more efficient way for people to care for themselves; soldiers
will drop their weapons, state monuments will become museums, and business
offices will become something else, as people no longer need to labor in
these ways to care for themselves.
Enough people see the problems and are building solutions with p2p or open
source/DIY in mind. To ensure a positive outcome; we just need to make sure
everyone developing these various parts get to know each other and agree on
There is a lot of detail that I can only imagine, but when we are able to
achieve the final presentation described in 'Remote Self Assembly' almost
all of the issues under discussion will be solved.
After reading through lots of jargon, economy is easy--but so too I am
finding--things simplify with interest seeking a fairly clear outcome and
believing what is done can simply be done; therefore it can be presented and
developed in the same way; and in ways that use economic observations as a
developmental part.

Dear Platform Developers
Dear Platform Facilitators,
This idea is presented in assuming the space always remains open while if
any one of us becomes lost can have a general developmental focus to
incorporate anything imaginable with an ability to execute more specifically
to individually willed outcomes without diminishing, but rather, enhancing
in some way the outcomes of others. The focus I present in 'Remote Self
Assembly' will end the need for human collaboration altogether, but by so
doing, will entail the ability to ask deeper questions such as to better
understand why it is we wonder at all; or even want to do so; and why.
'Remote Self Assembly' is not as far fetched or off-topic as it might seem,
as our workshop will have enough raw talent as a whole to describe generally
what will specifically be required to accomplish the aims this document
provides as an example:
Remote Self Assembly
The text may seem too narrow, but I believe that it gives all specific
development groups an area to develop to achieve the highly integrated
outcome described; and will enable more time to discuss within open spaces
to ask questions ever more endlessly to ensure our individual and collective
life paths are sound. . .
Thank you so much Sophia for facilitating the Skype talk. You listen deeply;
all of us would benefit from this; and you act in a way that motivates
action; all of us would benefit from this. I look forward to better
understanding the ingenious magic you've cooked up by reading whatever
documentation you have that represents your general approach. We can see
this best by what it is you do to spur collaboration; so perhaps that will
do. ;) Just keep as you are and record it to the greatest degree possible as
the happenings occur. The finer details may be for an offline discussion,
but I ask because I think its important that everyone have access to the
knowledge framework you use to engage individuals and groups. We cannot

continue that before and after the workshop as we develop an open integrated
communications or collaborative structure. Those are very good questions
that will be forwarded to presenters and attendees (including virtual ones)
and this synergistic feedback will help to develop the integrated model.
More questions will include asking what each presentation is about; which
was requested; so that will be posted as soon as they are received. With
this as an idea initiated by Matt and Suresh, I'm asking they engage the
presenters by acting as that document suggests to provide the example for
how the document is put to practice for the purpose of this workshop and
ongoing discussion now and later in light of whatever relevant history
We really need to get to the root of things by at least in description
building something more useful than what exists today; to get the best out
this one day. To do that, we need to better understand from each other why;
what it is we'd like to achieve together; why we are all meeting up in the
first place; and how our works can contribute in some way to the works of
others in a way that exceed the existing collaborative platforms today.
Sophia can better describe how to better approach the workshop itself and

Dear Platform Facilitators,
This idea is presented in assuming the space always remains open while if
any one of us becomes lost can have a general developmental focus to
incorporate anything imaginable with an ability to execute more specifically
to individually willed outcomes without diminishing, but rather, enhancing
in some way the outcomes of others. The focus I present in 'Remote Self
Assembly' will end the need for human collaboration altogether, but by so
doing, will entail the ability to ask deeper questions such as to better
understand why it is we wonder at all; or even want to do so; and why.
'Remote Self Assembly' is not as far fetched or off-topic as it might seem,
as our workshop will have enough raw talent as a whole to describe generally
what will specifically be required to accomplish the aims this document
provides as an example:
Remote Self Assembly
The text may seem too narrow, but I believe that it gives all specific
development groups an area to develop to achieve the highly integrated
outcome described; and will enable more time to discuss within open spaces
to ask questions ever more endlessly to ensure our individual and collective
life paths are sound. . .
Thank you so much Sophia for facilitating the Skype talk. You listen deeply;
all of us would benefit from this; and you act in a way that motivates
action; all of us would benefit from this. I look forward to better
understanding the ingenious magic you've cooked up by reading whatever
documentation you have that represents your general approach. We can see
this best by what it is you do to spur collaboration; so perhaps that will
do. ;) Just keep as you are and record it to the greatest degree possible as
the happenings occur. The finer details may be for an offline discussion,
but I ask because I think its important that everyone have access to the
knowledge framework you use to engage individuals and groups. We cannot
expect everyone to practice with the abilities you have, but in presenting
the knowledge you use in a variety of ways, the chances increase. . .

@_subject: [p2p-research] Pre-Workshop Questions: An Inquiry for a More 
Dear Presenters & Developers,
This is an open space. This part is a more specific open structure within
the open space. If this does not interest you, but rather explore another
area that does, or know of a better way we might better prepare for the
workshop, please present that to this space as a new topic. Answering or
adding to these questions will help others get to know you and better
understand what we discuss and develop before and after the workshop.
What would you like to achieve from the workshop?
Nathan Cravens:
   - A text document with a collection of methods used to incite
   collaboration
   - A listing of useful collaborative or communications platforms like
   facebook, twitter, Tent, IRC, Skype, ect
   - A roadmap describing how we integrate social collaboration and open
   manufacturing theories into a single platform, enabling better practices.
   - A determination of funding sources that may benefit from the open
   source integrated communications product we develop.
   - I'm seeking a fun time and lasting friendships
What is your study or development about?
Nathan Cravens:
   - I am researching to develop the foundational assumptions for an
   integrated platform and the platform itself that can meet all human needs.
   No less.
   - This means I often get stuck with my head in the clouds exploring a
   variety of theoretical abstractions. You help me keep my feet on the ground.
   Thank you.
   - I look forward to working with you to better ground those views into a
   viable platform.
   - I am preparing to present 'Remote Self Assembly or Full Automation -
   Will Material Abundance End Collaboration?' if I am able to properly develop
   the presentation and if we have time. In the event this is not properly
   developed in time or we do not have time to explore this area, or for
   whatever reason or not, see the working draft of that document anyway:
      - I will write an abstract for this subject area once that work is
   presentable.
How might my work be compatible with yours to construct this "Facebook" or
"Google" "on crack?"
*Workshop Questions as PreWorkshop Questions* *for a More Productive
Workshop questions originally intended to ask presenters and panelist can be
answered here before the workshop. These answers will then be presented and
properly cited at the workshop as we explore the area of interest these
questions and answers address.
*Panel 1. Social Collaboration Theory and Platform. *
Presenter Questions
Note: Questions written by Michel Bauwens with additions by Nathan Cravens
   - In as few words possible, what best inspires collaborative activity? What
   is your group's "secret sauce?"
   - What is lacking in present collaboration platforms?
   - What is the critique of existing corporate alternatives?
   - What are the underlying principles and building blocks of your own
   project?
   - Status: what has been achieved so far? At what rate are goals achieved?
   Describe what worked in your best experiences.
   - If possible: little mock-up of how it should look like as is or when
   finished?
   - What is still crucial for future developments, what are the next steps?
   - Knowing what you do of other projects, where do you see collaboration
   can occur, and what would be the priorities within a context for
   collaboration?
Nathan: Forgive me for not answering the above questions. My angle is more
one of open manufacturing.
 Wrap-up
   - Once all projects are presented, there should be a process for finding
   synergies. Facilitator: Sofia Bustamante
   - Followed by a five minute conclusion by each
Nathan: We can do this in some way on our discussion list.
Inspired by Michel's inquiry, I wrote the following panel questions:
 Panel Questions
   - In as few words possible, what have we determined best inspires
   collaborative activity? What contributes to the "secret sauce?"
   - What basic platform functions are required to secure what we've learned
   of optimal collaboration?
   - What standards can we agree on? Where is the text document link we can
   collaboratively write, spelling it out?
   - What do we call this open and adaptive collaborative organizationally
   transcendent platform we develop together?
      - OpenKollab
*Panel 2. Open Manufacturing Theory and Platform.*
Presenter Questions
Nathan: I will answer these in terms of 'Remote Self Assembly'. (
You will be asked to answer these questions in the context of your own work.
We will work together as a group to combine the best of our ideas from both
panels to form an integrated platform
   - In addition to your work, what is needed to have open manufacturing,
   generally?
      - Nathan: A few pointers that come to mind are: transparency and
      adequate representations of knowledge. I address the need for
      cross-compatibility of various software and hardware standards in posing
      advancements in remote control by self assembly; a template that
will act as
      "water cooler" project I hope might apply to and further advance many
      different developmental works; including works indirectly related to the
      presentation described in that document.
   - What is the critique of existing state and corporate alternatives?
      - Nathan: Business stakeholders must become more aware of how
      technology affects economic activity, and the disadvantages this
causes paid
      work, which in turn diminishes the need for exchange trade. In turn, the
      state will have less ability to tax individuals or business in
      costly state services like public transport or neocolonialism. The
      alternatives under development must address these existing failures; and
      that business and state are themselves instigators of failure as
      economy dictates--with all due respect.
      - What are the underlying principles and building blocks of your own
   project?
      - Nathan: The belief that full disclosure makes for a better
      individual and something more deserving of the term: community.
      - Status: what has been achieved so far? At what rate are goals
   achieved? Describe what worked in your best experiences.
      - Nathan: My work is mostly theoretical today; the practical outcomes
      are forthcoming with rates of goal achievement as yet determined.
   - If possible: what might it look like like in practice?
      - Nathan: Pretty spiffy. I will insist a more descriptive answer from
      you! ;p
      - What is still crucial for future developments; what are the next
   steps; what amount of time (days, months, years) to achieve them with a
   defined amount and quality* *of developers and resources?
      - Nathan: If this group comes to a consensus that the demonstration
      expressed is a good idea; just off the top; the paper folding
demo could be
      in less than a year; the second part in 2-3 years; and the final
      demonstration in less than 5 years. Again, without much grounding, I will
      side with Gershenfeld and suspect we'll have Star Trek
replicators roughly
      20 years from now, *gratis* globally.
      - Where might these observations or reflections be applied?
      - Nathan: Hackerspaces, Transition Towns, Intentional Communities...
  Wrap-up
   - Once each project is presented, there should be a process for finding
   synergies. Facilitator: Sm?ri McCarthy
   - Followed by a five minute conclusion by each
 *Panel Questions*
 What are the best known solutions or resources to solve the issue of...?
   - Water
   - Food
   - Energy
   - Communications
    - Manufacturing & Waste
   - Housing
   - Transport & Distribution
   - Urban and Suburban Regeneration
   - Education
Nathan: I authored these questions, but now in light of time, and
considering the wide array of information already covering these topics, to
use our limited about of time to answer these questions to any significant
degree would probably be a poor use of our time. It would be best, perhaps,
if we compile a list of links to knowledge resources found on the web for
each topic (like Water, Food, Energy, ect) then explore the 'best of' (which
will likely involve our own work) to determine which options would be best
before discussing these issues at the workshop. I suppose these areas are
not as abstract as my general interests would like; so I am not very
interested in exploring the answers to these areas. I hope that you might.
 Now that we've determined the solutions or resources to place our
attention, what standards can we come to consensus on? (This may include
agreeing on more than one standard per category.)
Nathan: Sam, Tav, Eddie, Sm?ri, other software/hardware developers, I hope
you might address standards you intend on presenting so we might come to
some agreement before meeting in person.
 How will we manage and distribute resources as they become increasingly
common property, unable to use mechanisms of exchange trade such as wage
labor, barter, or currency?
   - Life must be a right. Therefore, the inability to 'earn' a living must
   not prevent anyone from living a comfortable life, as our moral duty ensures
   everyone, at minimum: access to neutral Internet, the ability to personally
   create or possess more than adequate water, food, housing, and protective
   clothing with the means to sustain them in a way that nurtures planetary
   ecologies and human sincerity.
 *Final Questions & Discussion Among Panel 1 & 2 *
   - Do social platform standards agree to open manufacturing standards?
   What compatibility or interoperable standards are needed?
   - What standards have we agree to?
   - What standards can we not agree to?
   - What standards have we overlooked or need to address later?
   - What software code or applications can we use to accelerate our goals?
   - What are we now preparing to further develop? What does our roadmap
   vision look like?
   - Where might we find sources for funding; individuals or organizations
   that might benefit from the fruit of our collective works?
Nathan: I was unable to answer these questions, but know those of you can,
so I decided to write them to see if you might.

I must make an additional mess of things: Another note on transcontinental
communications: make the repeaters mobile, with motors to keep them in
points of need. The is handy for repair and to distribute bandwidth at the
point of need. So if you're on an island and more bandwidth is needed, more
modules float your way, assuming at least one receives your signal. The same
would apply to land-based modules.
Just got your message, Sam, before sending this: air ships--like
blimps?--could work too! I'll give that a read. . .
It would be interesting to view these mobile units self replicate and repair
themselves or cluster up as I prepared to model the known universe. ;p

When lack of information is unequal to result in a relative equal amount of
exchanges, such as the decrease in labor value by means of technological
efficiencies, the economy tanks, after reactive or parasitic financial
tricks fail.
The major income distribution to the top is the result of technological
efficiencies such as automation such as software to replace 'information
workers'. Monopoly or property mergers are similar strategies that to 'play
on average growth' while population majorities continue into exchange trade
poverty, and real poverty for most that accept the norms of the existing
Similar views are expressed by contemporaries such as Immanuel Wallerstein
(2004) and Richard Wolff (2009). I am critical of Marxism and Anarchism, but
my views seem to echo many views within both of these areas as they are both

@_subject: [p2p-research] ecovillages and communities : which ones are 
Hi Dante,
For the uninitiated, when I'm asked 'what I do', I'm now in the habit of
saying, 'I help people better care for themselves'. If I were in the East,
(and I hope in parts of Europe) I would say, 'I help people care for their
families'. (family is a far more interesting and satisfying idea in my
opinion, but to say that in the culture that surrounds me presently, this
would be considered unpractical or overly dramatic.)
Thanks for addressing this topic, Dante. Intentional communities at the
surface, seeing that they are an alternative social movement wanting to be a
community movement, you might think they would be attracted to p2p; and I
believe they are for the most part; but the established language used in
these areas are probably the greatest challenge to overcome unless we have
viable solutions to show rather than tell.
The greatest hurdle in my experience is addressing the topic of technology.
If you call it 'technology', in the IC crowd I've lived in for a time, the
listening stops. There's a tremendously deep seeded neoluddite sentiment
(like that professed by the romantic and very persuasive prose of
Kirkpatrick Sale) that I believe is a great detriment to the autonomy these
groups would like to establish.  The issue is not that technology is bad,
but that technology in this view is confused with mass production, only one
general approach to tool and object manipulation, which is not bad in
itself, but it is bad if you want to 'earn money in the workforce'. This
means I'd like to see all existing jobs fully automated, just like a
majority shareholder of a company, but the difference between the
shareholder and I is that I want to see this further decay the economic
system that surfaced the mass model so that more people see the need to
develop something better 'underneath'; and that 'better' is a "commons
floor" which will rise to better production standards than mass production
as development attention is better coordinated; after the vision is better
defined: broken into easy to comprehend developmental parts (first for key
developers that can better establish in more detail what must be done; then
presented for users to do for themselves without a developer hierarchy),
assembled, and distributed.
My views may be considered post-luddite, (though I seem to have skipped the
luddite phase ;p) as I believe craft production (or personal fabrication in
contemporary terms) is the most sincere or meaningful work, but I understand
the benefit in having more advanced techniques that may include having a
desktop device produce the entire product, especially if it for someone
else, like the elderly, that may not be able to produce or deliver needed
items for themselves when I or anyone else cannot possibly produce or
deliver what everyone needs with simple hand tools. That may be practical in
smaller 300-600 village settings with the right people, but not for large
urban areas where abilities are more difficult to match a variety of needs.
Its also important any p2p advocate be very sensitive to the established
culture or spiritual beliefs; and try to understand them; and address the
practices members of the group care to better meet or exceed. After the
advocate is well established in the community then talk of other areas may
be appropriate. (The term 'p2p colonialist' comes to mind... ;p We're the
GOOD colonialists! ;p I would only jest on this if no other approach
Our foundation needs to place a fairly rigorous amount of attention toward
describing how p2p technology differs from mass production technology. P2P
advocacy ensures self sufficiency by sharing knowledge and other resources
in commons. Demonstrating good technologies like mesh network communications
and solar power energy devices (for example) easy to personally fabricate
and maintain by the community itself will go a long way in influencing this
very important movement and potential partner.

It might seem p2p rejects mass production outright the way I addressed it;
that may not be the case so long as the mass production is fully automated
so a 'worker class' is not required. That may be a matter of debate, but
that approach I consider the most ethical way of having a mass production
model if one is necessary.

Hi Paul,
Yes. With P2P, users are the infrastructure. Well said.
There will be a need for powering autonomously driven vehicles (some very
tiny to very large like a 777 or cargo ship) to distribute physical packets.
If hydrogen can be created and captured without cost, after the energy
producing product surfaces, might this fuel these vehicles in the same
cost-free manner?

Hi Franz,
I'd prefer to acknowledge my own judgment toward the appropriate
distribution of my writings, but I do want that judgment to be as agreeable
as possible. Thanks for your blessing. ;)
In this age and capacity it must, especially if the product can mass
produce, become fully automated at costs less than employing people to
perform the same repetitive tasks. In this way, if someone in the community
wants to learn how products are made in a factory, they may go and learn
from the web interface onsight how to fabricate the device or outcome.
The first generation of these factories may have a robotic arm on wheels
with a laptop attached that follows or leads you around expressing how parts
are assembled on the screen in the way the particular person can understand.
If the person is blind or deaf, a pad with Braille will explain the room and
the objects within it as they occur.  For the deaf only, highly visual
representations will compensate for products that have otherwise
unrecognizable audible expressions. (I'm becoming very interested in
learning Braille when imagining the device that communicates in this way,
because essentially all you do is place your hand on a dynamic pad that
creates the surfaces as if they were swept from left to right as they would
from a static surface. This means for those with sight can have the ability
to better absorb knowledge if they can both read visual text
and receive Braille simultaneously! To do this would only require a sensor
to follow eye movement on what text is being read to output the appropriate
Braille expression. You might set your Braille output to nudge you along if
your eyes wonder from the text surface. Neat! ;p)
In my critical view, 'worker's collectives' or 'worker owned factories' are
simply a milder or mutual form of exploitation. The profits may directly
return to the worker, but if the worker must depend on income or ration
units to remain a participant of resource rights, (the economy) the
collective will be persuaded to neglect the means to fully automate process
or enable the product user to personally fabricate to ensure the right to
participation within that tyrannous exchange trade framework. (I view any
form of exchange trade tyrannous as I hope any post-scarcity theorist might)

Hi Franz,
I will now act as if you are directing that message to me, even if you did
not state that explicitly. I believe the outcome of your message
essentially, as well meaning as it may be, exchanges fascism for tyranny. To
adhere to the outcomes you would like had will mean genocide by neglect for
the elderly populations to come due to preserving a then faulty past
A human is a linear being that can only experience so much at one time. In
the strictest theory, we may never have infinite resources, but all
resources, just as they were before from the environments that once fed us
before agriculture, can be managed or coordinated in a way to meet all
needs. I apologize for not breaking this down into a spreadsheet per product
or outcome, but that is not required, (even if I lack the capacity) so long
as those interested in a given area act in a way to better enable the user
to produce for themselves, personally.
Automation came out of capitalism to disempower labor and, somehow
paradoxically, maximize returns. In so doing it has shaped a consistently
ill person, a consumer within an exchange trade system is a pawn by which
constant distraction diverts attention toward appropriate mice trappings
such as sports, professions, corporate ownership, state sanctioned murder by
political dictatorship; call it a congress if you like; the results are the
same. . .
Yet from this automation comes the hope of better craft tools we're seeing
come out of fab labs and hackerspaces; and they are becoming more affordable
and more intelligent for less market cost. Franz, its really not a question
of if we want full automation, but rather, do we think automation of any
sort is appropriate in the communities we choose to live in? Our choice must
not to the greatest degree affect the choices of others. Your statements in
attempting to reject post-scarcity conceptions can only lead to a desperate
grasp of mutual exploitation within a collectivist toilscape I would much
rather not be a part. That does not suggest I want you to live differently
to your own settings, but that you not try to interfere with those that
would prefer different outcomes, such as the ones I would like, that do not
otherwise effect your own.
I reject this argument for lack of clarity! ;p
Sm?ri and I, for example, share this burden. I look forward to discussing
these burdens in detail so we might overcome or transform them in some way.
We cannot do it alone, but it can be done, we assert.
Again, if a group wants a tradition to be preserved, they must agree to do
so. For those born within these groups or for a member that may be persuaded
otherwise see these views as faulty, that person must have the ability to
choose a different way, one that may include automations in a community that
would prefer not to experience such silliness. . .
The datasets in response to these blanketed claims of scarcity are coming. .
. ;p
'Wrong' is mostly an opinion; which means I may be wrong for saying so.
Automations can account for these concerns given artificial intelligences
are adaptive.
Opening up to the ideas expressed by post-scarcity concepts will further
enhance these pursuits in parallel with p2p practice. I am stating here that
p2p and abundance are mutually exclusive, that one cannot function as
intended without the other. You must begin to understand and accept this,
dear Franz.
Struggle is a systemic and communications issue.
I believe I have affectively argued the contrary, but I am willing to debate
this with you further.

Thank you Paul Fernhout for your deeply sourced responses. Let's hope
someone reads them! If I knew you to be unavailable for some reason, I would
have desperately made my best attempts to dig into your research and mimic
your approach.
I appreciate you as a contributor, as this ensures room for others to be
more creative, as I'd like to believe I am attempting at the very worst.
I can be stubborn, but to call me a tyrant far exceeds my creditability
here, though I will oblige Marcin Jakubowski of the title, so he might wear
that signifier more proudly. I'm really much too playful to be a tyrant; as
that gets old after a while. You may want to be a tyrant too, but that may
turn difficult these days without being laughed at; if not now; that will
soon be the case. . . Don't mind if I fall into your rhetorical fallacy once
The web has all the backing you need. Try it sometime.
That likens to saying I can say 'whatever' because the evidence is in the
Or like saying the sun will rise because it has risen before.
Maybe I just find rhetoric boring? Do you like how I continue to prove your
point? Interesting isn't it? This must mean I like you, Herbie.
Just to make it exceedingly perfect and clear, the argument I am addressing
is 'that post-scarcity should be removed from the Global Village and P2P
Foundation list of things to do' is a bad idea and will only ensure
'struggle' within the existing "who pays" system as Rodney Brooks calls it;
a system that is ending.
I have located roughly enough of all the parts necessary to integrate and
surface a fully automated general manufacturing whole; discovered with only
a few days of search on the web. You could have easily accomplished this. To
create the machine may well not exceed the cost of a fab lab in its first
articulation, about the price of a luxury sedan, after R&D and patent
negotiations. That is a rough estimate at present and is subject to change
once the details are better pinned. This means the parts to create this
fully automated manufacturing device exists today; only; they are yet
properly integrated into a whole, similar with the issue of software
comprehension between other software as Rose-Hartzog will address with
I am seeing from my tiny netbook screen that we're very close to overcoming
boundaries almost as soon as we see a need to address them. I will have my
peers confirm the list of materials I've compiled are adequate enough to
produce this device before I present the parts requirements to the open
manufacturing and p2presearch lists at least.
For now, I will direct your receptacles to this one video; which is very
telling of the advances in robotics generally as it displays a hand that can
do what a human can do, but better, with touch sensing that can grasp
objects safely and more quickly. The visual system is also rather amazing to
see operating with the hand; as it can do amazing tricks; like throw a
cellphone from its own hand up into the air and catch it. Isn't that neat?
This video alone demonstrates, if you can imagine it, the fantasy of having
a fully automated general fabrication robot which could easily instruct the
user how to fabricate the object, including a replica of itself--and would
you know it?--this fantasy will work in practice. Its only a matter of how
we use our imagination and address our boundary rights from here on:
High-speed robotic hand: So there you go, some good 'ol evidence.
Once my peers and I have better addressed parts requirements and build the
first prototype, after the results and potential becomes more apparent,
we're likely to attract a self organised development team, as my primary
target audience are those within hackerspaces, and these along with
the initial developers will produce better designs so the machine can make
its own parts from less processed parts or materials until the machine can
make anything, including the machine itself, from simple raw materials from
any local area. The outcomes from this logic are self explanatory; its just
a matter of proving it with forthcoming evidence. . .
With that finally expressed, the statements of Franz-Bauwens to me seem like
silly talk, perhaps in order to preserve some vague notion of dignity in
manual labor.
I stress, again, that just because everything is fully automated does not
mean people will not want to do anything anymore and decide instead to
destroy the planet; as that seems the unclarified assumption from that view
in regard to post-scarcity; which as Paul F. mentions may be true in
Transhumanist/Singulatotalitarian/libertarian circles, but certainly not the
small patch of post-scarcity talk as described by Bishop, Fernhout, Cravens,
and Hunting which is, from what I've seen, a prevailing view in the
p2presearch list circle at present; and why I totally flipped when
Franz-Bauwens framed post-scarcity so dimly. I think were it not for that
pesky Franz: Bauwens: who I know to be a good kid in his own right, would
not have gotten mixed up into all this trouble; if only it were not for that
Franz character mucking things up. ;p Bad Franz! Very bad Franz!! You just
stop that!
I love playing drums and piano. No amount of listening to the most beautiful
music (though I enjoy that too with love) comes close to that feeling and
experience of playing what sounds come from the actions. I will continue to
do so, when the proclivity surmises, no matter how well a robot can
out-perform me. We are born to do stuff, to want to experience the acts and
variations of attract and detract in the environment of competitive and
cooperative attractions and detracts; and sometimes destractions; (or
however you like to frame it) and that will not change unless someone wants
to tinker with themselves for some reason.
Yet, you seem to think that you
I suspect you say this with such sassiness because you respect Franz and
Michel more than myself; and you would like for them to pat your head. I'm
not jealous.
As clarified and descriptive as that may be, I reject such notions
as inadequate, as it is an attempt to describe what cannot possibly be
represented adequately in words or metrics no matter the detail of the
phenomenon the representation claims to have observed. It was worth a try I
guess, but that was a futile attempt none the less, as well intended as it
may have been. That is not to say I don't view you poorly for trying.

*gasp* I haven't rambled this much in sometime! ;p
On Mon, Sep 14, 2009 at 11:35 AM, Chris Watkins <
Thanks for addressing this Chris. I will use this window to describe in more
detail my views on exchange trade and technological determinism.
Right. Banning trade will not solve the problem. I never said we should.
Removing the need for trade, however, is best. I'm not going to shush about
that no matter what investments you or I may have or how fiercely you might
label me incorrectly as a Marxist. In 2050 when the European elderly
population is greater than those able to care for themselves; even if money
where to exist; there's no amount of it that could motivate enough people to
take care of them. This needs to be understood before the crisis happens
before ignorance leads to the cruelty geriatric genocide by means of
neglect! If we do not care for our elderly or our children either group will
surely want to destroy everyone else in some way; we're better than that;
we're smarter than that!
So put the appropriate political exchange trade economies in practice to
address the existing production methods (from 'mostly': mass production >>
to >> adaptive digitally/robotically assisted distributed production (which
will be fully automated without (much?) workforce) >> to >>
digitally/robotically personal production enabling the freedom to return to
simple hand tool craft production if you so please) and distribution
channels or dependencies until full personal autonomy (craft or personal
production) is achieved.
I enjoy acting like a fool, (to see how foolish or playful you might act in
kind) but it would be much too foolish for me to state any specific time for
when we fashion our technology into enabling anyone to do as they reasonably
please, moreso at least that we can reasonably do as we wish today. We can
know better when we have the right strategy that we know in theory will
produce the outcome and if we have the people to meet those requirements. I
am now working on that document with those I know or know someone else who
knows how to accomplish these tasks.
To better express the link between exchange trade and production
progression, here's a working model to debate and elaborate:
Urban. 50% of the global population. Toward post-scarcity with exchange
trade as needed, but reduced with each phase.
   - we know what mass production picture looks like, factory workers are
   obsolete and we must admit this and information workers are being replaced
   with software. Not enough people are able to afford the goods so capital
   collapses whether demand exists for the  >> product or outcome
   - flexible mass production >> a few techs to ensure designs created by
   the user match the robots used to assemble a variety >> with few jobs in
   high paying positions, but mostly many jobs that do not pay enough,
   populations with this production formula are issued a basic income to pay
   for goods if they cannot be made personally for free >> product or outcome
Post-scarcity is achieved
   - Digitally/robotically personal production enabling the freedom to
   return to simple hand tool craft production if you so please >> product or
   outcome
The assumptions I've stated mean I am a technological advocate, but I do not
agree that technology in itself will fruit the production phases I presented
without guidance or self determination. The outcomes presented require the
tact of social science integrated with the study in applied technology and
will require an interest in how things work and an desire to make the things
that work to secure the paths I have presented. I am doing my best to become
a person of such sorts, but I admit I still have a hangover from the
consumer culture that surfaced me. I may well be considered insane; as my
beliefs do not reflect or address with much interest the present "reality,"
but the 'reality' I would rather live whether practices can meet these
requirements or not. I'm stubborn and more of us need to be in this regard.
I am a technological determinist in the sense that based on the information
presented by Kurzweil in 'The Singularity is Near', it presents various
technology developments, showing that when our tools are accessed by
computers or communications channels, people can see them and then work to
develop them further, and in so doing, the 'deposit' remains and grows
exponentially, and that this can be shown on a variety of charts as
happening before for sometime, and we call the human deposit that is made,
'technology'. If it happened before for hundreds of years along with a
variety of others things we can expect many of these things to continue to
develop exponentially regardless of our individual behaviors. I understand
the pitfalls of extrapolation as I will address.
I rarely, if at all, separate what is human from what is technology, as I
view technology as a human artifact; a series of methods produced to extend
or secure a human function.
For those not familier or unable to access Kurzweil's book, Moravec in 1998
made a similar extrapolation in 'When will computer hardware match the human
brain'. This essay simply demonstrates that as the years go by, it is
becoming more possible than the day before to have the outcomes I have
proposed here and elsewhere.
We have the ability to do a variety of things people do well with
distributed computer networks, so we have the computational capacity beyond
a single human brain already. Its just a matter of determining the problem
and figuring what artifact, ideally adaptive, that might address it and
problems the many other problems that come after it. So solving problems
just creates more problems as we'll have an exchange trade economy
indefinintely because of this? I'd like to see the evidence for
that argument; regardless I don't buy it; because people are poor when
there's no reason for it for one, but here's another reason to watch your
future market value dissapear:
When IBM demonstrates DeepQA this will mean the end of the researcher in
short order as a profession, given IBM shares the code or an insider hacks
it or someone figures it out.
A new job title is likely to surface once the researcher is no more: to that
of creator or content generator. That's what this guy says anyway. ;p
Tomoaki Kasuga "Bringing a robot to every home"
Kurzweil curiously (perhaps because he has billions of dollars invested?)
adds the exchange trade economy into his exponential figures, (but these
elegant mathematics dismiss most people having less income to that of an
average income, which fails to observe an economic tipping point we're
seeing, when ownership exceeds earnership or income becomes too disparaged
to function properly after financial gadgetry fails) which holds when the
Industrial Revolution as its called surfaced, suggesting we will have an
ever growing exchange trade economy. I reject that notion, but I have yet
the appropriate theoretical backing to better ground my claims, unless Paul
Fernhout has in his wonderfully expansive source references. Regardless, I
know its possible because of nomadic societies living well without exchange
trade and from reflecting deeply within myself to that which surfaces
emotion and seeing that it is a most reasonable moral pursuit. Many people I
have spoken in admitting they would prefer not to have any compromise for
living, tells me there are enough people here on earth to pursue the ability
to care for themselves without compromising others, call it alternative
currency if you like, it remains a compromise, no matter how ethically or
evenly you frame it. A market is a compromise. No matter how "fair" or
"even" or "equal" the exchange is, judgement is made toward a value of a
thing before it is addressed; and worse; at least two people must decide
that it is of one measurable value. The measurement of value destroys it in
my view, becasue to measure value is to destroy what generated its worth to
begin with, and cannot possibly account for what produced the 'thing' of
value. This is one argument that demonstrates why I am so strongly for basic
income or gift economies or freedom without markets because it lets the
individual decide what to do and what is valuable. However innefficient or
selfish that may be; these rough edges can be soften by technological
implements that ensure free human behavior serves the needs or wants of
others, intended or not. We're seeing this surface with 'recommendation
engines' like Amazon or friend suggestions on Facebook from simple
'friend-of-a-friend' algorithms that simply see who's a friend of your
friend and makes a suggestion for you to befriend them. When this is better
applied in an 'interest-of-interest', then we can see the people that share
particular interests like engineering or 3d modeling or robotics and contact
these people to build that magical technology that will solve many of our
(Ahh, but there's always a catch, a cost, a price. . . yes. . . its called
profit of the sort that cannot be measured and of which we can hardly
imagine; a profit that will turn our views of children as pests, as many I
see do to my detriment and anger, into the most brilliant of beings, as they
use what we build to do far more amazing things that what you may well have
already damned for yourself, long ago. But of course, we're seeing that
people can quickly adapt, so I have hope for overgrown children as well.
That is not to say we will approve of what they do; I suspect that like any
good parent we will not!)
If I thought the word 'technology' represented a magical thing that will
soon 'solve all of our problems', I would not be so interested in ensuring
that our tools nurture individuals and communities. So my concern is
ensuring the exponential growth of technical developments enable rather than
destroy people. Many people will likely want to 'destroy' themselves from my
view, such as manipulate their DNA or replace bodily biologies with 'better'
artificial replacements to a degree that would make them post-human. Many in
this group find this unattractive as I do.
What I find dissapointing is only a few people are expressing on the lists I
follow try to present full or broader technologically packaged ways toward
going toward an abundant environment. For one they may fear being viewed as
a fool for trying, such as on the open manufacturing list where many there
are tech friendly and savvy. For those on the p2presearch list, I've
experienced a sentiment of the rejection technology as a viable solution to
social problems; which I find rather unusual, since we're using a highly
advanced integrated media to have this very discussion. Perhaps I have
been criticized (thank you for the criticism, Herbert, as this will help us
improve our lives in some way) not because you view technology as a bad
thing, but because I have failed to address how badly technology is used. I
believe addressing the ills are rhetorical as the ills are clearly expressed
in every Industrial mass production based civilization today. Just
acknowledge your feelings reflectively as you behave; and your body will
tell you what is right and what is wrong: for you.
Without technologies like netbooks and the web life would be worse off. If
it were not for computers and the web, I'd probably be miserable in
university class room or miserable teaching in a university classroom for
lack of knowing anything else better to pursue. That's not to say I think
universities are awful places, but they are rather depressing, so will need
to become more flexible for me to have much tolerance for them, as I believe
any student, especially one (usually the parents) that pays
such outrageous fees, to follow the 'path of the [compartmentalized] elders'
insisted today.
It likely required more arms to put food into your mouth than your own. This
means someone is doing something they much would rather not. That must
change. Those three final sentences sum up my overall interest in the P2P
Foundation as a researcher and developer; to help people feed themselves
without making others hungry. If you think such goals are not appropriate
for the P2P Foundation, I'd rather not go anywhere else, because I like you
people too much, because you seem to 'get it' as a whole more than any other
social collective I've encountered.
My critics (that's good; it means I may be saying something of value!) may
say that may well have read well, but its not good enough, and that I must
say more, present more sources, and so on. If this becomes the case, I will
be encouraged to elaborate, but if not, that means what I have said is good
enough to work with. I do not think it is in itself, which is why we're
alive I suppose, but I hope it is at least convincing enough to critique. ;)
I'm pretty confused as to what to call myself as I seem to use a variety of
disciplines. Until I can think of something better than post-scarcity
theorist, that 'fool's game' at present, (so I'll accept the title of fool
as well) as it is greatly dependent on that fuzzy thing we call technology.
(unless you're interested in the sort of post-scarcity that can be measured
scientifically, what Paul Fernhout calls pre-scarcity, then you're a
primitivist, not all that interesting in my opinion, as we know this to
work, but without all the groovy toys I think and what others believe are
worth keeping) There is a reason technology is a separate discipline from
science. . . Technology is difficult today to measure social outcomes, so if
I'm addressing technology for reasons of personal and community autonomony,
this may seem to make things even more difficult as the modeler must address
what devices are needed to solve x and of what quantity and quality. This
provides an interesting challenge to the systems modeler or post-scarcity
theorist, but until that is better explored and placed into a coordination
platform, as to how to model technology in regard to its social effect in a
way that makes people present their works more transparently, if it is to be
a thing of use that exists, I will seem rather foolish for making ungrounded
assumptions based on small scraps of evidence. Paul F. is doing his best to
present that case; bless him.
Whatever I may lack in precision I hope to make up for in coordinating
efforts to produce the appropriate product everyone will have an interest
and no one will want to buy it as they ideally cannot, but they will have
it, unless they do not want a certain aspect of it. I intend very soon to
get my hands dirty now that I have some idea of what it is that is
Daily Me
This may well be the result if you're really into yourself. ;p We must not
let these types muck it up for the rest of us by creating technology that
can ensure those that decide to isolate in an extreme (and in my view,
unhealthy) way do not destroy the environment around them. These types are
the most likely to 'destroy themselves' from our human perspective. (again,
I'm leaving it to you to find the source material to prove that; my
apologies to the philosophers here)

There is a robot that does its own research, in the sense that is asks the
It would be better for me to restate that its 'pursuits like DeepQA' that
will enhance the researcher's ability to the degree it is no longer
worthwhile to pursue as a profession. There you another fuzzy window without
uncontested evidence; such is the nature of the 'future focused' mind. I
will do my best to play within the windows of the knowledge of the past, the
practical present, and anticipate future outcomes based on past and present
practical application. We might consider this approach one of the
'post-scarcity futurist' in 'gift' terms (one that is not 'rational' in the
contemporary 'market rationality' meaning of the word) or that of the
'foolish fool' in market rationality terms. . .
(So this mean in the past I have called myself a fool jokingly in an attempt
to establish a 'joking relationship' with my brothers and sisters in the
'struggle' for acceptability. foo-bitch-m'nigga ;)
As this ensures capital exploitation via the ignorance created by
compartmentalization without transparency and uneven permissability; which
will only become more uneven if we adhere to a market rationality as
automation technologies, like the research bot and many others to be
expected, remove the last remaining well paid jobs of the information
It may create more jobs, but they will be of less quality. This is a
discussion list and not a research paper, so I'm not going to present data
point after graph after data point. . . It would be nice to have a
DeepQA-like thing debunk that statement or not. Wolfram Alpha hints toward
that area. We soon will have the ability to make statements without argument
with argumentation engines as lightly theorized, which is why I'm less
rigorous in one sense, but more creative in another; again; perhaps this is
a response to my hang-over from a consumer mentality; but interestingly;
this vice can become a virtue in terms of demands for automation; which is a
good thing so long as we accept post-scarcity as a preferable goal to make
more feasible by wanting it; (again; no data; but you can determine for
yourself that without interest in the novel nothing happens to surface it as
practice other than the interests already established that were once novel)
then pursuing the questions necessary to develop the solution the problems
that surface to address a post-scarcity outcome. . .
Yes. These forthcoming research tools will better enable the researcher, but
not the profession. Its important to address that difference. This form of
automation when shared freely with transparent and accurate data will
benefit and enhance the autonomy of the person and her community.
Property rights then become a major issue that's for greater conflict as
projected technical advancements reflected in labor value decline and
capital collapse if market rationalities are not adequately addressed! Read
that line over and over and over again until you get.
And when funds become more limited and staff can no longer become hired at
the line at the fast food assembly line property rights that funds are used
to acknowledge rights to come into greater question; and if the boundaries
set are not questioned as technical abilities advance for the "principal
investigator," such types in these positions, without revision of the map
toward the territory with destroy the periphery that surfaced its core.
(Sources: Wallerstein 2004. Richard Wolff 2009. What can I say, the Marxists
are good are being critical of markets and capitalism. But whether Marxism
is viewed dimly does not refute in itself that the data lacks accuracy even
if the data and conclusions are fuzzy)
You address a valid point that has shadowed the problem: jobs still exist,
the apologists say, but they curiously deny that most people's income in
less and less. The only arguement I recall to counter this is: 'well, things
just get cheaper and cheaper so they can afford it'. That is false, as
outsourcing from the consumer area eventually outstripps the ability for
labor value to afford even the most 'affordable' of goods, no matter how
much bloodshed or hardship (toil) occurred overseas to procure the goods.
Unless a universal socialism or basic income is put into place as property
is renegotiate into a commons as labor value decreases we can only see
the tyrant and fascism to keep the progression toward that more theft driven
market compromise. This is why I find it astounding to have such accusations
of tyrant and fascist made by Herbert, a very smart person. This just blows
my mind!
Paul, perhaps you can attempt to understand why I might seem like a fascist
or a tyrant from an additional third person perspective? I'm passionate and
stubborn, but I'm willing to listen, until I think someone is presenting
something I believe is a detriment to their well being and that of others.
Even if I disagree I will do my best to listen to these views; as they help
to strength the argument Paul and I believe is essential for a fruitful
human outcome.My apologies for getting off topic. ;p
Again, I will state here and repeat myself if need be, that if post-scarcity
is rejected as a primary initiative for the P2P Foundation, it will limit
the ability to have free communication channels that assure transparent and
accurate peer-to-peer communications as technology is used by market
participants to maximize supposed gains or outcomes. The market place should
be second to a post-scarcity outcome! Would you not rather have something
without permission than to ask for it if that thing you wish is what you
feel is appropriate?!
We must begin to trust people and nurture their individual judgment and
present alternatives in complement with the interests pursued within that
person's community!  The evidence for this is berried in anthropology text
(Mauss' and Hyde's 'The Gift'; Marshall Sahlins; David Greaber) and in
alternative education texts (such as John Taylor Gatto) and your mother's
"irrational" behavior for caring for you without receiving a paycheck for
"services rendered!!" (If you think your mother should have received an
hourly wage; that's really disturbing! You are overwhelmed with a market
rationality that will tear your soul apart until you destroy the world or
yourself. That's called poetic prose and I will not diminish it by citing
supporting evidence; you see? I've destroyed it. Those words are the result
of the market rationality I refer to.)
This is a good approach to arguing for post-scarcity. Toward the end of the
1960s onward labor value decreased rapidly as the end of 'Treaty of Detroit'
represents in the United States. Paul, we must observe the technologies or
approaches used that caused a direct or indirect effect on labor value. Then
we must argue why that will continue with the liklihood full automation of
people will continue to the degree it cannot feasibly pay anyone enough in
labor value terms. That will not mean, as our critics will point out, that
our work will be less appreciated, that is if it is sincere. The issue then
is that work today is not sincere, but a duty, and fulfilling this duty
regardless of personal prefers is regarded a quality, but that long held
tradition is overwelmingly obsolete with each advance.
Creative destruction, build-it obsolescence, automation, outsourcing, call
it what you want, it destroys the very theortical fabric of libertarianism
as it is defined today; and libertarians will just have to get over that or
becoming sassier and more biligerent as technical advances make that
romanticised individual (the Descartes 'mind alone'), one that may have
served it purpose well to procure the 'fruits' we have today, but it will
only kill the 'tree' that birthed it, so it is therefore stated here a
notion of a bygone era, even if that era has yet to rest, it must do so
quickly with the appropriate alternatives to fill its place for the benefit
of a greater individual, greater because she listens to her community and
adopts a variety of things that work without resorting to narrow ant-prone
toil or the toilscape that once reinforced it.
Look to your Industrial dwelling today. Your madness is reinforced. Those
operations you see all around you are a lie. Admit it. And then act in the
ways that better empower others so you might empower yourself in whatever
way you can. I am doing what I can to do the same relative to my desire for
sanity, spontaneity or creativity. You do what you believe is right even if
it is the opposite to what I am saying, but that doesn't mean I have to
reduce myself to those standards, and so I am doing what I can so anyone can
live to the standards they appreciate without affecting my own.

Yes, but our critics may dismiss us if we call it "transhumanist"
;) I
The morality embedded in that term is questionable.
*hiss* socialist *hiss* ! ;p
I'd like to have the research capacities of you and Michel automated, that
would be wonderful ;p
Anyway, this is all not to disagree with your general point. You are right
I think it is good that Franz and Michel have standards, but I only suggest
they continue to question them where appropriate.

'...you also pay for your dog's damages to others' .. I don't recall that in
Beer's work. hehehe! ;p I'd tell my dog to fuss up pay for it! Its enough
like throwing a Frisbee and having it retrieved!
I agree with you Michel, well said, we just need to better apply
that lovely sounding theory of yours. ;)
(It looks as if I'm repeating a complaint:) The VSM model is a useful
approach, but I see it applied in outdated ways, such as by use of 'experts
at the top' 'congresses' and the underlying assumption of heavily
centralised mass production methods inappropriate when affairs are better
managed more adequately by individuals or small groups in or at the problem
area. Beer made hints of bashing the status quo in an attempt to have it
applied differently than the failing centralized or massified model today.
(I really enjoy his sense of humor; he reminds me of Alan Watts in many
ways, another Brit I'm fond of.) Its important to use a variety of
approaches other than the VSM model, even if it is adequate as a universal
approach; I suggest this for creativity's sake to better explore problem
areas possibly overlooked with the same universal model.
As Sm?ri hints, we have the ability to create systems that meet the need
directly managed by the user. It seems appropriate to begin with making
computers and communications devices in this way, with prices on components
of this sort already so cheap, its now a matter of hacking the ways these
components are made, understanding and making the machines that make them,
distributing the knowledge representations (words, stick figures, stop
motion video, Braille, ect) and 'free/gratis materials use' (nurtured by
cultures that experience the benefits of positive reciprocity as open source
software/hardware depicts to establish a free stuff repository for each
outcome mentioned on the web) details on the web, making it reasonable by
affordability; and easy to make with good instructional documentation.
So work the low hanging fruit and make it publicly accessible starting with
computer and communications components, then spread those tools to everyone
globally so we can better manage those problems, while working out the kinks
stigmergically the way wikis signal, as we apply this to that life needs
pendulum Vinay has outlined in 6 ways to live ;p
Once we get that life business appropriately handled in the ways p2p garb
suggests, congresses and the systems they represent will be of less
importance until they are not.

@_subject: [p2p-research] Pet Ownership (was: Cybernetics the missing piece...) 
I view pet ownership out of context as subjugation of the animal to the
subjugated owner; just as owners of capital are subjugated to the
performance of machinery or workers; or the reversal.
In context, ironies or dilemmas surface. To insist the view expressed would
mean to place domesticated animals in a harmful environment or to destroy
them, as they have not grown up with their peers in an
adequate pre-(post-)Industrial environment.
Perhaps it is most ethical for the person and community to better understand
the nature of pet ownership and its links to suffering and subjugation or
exploitation before making decisions in any regard. Once the person, family,
community, world is no longer submissive or domineering to one another, we
can expect if pets are had, this is followed by 'pets' deciding what human
folk they might prowl with. For cats, this means they get to choose what
human pets feed them. ;p
I hope this clarifies the previous jest, where the dog is required to pay
for damages after harming someone after a boundary dispute. Market
rationalities are somewhat beyond them, which may be why so many people
prefer their company over that of their own species.

@_subject: [p2p-research]  economic abundance textbook 
It would be appropriate, especially for this subject, to make the work dual
license at least; free at the digital altar; paid for at the paper generated
gate: like Benkler, von Hippel, ect. Its too late now, I suppose. If someone
decided to print this out and give it to others, I don't see an issue with
that either.
Another bit of irony is that its for a classroom environment, well known for
its socialization of artificial scarcity by means of artificial
specialization. Therefore, this book is a work of artificial abundance! No
offense, Michel, I know you and many other professors mean well, and are
doing their best under the circumstances.
I have not read the book, but I do not see in the contents table mention of
methods of production that would render something scarce or abundant. That
may be covered somewhat in '4. Resources and the Environment'. Production
method is very crucial point in determining a scarce (market) or abundant
(commons) environment.
Boundary negotiation is another vital point; and seems covered in the bits
on inequality in the second section.
I am really suspicious of this part:
11. Universal Employment
Full employment does not work if machines or flooded labor markets are doing
most of it!! This is why this topic must also be covered in that section!!:
Wealth redistribution practices in Europe that qualify as a Basic Income; or
the legislation passed in Brasil to enact a basic income overtime; as it is
understood that markets are good at capturing wealth, but lacks the ability
to nurture that which surfaced its wealth.
These policies are crucial to discuss if we do not want to end up in a Mad
Max like environment, not from nuclear proliferation, but from large failing
infrastructures unable to financially afford maintenance after monopolies,
whether state or business or both, have exceeded 'on average' monopoly
advantages. This is happening already in the United States with news stories
of bridges and other large infrastructures collapsing due to lack of
attention to the topic of redistribution.
I really must read this book before making any further comments. . .

This is a definition based, within the context Michel presented in one
message, on observing representations of the 'struggle' for "power" among
others that are assumed to share the same rigidly defined cognitive
approach, one that is mostly reductive and reactionary and can only approach
the world within its 'articulated gridlock' or trappings. Everything else
outside that described world-view is flawed and objected to destruction,
even if that novel view is a more preferable one, to preserve the past
'struggle holder's' own toxicity, thus so by stagnation in using a static
'logic model' in the attempt at preserving an ideology believed so
rigorously to work best and always.
That author does well to call it a "drama" or a play or an act; a show; a
spectacle. 'So' as it lacks mutual reciprocity and the sincerity that comes
of this. What is needed is a 'cyclical selfishness' as a preparatory before
'off' or a dissolve into generality or 'void'; no more, nor known in that
moment, the burden of the 'fabricated solitary self'. Without that 'awe' and
the peripheral power that drives it; that which feeds upon the enclosure of
need and want to preserve a disempowered mass or group of objects, a view
that may well approach one another as less than nothing, cannot last without
a perpetual remembrance of limitation, of 'flaw', of 'wrong' instilled by
the inescapable vapor of that culture itself.
That was the madness Hobbs observed; thus granting the permission for the
State: the gate to be preserved by the battlefield and gloried by the
bloodshed of the damned. This is a 'linear selfishness' preserved by the
State and other institutionalized opportunists such as market activity. We
are finally coming to grips with this flaw by applying working alternatives;
almost as an accident: Wikipedia. It is human artifacts like this that must
be applied diligently and well to the physical world or many more will be
damned by the 'rules of opportunity' at greater moral cost as I have argued
Power may better become defined as: a 'directed activity': and best achieved
when: an individual's will is transcended and 'becomes' the will of all:
best had after: the most common of basic human needs are met (rather than
promised) by this directed activity.
It is for these reasons we have permission to be optimistic. . . And if not
rewarded by the world around us; inner peace at least 'is'; "struggle" a
previous abstraction; 'true warmth' of a mother's love.

Health care and swine flu, what a bunch of stupid bunkity that will leave
the discussion once that mass media business says something else. This is
not to speak poorly of those (dammit Paul!!) discussing these issues, but
discussing these avoids the underlying causes of these issues: lack of
material independence: <<< in a phrase. I'm becoming all irate just thinking
about as such! WTF! ;p
Okay, now I'm back to looking around at things and hand waving like any

Hi Ryan,

hardened fisherman: doing to her duty: as you have seen many heros rise only
insofar as the blade plows them swiftly to the grave.

Wups! I thought that was to the open manufacturing list. Otherwise I would
not have made such a comment! I associated your name with open manufacturing
too strongly! Very sorry about that Paul and you too!
With that said, its important to define things like 'material independence'.
By that I mean the ability to care for basic needs without ration units.
All things matter in p2p land so long as you don't try to place bias that
might prevent other p2p alternatives. . .
Its good to be exposed to others to prevent disease, however: Too much
exposure: disease. Too little exposure: disease. They call that evolution
