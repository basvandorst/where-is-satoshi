Why torrent files the normal way when you can become anonymous by
torrenting small chunks of huge numbers of files instead? I'm sure ISPs and
prosecutors will understand!
Even if they start mentioning this little detail, their implementation
would still be horribly broken: ECB mode without authentication, no RSA
padding, poor random numbers, and code like this:
    try:
        raise ImportError()
        from Crypto.Random.random import StrongRandom
    except ImportError:
        from random import Random as StrongRandom
The list goes on:
Tribler is the Telegram of torrent clients. Stay far away from it.

Well, my point was that it doesn't matter what you've contributed--it
doesn't give you carte blanche to say whatever you want and somehow not be
deserving of a reaction.
"Racism doesn't matter": I don't know how to respond to that.
Then again, I'm not trying to rationalize why people deserve to die.
In any case, I'm not interested in turning this into a pissing contest.

Discussion of cryptography and related Highly recommend watching the video (it gets good at around 28 minutes in,

Very sobering to see sanity almost across the board, and I at least was
surprised that there are people with computer science degrees in Congress!

All that text and I still have no idea what this thing does. The exercise
is pointless: I could give you some plaintext and blob of random garbage
(or just use a one-time pad) and make all the same claims. And the

But all you really need to know is they're only offering $1,000 as a reward
to people who break their
provably-secure-everybody-else-is-an-idiot-yadda-yadda system. Maybe they
should convince themselves that it's secure first.
