here is his argument : i bought a gun i shot someone killed them got
arrested and convicted of the murder my trial in which i blamed the
manufacturer of the gun for the whole ordeal was overturned after i sued
the gun manufacturer and they in fact were then convicted of my murderous
rampage and i was let out of jail and everything was reversed and oh yay i
am a good person its just the gun manufacturer > they are bad - very bad
white men
and all those people in history that have been convicted of committing war
crimes they didnt do it really as they were just following orders

i am a fucking anarchist which by the words you use in your writing that
point to your low level concepts - you probably have no clue about
you are a capitalist - making frames for others to fit your fucking lame
ass argument - pathetic
an anarchist DOES NOT generally have one goal - capitalists think that way
anarchists are node based thinkers capitalist are monolithic thinkers and
often frame things in a dualistic or black and white manner which is very
christian religion in form and thought pattern
capitalism is an economic model that has severe ramifications for society
it is no different than having a monarch really there is a degree of
difference regarding poverty but ... i heard today that if you are dying of
cancer in uganda you have a 10% chance of having access to morphine ...
they give cancer patients paracetamol ... thats your great capitalism i

that shows how little you know about it for you to think of it on such

your not an anarchist
what was your little 'foray' - so french - do tell 1902 chicago?
for your information i am a provocateur that you cannot see that again
exclaims your lack of knowledge/care
its not just about the state - there are very different types of anarchists
- that is part of the quality of it all the form is open - its like the
concept of opensource
you are right to a degree it is about personal freedom but that still
frames as against the state so i would say it is more about not imposing
your will on others instead wanting others to be authentically themselves
and 'believe' it or not that has a lot to do with optimal production - each
person has a quality like no other ...
because some people have qualities that are harmful to others of course
there are huge issues of justice within this model and often we are asked
about justice - a lot of the community thinks on the level of restorative
justice which has models in pockets of society all over the world - one
example is in ecuador - the natives have a different form of justice when a
crime is committed the gov police are called but then the decision is made
with the community what will happen next - will the perp be taken to the
government justice system or will the community deal with them - if the
community deals with them then they will be asked to perform certain tasks
in the community to make up for their misdeeds - some even think it is a
good idea for the person to come up with the tasks themselves...
look up direct democracy - there is often within our model questions
regarding scalability that is often where the rubber meets the road for
people - we dont know how that works exactly as it is not been sent into
praxis enough but we have developed spokes councils and what happens is
rotation of all aspects - all members are rotated so that it is not
representative - now zizek has complained about our model that he doesnt
want to participate in this kind of constant meetings he doesnt want to
deal with other stuff besides his scholarly intellectual stuff ... i dont
think it is a problem no one is forced to be a part - there is just no
exclusion - inclusion is not mandated - so zizek is kinda not knowledgable
there - what i really like is that people that work in say sanitation do a
report back about what is going on to everyone and people that work in say
media can be knowledgeable about what is happening in that field (there can
be people that actually work in both fields of couse) but then the people
in the field of media can be alerted if there is something they can do to
help the field of sanitation in some way - get information out about that
they need help with this project etc... information flow ....
anyway i dont want to write a book here mayb listen to this - yes theres a
big star and david graeber capitalist but it has real info too
particularly i would point you to the theories of proudhon, bakunin and
 >> capitalism is an economic model that has severe ramifications
i call it capitalism

@_subject: reminder of mays manifesto 
i post this here as a reminder of anarchist models and how they can be
utilized in fascist occasions and are anti facsist but also are anti
capitalist - anarchist models are found in every sector that i know of
ideas of autonomy and horizontality - direct democracy but there is an
overwhelming desire of some to subvert these tendencies - look for them in
The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto Timothy C.
A specter is haunting the modern world, the specter of crypto anarchy.
Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for
individuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a
totally anonymous manner. Two persons may exchange messages, conduct
business, and negotiate electronic contracts without ever knowing the True
Name, or legal identity, of the other. Interactions over networks will be
untraceable, via extensive re- routing of encrypted packets and
tamper-proof boxes which implement cryptographic protocols with nearly
perfect assurance against any tampering. Reputations will be of central
importance, far more important in dealings than even the credit ratings of
today. These developments will alter completely the nature of government
regulation, the ability to tax and control economic interactions, the
ability to keep information secret, and will even alter the nature of trust
and reputation.
The technology for this revolution--and it surely will be both a social and
economic revolution--has existed in theory for the past decade. The methods
are based upon public-key encryption, zero-knowledge interactive proof
systems, and various software protocols for interaction, authentication,
and verification. The focus has until now been on academic conferences in
Europe and the U.S., conferences monitored closely by the National Security
Agency. But only recently have computer networks and personal computers
attained sufficient speed to make the ideas practically realizable. And the
next ten years will bring enough additional speed to make the ideas
economically feasible and essentially unstoppable. High-speed networks,
ISDN, tamper-proof boxes, smart cards, satellites, Ku-band transmitters,
multi-MIPS personal computers, and encryption chips now under development
will be some of the enabling technologies.
The State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of this technology,
citing national security concerns, use of the technology by drug dealers
and tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration. Many of these
concerns will be valid; crypto anarchy will allow national secrets to be
trade freely and will allow illicit and stolen materials to be traded. An
anonymous computerized market will even make possible abhorrent markets for
assassinations and extortion. Various criminal and foreign elements will be
active users of CryptoNet. But this will not halt the spread of crypto
Just as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of
medieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will cryptologic
methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of government
interference in economic transactions. Combined with emerging information
markets, crypto anarchy will create a liquid market for any and all
material which can be put into words and pictures. And just as a seemingly
minor invention like barbed wire made possible the fencing-off of vast
ranches and farms, thus altering forever the concepts of land and property
rights in the frontier West, so too will the seemingly minor discovery out
of an arcane branch of mathematics come to be the wire clippers which
dismantle the barbed wire around intellectual property.
Arise, you have nothing to lose but your barbed wire fences!

i am against those things and a lot of anarchists dont align with socialism
or marxism i am often fighting with my friends that are marxist or
trotskyists - i hate political correctness and also feminism its all
bullshit and brings no solution - what people often dont understand about
the difference btwn anarchy and socialism is that anarchists want no rule -
they dont want to be ruled by anything or anyone and deal with things in a
horizontal mode or horizontal decision making - socialism is state and
centralized autocracy - totally different animal

proudon who was the first to call himself an anarchist in like 1850 was not
aligned with marx - they knew one another but... he was not a socialist and
certainly not a marxist he worked on mutualism which is structurally
incredibly different and majorly egalitarian (no state rule whatsoever
autocratic or otherwise)
i dont think in a dualist manner either communism or capitalism there are
different ways
proudon dealt a lot with the issue of property which is an incredibly
difficult issue to deal with and some say if the french during the
revolution would have dealt solidly with the issue of property (a giant
problem because of the elite) there would have been a much more transformed
world after and a 'real' revolution
he had some things in common with diderot as he dealt with intellectual
property a lot - educating the masses... information flow for the people

is not a problem regarding time wasting - as the ideas of efficiency are
capitalistic and massively overblown + often what seems efficient is just
short term problem solving - leaving huge gaps for people to have to deal
with later - the big problem with consensus is mob rule - just like the
problem we have with supposed democracy in the representative manner

A specter is haunting the modern world, the specter of crypto anarchy.
Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for
individuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a
totally anonymous manner. Two persons may exchange messages, conduct
business, and negotiate electronic contracts without ever knowing the True
Name, or legal identity, of the other. Interactions over networks will be
untraceable, via extensive re- routing of encrypted packets and
tamper-proof boxes which implement cryptographic protocols with nearly
perfect assurance against any tampering. Reputations will be of central
importance, far more important in dealings than even the credit ratings of
today. These developments will alter completely the nature of government
regulation, the ability to tax and control economic interactions, the
ability to keep information secret, and will even alter the nature of trust
and reputation.
The technology for this revolution--and it surely will be both a social and
economic revolution--has existed in theory for the past decade. The methods
are based upon public-key encryption, zero-knowledge interactive proof
systems, and various software protocols for interaction, authentication,
and verification. The focus has until now been on academic conferences in
Europe and the U.S., conferences monitored closely by the National Security
Agency. But only recently have computer networks and personal computers
attained sufficient speed to make the ideas practically realizable. And the
next ten years will bring enough additional speed to make the ideas
economically feasible and essentially unstoppable. High-speed networks,
ISDN, tamper-proof boxes, smart cards, satellites, Ku-band transmitters,
multi-MIPS personal computers, and encryption chips now under development
will be some of the enabling technologies.
The State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of this technology,
citing national security concerns, use of the technology by drug dealers
and tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration. Many of these
concerns will be valid; crypto anarchy will allow national secrets to be
trade freely and will allow illicit and stolen materials to be traded. An
anonymous computerized market will even make possible abhorrent markets for
assassinations and extortion. Various criminal and foreign elements will be
active users of CryptoNet. But this will not halt the spread of crypto
Just as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of
medieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will cryptologic
methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of government
interference in economic transactions. Combined with emerging information
markets, crypto anarchy will create a liquid market for any and all
material which can be put into words and pictures. And just as a seemingly
minor invention like barbed wire made possible the fencing-off of vast
ranches and farms, thus altering forever the concepts of land and property
rights in the frontier West, so too will the seemingly minor discovery out
of an arcane branch of mathematics come to be the wire clippers which
dismantle the barbed wire around intellectual property.
Arise, you have nothing to lose but your barbed wire fences!

proudon who was the first to call himself an anarchist in like 1850 was not
aligned with marx - they knew one another but... he was not a socialist and
certainly not a marxist he worked on mutualism which is structurally
incredibly different and majorly egalitarian (no state rule whatsoever
autocratic or otherwise)
i dont think in a dualist manner either communism or capitalism there are
different ways
proudon dealt a lot with the issue of property which is an incredibly
difficult issue to deal with and some say if the french during the
revolution would have dealt solidly with the issue of property (a giant
problem because of the elite) there would have been a much more transformed
world after and a 'real' revolution
he had some things in common with diderot as he dealt with intellectual
property a lot - educating the masses... information flow for the people

i am a fucking anarchist which by the words you use in your writing that
point to your low level concepts - you probably have no clue about
you are a capitalist - making frames for others to fit your fucking lame
ass argument - pathetic
an anarchist DOES NOT generally have one goal - capitalists think that way
anarchists are node based thinkers capitalist are monolithic thinkers and
often frame things in a dualistic or black and white manner which is very
christian religion in form and thought pattern
capitalism is an economic model that has severe ramifications for society
it is no different than having a monarch really there is a degree of
difference regarding poverty but ... i heard today that if you are dying of
cancer in uganda you have a 10% chance of having access to morphine ...
they give cancer patients paracetamol ... thats your great capitalism i
find it disgusting
listen i am an activist journalist making money / becoming famous like them
off of journalism in the way they do it  is not ok with me its not how i
would ever in a million years do my work
i think your an idealist actually 'true capitalism' thats a theory
BELIEVERS????????? LMAO
i dont believe in belief that is religious
i dont think you understand that capitalism is well beyond an economy -

that shows how little you know about it for you to think of it on such
monolithic terms - it already works is working in many many places and
factions so...
your not an anarchist
what was your little 'foray' - so french - do tell 1902 chicago?
for your information i am a provocateur that you cannot see that again
exclaims your lack of knowledge/care
its not just about the state - there are very different types of anarchists
- that is part of the quality of it all the form is open - its like the
concept of opensource
you are right to a degree it is about personal freedom but that still
frames as against the state so i would say it is more about not imposing
your will on others instead wanting others to be authentically themselves
and 'believe' it or not that has a lot to do with optimal production - each
person has a quality like no other ...
because some people have qualities that are harmful to others of course
there are huge issues of justice within this model and often we are asked
about justice - a lot of the community thinks on the level of restorative
justice which has models in pockets of society all over the world - one
example is in ecuador - the natives have a different form of justice when a
crime is committed the gov police are called but then the decision is made
with the community what will happen next - will the perp be taken to the
government justice system or will the community deal with them - if the
community deals with them then they will be asked to perform certain tasks
in the community to make up for their misdeeds - some even think it is a
good idea for the person to come up with the tasks themselves...
look up direct democracy - there is often within our model questions
regarding scalability that is often where the rubber meets the road for
people - we dont know how that works exactly as it is not been sent into
praxis enough but we have developed spokes councils and what happens is
rotation of all aspects - all members are rotated so that it is not
representative - now zizek has complained about our model that he doesnt
want to participate in this kind of constant meetings he doesnt want to
deal with other stuff besides his scholarly intellectual stuff ... i dont
think it is a problem no one is forced to be a part - there is just no
exclusion - inclusion is not mandated - so zizek is kinda not knowledgable
there - what i really like is that people that work in say sanitation do a
report back about what is going on to everyone and people that work in say
media can be knowledgeable about what is happening in that field (there can
be people that actually work in both fields of couse) but then the people
in the field of media can be alerted if there is something they can do to
help the field of sanitation in some way - get information out about that
they need help with this project etc... information flow ....
anyway i dont want to write a book here mayb listen to this - yes theres a
big star and david graeber capitalist but it has real info too
particularly i would point you to the theories of proudhon, bakunin and
 >> capitalism is an economic model that has severe ramifications
i call it capitalism
when the assistant attorney general of the united states says they made a
decision not to try to convict the banks of fraud because there would be an
economic hit to the u$ of a ... that is capitalism in praxis today
i gotta go more later...

i have not heard this before - i had the information that he was
downloading way too much at a time and doing it over a very small
period of time and that tipped them off my information is that he was
very careful in other work of this kind why would he b so sloppy this
time - i mean how do you know he knew they were on to him?
yes but i think from my understanding it wasnt the amount of prison
time or the money but the fact that he wld have to plead guilty to 13
felony counts - he would not get to serve in the government ... vote
AGREED - i am not sure ppl know enough about his case any ideas about
how we can push it out there more?????

i would be interested to hear more of what ppl think were the

processies are not like "white" ppl > ideas of ownership are foreign
to me i am native american and most tribes though they lived in areas
didnt consider ownership of them but a co-creative partnership - re:
food > when my people hunted buffalo in the plains they didnt just
indiscriminately kill buffalo they weeded the herd and were mindful to
examine how they could be of help to the herd it was only intelligent
to do so as it kept their source of food and clothing healthy and
vibrant but also it was respectful of life
so there are people that give food away for free right now today > why
would they do that?
well i think ideas are in the air and we build on the shoulders of
giants so production is owed down thru the ages and i think there isnt
really a you basically > your first form i would say is life itself
and you are made mostly of water and some minerals (dirt) and when you
'die' your body dissipates like a cloud - i dont think 'you' die i
think you just transform
so there is no 'you' to have ownership > would you say life owns life
? that would be odd > i think ownership is an illusion i also think
you didnt make yourself so that would be a glitch in your argument > i
mean i think you had a bit to say in the matter but we are very
limited mathematical concoctions (gorgeously made and amazing but
limited) we cant presently manufacture ourselves in order to "own"
ourselves but even then we wouldnt be independent of life itself so
... > maybe in future we will manufacture ourselves but there is
probably going to be a divisive factor in the manufacturing of life
forms (divisive as in schism - not workin so good - should be
interesting but already happening w/ monsanto actually so...)

this may explain a little more
yes "white terminology" holds white CONCEPTS as do words in my tribe
the blackfoot and other tribes languages i am also cherokee for
instance the word "floor" does not exist because things are noted as
actions so it is "flooring" because things are not stagnant they are
active > everything is animated there are no inanimate and animate
objects all are animate
you may hear people say the whites 'stole' the land but what they did
was move the people ... kill them etc they did not live in concert etc
'indians' lived > very different
i am not sure mayb make an argument as to why it is different
i know of these instances yes but the land was vast so ... they moved
on ... no i dont think they saw it as particularly 'ok' and they made
confederacies and agreements regarding these issues - they had
community agreements which they worked together to come to also fyi
they had chiefs yes but they had different councils that made
decisions they still function in this way and what your role was was
what you were naturally good at  - they didnt try to make people into
something they were not
thats what we have now with neo liberal capitalism
i meant physical production too - i mean do you understand how many
hundreds of years it took life to come up with the spoon > just a
spoon that took a ton of time and energy and really i see myself as no
different than a spoon
i never said that i think in terms of co-creativity
no i was extending and making an argument > but how do you think you
"own" yourself?
BUT what about the tomato plant it took more "trouble" than u i would
say - in ur world does it have "ownership"
F no and i dont think there was a big bang either or a beginning i
think life is a spiral cone time and space are - i dont think time is
linear see deleuze and guattari > but native americans think like that
i think property is a coffin
BUT i understand what you mean how it could be seen that way actually
it really is a multidimensional issue but overall i see that history -
and my own inner gut - shows that having community is a more fully
effective way of living than individualism BUT also i think rulers
will turn anything they can into something fucked up
yes that was my point those are the people that are so interested in
property rights > hey ya know the largest land owner in manhattan ??
catholic church... know the second largest property owner in manhattan
?? episcopal church ... what i think they have socially engineered is
the protection of ruling class property rights and convinced the
people it serves them - it does not !! otherwise everyone would have
food and clean water and a place to live (its not that much to ask
for) really it doesnt serve humanity or life force either to have such
levels of separation between ppl because of who they were born to,

they say it is very problematic > the people that sit on juries are
not informed that they can in fact nullify AND if a lawyer sees a
possibility in an instance of a case they can get at best reprimanded
by the judge if there is any 'jury tampering' perceived
the courts have nullified the jury nullification law
if the citizenry were in fact knowledgable and educated that would
help the issue and change a lot of things actually - the education
system sucks of course so... and its such an odd thing because people
put such incredible "faith" in the legal system and they know so
little about how it "functions"

experiences - he spent a lot of time in second life fr what i know
he has some really bad history with micro-finance con games why not
expand ur lack of ethics onto other realms i guess his own little
crypto party > seems he would even sell a piece of chewed gum
the "journalism" he wants to "build" is a replica of huffpo i think as
again thats what he knows > partnered w/ them in hawaii ...
while they are multimillion dollaring it others are doing the real
work of jounalism so i am not worried about the craft its just that

there were convictions on stalking that were not illegal at the time of the incidents - thats my information from one of the defendants anyway and other laws were never utilized in such a way in order to convict activists or anyone  - one law that was over 10 years old was used that had never been utilized in any case and even the name of the law was changed before the case was brought
the problem with these kinds of cases is that they set precedent and no one knows about it AND the defendants rarely have the cash to properly fight the case so the system of law becomes flawed - broken

yes but i think from my understanding it wasnt the amount of prison
time or the money but the fact that he wld have to plead guilty to 13
felony counts - he would not get to serve in the government ... vote

giants so production is owed down thru the ages and i think there isnt
really a you basically > your first form i would say is life itself
and you are made mostly of water and some minerals (dirt) and when you
'die' your body dissipates like a cloud - i dont think 'you' die i
think you just transform
so there is no 'you' to have ownership > would you say life owns life
? that would be odd > i think ownership is an illusion i also think
you didnt make yourself so that would be a glitch in your argument > i
mean i think you had a bit to say in the matter but we are very
limited mathematical concoctions (gorgeously made and amazing but
limited) we cant presently manufacture ourselves in order to "own"
ourselves but even then we wouldnt be independent of life itself so
... > maybe in future we will manufacture ourselves but there is
probably going to be a divisive factor in the manufacturing of life
forms (divisive as in schism - not workin so good - should be
interesting but already happening w/ monsanto actually so...)
i think the idea of ownership was made by rulers (seen thru millenia
but look at the magna carta which will be 800 in 2015) i want as
little to do with rulers thought patterns and functioning as possible

this may explain a little more
yes "white terminology" holds white CONCEPTS as do words in my tribe
the blackfoot and other tribes languages i am also cherokee for
instance the word "floor" does not exist because things are noted as
actions so it is "flooring" because things are not stagnant they are
active > everything is animated there are no inanimate and animate
objects all are animate
you may hear people say the whites 'stole' the land but what they did
was move the people ... kill them etc they did not live in concert etc
'indians' lived > very different
i am not sure mayb make an argument as to why it is different
i know of these instances yes but the land was vast so ... they moved
on ... no i dont think they saw it as particularly 'ok' and they made
confederacies and agreements regarding these issues - they had
community agreements which they worked together to come to also fyi
they had chiefs yes but they had different councils that made
decisions they still function in this way and what your role was was
what you were naturally good at  - they didnt try to make people into
something they were not
thats what we have now with neo liberal capitalism
i meant physical production too - i mean do you understand how many
hundreds of years it took life to come up with the spoon > just a
spoon that took a ton of time and energy and really i see myself as no
different than a spoon
i never said that i think in terms of co-creativity
no i was extending and making an argument > but how do you think you
"own" yourself?
BUT what about the tomato plant it took more "trouble" than u i would
say - in ur world does it have "ownership"
F no and i dont think there was a big bang either or a beginning i
think life is a spiral cone time and space are - i dont think time is
linear see deleuze and guattari > but native americans think like that
i think property is a coffin
BUT i understand what you mean how it could be seen that way actually
it really is a multidimensional issue but overall i see that history -
and my own inner gut - shows that having community is a more fully
effective way of living than individualism BUT also i think rulers
will turn anything they can into something fucked up
yes that was my point those are the people that are so interested in
property rights > hey ya know the largest land owner in manhattan ??
catholic church... know the second largest property owner in manhattan
?? episcopal church ... what i think they have socially engineered is
the protection of ruling class property rights and convinced the
people it serves them - it does not !! otherwise everyone would have
food and clean water and a place to live (its not that much to ask
for) really it doesnt serve humanity or life force either to have such
levels of separation between ppl because of who they were born to,
where etc

two of my great grandmothers were native one blackfoot one cherokee
and you are not the first to be dismissive of my blood and wont be the
last i find it sad
the blackfoot hunted buffalo heres what happened with that (hint:
white ppl ordered them killed in mass)
the blackfoot moved entirely to canada where they are today trying to
retain their history and memories thru retaining their language
re ownership some say if the french would have confronted the issue in
their revolution mankind would be a bit further down the road - it
isnt an easy task by far but worth discussing
re chief seattle - stories i heard while living in seattle were that
natives could not even walk on the same sidewalk as a white person and
their right to fish was taken from them (this is still an issue) > how

i have spoken exstensively to lawyers about using this tactic
they say it is very problematic > the people that sit on juries are
not informed that they can in fact nullify AND if a lawyer sees a
possibility in an instance of a case they can get at best reprimanded
by the judge if there is any 'jury tampering' perceived
the courts have nullified the jury nullification law
if the citizenry were in fact knowledgable and educated that would
help the issue and change a lot of things actually - the education
system sucks of course so... and its such an odd thing because people
put such incredible "faith" in the legal system and they know so
little about how it "functions"
i have done some work in the jail/court support area and there are a
ton of things happening in the courts that need changing there is
barely an analysis of how screwed up the system really is - some
volunteers are doing great work in statistics especially regarding
sexual assault cases BUT it is only a beginning on what needs to

i have not heard this before - i had the information that he was
downloading way too much at a time and doing it over a very small
period of time and that tipped them off my information is that he was
very careful in other work of this kind why would he b so sloppy this
time - i mean how do you know he knew they were on to him?
yes but i think from my understanding it wasnt the amount of prison
time or the money but the fact that he wld have to plead guilty to 13
felony counts - he would not get to serve in the government ... vote
AGREED - i am not sure ppl know enough about his case any ideas about
how we can push it out there more?????
i would love to see the rankings on that too i was just going over
this very thing > there is no oversight absolutely NONE like in the
bureau of prisons guess who decided the fate of lynne stewart > 1 man
who is the director > it is a piss poor system that has no
intellectual growth in its structure for a very long time > i find it
curious that u compare US judicial system to russia thats funny
agreed the system is not reliably predictable EVER i think he spoke to
agents without a lawyer present
i think all instances are multifaceted and criticism and debate about
aaron is helpful i wasnt saying that i was saying the militance was
off to me
i would be interested to hear more of what ppl think were the
mis-steps in his work however large or small it may seem - as i am
doing some work around 'reparations' and want the full picture as much
as possible before i get hit in the face with it somewhere else...
THANKS FOR YOUR TIME

if u really want to know what i think then u need to know my thought
processies are not like "white" ppl > ideas of ownership are foreign
to me i am native american and most tribes though they lived in areas
didnt consider ownership of them but a co-creative partnership - re:
food > when my people hunted buffalo in the plains they didnt just
indiscriminately kill buffalo they weeded the herd and were mindful to
examine how they could be of help to the herd it was only intelligent
to do so as it kept their source of food and clothing healthy and
vibrant but also it was respectful of life
so there are people that give food away for free right now today > why
would they do that?
well i think ideas are in the air and we build on the shoulders of
giants so production is owed down thru the ages and i think there isnt
really a you basically > your first form i would say is life itself
and you are made mostly of water and some minerals (dirt) and when you
'die' your body dissipates like a cloud - i dont think 'you' die i
think you just transform
so there is no 'you' to have ownership > would you say life owns life
? that would be odd > i think ownership is an illusion i also think
you didnt make yourself so that would be a glitch in your argument > i
mean i think you had a bit to say in the matter but we are very
limited mathematical concoctions (gorgeously made and amazing but
limited) we cant presently manufacture ourselves in order to "own"
ourselves but even then we wouldnt be independent of life itself so
... > maybe in future we will manufacture ourselves but there is
probably going to be a divisive factor in the manufacturing of life
forms (divisive as in schism - not workin so good - should be
interesting but already happening w/ monsanto actually so...)
i think the idea of ownership was made by rulers (seen thru millenia

this may explain a little more
yes "white terminology" holds white CONCEPTS as do words in my tribe
the blackfoot and other tribes languages i am also cherokee for
instance the word "floor" does not exist because things are noted as
actions so it is "flooring" because things are not stagnant they are
active > everything is animated there are no inanimate and animate
objects all are animate
you may hear people say the whites 'stole' the land but what they did
was move the people ... kill them etc they did not live in concert etc
'indians' lived > very different
i am not sure mayb make an argument as to why it is different
i know of these instances yes but the land was vast so ... they moved
on ... no i dont think they saw it as particularly 'ok' and they made
confederacies and agreements regarding these issues - they had
community agreements which they worked together to come to also fyi
they had chiefs yes but they had different councils that made
decisions they still function in this way and what your role was was
what you were naturally good at  - they didnt try to make people into
something they were not
thats what we have now with neo liberal capitalism
i meant physical production too - i mean do you understand how many
hundreds of years it took life to come up with the spoon > just a
spoon that took a ton of time and energy and really i see myself as no
different than a spoon
i never said that i think in terms of co-creativity
no i was extending and making an argument > but how do you think you
"own" yourself?
BUT what about the tomato plant it took more "trouble" than u i would
say - in ur world does it have "ownership"
F no and i dont think there was a big bang either or a beginning i
think life is a spiral cone time and space are - i dont think time is
linear see deleuze and guattari > but native americans think like that
i think property is a coffin
BUT i understand what you mean how it could be seen that way actually
it really is a multidimensional issue but overall i see that history -
and my own inner gut - shows that having community is a more fully
effective way of living than individualism BUT also i think rulers
will turn anything they can into something fucked up
yes that was my point those are the people that are so interested in
property rights > hey ya know the largest land owner in manhattan ??
catholic church... know the second largest property owner in manhattan
?? episcopal church ... what i think they have socially engineered is
the protection of ruling class property rights and convinced the
people it serves them - it does not !! otherwise everyone would have
food and clean water and a place to live (its not that much to ask
for) really it doesnt serve humanity or life force either to have such

i have spoken exstensively to lawyers about using this tactic
they say it is very problematic > the people that sit on juries are
not informed that they can in fact nullify AND if a lawyer sees a
possibility in an instance of a case they can get at best reprimanded
by the judge if there is any 'jury tampering' perceived
the courts have nullified the jury nullification law
if the citizenry were in fact knowledgable and educated that would
help the issue and change a lot of things actually - the education
system sucks of course so... and its such an odd thing because people
put such incredible "faith" in the legal system and they know so
little about how it "functions"

snowden thing they are (probably) hyper vigilant - though i am sure sloppy
as hell still... as they are want to be
also do note that whistleblowers often go to their managers and higher ups
and complain about the government breech and no one listens so... it is a
very long process
thats an amazing idea
you understand he pledged a mere 100,000 to mannings defense [just his
defense not him] then gave 15,000

its the shac7 case
there were convictions on stalking that were not illegal at the time of the incidents - thats my information from one of the defendants anyway and other laws were never utilized in such a way in order to convict activists or anyone  - one law that was over 10 years old was used that had never been utilized in any case and even the name of the law was changed before the case was brought
the problem with these kinds of cases is that they set precedent and no one knows about it AND the defendants rarely have the cash to properly fight the case so the system of law becomes flawed - broken

its not a 'claim' watch his film that was up for an academy award
there is a scene in mogadishu where he is in the morgue there is a dead
body and him in the scene he is standing right next to it - the person was
hit by a drone strike
no journalist gets filmed with dead bodies it is unethical it never happens
perhaps if you were a journalist in the field you would understand
it isnt 'slander' if it is true so maybe you dont know anything about law
just because you have not run across other people criticising the great
perfect white guy jeremy scahill doesnt mean it isnt happening - you seem
to assume a lot and not ask questions just flame out assuming you know
everything i think that is known as narcissism which people go to
psychiatrists to get help working out of as its such a lethal condition but
it isnt easy because narcissists think they are right all the time
besides even if i was the only one criticising jeremy that doesnt prove me
wrong - prove me wrong > go ahead try...
also i knew the 'report' was false that you assume i thought it was true
again proves my premise that you are narcissistic

bethany you are obviously NOT a journalist... its called exploitation
i dont remember the images of the baby at hiroshima or the girl burned
naked running in vietnam having the journalists fat head in the frame
guess who gets their picture took with dead bodies? smiling american
soldiers have in afghanistan and nazi's - i am sure you can look those
images up for yourself i wont be a party to it
just because you dont understand ethics doesnt mean they dont exist
being filmed with dead bodies is absolutely a breech of journalistic ethics
thanks alexis for your analysis of tor i heartily agree with your

show me an instance of someone posing with a corpse thats a journalist &
have you done it?
i dont know what kind of journalist you are but it sounds like you are in
america as you site specific news outlets - make assumptions that i am also
in america - i dont watch that shit - i am an activist journalist
being an activist journalist makes part of my job to be critical of
journalism and therefor maybe i am in a different position than you - if
you are okay posing with corpses then i will call you out as well but as
your identity is hidden here.... soooooo... that wouldnt be so easy would
it is your idea that there is nothing unethical but that doesnt mean that
there is nothing unethical about it and that standards are not breeched by
jeremy doing it and your post has not proven otherwise in any way
you are presenting as if i said there is a journalist bible and it was
written in there and also you are presenting as if he is just hanging out
and woops a dead body came flying by and the camera was just like on and
pointed at him .... and the slab they just like landed in the slab like
that ... it is perfectly disgusting
besides if its so nothing why are bothering to post about it

mirimir - you prove you know what was in the mind of the filmmaker and then
prove that the overriding factor in any documentary is absolutely what was
in the mind of the filmmaker
could it possible be that the story matters more than the filmmaker - ya
think maybe ? maybe possibly ?
plus your 'proposiition' is not evidence - its no excuse for him exploiting
a dead body anyway
people when you are an ethical journalist you are careful not to exploit
images of children, people that are unconscious etc as they do not have a
say in the image content - if this is breeched it is possible they are
being exploited but to then place oneself in the frame is just beyond all
of that even - that is totally unethical

i found that area of the report its at 22:44 the link should take you there
even laura at least thinks about when to film / when not to
btw she talked snowden into filming in hong kong - was it ethical for her
to do it as he was under incredible duress?? i dont know .... i question
her and glenns role and wikileaks role in him being now trapped in russia
but maybe its the best place for him i dont know ... but i still get to
question the ethics of their role... there are other places he could have
my problem with laura as with jeremy is that they are too capitalistic and
therein breech ethics

dear razor
soldiers sign up to be filmed as far as i am concerned they have sold
themselves - the journalist was not in the frame so i dont see why you
think it relates to this argument - i think soldiers should always be
filmed like the cops because i think the role they play is super psychotic
- maybe if the images of them and what they are doing were distributed more
it would be helpful
i think it would have been ethical for scahill to film the dead body in the
morgue - it would be great if they had the permission of the family but...
its that he was in the frame thats really my big problem
also the person in the scene with scahill - a white man - is a person of
color (POC) which also was super problematic for me

i dont remember ever a journalist putting themselves in a shot like that
i dont see how jeremy's head in that shot gives ANY context that brings it
out of the abstract cerebral place - that it isnt actually in in the first
place - dead bodies in mogadishu or the moon are not abstract or just
floaty... not in my head at least not in my gut either or my big toe
jeremy is from wisconsin i think is that what you think brings context?
please you will have to bring more to the table than that... i am not
listen i am all for showing a lot of stuff truelly really i am... but if
you are on the ground as a journo you run across things that are just not
ok to even film - its just like that
i have other things as i originally posted that make all of this much worse
for me > jeremy attacked mona eltahawy on twitter over her media 'junkets'
in new york regarding the revolution in egypt he was really fucked up in
doing it and i was like after that questioning his ethics then i saw this
scene and i was like wtf
i do not think he is ethical and for other reasons as well so... things
pile up ya know and then you have to acknowledge them or you are a part of

ALL snowden docs should go to EFF - should have gone there in the beginning
for analysis snowden gave those docs to people unqualified to deal with

dear mirimir you cannot read
'Nonetheless, because of the general faith I had in political and media
institutions, I assumed - since both political parties and media outlets
and journalists from across the ideological spectrum were united in support
of the war - that there must be some valid basis to the claim that Saddam
posed a threat. My basic trust in these institutions neutralized the
objections I had and led me to passively acquiesce to what was being done
("I believed then that the president was entitled to have his national
security judgment deferred to, and to the extent that I was able to develop
a definitive view, I accepted his judgment that American security really
would be enhanced by the invasion of this sovereign country.").'

i am sorry but that is just stupid x 5 million
i dont care about his excuses my pet spider even knew it was crap
if you can give him a pass for being 'apathetic' which i wouldnt frame it
like that then that says a lot about you - its not apathy to support a
fucking invasion of a people - people that are apathetic are like i dont
know not oh yay lets do it it is a totally different mindset
and that he is here in daily kos framing out this lie says more to me about

i have seen another quote someone sent me on twitter - as i use to fight
with glenn on twitter about pierre and shit ... and laura ... i cant find
it ... i will keep looking - these things were out in the press before this
book was published
fyi i fought a lot with laura over her unwavering support of wikileaks she

there is a scene in mogadishu where he is in the morgue there is a dead
body and him in the scene he is standing right next to it - the person was
hit by a drone strike
no journalist gets filmed with dead bodies it is unethical it never happens
perhaps if you were a journalist in the field you would understand
it isnt 'slander' if it is true so maybe you dont know anything about law
just because you have not run across other people criticising the great
perfect white guy jeremy scahill doesnt mean it isnt happening - you seem
to assume a lot and not ask questions just flame out assuming you know
everything i think that is known as narcissism which people go to
psychiatrists to get help working out of as its such a lethal condition but
it isnt easy because narcissists think they are right all the time
besides even if i was the only one criticising jeremy that doesnt prove me
wrong - prove me wrong > go ahead try...
also i knew the 'report' was false that you assume i thought it was true
again proves my premise that you are narcissistic

bethany you are obviously NOT a journalist... its called exploitation
i dont remember the images of the baby at hiroshima or the girl burned
naked running in vietnam having the journalists fat head in the frame
guess who gets their picture took with dead bodies? smiling american
soldiers have in afghanistan and nazi's - i am sure you can look those
images up for yourself i wont be a party to it
just because you dont understand ethics doesnt mean they dont exist
being filmed with dead bodies is absolutely a breech of journalistic ethics
thanks alexis for your analysis of tor i heartily agree with your
look into a blow up of  had regarding her protections of when the whole ukranian thing was revealed she has to do a lot of dancing
to dodge the bullets coming her way ...
when i get time later i will look it up for you

show me an instance of someone posing with a corpse thats a journalist &
have you done it?
i dont know what kind of journalist you are but it sounds like you are in
america as you site specific news outlets - make assumptions that i am also
in america - i dont watch that shit - i am an activist journalist
being an activist journalist makes part of my job to be critical of
journalism and therefor maybe i am in a different position than you - if
you are okay posing with corpses then i will call you out as well but as
your identity is hidden here.... soooooo... that wouldnt be so easy would
it is your idea that there is nothing unethical but that doesnt mean that
there is nothing unethical about it and that standards are not breeched by
jeremy doing it and your post has not proven otherwise in any way
you are presenting as if i said there is a journalist bible and it was
written in there and also you are presenting as if he is just hanging out
and woops a dead body came flying by and the camera was just like on and
pointed at him .... and the slab they just like landed in the slab like
that ... it is perfectly disgusting
besides if its so nothing why are bothering to post about it

mirimir - you prove you know what was in the mind of the filmmaker and then
prove that the overriding factor in any documentary is absolutely what was
in the mind of the filmmaker
could it possible be that the story matters more than the filmmaker - ya
think maybe ? maybe possibly ?
plus your 'proposiition' is not evidence - its no excuse for him exploiting
a dead body anyway
people when you are an ethical journalist you are careful not to exploit
images of children, people that are unconscious etc as they do not have a
say in the image content - if this is breeched it is possible they are
being exploited but to then place oneself in the frame is just beyond all
of that even - that is totally unethical

mirimir - heres some fucked up people (laura poitras) talkin about the shit
i found that area of the report its at 22:44 the link should take you there
even laura at least thinks about when to film / when not to
btw she talked snowden into filming in hong kong - was it ethical for her
to do it as he was under incredible duress?? i dont know .... i question
her and glenns role and wikileaks role in him being now trapped in russia
but maybe its the best place for him i dont know ... but i still get to
question the ethics of their role... there are other places he could have
my problem with laura as with jeremy is that they are too capitalistic and
therein breech ethics

dear razor
soldiers sign up to be filmed as far as i am concerned they have sold
themselves - the journalist was not in the frame so i dont see why you
think it relates to this argument - i think soldiers should always be
filmed like the cops because i think the role they play is super psychotic
- maybe if the images of them and what they are doing were distributed more
it would be helpful
i think it would have been ethical for scahill to film the dead body in the
morgue - it would be great if they had the permission of the family but...
its that he was in the frame thats really my big problem
also the person in the scene with scahill - a white man - is a person of
color (POC) which also was super problematic for me

i dont remember ever a journalist putting themselves in a shot like that
i dont see how jeremy's head in that shot gives ANY context that brings it
out of the abstract cerebral place - that it isnt actually in in the first
place - dead bodies in mogadishu or the moon are not abstract or just
floaty... not in my head at least not in my gut either or my big toe
jeremy is from wisconsin i think is that what you think brings context?
please you will have to bring more to the table than that... i am not
listen i am all for showing a lot of stuff truelly really i am... but if
you are on the ground as a journo you run across things that are just not
ok to even film - its just like that
i have other things as i originally posted that make all of this much worse
for me > jeremy attacked mona eltahawy on twitter over her media 'junkets'
in new york regarding the revolution in egypt he was really fucked up in
doing it and i was like after that questioning his ethics then i saw this
scene and i was like wtf
i do not think he is ethical and for other reasons as well so... things
pile up ya know and then you have to acknowledge them or you are a part of
it in a way

anyway liberals are not that bright too
ALL snowden docs should go to EFF - should have gone there in the beginning
for analysis snowden gave those docs to people unqualified to deal with
them and they still are not qualified their capacity is far too low for
them to ever be qualified the mere fact that they drip so slowly says so
no-no laura greenwald and scahill arent making any money... i think we

dear mirimir you cannot read
'Nonetheless, because of the general faith I had in political and media
institutions, I assumed - since both political parties and media outlets
and journalists from across the ideological spectrum were united in support
of the war - that there must be some valid basis to the claim that Saddam
posed a threat. My basic trust in these institutions neutralized the
objections I had and led me to passively acquiesce to what was being done
("I believed then that the president was entitled to have his national
security judgment deferred to, and to the extent that I was able to develop
a definitive view, I accepted his judgment that American security really
would be enhanced by the invasion of this sovereign country.").'

it is good us is invading to get back at the iraqi's for 9-11
umn the iraqi's had nothing to do with 9-11 and he swallowed that tripe...
i am sorry but that is just stupid x 5 million
i dont care about his excuses my pet spider even knew it was crap
if you can give him a pass for being 'apathetic' which i wouldnt frame it
like that then that says a lot about you - its not apathy to support a
fucking invasion of a people - people that are apathetic are like i dont
know not oh yay lets do it it is a totally different mindset
and that he is here in daily kos framing out this lie says more to me about
his lack of character than anything and you of course didnt address that
part - if the fuck was an actual person he could be like yay i sucked but

i think his mind was being changed after that about iraq thats what the 2

iraq thing but then still backed the invasion anyway
i have seen another quote someone sent me on twitter - as i use to fight
with glenn on twitter about pierre and shit ... and laura ... i cant find
it ... i will keep looking - these things were out in the press before this
book was published
fyi i fought a lot with laura over her unwavering support of wikileaks she

i think there could be solutions utilized like easily shifting the ip
address of comp and router yourself in your own little hut > 'ghost' it but
not thru others .... pretty fucking simple i know but maybe effective in a
really different way than having the fake government of the US build
something and use people that are activists against them to make it work
also i think the infrastructure is too bulky
i like to think about satelites (and thats all i will say about that) - i
dont know i would have to have a real think about solutions it is very
important to think about it and not just the problem for sure but i dont
think the methodology of tor is a solution i think it is a stoppage point
that people are not seeing beyond ... people dont think it has been
penetrated and i have no proof of that but maybe that isnt the main problem
for me ... structurally speaking it is a disaster ... the masses being
handed a tool in order to subvert the government??? as they say you cant
make this shit up
i know that when i was in syria i could get a fucking video call in the
desert where there was nothing ... this was syria not a rich country per
say like at all so i think the choking of the communication system is super
in play ... if others dont think thats a problem then they need to educate
themselves ... do people that live in the US on this list even know that
the infrastructure of fiber optics that underlies the communications may
not even be utilized in their city and that the reason it is not used is
because the communication companies bought a contract with there city that
freezes it all up? please look into the chatanooga model if you dont know
about this 'freemarket' bullshit>>>> also fyi iraq had video calls
nationwide in 2000 or even before ... now i am not sure what tech they were
using i think radiowaves and shooting the signal over land that way but it
all points to a tremendous shut down of functionality  .... not that it was
probably all that healthy for people but...
sure we can write each other little words on this frame of communications
but see what happens when attempting to shift in a large way ... like when
they printed the 3d gun... people had to git fr USA & like when barrett
made project pm and this is a major reason i think there should be as many
solutions as possible not just one - not as easy for gov/corp to take them

its religious thought to even utilize the word 'evil' let alone think in
those terms and religious thought is a capitalist parasite >>> read
nietzsche for fuck sake he wrote in the 1800's
one of my arguments is that it is structurally unsound to rely on one
method >>> especially if built by your enemy - i look to nature as other
thinkers do/have and i think about buckminster fuller - his analysis of
panther dna making them vulnerable to extinction because it is all so/too
similar ... in any given situation i do not think in terms of one solution
... i have used this analogy before ... sperm: there are lots of them in
one load ... they all race to get to the egg sure but, they actually help
each other to penetrate - they dont care who gets in as long as one of them
transforms the egg into a being (i mean i cant really speak for sperms in
general but it has been analysed like this)... thats their job ...they even
have been seen to help each other non-competative like :: this is the kind
of structures we need moreso not monolithic structures that blind us ...
its really a geometry problem for me... math
but also it is all ethical to me as well : if my family was murdered by a
fucker i wouldnt go and use that fuckers infrastructure cause they made it
for me to use and sent some other fuckers around the globe selling it cause
like the fucker murdered my family i wont support them in any way ever

i dont see it as poetry or emotion i see it as logic but prove logic to be
lacking poetry or emotion empirically/logically
these kinds of degrading segregations or silos of thought are also
christian in my mind which in turn for me is capitalist like in an
anti-enlightenment kind of way ie logic good emotion or instinct bad
instinct is really important to understand like in the tsunami that hit
thailand remember ? Animals didnt really die en mass as they knew it was
coming so they got out of dodge as they say ... did they have a gauge that
told them to get the fuck out sure they are closer to life so they can
sense it better or they got a signal in some form .... sound probably its
really logical actually but why didnt oh so logical humans get the same
ethics are not emotional by nature - really ethics are logical we may get
hints that something doesnt feel right in our gut but then i think it can
be logically laid out as to why as well : murder isnt just emotional there
are lots of factual ramifications that follow from the murder as i am
native american and basically my family was murdered by the fake USG i can
first person talk about the logical ramifications of my family not being
allowed to exist
please prove your point about `lateral thinking` which i would term
horizontality ... if it isnt effective in a given space i often have seen
that the structures that are monolithic are why so i would be interested to
see any other formulations ... as i am a problem seeker ...uuuuhhh then i
know where to work
i think we agree that ideology is not functional but i am not sure we see
the same problems to solve ... i am not sure there is a clear understanding
that life is being heavily designed by a 'few' people in power and they are
designing it for many years to come like they have plans and shit so...
somehow i dont think the plans include medicine for the sick or literacy
for everyone... lets not even discuss food and water or combating mass
murder of the planets inhabitants
heres a video about what people often section off as logic and emotional or
creative sides of the brain ... our own interfaces should be looked at as
evidence not only because of their structures information but to show our
limited scope and not just thru our form but thru the
manipulation/propaganda about our form/forms which you seem to be driving
i think in order to make the machines of the future - like the ones that
will decide on their own wether to kill you or not in a battle - then this
kind of emotion/logic mis-equation will need to be worked on

like white fuckers that killed my people en mass and did a lot of other
horrible things to them in the name of capitalism so
i am black foot and cherokee and my character seems to align more with that
part of my dna a lot of the time ... yes sometimes i am a dumb white fuck
but thats the nature of the beast but mostly i behave not like a white
person that smiles and nods and stays silent out of fear... i cant exist
that way... i am just a 'wild indian' some other racists have said... they
were white people of course
i am very racist against white empirical capitalist and while i know native
americans that suck - other races have people that suck of course but white
people are really oppressive in my mind so i call them out for it
some people have told me it is racist to claim my heritage of being native
american ... a cop in berlin said 'hile hitler' to me when i told him i was
native american but i guess i should be grateful he actually believed i was
native american - some people dont
i really despise zion because of their fascism and mass murder based on
race and dont understand that other people love zion - do you love zion?
i know me engaging the frame of racism is fucked up but it is so beyond any
comprehension that whites have so much and others have so little
maybe we can work together to figure out wording that points out that they
are white without it being racists??? cause ya know they are like white
so... no i guess it doesnt work... should we ignore their oppressive race?

define racism then cause i dont think we have the same definition really
also maybe we dont have the same definition of trolling
just saying someone is a race and is fucked up with power based on their
racial privilege is not racism
its like saying someones race and then being called a racist because you
categorized someone within their race
have we been socially engineered as racist and genderist and specieist and
ageist and mentally or physically challengedists - oh yes and we need to
build new frames out of it but you saying i am white and racist against my
"own" people because i hate the culture doesnt do that - if you really want
to do something about it have a really long think about designing new
frames... raise consciousness - make new words develop your own mind
which tribe?
not a club
are you being racist by deciding my identity for me ?... i dont identify as
white ... i dont act white ... its like i am a tansgender person that
identifies as a woman and you are telling me i am just a man and i have to
just face that ... you dont get to decide for me what i identify with
its really white of you to think you get to decide for me btw
power bullshit ... very white capitalist behavior
is the first step to fixing it...
race and dont understand that other people love zion - do you love zion?

I agree, massive ongoing public investment in water infrastructure sure is
a nice thing!  But most people on the planet do have potable water to
drink, tho perhaps not as plentifully as in America.  Not that many people
worldwide are literally dying of thirst.
umn talking people that dont have a tap to have fucking water in so... but
here i cannot drink the tap water maybe more common than you know
that are the others that dont have the right to even learn to read
America ya call "the flyover" is chock full o' people with horrific
malnutrition caused by the toxic industrial food system.
you have no idea where i am on the planet

i knew someone would bring up the racism of the irish it still is a super

they were the barbary pirates i think ...ottomans
yes it is culture but it is also my dna ... my computer is not a microsoft
computer and that is just that... it might have little gui's of microsoft
but NO not microsoft ...i am racist against microsoft ...because native
american or indigenous were slaughtered in mass in more ways than just
their bodies and they still are and we have political prisoners and yes we
say 'we' when we are together and some tribes are deemed with this kind of
characteristic others not etc language structures are similar though ... it
is very different to be indigenous and just denial of indigenousness is a
defacement its part of the horror as the whites that took the native
american babies away from their families wanting to erase the native
american in them
so how can we have our dna respected and not be racists ?
so bringing it back to all things cypher is it possible to get these
turkish docs unredacted - have they made it illegal to unredact shit - i
think they have - i think i read it somewhere ? wheres hitler been lately?
o am i being racist against germans? lets make u a new word ..how bout
'culturist' ... 'you are a culturist' ... no that doesnt sound right
docs are all about the terrorist kurds you know - a race of people - and we
are fucked by laura poitras again what fucking explanation can she have for
these massive redactions
turkey just wants everyone to be turks cathal
the keyword option wasnt given to the turks then... i wonder if they have
it now? maybe they hacked the american code and made it possible if the

*Black Swans in a Cyber Forest: ‘FARness’ Needed In Future Information
Technology Acquisition*
Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates stated, "Our record of predicting
where we will use military force since Vietnam is perfect–we have never
once gotten it right. . . We need to have in mind the greatest possible
flexibility and versatility for the broadest range of conflict."[1]
joint operations rely on consistent access to the cyber domain. It is in
the complexity of the cyber world, and our new found reliance on it, that
cyber black swan events are most dangerous to our security.
The cyber domain is a 'forest' dense with complications and operational
implications. Cyber black swan events will happen; we must prepare to deal
with them. As the United States enters a reality where efficiency may trump
effectiveness, it must be careful not to make cyber infrastructure
decisions today that remove flexibility, adaptiveness, and robustness from
the U.S. military in the future.
The Department of Defense (DoD) is looking at maintaining and improving its
cyber domain access with limited funds. The U.S. Navy, for example, began
reducing the number of data-centers it operates, taking advantage of
virtualization or "cloud-computing" technology.[2]
allows one server to service many customers and the “cloud” is the
networked data center's servers storing and providing access to data from
many locations. These new technologies increase speed and the efficiency of
the operating system by distributing and utilizing processing power across
the network.[3]
Navy may be underestimating the need for flexibility, adaptiveness, and
robustness (FAR) in its cyber infrastructure. Risk consideration to the
Navy cyber infrastructure appears to be focused toward information and
network security and financial savings than toward the redundancy and
resiliency needed to overcome catastrophic black swan events.
Current DoD acquisition risk assessment methodology uses pattern analysis
and previous experience, but focuses on single-failure scenarios. This
"what if" versus "how can (it happen)" analysis is more often used because
multi-failure scenarios have a low probability of occurrence. Searching for
the black swan scenarios, or "how can" scenarios, as part of the risk
analysis is critical to creating layers of protection that have the ability
to prevent the event, if possible, but recover from it when necessary.[5]
FAR costs money and our quest for economy may be reducing the capacity
needed to overcome black swan events.
The DoD acquisition system is a top-down process that has its own
institutional inertia and sometimes lacks critical thinking, innovation,
and adaptation. The current acquisition process considers low-probability
events and scenario-based planning, but constrains them to what it believes
is plausible and fundable, limiting the inclusion of creative and critical
is necessary to think “bigger” about the risks.
Defense forecasting, or predicting the future operational environment, is
used in DoD's planning, programming, budgeting, and execution system
(PPBES), and is, "generally static, linear, and reasonably mechanical" in
its approach.[7]
focuses on a capabilities versus risk approach.[8]
Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) and PPBES,
one could argue, is similar to the single-failure scenario based analysis
described earlier. It is not necessarily suited toward multiple-failure
scenarios needed for the complex cyber systems of the future.
The future will demand the balance of technology maturity and cost. In the
early stages of the defense acquisition process for cyber technology,
leaders must ensure that a risk management approach and not just a
capabilities approach is used. The cyber infrastructure key performance
parameters (KPP) and key systems attributes (KSA) should represent a
possible future multi-failure and cyber black swan environment.
Additionally, network-ready key performance parameters (NR-KPP) must
measure survivability and recovery, not just operation. Testing of KPP,
KSA, and NR-KPPs will require a new lens from which to develop testing and
assessment methodology.
The DoD must accept that black swan events will likely accelerate in the
growing complexity of the cyber domain. The analysis used at the strategic
level to make cyber infrastructure decisions must shift from a
single-failure to multi-failure view. Emphasizing "FARness"–that is
flexibility, adaptiveness, and robustness in acquisition decisions is key.
identify "FARness" attributes, the use of brain-storming and subject matter
experts focusing on developing multi-failure scenarios for a proposed cyber
infrastructure should be used. This "how can" approach creates robust
scenarios approaching black swan type events and can identify ways the
system could recover from a catastrophe–a type of "war-gaming." Identifying
common recovery methods or needed attributes through “how can” scenarios
would help decision makers think about the system within the context of a
future environment and the "FARness" needed to survive.
In an effort to become more efficient and save money, the strategic
leadership may not see the potential for black swans hidden in the cyber
domain forest. Layered protections and redundancy are needed to survive a
cyber-black swan event and must be considered in the analysis and decision
making for future virtualization, cloud-computing, and data-center
consolidation. It is with regard to probabilities that decision making
based more on fiscal conservation makes the future force vulnerable. While
history shows that black swan events will occur, it is up to the leadership
to equip the future force with cyber systems that have "FARness"–yet fit
within today's budget.

AUGUST 28, 2015 | BY DANNY O'BRIEN
Speech that Enables Speech: China Takes Aim at Its Coders
The maintainer of GoAgent, one of China's more popular censorship
circumvention tools emptied out the project's main
 source code repositories
 on Tuesday. Phus Lu, the developer,
renamed the repository’s description to “Everything that has a beginning
has an end”. Phus Lu’s Twitter account's historywas also deleted, except
for a single tweet  that
linked to a Chinese translation of Alexander Solzhenitsyn’s “Live Not By
That essay was originally published in 1974 on the day of the Russian
dissident’s arrest for treason.
We can guess what caused Phus Lu to erase over four years’ work on an
extremely popular program from the brief comments of another Chinese
anti-censorship programmer, Clowwindy. Clowwindy was the chief developer of
ShadowSocks, another tool that circumvented the Great Firewall of China by
creating an encrypted tunnel between a simple server and a portable client.
Clowwindy also deleted his or her Github repositories last week. In a
comment on the now empty Github archive Clowwindy wrote in English
Two days ago the police came to me and wanted me to stop working on this.
Today they asked me to delete all the code from Github. I have no choice
but to obey.
The author deleted that comment too shortly afterwards.
Github, the host for both repositories, reported a DDoS attack on the days
between these two incidents. While Github has not commented on the source
of the current attack, the evidence strongly suggests
 that a previous DDoS
against Github in March was conducted by the Chinese government
pressure the company to remove the repositories of two other
anti-censorship programs.
The Chinese government’s control of the Internet passes through regular
waves of enhanced repression, often tied to a significant political event
or protest. Many commentators have connected a current wave of media and
Internet crackdowns
a forthcoming military parade commemorating World War II in Beijing on
September 3.
But even as a peak moment in a temporary spate of repression, the
intimidation of GoAgent and ShadowSock’s creators represents a continuing
escalation by the authorities against technologists.
Chinese law has long forbidden the selling of telecommunication services
that bypass the Great Firewall of China, as well as the creation or
distribution of “harmful information”. Until recently, however, the
authorities have not targeted the authors of non-commercial circumvention
software, nor its users. Human Rights in China ,
a Chinese rights advocacy and research organization, told EFF that, based
on its preliminary review, VPNs and circumvention software is not
specifically prohibited under Chinese law. While the state interferes with
people's ability to use such software, it has not outlawed the software
In November, Phus Lu wrote a public declaration to clarify
oint. In the statement, he
stated that he has received no money to develop GoAgent, provided no
circumvention service, nor asserted any political view.
Phus Lu’s caution at that time was prompted by the police questioning of
another technologist, Xu Dong, a supporter of the Hong Kong opposition
Umbrella Movement who was detained in the same month for “picking quarrels
and creating disturbances”
According to the Washington-based blog China Change, Xu Dong, who goes by
the nym Onionhacker  online, had also been
working on censorship circumvention code. During his detention he was told
by the police that he had committed “crimes of developing software to help
Chinese Internet users scale the Great Fire Wall of China.”
Even if it's unclear what law Xu Dong had broken, if any, in November, the
legal and political climate has grown even more aggressively anti-Internet
since then. A new National Security Law
 came into effect on July 1
, which provides the authorities with a wide remit to oversee “internet
information technology produces and services” that impact national security
(Art. 59), as well as maintain “network sovereignty”
 (Art. 25). It seems
that is already being interpreted to include the creators of circumvention
software. A sweeping bill on cyber-security
 is also in the
The targeting of software developers by China is a new and worrying trend,
but one that we’re seeing occur around the world. Authorities everywhere
are realising that one way to sabotage free expression is to intimidate
those who build the tools that enable that speech.
Technologists like Phus Lu, Clowwindy and Xu Dong are now facing the same
political scrutiny and intimidation in authoritarian regimes as independent
writers, publishers, poets or journalists did in Solzhenitsyn’s time. Code
is speech
and using police intimidation to compel these creators to delete their code
repositories is as serious a violation of human rights law as compelling a
writer to burn his or her own books.
It’s also as ultimately futile: while the Chinese authorities have chosen
to target and disrupt two centralised stores of code, thousand of forked
copies of the same software exist—both on other accounts on Github and in
private copies around the Net. ShadowSocks and GoAgent represent hours of
creative work for their authors, but the principle behind them is
reproducible by many other coders. The Great Firewall may be growing more
sophisticated in detecting and blocking new circumvention systems, but even
as it does so, so new code blossoms.
Meanwhile the intimidation of programmers remains a violation of the human
rights of the coder—and a blow to the rights of everyone who relies on
their creativity to exercise their own rights.

something and use people that are activists against them to make it work

dont know i would have to have a real think about solutions it is very
important to think about it and not just the problem for sure but i dont
think the methodology of tor is a solution i think it is a stoppage point
that people are not seeing beyond ... people dont think it has been
penetrated and i have no proof of that but maybe that isnt the main problem
for me ... structurally speaking it is a disaster ... the masses being
handed a tool in order to subvert the government??? as they say you cant
make this shit up
i know that when i was in syria i could get a fucking video call in the
desert where there was nothing ... this was syria not a rich country per
say like at all so i think the choking of the communication system is super
in play ... if others dont think thats a problem then they need to educate
themselves ... do people that live in the US on this list even know that
the infrastructure of fiber optics that underlies the communications may
not even be utilized in their city and that the reason it is not used is
because the communication companies bought a contract with there city that
freezes it all up? please look into the chatanooga model if you dont know
about this 'freemarket' bullshit>>>> also fyi iraq had video calls
nationwide in 2000 or even before ... now i am not sure what tech they were
using i think radiowaves and shooting the signal over land that way but it
all points to a tremendous shut down of functionality  .... not that it was
probably all that healthy for people but...
sure we can write each other little words on this frame of communications
but see what happens when attempting to shift in a large way ... like when
they printed the 3d gun... people had to git fr USA & like when barrett
made project pm and this is a major reason i think there should be as many

sense it better or they got a signal in some form .... sound probably its
really logical actually but why didnt oh so logical humans get the same
ethics are not emotional by nature - really ethics are logical we may get
hints that something doesnt feel right in our gut but then i think it can
be logically laid out as to why as well : murder isnt just emotional there
are lots of factual ramifications that follow from the murder as i am
native american and basically my family was murdered by the fake USG i can
first person talk about the logical ramifications of my family not being
allowed to exist
please prove your point about `lateral thinking` which i would term
horizontality ... if it isnt effective in a given space i often have seen
that the structures that are monolithic are why so i would be interested to
see any other formulations ... as i am a problem seeker ...uuuuhhh then i
know where to work
i think we agree that ideology is not functional but i am not sure we see
the same problems to solve ... i am not sure there is a clear understanding
that life is being heavily designed by a 'few' people in power and they are
designing it for many years to come like they have plans and shit so...
somehow i dont think the plans include medicine for the sick or literacy
for everyone... lets not even discuss food and water or combating mass
murder of the planets inhabitants
heres a video about what people often section off as logic and emotional or
creative sides of the brain ... our own interfaces should be looked at as
evidence not only because of their structures information but to show our
limited scope and not just thru our form but thru the
manipulation/propaganda about our form/forms which you seem to be driving
i think in order to make the machines of the future - like the ones that
will decide on their own wether to kill you or not in a battle - then this
kind of emotion/logic mis-equation will need to be worked on

i am french yes and some irish and NATIVE AMERICAN which means i super dont
like white fuckers that killed my people en mass and did a lot of other
horrible things to them in the name of capitalism so
i am black foot and cherokee and my character seems to align more with that
part of my dna a lot of the time ... yes sometimes i am a dumb white fuck
but thats the nature of the beast but mostly i behave not like a white
person that smiles and nods and stays silent out of fear... i cant exist
that way... i am just a 'wild indian' some other racists have said... they
were white people of course
i am very racist against white empirical capitalist and while i know native
americans that suck - other races have people that suck of course but white
people are really oppressive in my mind so i call them out for it
some people have told me it is racist to claim my heritage of being native
american ... a cop in berlin said 'hile hitler' to me when i told him i was
native american but i guess i should be grateful he actually believed i was
native american - some people dont
i really despise zion because of their fascism and mass murder based on
race and dont understand that other people love zion - do you love zion?
i know me engaging the frame of racism is fucked up but it is so beyond any
comprehension that whites have so much and others have so little
maybe we can work together to figure out wording that points out that they
are white without it being racists??? cause ya know they are like white
so... no i guess it doesnt work... should we ignore their oppressive race?
how... they are all over everything all the time nodding smiling acting

define racism then cause i dont think we have the same definition really
also maybe we dont have the same definition of trolling
just saying someone is a race and is fucked up with power based on their
racial privilege is not racism
its like saying someones race and then being called a racist because you
categorized someone within their race
have we been socially engineered as racist and genderist and specieist and
ageist and mentally or physically challengedists - oh yes and we need to
build new frames out of it but you saying i am white and racist against my
"own" people because i hate the culture doesnt do that - if you really want
to do something about it have a really long think about designing new

are you being racist by deciding my identity for me ?... i dont identify as
white ... i dont act white ... its like i am a tansgender person that

its really white of you to think you get to decide for me btw

they were the barbary pirates i think ...ottomans
yes it is culture but it is also my dna ... my computer is not a microsoft
computer and that is just that... it might have little gui's of microsoft
but NO not microsoft ...i am racist against microsoft ...because native
american or indigenous were slaughtered in mass in more ways than just
their bodies and they still are and we have political prisoners and yes we
say 'we' when we are together and some tribes are deemed with this kind of
characteristic others not etc language structures are similar though ... it
is very different to be indigenous and just denial of indigenousness is a
defacement its part of the horror as the whites that took the native
american babies away from their families wanting to erase the native
american in them
so how can we have our dna respected and not be racists ?

people is a construct of the real fascist racists > the people of color of

predominantly mass shootings in the us are not carried out by white men

dissent ...capitalism is not fascist and you are not part of the problem

cornell west is anyones saviour then you know nothing about capitalism or

chicago now you may know nothing of chicago which speaks volumes in and of
itself but mlk was tackling poverty which you also probably know nothing
about - i see no action by the academic west (ahha lol) that even pretends
to be at that level
Also leaders are now being understood as beyond problematic but you have no
working knowledge of these matters yet pretend you are somehow smart in
them - node based structure is the preferred model because they murder
leaders ... now who is they?
there is no they - white people have no dna tracers like me with my

just an uncategorized blob & no person has been assimilated ever the dna
tracers of whites have no information in them there is no build there is no

and catagorize an entire sector of society global society that are

what they want it to
white people have harness the imaginations of so many that people dont want
to engage the identity of their ancestors asking people what their dna
chain has in it if they are poc is a no no because it is 'racist' therefore
no one any longer has a race ... how convenient its so much easier to
assimilate the other if it is deluded into thinking it is not 'other'
living in berlin i came to know your kind 'the climate deniers' there are
some germans that can barely see and some that face the horror - whats the

You've been called the Dragon Lady for the past twenty years. How do you
feel about it? Why do you think that happened?" You know what that is like?
It's like somebody battering a woman and then saying, "All of us battered
you, but why do you think we did it?" I'm the one responsible for telling
them why I was battered? Well let them tell me. They're the ones who did
it. The other side of it was Asian-bashing--it was as simple as that.'

@_subject: cute little cypher (i hate that other word) black swans 
*Black Swans in a Cyber Forest: ‘FARness’ Needed In Future Information
Technology Acquisition*
Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates stated, "Our record of predicting
where we will use military force since Vietnam is perfect–we have never
once gotten it right. . . We need to have in mind the greatest possible
flexibility and versatility for the broadest range of conflict."[1]
joint operations rely on consistent access to the cyber domain. It is in
the complexity of the cyber world, and our new found reliance on it, that
cyber black swan events are most dangerous to our security.
The cyber domain is a 'forest' dense with complications and operational
implications. Cyber black swan events will happen; we must prepare to deal
with them. As the United States enters a reality where efficiency may trump
effectiveness, it must be careful not to make cyber infrastructure
decisions today that remove flexibility, adaptiveness, and robustness from
the U.S. military in the future.
The Department of Defense (DoD) is looking at maintaining and improving its
cyber domain access with limited funds. The U.S. Navy, for example, began
reducing the number of data-centers it operates, taking advantage of
virtualization or "cloud-computing" technology.[2]
allows one server to service many customers and the “cloud” is the
networked data center's servers storing and providing access to data from
many locations. These new technologies increase speed and the efficiency of
the operating system by distributing and utilizing processing power across
the network.[3]
Navy may be underestimating the need for flexibility, adaptiveness, and
robustness (FAR) in its cyber infrastructure. Risk consideration to the
Navy cyber infrastructure appears to be focused toward information and
network security and financial savings than toward the redundancy and
resiliency needed to overcome catastrophic black swan events.
Current DoD acquisition risk assessment methodology uses pattern analysis
and previous experience, but focuses on single-failure scenarios. This
"what if" versus "how can (it happen)" analysis is more often used because
multi-failure scenarios have a low probability of occurrence. Searching for
the black swan scenarios, or "how can" scenarios, as part of the risk
analysis is critical to creating layers of protection that have the ability
to prevent the event, if possible, but recover from it when necessary.[5]
FAR costs money and our quest for economy may be reducing the capacity
needed to overcome black swan events.
The DoD acquisition system is a top-down process that has its own
institutional inertia and sometimes lacks critical thinking, innovation,
and adaptation. The current acquisition process considers low-probability
events and scenario-based planning, but constrains them to what it believes
is plausible and fundable, limiting the inclusion of creative and critical
is necessary to think “bigger” about the risks.
Defense forecasting, or predicting the future operational environment, is
used in DoD's planning, programming, budgeting, and execution system
(PPBES), and is, "generally static, linear, and reasonably mechanical" in
its approach.[7]
focuses on a capabilities versus risk approach.[8]
Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) and PPBES,
one could argue, is similar to the single-failure scenario based analysis
described earlier. It is not necessarily suited toward multiple-failure
scenarios needed for the complex cyber systems of the future.
The future will demand the balance of technology maturity and cost. In the
early stages of the defense acquisition process for cyber technology,
leaders must ensure that a risk management approach and not just a
capabilities approach is used. The cyber infrastructure key performance
parameters (KPP) and key systems attributes (KSA) should represent a
possible future multi-failure and cyber black swan environment.
Additionally, network-ready key performance parameters (NR-KPP) must
measure survivability and recovery, not just operation. Testing of KPP,
KSA, and NR-KPPs will require a new lens from which to develop testing and
assessment methodology.
The DoD must accept that black swan events will likely accelerate in the
growing complexity of the cyber domain. The analysis used at the strategic
level to make cyber infrastructure decisions must shift from a
single-failure to multi-failure view. Emphasizing "FARness"–that is
flexibility, adaptiveness, and robustness in acquisition decisions is key.
identify "FARness" attributes, the use of brain-storming and subject matter
experts focusing on developing multi-failure scenarios for a proposed cyber
infrastructure should be used. This "how can" approach creates robust
scenarios approaching black swan type events and can identify ways the
system could recover from a catastrophe–a type of "war-gaming." Identifying
common recovery methods or needed attributes through “how can” scenarios
would help decision makers think about the system within the context of a
future environment and the "FARness" needed to survive.
In an effort to become more efficient and save money, the strategic
leadership may not see the potential for black swans hidden in the cyber
domain forest. Layered protections and redundancy are needed to survive a
cyber-black swan event and must be considered in the analysis and decision
making for future virtualization, cloud-computing, and data-center
consolidation. It is with regard to probabilities that decision making
based more on fiscal conservation makes the future force vulnerable. While
history shows that black swan events will occur, it is up to the leadership
to equip the future force with cyber systems that have "FARness"–yet fit
within today's budget.

AUGUST 28, 2015 | BY DANNY O'BRIEN
Speech that Enables Speech: China Takes Aim at Its Coders
The maintainer of GoAgent, one of China's more popular censorship
circumvention tools emptied out the project's main
 source code repositories
 on Tuesday. Phus Lu, the developer,
renamed the repository’s description to “Everything that has a beginning
has an end”. Phus Lu’s Twitter account's historywas also deleted, except
for a single tweet  that
linked to a Chinese translation of Alexander Solzhenitsyn’s “Live Not By
That essay was originally published in 1974 on the day of the Russian
dissident’s arrest for treason.
We can guess what caused Phus Lu to erase over four years’ work on an
extremely popular program from the brief comments of another Chinese
anti-censorship programmer, Clowwindy. Clowwindy was the chief developer of
ShadowSocks, another tool that circumvented the Great Firewall of China by
creating an encrypted tunnel between a simple server and a portable client.
Clowwindy also deleted his or her Github repositories last week. In a
comment on the now empty Github archive Clowwindy wrote in English
Two days ago the police came to me and wanted me to stop working on this.
Today they asked me to delete all the code from Github. I have no choice
but to obey.
The author deleted that comment too shortly afterwards.
Github, the host for both repositories, reported a DDoS attack on the days
between these two incidents. While Github has not commented on the source
of the current attack, the evidence strongly suggests
 that a previous DDoS
against Github in March was conducted by the Chinese government
pressure the company to remove the repositories of two other
anti-censorship programs.
The Chinese government’s control of the Internet passes through regular
waves of enhanced repression, often tied to a significant political event
or protest. Many commentators have connected a current wave of media and
Internet crackdowns
a forthcoming military parade commemorating World War II in Beijing on
September 3.
But even as a peak moment in a temporary spate of repression, the
intimidation of GoAgent and ShadowSock’s creators represents a continuing
escalation by the authorities against technologists.
Chinese law has long forbidden the selling of telecommunication services
that bypass the Great Firewall of China, as well as the creation or
distribution of “harmful information”. Until recently, however, the
authorities have not targeted the authors of non-commercial circumvention
software, nor its users. Human Rights in China ,
a Chinese rights advocacy and research organization, told EFF that, based
on its preliminary review, VPNs and circumvention software is not
specifically prohibited under Chinese law. While the state interferes with
people's ability to use such software, it has not outlawed the software
In November, Phus Lu wrote a public declaration to clarify
oint. In the statement, he
stated that he has received no money to develop GoAgent, provided no
circumvention service, nor asserted any political view.
Phus Lu’s caution at that time was prompted by the police questioning of
another technologist, Xu Dong, a supporter of the Hong Kong opposition
Umbrella Movement who was detained in the same month for “picking quarrels
and creating disturbances”
According to the Washington-based blog China Change, Xu Dong, who goes by
the nym Onionhacker  online, had also been
working on censorship circumvention code. During his detention he was told
by the police that he had committed “crimes of developing software to help
Chinese Internet users scale the Great Fire Wall of China.”
Even if it's unclear what law Xu Dong had broken, if any, in November, the
legal and political climate has grown even more aggressively anti-Internet
since then. A new National Security Law
 came into effect on July 1
, which provides the authorities with a wide remit to oversee “internet
information technology produces and services” that impact national security
(Art. 59), as well as maintain “network sovereignty”
 (Art. 25). It seems
that is already being interpreted to include the creators of circumvention
software. A sweeping bill on cyber-security
 is also in the
The targeting of software developers by China is a new and worrying trend,
but one that we’re seeing occur around the world. Authorities everywhere
are realising that one way to sabotage free expression is to intimidate
those who build the tools that enable that speech.
Technologists like Phus Lu, Clowwindy and Xu Dong are now facing the same
political scrutiny and intimidation in authoritarian regimes as independent
writers, publishers, poets or journalists did in Solzhenitsyn’s time. Code
is speech
and using police intimidation to compel these creators to delete their code
repositories is as serious a violation of human rights law as compelling a
writer to burn his or her own books.
It’s also as ultimately futile: while the Chinese authorities have chosen
to target and disrupt two centralised stores of code, thousand of forked
copies of the same software exist—both on other accounts on Github and in
private copies around the Net. ShadowSocks and GoAgent represent hours of
creative work for their authors, but the principle behind them is
reproducible by many other coders. The Great Firewall may be growing more
sophisticated in detecting and blocking new circumvention systems, but even
as it does so, so new code blossoms.
Meanwhile the intimidation of programmers remains a violation of the human
rights of the coder—and a blow to the rights of everyone who relies on
their creativity to exercise their own rights.

i think there could be solutions utilized like easily shifting the ip
address of comp and router yourself in your own little hut > 'ghost' it but
not thru others .... pretty fucking simple i know but maybe effective in a
really different way than having the fake government of the US build
something and use people that are activists against them to make it work
also i think the infrastructure is too bulky
i like to think about satelites (and thats all i will say about that) - i
dont know i would have to have a real think about solutions it is very
important to think about it and not just the problem for sure but i dont
think the methodology of tor is a solution i think it is a stoppage point
that people are not seeing beyond ... people dont think it has been
penetrated and i have no proof of that but maybe that isnt the main problem
for me ... structurally speaking it is a disaster ... the masses being
handed a tool in order to subvert the government??? as they say you cant
make this shit up
i know that when i was in syria i could get a fucking video call in the
desert where there was nothing ... this was syria not a rich country per
say like at all so i think the choking of the communication system is super
in play ... if others dont think thats a problem then they need to educate
themselves ... do people that live in the US on this list even know that
the infrastructure of fiber optics that underlies the communications may
not even be utilized in their city and that the reason it is not used is
because the communication companies bought a contract with there city that
freezes it all up? please look into the chatanooga model if you dont know
about this 'freemarket' bullshit>>>> also fyi iraq had video calls
nationwide in 2000 or even before ... now i am not sure what tech they were
using i think radiowaves and shooting the signal over land that way but it
all points to a tremendous shut down of functionality  .... not that it was
probably all that healthy for people but...
sure we can write each other little words on this frame of communications
but see what happens when attempting to shift in a large way ... like when
they printed the 3d gun... people had to git fr USA & like when barrett
made project pm and this is a major reason i think there should be as many
solutions as possible not just one - not as easy for gov/corp to take them

its religious thought to even utilize the word 'evil' let alone think in
those terms and religious thought is a capitalist parasite >>> read
nietzsche for fuck sake he wrote in the 1800's
one of my arguments is that it is structurally unsound to rely on one
method >>> especially if built by your enemy - i look to nature as other
thinkers do/have and i think about buckminster fuller - his analysis of
panther dna making them vulnerable to extinction because it is all so/too
similar ... in any given situation i do not think in terms of one solution
... i have used this analogy before ... sperm: there are lots of them in
one load ... they all race to get to the egg sure but, they actually help
each other to penetrate - they dont care who gets in as long as one of them
transforms the egg into a being (i mean i cant really speak for sperms in
general but it has been analysed like this)... thats their job ...they even
have been seen to help each other non-competative like :: this is the kind
of structures we need moreso not monolithic structures that blind us ...
its really a geometry problem for me... math
but also it is all ethical to me as well : if my family was murdered by a
fucker i wouldnt go and use that fuckers infrastructure cause they made it
for me to use and sent some other fuckers around the globe selling it cause
like the fucker murdered my family i wont support them in any way ever
....why would i talk myself into supporting the murderer of my family when
i could think about, invent or utilize other methods - its just really not

i dont see it as poetry or emotion i see it as logic but prove logic to be
lacking poetry or emotion empirically/logically
these kinds of degrading segregations or silos of thought are also
christian in my mind which in turn for me is capitalist like in an
anti-enlightenment kind of way ie logic good emotion or instinct bad
instinct is really important to understand like in the tsunami that hit
thailand remember ? Animals didnt really die en mass as they knew it was
coming so they got out of dodge as they say ... did they have a gauge that
told them to get the fuck out sure they are closer to life so they can
sense it better or they got a signal in some form .... sound probably its
really logical actually but why didnt oh so logical humans get the same
ethics are not emotional by nature - really ethics are logical we may get
hints that something doesnt feel right in our gut but then i think it can
be logically laid out as to why as well : murder isnt just emotional there
are lots of factual ramifications that follow from the murder as i am
native american and basically my family was murdered by the fake USG i can
first person talk about the logical ramifications of my family not being
allowed to exist
please prove your point about `lateral thinking` which i would term
horizontality ... if it isnt effective in a given space i often have seen
that the structures that are monolithic are why so i would be interested to
see any other formulations ... as i am a problem seeker ...uuuuhhh then i
know where to work
i think we agree that ideology is not functional but i am not sure we see
the same problems to solve ... i am not sure there is a clear understanding
that life is being heavily designed by a 'few' people in power and they are
designing it for many years to come like they have plans and shit so...
somehow i dont think the plans include medicine for the sick or literacy
for everyone... lets not even discuss food and water or combating mass
murder of the planets inhabitants
heres a video about what people often section off as logic and emotional or
creative sides of the brain ... our own interfaces should be looked at as
evidence not only because of their structures information but to show our
limited scope and not just thru our form but thru the
manipulation/propaganda about our form/forms which you seem to be driving
i think in order to make the machines of the future - like the ones that
will decide on their own wether to kill you or not in a battle - then this
kind of emotion/logic mis-equation will need to be worked on

i am french yes and some irish and NATIVE AMERICAN which means i super dont
like white fuckers that killed my people en mass and did a lot of other
horrible things to them in the name of capitalism so
i am black foot and cherokee and my character seems to align more with that
part of my dna a lot of the time ... yes sometimes i am a dumb white fuck
but thats the nature of the beast but mostly i behave not like a white
person that smiles and nods and stays silent out of fear... i cant exist
that way... i am just a 'wild indian' some other racists have said... they
were white people of course
i am very racist against white empirical capitalist and while i know native
americans that suck - other races have people that suck of course but white
people are really oppressive in my mind so i call them out for it
some people have told me it is racist to claim my heritage of being native
american ... a cop in berlin said 'hile hitler' to me when i told him i was
native american but i guess i should be grateful he actually believed i was
native american - some people dont
i really despise zion because of their fascism and mass murder based on
race and dont understand that other people love zion - do you love zion?
i know me engaging the frame of racism is fucked up but it is so beyond any
comprehension that whites have so much and others have so little
maybe we can work together to figure out wording that points out that they
are white without it being racists??? cause ya know they are like white
so... no i guess it doesnt work... should we ignore their oppressive race?
how... they are all over everything all the time nodding smiling acting
calm even in the face of mass murder
your little axiom about privilege wouldnt hold up in an ethical court ...
wow i will tell my mother someone said i am from a privileged background
she will rofl for days... i am privileged... isnt everyone from the great

define racism then cause i dont think we have the same definition really
also maybe we dont have the same definition of trolling
just saying someone is a race and is fucked up with power based on their
racial privilege is not racism
its like saying someones race and then being called a racist because you
categorized someone within their race
have we been socially engineered as racist and genderist and specieist and
ageist and mentally or physically challengedists - oh yes and we need to
build new frames out of it but you saying i am white and racist against my
"own" people because i hate the culture doesnt do that - if you really want
to do something about it have a really long think about designing new
frames... raise consciousness - make new words develop your own mind
which tribe?
not a club
are you being racist by deciding my identity for me ?... i dont identify as
white ... i dont act white ... its like i am a tansgender person that
identifies as a woman and you are telling me i am just a man and i have to
just face that ... you dont get to decide for me what i identify with
its really white of you to think you get to decide for me btw
power bullshit ... very white capitalist behavior
is the first step to fixing it...
race and dont understand that other people love zion - do you love zion?
in general?  The state of Israel?
personally met have been nice to me, and I've gotten along well with them.
Draw your own conclusions.
conclusion - you dont know anything about zion
umn fuck gods please read nietzsche - wrote in the 1800's
ethics has nothing to do with law ... guess you havent noticed
us of fucking a beyond privileged compared to the people that dont have
potable water on the planet
I agree, massive ongoing public investment in water infrastructure sure is
a nice thing!  But most people on the planet do have potable water to
drink, tho perhaps not as plentifully as in America.  Not that many people
worldwide are literally dying of thirst.
umn talking people that dont have a tap to have fucking water in so... but
here i cannot drink the tap water maybe more common than you know
that are the others that dont have the right to even learn to read

they were the barbary pirates i think ...ottomans
yes it is culture but it is also my dna ... my computer is not a microsoft
computer and that is just that... it might have little gui's of microsoft
but NO not microsoft ...i am racist against microsoft ...because native
american or indigenous were slaughtered in mass in more ways than just
their bodies and they still are and we have political prisoners and yes we
say 'we' when we are together and some tribes are deemed with this kind of
characteristic others not etc language structures are similar though ... it
is very different to be indigenous and just denial of indigenousness is a
defacement its part of the horror as the whites that took the native
american babies away from their families wanting to erase the native
american in them
so how can we have our dna respected and not be racists ?
so bringing it back to all things cypher is it possible to get these

you to the point of banality
its not about me ... why do you need to try to make it about me?????
right shelley there is no white person no white culture no empire built by
whites no western european and american people that mass murdered enslaved
have stolen resources ...still do
the iraqi people japanese vietnamese loa panamanian on and on were not mass
murdered by western european and american people ... they didnt murder
every buffalo they could see so that my people would starve and pile the
dead buffullo up into hills and take selfies with the corpses... white
people is a construct of the real fascist racists > the people of color of
which i am not i am not native american in any way in my dreams i am but i
am a fanatical fuck ... people of other cultures are not assimilated by the
western mickey mouse culture children are not molested by white men
predominantly mass shootings in the us are not carried out by white men
ever there is no box anywhere on any form that says check this box if you
are 'white' judges in the us are not predominantly from western european
dissent ...capitalism is not fascist and you are not part of the problem
I was trolling the guy which you desire to make into something it is not
But listen - or dont - if you are under the darkness of thought that
cornell west is anyones saviour then you know nothing about capitalism or
the history of the struggle for instance mlk took his babies and lived in
chicago now you may know nothing of chicago which speaks volumes in and of
itself but mlk was tackling poverty which you also probably know nothing
about - i see no action by the academic west (ahha lol) that even pretends
to be at that level
Also leaders are now being understood as beyond problematic but you have no
working knowledge of these matters yet pretend you are somehow smart in
them - node based structure is the preferred model because they murder
leaders ... now who is they?
there is no they - white people have no dna tracers like me with my
delusional native american dna scam there are no constructs in society its
just an uncategorized blob & no person has been assimilated ever the dna
tracers of whites have no information in them there is no build there is no
planet its all a fantasy that you dont have to take responsibility for
please tell me all seeing eye shelley what words should i use to describe
and catagorize an entire sector of society global society that are
presently and historically cannibals? especially seeing how they dont want
to be categorized at all - they even eat categories when it doesnt reflect
what they want it to
white people have harness the imaginations of so many that people dont want
to engage the identity of their ancestors asking people what their dna
chain has in it if they are poc is a no no because it is 'racist' therefore
no one any longer has a race ... how convenient its so much easier to
assimilate the other if it is deluded into thinking it is not 'other'
living in berlin i came to know your kind 'the climate deniers' there are
some germans that can barely see and some that face the horror - whats the
difference ? it doesnt matter their consciousness ? your consciousness
doesnt matter ? they dont walk around saying what is german EVER they dont
say there is no german or germany they fucking face the schiesse which
makes a father fucking difference even though they themselves have been
devoured by capitalism of the super fascist kind
that you call out black lives matter people is repulsive and engages an

that I had never realized before. I said to myself, How dare they! Every
time I have an interview I am asked this question: "The world hated you.
You've been called the Dragon Lady for the past twenty years. How do you
feel about it? Why do you think that happened?" You know what that is like?
It's like somebody battering a woman and then saying, "All of us battered
you, but why do you think we did it?" I'm the one responsible for telling
them why I was battered? Well let them tell me. They're the ones who did
it. The other side of it was Asian-bashing--it was as simple as that.'
that you shelley think you can really informedly speak on critique or
otherwise have serious discourse on black do's and donts in radicalised
activism is the essence of why they struggle

*Black Swans in a Cyber Forest: ‘FARness’ Needed In Future Information
Technology Acquisition*
Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates stated, "Our record of predicting
where we will use military force since Vietnam is perfect–we have never
once gotten it right. . . We need to have in mind the greatest possible
flexibility and versatility for the broadest range of conflict."[1]
joint operations rely on consistent access to the cyber domain. It is in
the complexity of the cyber world, and our new found reliance on it, that
cyber black swan events are most dangerous to our security.
The cyber domain is a 'forest' dense with complications and operational
implications. Cyber black swan events will happen; we must prepare to deal
with them. As the United States enters a reality where efficiency may trump
effectiveness, it must be careful not to make cyber infrastructure
decisions today that remove flexibility, adaptiveness, and robustness from
the U.S. military in the future.
The Department of Defense (DoD) is looking at maintaining and improving its
cyber domain access with limited funds. The U.S. Navy, for example, began
reducing the number of data-centers it operates, taking advantage of
virtualization or "cloud-computing" technology.[2]
allows one server to service many customers and the “cloud” is the
networked data center's servers storing and providing access to data from
many locations. These new technologies increase speed and the efficiency of
the operating system by distributing and utilizing processing power across
the network.[3]
Navy may be underestimating the need for flexibility, adaptiveness, and
robustness (FAR) in its cyber infrastructure. Risk consideration to the
Navy cyber infrastructure appears to be focused toward information and
network security and financial savings than toward the redundancy and
resiliency needed to overcome catastrophic black swan events.
Current DoD acquisition risk assessment methodology uses pattern analysis
and previous experience, but focuses on single-failure scenarios. This
"what if" versus "how can (it happen)" analysis is more often used because
multi-failure scenarios have a low probability of occurrence. Searching for
the black swan scenarios, or "how can" scenarios, as part of the risk
analysis is critical to creating layers of protection that have the ability
to prevent the event, if possible, but recover from it when necessary.[5]
FAR costs money and our quest for economy may be reducing the capacity
needed to overcome black swan events.
The DoD acquisition system is a top-down process that has its own
institutional inertia and sometimes lacks critical thinking, innovation,
and adaptation. The current acquisition process considers low-probability
events and scenario-based planning, but constrains them to what it believes
is plausible and fundable, limiting the inclusion of creative and critical
is necessary to think “bigger” about the risks.
Defense forecasting, or predicting the future operational environment, is
used in DoD's planning, programming, budgeting, and execution system
(PPBES), and is, "generally static, linear, and reasonably mechanical" in
its approach.[7]
focuses on a capabilities versus risk approach.[8]
Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) and PPBES,
one could argue, is similar to the single-failure scenario based analysis
described earlier. It is not necessarily suited toward multiple-failure
scenarios needed for the complex cyber systems of the future.
The future will demand the balance of technology maturity and cost. In the
early stages of the defense acquisition process for cyber technology,
leaders must ensure that a risk management approach and not just a
capabilities approach is used. The cyber infrastructure key performance
parameters (KPP) and key systems attributes (KSA) should represent a
possible future multi-failure and cyber black swan environment.
Additionally, network-ready key performance parameters (NR-KPP) must
measure survivability and recovery, not just operation. Testing of KPP,
KSA, and NR-KPPs will require a new lens from which to develop testing and
assessment methodology.
The DoD must accept that black swan events will likely accelerate in the
growing complexity of the cyber domain. The analysis used at the strategic
level to make cyber infrastructure decisions must shift from a
single-failure to multi-failure view. Emphasizing "FARness"–that is
flexibility, adaptiveness, and robustness in acquisition decisions is key.
identify "FARness" attributes, the use of brain-storming and subject matter
experts focusing on developing multi-failure scenarios for a proposed cyber
infrastructure should be used. This "how can" approach creates robust
scenarios approaching black swan type events and can identify ways the
system could recover from a catastrophe–a type of "war-gaming." Identifying
common recovery methods or needed attributes through “how can” scenarios
would help decision makers think about the system within the context of a
future environment and the "FARness" needed to survive.
In an effort to become more efficient and save money, the strategic
leadership may not see the potential for black swans hidden in the cyber
domain forest. Layered protections and redundancy are needed to survive a
cyber-black swan event and must be considered in the analysis and decision
making for future virtualization, cloud-computing, and data-center
consolidation. It is with regard to probabilities that decision making
based more on fiscal conservation makes the future force vulnerable. While
history shows that black swan events will occur, it is up to the leadership
to equip the future force with cyber systems that have "FARness"–yet fit
within today's budget.

AUGUST 28, 2015 | BY DANNY O'BRIEN
Speech that Enables Speech: China Takes Aim at Its Coders
The maintainer of GoAgent, one of China's more popular censorship
circumvention tools emptied out the project's main
 source code repositories
 on Tuesday. Phus Lu, the developer,
renamed the repository’s description to “Everything that has a beginning
has an end”. Phus Lu’s Twitter account's historywas also deleted, except
for a single tweet  that
linked to a Chinese translation of Alexander Solzhenitsyn’s “Live Not By
That essay was originally published in 1974 on the day of the Russian
dissident’s arrest for treason.
We can guess what caused Phus Lu to erase over four years’ work on an
extremely popular program from the brief comments of another Chinese
anti-censorship programmer, Clowwindy. Clowwindy was the chief developer of
ShadowSocks, another tool that circumvented the Great Firewall of China by
creating an encrypted tunnel between a simple server and a portable client.
Clowwindy also deleted his or her Github repositories last week. In a
comment on the now empty Github archive Clowwindy wrote in English
Two days ago the police came to me and wanted me to stop working on this.
Today they asked me to delete all the code from Github. I have no choice
but to obey.
The author deleted that comment too shortly afterwards.
Github, the host for both repositories, reported a DDoS attack on the days
between these two incidents. While Github has not commented on the source
of the current attack, the evidence strongly suggests
 that a previous DDoS
against Github in March was conducted by the Chinese government
pressure the company to remove the repositories of two other
anti-censorship programs.
The Chinese government’s control of the Internet passes through regular
waves of enhanced repression, often tied to a significant political event
or protest. Many commentators have connected a current wave of media and
Internet crackdowns
a forthcoming military parade commemorating World War II in Beijing on
September 3.
But even as a peak moment in a temporary spate of repression, the
intimidation of GoAgent and ShadowSock’s creators represents a continuing
escalation by the authorities against technologists.
Chinese law has long forbidden the selling of telecommunication services
that bypass the Great Firewall of China, as well as the creation or
distribution of “harmful information”. Until recently, however, the
authorities have not targeted the authors of non-commercial circumvention
software, nor its users. Human Rights in China ,
a Chinese rights advocacy and research organization, told EFF that, based
on its preliminary review, VPNs and circumvention software is not
specifically prohibited under Chinese law. While the state interferes with
people's ability to use such software, it has not outlawed the software
In November, Phus Lu wrote a public declaration to clarify
oint. In the statement, he
stated that he has received no money to develop GoAgent, provided no
circumvention service, nor asserted any political view.
Phus Lu’s caution at that time was prompted by the police questioning of
another technologist, Xu Dong, a supporter of the Hong Kong opposition
Umbrella Movement who was detained in the same month for “picking quarrels
and creating disturbances”
According to the Washington-based blog China Change, Xu Dong, who goes by
the nym Onionhacker  online, had also been
working on censorship circumvention code. During his detention he was told
by the police that he had committed “crimes of developing software to help
Chinese Internet users scale the Great Fire Wall of China.”
Even if it's unclear what law Xu Dong had broken, if any, in November, the
legal and political climate has grown even more aggressively anti-Internet
since then. A new National Security Law
 came into effect on July 1
, which provides the authorities with a wide remit to oversee “internet
information technology produces and services” that impact national security
(Art. 59), as well as maintain “network sovereignty”
 (Art. 25). It seems
that is already being interpreted to include the creators of circumvention
software. A sweeping bill on cyber-security
 is also in the
The targeting of software developers by China is a new and worrying trend,
but one that we’re seeing occur around the world. Authorities everywhere
are realising that one way to sabotage free expression is to intimidate
those who build the tools that enable that speech.
Technologists like Phus Lu, Clowwindy and Xu Dong are now facing the same
political scrutiny and intimidation in authoritarian regimes as independent
writers, publishers, poets or journalists did in Solzhenitsyn’s time. Code
is speech
and using police intimidation to compel these creators to delete their code
repositories is as serious a violation of human rights law as compelling a
writer to burn his or her own books.
It’s also as ultimately futile: while the Chinese authorities have chosen
to target and disrupt two centralised stores of code, thousand of forked
copies of the same software exist—both on other accounts on Github and in
private copies around the Net. ShadowSocks and GoAgent represent hours of
creative work for their authors, but the principle behind them is
reproducible by many other coders. The Great Firewall may be growing more
sophisticated in detecting and blocking new circumvention systems, but even
as it does so, so new code blossoms.
Meanwhile the intimidation of programmers remains a violation of the human
rights of the coder—and a blow to the rights of everyone who relies on
their creativity to exercise their own rights.

actually if more people were involved in the process it would be in safer

that you think there is 'evil' is anti-arrow let alone 'arrow to progress'
islam is a small section of time within arab culture look to zarathustra
plus muhammad was basically a resistance fighter - anti capitalist like
jesus or so the story goes...
these are stories read or look into joseph campbell - nietzsche ...
buckminster fuller if you are interested
your frames are anti arrow ... your frames are fiction
and john young arabs did not invent 0 indians did - the 'arab' - actually
they say he was persian which is very different - wrote about it was
muhammad ibn musa alKhwarizmi
they say though that he invented algebra/trig but probably also it is a
build - arabs did a lot of astronomy invented tools for calculations etc

what i would like is for people to not equate everything with diseases
people desire religion for a reason sometimes psychological reasons and
societal cultural reasons it didnt just manifest onaccounta' because
religion taps into some ancient shit way back in the cells memory ... ritual
the torah taught people how to plant seeds and hindu and other ancient
'religions' are philosophy more than religion and they also have a whole
medical arm > ayuvedic medicine
to say society has not advanced or will not advance is super inaccurate ...
it slows it down but life advances in spite of human shit ... life isnt
just humans its a ton of stuff and people are just a part of it people cant
halt the movement of life itself in any way no matter how fucked up people

or that if someone stole your tv the community would not allow you to just
go in the dudes hut and take it back - you need an intermediary ... but
this is monolithic thinking ... which is a pit in theories ... they
strangle themselves with coffinesque solutions instead of being base theory
so fucking blackwater has been doing this shit for a while now ... gun for

murder/war zone is a fucking hopped up place the people that perform these
actions are getting off on
i found the place for you where he says combat is like no other drug jim so
you dont have to listen to everything
so some people get off on the murder
but we have to already know that
the idea behind dropping the bombs on japan was like this deterrent or that
is what generally american people think anyway ... the japanese would not
give an unconditional surrender yet they had surrendered
all these mass murder desires need to be shifted out as i think they are
strong entities in and of themselves apart from money the psyche is
straight up blood lust blood thirsty fucks ... why we have blood thirsty
fucks everywhere ??? why do people get off on murder/war like it is a drug
? until these mindsets are twisted out of themselves and drained of energy
clear theory of crowd sourced assassination for deterrent cannot fully
work... if it was like one or two crazy fucks that desired combat and

I do agree with steve that the use of the word fuck is a exploitation or
degradation of sex/love which is not that great
We need new words
There have been psyche tests on using swear words ... that is benificial to
the psyche as a sort of release ... some fri3nds of mine that are autistic
find using them to be really helpful but which words using is important
I have 2 friends that had a giant fight about this very thing - one woman
was dutch one american - the dutch hated that the new yorker said fuck and
the new yorker hated and argued against the dutch woman using the word cunt
- which is very common in dutch culture - the giant fight was the demise of
their friendship
The dutch stated using fuck was degrading to love
The new yorker stated using cunt was degrading to women
The dutch said degrading love was far worse than degrading women

I am an artist and have worked with whats considered high level artists ...
say fuck more than me which seems impossible and these kind of caste
distinctions of words or body functions seem to slap in the face the life
of language
Well known thinkers and artists minds dont wotk overall in these
hierarchies ... exclusionary breaks of fenced off condemnation ... spaces
of life - all of them - are expressionable and loved which is actually very
difficult in having no good and bad no good and evil is a complexity the
western mind - christian mind finds hard to bare
Where can they put the control valves and buttons to press if there are no
societal goods and evils as if mass stupidity is the overall normative of
each and everyone needs instriction booklets with their bodies
I like that maybe both realities are acknowledged - saying fuck or mother
fucker is now considered a right  - to be upheld like other rights and
maybe also at the same time a degradation of women or love

Shelly you read zinn and dont internalize it?
Yes the CIA is perceived as master of the universe but the syrian revolt
began in a small town dara'a where some school children wrote grafitti on
the walls against the regime then had their fingers cut off
The supports of the syrian regime globally that prop it up are what keeps
it alive ... france did this in syria for too many decades
CIA is just enforcer to the authoratarian capitalists and attacking the
authoritarian capitalists where they live ... money ... comodification of
life ... is a solution... ie boycott all things french etc but undercutting
CIA by any means whatsoever ... finding all means ... any means is
Basically the CIA is one small maggot of many maggots and just focusing on
the surface parasite or maggot as THE ONE is inneffective besides the
parasitic state lives in one and all and isnt just some outside force to be
battled there are many fronts all around ... so we can pick up any one of
them at any point in time and shove

the psyche as a sort of release ... some fri3nds of mine that are autistic
find using them to be really helpful but which words using is important
I have 2 friends that had a giant fight about this very thing - one woman
was dutch one american - the dutch hated that the new yorker said fuck and
the new yorker hated and argued against the dutch woman using the word cunt
- which is very common in dutch culture - the giant fight was the demise of
their friendship
The dutch stated using fuck was degrading to love
The new yorker stated using cunt was degrading to women
The dutch said degrading love was far worse than degrading women

easily it is backing its money w the US dollar BECAUSE it cant then go to
the US and say ok give me chinese yen ... it just has to hold the dollar in
its system and therefor ownes the debt
Presently the chinese see the futility of the system and are shifting i
cant remember into what exactly ... will dig that up when i get a minute
but they dont want to be basing econ on debt papers anymore

The US has been buidling the present global econ structure for a long long
time and unfortunately when i have tried to talk people out of the system
... like in the middle east ... out of trying to assymilate to the current
rating system etc they just are baffled i ask them to make their own system
... they dont think on these terms because the US has indocrinated everyone
with hegemony for their own benefit its a horror and sick people could have
many more criteria for rating etc change the system... especially the

Quantum Entanglement & Spooky Action at a Distance
Published on Jan 12, 2015
Does quantum entanglement make faster-than-light communication possible?
What is NOT random? First, I know this video is not easy to understand. Thank you for taking
the time to attempt to understand it. I've been working on this for over
six months over which time my understanding has improved. Quantum
entanglement and spooky action at a distance are still debated by
professors of quantum physics (I know because I discussed this topic with
two of them).
Does hidden information (called hidden variables by physicists) exist? If
it does, the experiment violating Bell inequalities indicates that hidden
variables must update faster than light - they would be considered
'non-local'. On the other hand if you don't consider the spins before you
make the measurement then you could simply say hidden variables don't exist
and whenever you measure spins in the same direction you always get
opposite results, which makes sense since angular momentum must be
conserved in the universe.
Everyone agrees that quantum entanglement does not allow information to be
transmitted faster that light. There is no action either detector operator
could take to signal the other one - regardless of the choice of
measurement direction, the measured spins are random with 50/50 probability
of up/down.

Dear fellows,
I´d like to know, what algorithm does TOR use to chose an exit node?
What I find strange is, I always get an exit node from the same region on
this planet.
I never had an exit node, say from Russia or Hong Kong or Japan, but always
from the same region.
This algorithm does not seem to chose it really randomly.
Thus I´m curious how TOR choses exit nodes!

You're wrong.
Existing solutions for the Byzantine Generals Problem provide for any
two correctly functioning nodes to reach agreement regardless of what
any or all other nodes do.  Sybil attacks do not affect the correctness
of the solution.
The problem with them is that required bandwidth per peer scale with the
square of the total number of all other peers.  And sybil attacks DO
affect the scale of the problem for bandwidth purposes.
With block chains the required bandwidth per peer scales linearly with
the number of all other peers (well, technically with the size of the
transactions done by all other peers), making it more scalable (but
still not scalable to the level of a widely used payment network).
The "Lightning Network" solves a problem for people who do many
transactions per day with each other.  There is no merchant nor client
with whom I do more than one transaction per day, so absolutely none of
my transactions would wind up using it.  I expect it to have some real
impact on the bandwidth and size of the block chain because some
business models are absolutely pathological in terms of number of
transactions per day by individual customers (like casinos or
speculative markets) but not nearly as much as its proponents hope
because it simply isn't applicable to ordinary tx (like grocery
stores, office supply vendors, restaurants, or investment markets).
And it still doesn't solve the problem that Trusted parties have emerged
in the form of online wallets and exchanges etc, and they are failing
and/or goxxing people on a regular basis.
Multimillion dollar losses, thefts, and swindles impose public as well
as private expense.  Legislators, Law enforcers, and civil courts cannot
ignore them because the people who get goxxed when they happen won't
allow them to.  Legislation, law enforcement, and both civil and
criminal prosecutions in court are damned expensive, and will
accordingly attract taxation and regulation as the taxpayers
underwriting that expense use their governments to seek to limit their
Being a self-sufficient or self-regulating system does not include
placing fiscal burdens on the public without taxation. Nor does it
include freeloading on public law enforcement, legislative, and judicial
resources without regulation.

Michael Best thanks for asking
we had a big argument on the list about it at one point but maybe it was
more about glenn greenwald, jeremy scahill and pierre so the intercept did
not come up for you as the target
my distrust is about numerous things but primary about authoritarian
capitalism and the capitalist nation building of the USA
pierre omidyar gave over 1 million dollars to usaid programs in the ukraine
before the 'revolution'
in case you dont know - usaid is a front group for the cia - they stomp
around the globe and either utilize uprising activists or create them for
their own use ie authoritarian capitalism
if you need to know about that whole history of the cia then i highly
recommend you look into the work of naomi klein - she is an economist based
out of canada - there are tones of videos on the webs of her speaking her
films - she writes books but sort of puts them to film
- if you need me to point you directly to information from her let me know -
but there are a lot of things the cia does and has done thru various front
organizations like NED etc
it is kind of like the whole thing with soros that supports a lot of
activism that may seem great on the surface but there are serious issues
his money supports which creates more problems but this is whole huge other
thing having to do with russia and other things ... caspar bowden also had
criticism of soros which will explain to you the deeper issues regarding
i said at the time and numerous times before i would never work for dick
cheney making fly fishing lures which essentially means it is a difficulty
to retain ethics while taking money from the corrupt comparmentalizing out
that you personally didnt drop a bomb on a child is an argument of willful
of course these are not black and white issues but there are levels
the ideology that the USG engages/enforces is a horror - the powers are
parasitic and plant parasites in the people and if you think that is not an
issue for the living then i would urge you to educate yourself
glenn greenwald wrote a book long ago whereby he claimed support for the
iraqi invasion and afghani invasion after 9/11
stating something strange like he trusts the US authorities to be doing the
right thing or some crap
the profound lie of the connection to 9/11 and iraq didnt seem to be an
issue for him
if this wasnt enough to dissuade anyone from hailing his brain function he
refuses to acknowledge this support of the invasion and apologize for it as
if he never wrote such insanity
jeremy scahill took a selfie with a murdered body in a morgue on a slab in
mogadeshu for his little film dirty wars
this is unconscionable
if someone thinks this is not unconscionable then they dont know enough
about journalism human rights or respect for that matter
he as a journalist for me is highly compromised because of his attachment
to authoritarian capitalism that he engages
laura poitras is a capitalist
i have issues as a journalist with her being embedded with the military in
the iraq invasion - which interestingly jeremy scahill was not embedded as
there was a huge ethics breech for journalists that agreed to the embed at
least in my realm of journalism which is as an activist journalist
i think they held onto the snowden files for capitalist reasons moreover
especially at the beginning
from the files she has produced articles out of german press a lot and i am
not sure americans are as aware of them but she retains high levels of
redaction - wanted by the US government - which i find disgusting
she has admitted - on camera - to pressuring snowden numerous times to be
filmed in hong kong and as he was under incredible pressure it cannot be
stressed enough that this crosses a journalistic ethical line
protection of the source was not even a thought it seems - there was i
think an idea that thru laura's connection to assange snowden would have
safe passage... excruciatingly naive...
from many security people i have been told over and over > trust no one but
i think it is really up to individuals to educate themselves regarding
funding issues behind orginazations etc and make decisions for themselves
if you dont know a lot about journalistic manipulation i would urge you to
look into the church committee
please look into the subsequent 'blowback' of EO 12333 (known as twelve
triple three) by ronald reagan

Michael Best more proofs:
here is a link where laura poitras admits she pressured snowden to go on
i have other issues with her as i see her as an idealogue which is low
level thought... but this has to do with many convos i had with her on
twitter regarding her blind devotion to assange
she has deleted her account on twitter  so i would only be able to
provide my side of the twitter convo but here you can look at some stuff
here if you want
here is one highly redacted report from laura which i find particularly
problematic because of the jeremy hammond case but overall its just not ok
to align so much with the executive branch
she stated at ccc that they get a lot of complaints about the slowness of
the information coming to the public regarding the snowden docs and glenn
said they have asked eff to take on some of the task but eff declined so
maybe they are doing better at at least trying to get others to work on it
still there is a reason that wikileaks is open ... i mean that decision
wasnt just out of nothing
i worked at democracy now where jeremy worked as well at the time he was
kind still a correspondent (that was waining) so i didnt work directly in
the office but there are issues regarding democracy now and the union they
have there ... him and numerous others that worked there before me for
years did not confront these issues ... i was part of a group that
confronted the union issues there which partially remain unsolved from my
current info
these are bizarre issues to hit when you are reporting on stories about
walmart having issues with maltreatment of employees and not facing the
issues of the very place reporting it ... so odd ...
i wont elaborate on all of this union stuff but i will say if it isnt clear
why there is a capitalist corruption within this then whatever
i am not saying unions are so perfect but the issues there are just too
much of a crossed line
people point fingers at the corrupt government then are corrupt in their
own lives?
here is glenns iraq invasion support admitting not admitting post
preface issue:
"During the lead-up to the invasion, I was concerned that the hell-bent
focus on invading Iraq was being driven by agendas and strategic objectives
that had nothing to do with terrorism or the 9/11 attacks. The overt
rationale for the invasion was exceedingly weak, particularly given that it
would lead to an open-ended, incalculably costly, and intensely risky
preemptive war. Around the same time, it was revealed that an invasion of
Iraq and the removal of Saddam Hussein had been high on the agenda of
various senior administration officials long before September 11. Despite
these doubts, concerns, and grounds for ambivalence, I had not abandoned my
trust in the Bush administration. Between the president's performance in
the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the swift removal of the Taliban in
Afghanistan, and the fact that I wanted the president to succeed, because
my loyalty is to my country and he was the leader of my country, I still
gave the administration the benefit of the doubt. I believed then that the
president was entitled to have his national security judgment deferred to,
and to the extent that I was able to develop a definitive view, I accepted
his judgment that American security really would be enhanced by the
invasion of this sovereign country.
It is not desirable or fulfilling to realize that one does not trust one's
own government and must disbelieve its statements, and I tried, along with
scores of others, to avoid making that choice until the facts no longer
permitted such logic.
Soon after our invasion of Iraq, when it became apparent that, contrary to
Bush administration claims, there were no weapons of mass destruction, I
began concluding, reluctantly, that the administration had veered far off
course from defending the country against the threats of Muslim extremism.
It appeared that in the great national unity the September 11 attacks had
engendered, the administration had seen not a historically unique
opportunity to renew a sense of national identity and cohesion, but instead
a potent political weapon with which to impose upon our citizens a whole
series of policies and programs that had nothing to do with terrorism, but
that could be rationalized through an appeal to the nation's fear of
further terrorist attacks."

i will look at that
but what makes wired less "chatty"
can you expand your ideas on why wireless over wired/fiber?
if the interconnected reach problem goes away that is
my issue with wire/fiber is that it is infrastructure built by the powers
... if higher levels of strength are on wireless networks - which my report
discusses as coming - then maybe it is a better place to form new structures
the powers have proven they will lock them for capital as the chatanooga
model demonstrates so i think it would be best to move from wire
and my point in bringing up syria and iraq wireless use as v strong signal
in the middle of nowhere speaks to wireless ability as well so
i have no clue how they attianed this super connectivity and maybe the
human body was sort of fucked by the waves floating in the air but still

 "cryptography Is Silent Circle “US Govt Approved”?
Encrypted Blackphone goes to war with snoopers
Sunday Jan 19, 2014  |  Rob Lever for Agence France Presse
"The larger firms, said Janke, 'want to own your soul. These companies are
in the business of monetizing data'."
“We know that encryption works,” he said, adding that “brute force” attacks
to break encryption are rare because they are time-consuming, and that spy
agencies generally use other means like inserting viruses in emails or
hardware that can intercept messages.
Because of this, Janke is careful not to promise too much. He said
Blackphone is not a “hardened” device like some designed for military use.
“There is no such thing as a completely secure phone,” he said. “Nothing is
going to protect you from your own behavior. But out of the box, this phone
does a lot of things to protect your privacy.”

Embedded in Galileo code 'pedoporn' 'childporn avi'
One idea - considering hacking team w/FBI and DEA, you can embed that code
to give the appearance that the flagged target is under surveillance for
child porn but since there is already an FBI flag for that, it's a lie.
It's a mask to hide that your surveilling someone but you have no
legitimate legal reason to do it.
a 'childporn.avi' - is a profile pic like an 'avatar' that flags the person
as in a child porn ring but hacking team doesn't do 'rings' - they do
targeted (activists, dissidents etc) surveillance. So that's off and since
it's embedded "placed over the source code" - the LEA is using it to mask
the real reason they are spying on this person
LEA likes to use child porn as a 'plant' - it's like an old school cop
'planting' cocaine on someone they've violated.

Michael Best thanks for asking
we had a big argument on the list about it at one point but maybe it was
more about glenn greenwald, jeremy scahill and pierre so the intercept did
not come up for you as the target
my distrust is about numerous things but primary about authoritarian
capitalism and the capitalist nation building of the USA
pierre omidyar gave over 1 million dollars to usaid programs in the ukraine
before the 'revolution'
in case you dont know - usaid is a front group for the cia - they stomp
around the globe and either utilize uprising activists or create them for
their own use ie authoritarian capitalism
if you need to know about that whole history of the cia then i highly
recommend you look into the work of naomi klein - she is an economist based
out of canada - there are tones of videos on the webs of her speaking her
films - she writes books but sort of puts them to film
- if you need me to point you directly to information from her let me know -
but there are a lot of things the cia does and has done thru various front
organizations like NED etc
it is kind of like the whole thing with soros that supports a lot of
activism that may seem great on the surface but there are serious issues
his money supports which creates more problems but this is whole huge other
thing having to do with russia and other things ... caspar bowden also had
criticism of soros which will explain to you the deeper issues regarding
i said at the time and numerous times before i would never work for dick
cheney making fly fishing lures which essentially means it is a difficulty
to retain ethics while taking money from the corrupt comparmentalizing out
that you personally didnt drop a bomb on a child is an argument of willful
of course these are not black and white issues but there are levels
the ideology that the USG engages/enforces is a horror - the powers are
parasitic and plant parasites in the people and if you think that is not an
issue for the living then i would urge you to educate yourself
glenn greenwald wrote a book long ago whereby he claimed support for the
iraqi invasion and afghani invasion after 9/11
stating something strange like he trusts the US authorities to be doing the
right thing or some crap
the profound lie of the connection to 9/11 and iraq didnt seem to be an
issue for him
if this wasnt enough to dissuade anyone from hailing his brain function he
refuses to acknowledge this support of the invasion and apologize for it as
if he never wrote such insanity
jeremy scahill took a selfie with a murdered body in a morgue on a slab in
mogadeshu for his little film dirty wars
this is unconscionable
if someone thinks this is not unconscionable then they dont know enough
about journalism human rights or respect for that matter
he as a journalist for me is highly compromised because of his attachment
to authoritarian capitalism that he engages
laura poitras is a capitalist
i have issues as a journalist with her being embedded with the military in
the iraq invasion - which interestingly jeremy scahill was not embedded as
there was a huge ethics breech for journalists that agreed to the embed at
least in my realm of journalism which is as an activist journalist
i think they held onto the snowden files for capitalist reasons moreover
especially at the beginning
from the files she has produced articles out of german press a lot and i am
not sure americans are as aware of them but she retains high levels of
redaction - wanted by the US government - which i find disgusting
she has admitted - on camera - to pressuring snowden numerous times to be
filmed in hong kong and as he was under incredible pressure it cannot be
stressed enough that this crosses a journalistic ethical line
protection of the source was not even a thought it seems - there was i
think an idea that thru laura's connection to assange snowden would have
safe passage... excruciatingly naive...
from many security people i have been told over and over > trust no one but
i think it is really up to individuals to educate themselves regarding
funding issues behind orginazations etc and make decisions for themselves
if you dont know a lot about journalistic manipulation i would urge you to
look into the church committee
please look into the subsequent 'blowback' of EO 12333 (known as twelve
triple three) by ronald reagan

Michael Best more proofs:
here is a link where laura poitras admits she pressured snowden to go on
i have other issues with her as i see her as an idealogue which is low
level thought... but this has to do with many convos i had with her on
twitter regarding her blind devotion to assange
she has deleted her account on twitter  so i would only be able to
provide my side of the twitter convo but here you can look at some stuff
here if you want
here is one highly redacted report from laura which i find particularly
problematic because of the jeremy hammond case but overall its just not ok
to align so much with the executive branch
she stated at ccc that they get a lot of complaints about the slowness of
the information coming to the public regarding the snowden docs and glenn
said they have asked eff to take on some of the task but eff declined so
maybe they are doing better at at least trying to get others to work on it
still there is a reason that wikileaks is open ... i mean that decision
wasnt just out of nothing
i worked at democracy now where jeremy worked as well at the time he was
kind still a correspondent (that was waining) so i didnt work directly in
the office but there are issues regarding democracy now and the union they
have there ... him and numerous others that worked there before me for
years did not confront these issues ... i was part of a group that
confronted the union issues there which partially remain unsolved from my
current info
these are bizarre issues to hit when you are reporting on stories about
walmart having issues with maltreatment of employees and not facing the
issues of the very place reporting it ... so odd ...
i wont elaborate on all of this union stuff but i will say if it isnt clear
why there is a capitalist corruption within this then whatever
i am not saying unions are so perfect but the issues there are just too
much of a crossed line
people point fingers at the corrupt government then are corrupt in their
own lives?
here is glenns iraq invasion support admitting not admitting post
preface issue:
"During the lead-up to the invasion, I was concerned that the hell-bent
focus on invading Iraq was being driven by agendas and strategic objectives
that had nothing to do with terrorism or the 9/11 attacks. The overt
rationale for the invasion was exceedingly weak, particularly given that it
would lead to an open-ended, incalculably costly, and intensely risky
preemptive war. Around the same time, it was revealed that an invasion of
Iraq and the removal of Saddam Hussein had been high on the agenda of
various senior administration officials long before September 11. Despite
these doubts, concerns, and grounds for ambivalence, I had not abandoned my
trust in the Bush administration. Between the president's performance in
the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the swift removal of the Taliban in
Afghanistan, and the fact that I wanted the president to succeed, because
my loyalty is to my country and he was the leader of my country, I still
gave the administration the benefit of the doubt. I believed then that the
president was entitled to have his national security judgment deferred to,
and to the extent that I was able to develop a definitive view, I accepted
his judgment that American security really would be enhanced by the
invasion of this sovereign country.
It is not desirable or fulfilling to realize that one does not trust one's
own government and must disbelieve its statements, and I tried, along with
scores of others, to avoid making that choice until the facts no longer
permitted such logic.
Soon after our invasion of Iraq, when it became apparent that, contrary to
Bush administration claims, there were no weapons of mass destruction, I
began concluding, reluctantly, that the administration had veered far off
course from defending the country against the threats of Muslim extremism.
It appeared that in the great national unity the September 11 attacks had
engendered, the administration had seen not a historically unique
opportunity to renew a sense of national identity and cohesion, but instead
a potent political weapon with which to impose upon our citizens a whole
series of policies and programs that had nothing to do with terrorism, but
that could be rationalized through an appeal to the nation's fear of
further terrorist attacks."

Embedded in Galileo code 'pedoporn' 'childporn avi'
One idea - considering hacking team w/FBI and DEA, you can embed that code
to give the appearance that the flagged target is under surveillance for
child porn but since there is already an FBI flag for that, it's a lie.
It's a mask to hide that your surveilling someone but you have no
legitimate legal reason to do it.
a 'childporn.avi' - is a profile pic like an 'avatar' that flags the person
as in a child porn ring but hacking team doesn't do 'rings' - they do
targeted (activists, dissidents etc) surveillance. So that's off and since
it's embedded "placed over the source code" - the LEA is using it to mask
the real reason they are spying on this person
LEA likes to use child porn as a 'plant' - it's like an old school cop
'planting' cocaine on someone they've violated.

@_subject: The Intercept steps up after catching a reporter faking data and 
thanks for asking
we had a big argument on the list about it at one point but maybe it was
more about glenn greenwald, jeremy scahill and pierre so the intercept did
not come up for you as the target
my distrust is about numerous things but primary about authoritarian
capitalism and the capitalist nation building of the USA
pierre omidyar gave over 1 million dollars to usaid programs in the ukraine
before the 'revolution'
in case you dont know - usaid is a front group for the cia - they stomp
around the globe and either utilize uprising activists or create them for
their own use ie authoritarian capitalism
if you need to know about that whole history of the cia then i highly
recommend you look into the work of naomi klein - she is an economist based
out of canada - there are tones of videos on the webs of her speaking her
films - she writes books but sort of puts them to film
- if you need me to point you directly to information from her let me know -
but there are a lot of things the cia does and has done thru various front
organizations like NED etc
it is kind of like the whole thing with soros that supports a lot of
activism that may seem great on the surface but there are serious issues
his money supports which creates more problems but this is whole huge other
thing having to do with russia and other things ... caspar bowden also had
criticism of soros which will explain to you the deeper issues regarding
i said at the time and numerous times before i would never work for dick
cheney making fly fishing lures which essentially means it is a difficulty
to retain ethics while taking money from the corrupt comparmentalizing out
that you personally didnt drop a bomb on a child is an argument of willful
of course these are not black and white issues but there are levels
the ideology that the USG engages/enforces is a horror - the powers are
parasitic and plant parasites in the people and if you think that is not an
issue for the living then i would urge you to educate yourself
glenn greenwald wrote a book long ago whereby he claimed support for the
iraqi invasion and afghani invasion after 9/11
stating something strange like he trusts the US authorities to be doing the
right thing or some crap
the profound lie of the connection to 9/11 and iraq didnt seem to be an
issue for him
if this wasnt enough to dissuade anyone from hailing his brain function he
refuses to acknowledge this support of the invasion and apologize for it as
if he never wrote such insanity
jeremy scahill took a selfie with a murdered body in a morgue on a slab in
mogadeshu for his little film dirty wars
this is unconscionable
if someone thinks this is not unconscionable then they dont know enough
about journalism human rights or respect for that matter
he as a journalist for me is highly compromised because of his attachment
to authoritarian capitalism that he engages
laura poitras is a capitalist
i have issues as a journalist with her being embedded with the military in
the iraq invasion - which interestingly jeremy scahill was not embedded as
there was a huge ethics breech for journalists that agreed to the embed at
least in my realm of journalism which is as an activist journalist
i think they held onto the snowden files for capitalist reasons moreover
especially at the beginning
from the files she has produced articles out of german press a lot and i am
not sure americans are as aware of them but she retains high levels of
redaction - wanted by the US government - which i find disgusting
she has admitted - on camera - to pressuring snowden numerous times to be
filmed in hong kong and as he was under incredible pressure it cannot be
stressed enough that this crosses a journalistic ethical line
protection of the source was not even a thought it seems - there was i
think an idea that thru laura's connection to assange snowden would have
safe passage... excruciatingly naive...
from many security people i have been told over and over > trust no one but
i think it is really up to individuals to educate themselves regarding
funding issues behind orginazations etc and make decisions for themselves
if you dont know a lot about journalistic manipulation i would urge you to
look into the church committee
please look into the subsequent 'blowback' of EO 12333 (known as twelve
triple three) by ronald reagan

more proofs:
here is a link where laura poitras admits she pressured snowden to go on
i have other issues with her as i see her as an idealogue which is low
level thought... but this has to do with many convos i had with her on
twitter regarding her blind devotion to assange
she has deleted her account on twitter  so i would only be able to
provide my side of the twitter convo but here you can look at some stuff
here if you want
here is one highly redacted report from laura which i find particularly
problematic because of the jeremy hammond case but overall its just not ok
to align so much with the executive branch
she stated at ccc that they get a lot of complaints about the slowness of
the information coming to the public regarding the snowden docs and glenn
said they have asked eff to take on some of the task but eff declined so
maybe they are doing better at at least trying to get others to work on it
still there is a reason that wikileaks is open ... i mean that decision
wasnt just out of nothing
i worked at democracy now where jeremy worked as well at the time he was
kind still a correspondent (that was waining) so i didnt work directly in
the office but there are issues regarding democracy now and the union they
have there ... him and numerous others that worked there before me for
years did not confront these issues ... i was part of a group that
confronted the union issues there which partially remain unsolved from my
current info
these are bizarre issues to hit when you are reporting on stories about
walmart having issues with maltreatment of employees and not facing the
issues of the very place reporting it ... so odd ...
i wont elaborate on all of this union stuff but i will say if it isnt clear
why there is a capitalist corruption within this then whatever
i am not saying unions are so perfect but the issues there are just too
much of a crossed line
people point fingers at the corrupt government then are corrupt in their
own lives?
here is glenns iraq invasion support admitting not admitting post
preface issue:
"During the lead-up to the invasion, I was concerned that the hell-bent
focus on invading Iraq was being driven by agendas and strategic objectives
that had nothing to do with terrorism or the 9/11 attacks. The overt
rationale for the invasion was exceedingly weak, particularly given that it
would lead to an open-ended, incalculably costly, and intensely risky
preemptive war. Around the same time, it was revealed that an invasion of
Iraq and the removal of Saddam Hussein had been high on the agenda of
various senior administration officials long before September 11. Despite
these doubts, concerns, and grounds for ambivalence, I had not abandoned my
trust in the Bush administration. Between the president's performance in
the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the swift removal of the Taliban in
Afghanistan, and the fact that I wanted the president to succeed, because
my loyalty is to my country and he was the leader of my country, I still
gave the administration the benefit of the doubt. I believed then that the
president was entitled to have his national security judgment deferred to,
and to the extent that I was able to develop a definitive view, I accepted
his judgment that American security really would be enhanced by the
invasion of this sovereign country.
It is not desirable or fulfilling to realize that one does not trust one's
own government and must disbelieve its statements, and I tried, along with
scores of others, to avoid making that choice until the facts no longer
permitted such logic.
Soon after our invasion of Iraq, when it became apparent that, contrary to
Bush administration claims, there were no weapons of mass destruction, I
began concluding, reluctantly, that the administration had veered far off
course from defending the country against the threats of Muslim extremism.
It appeared that in the great national unity the September 11 attacks had
engendered, the administration had seen not a historically unique
opportunity to renew a sense of national identity and cohesion, but instead
a potent political weapon with which to impose upon our citizens a whole
series of policies and programs that had nothing to do with terrorism, but
that could be rationalized through an appeal to the nation's fear of
further terrorist attacks."

Embedded in Galileo code 'pedoporn' 'childporn avi'
One idea - considering hacking team w/FBI and DEA, you can embed that code
to give the appearance that the flagged target is under surveillance for
child porn but since there is already an FBI flag for that, it's a lie.
It's a mask to hide that your surveilling someone but you have no
legitimate legal reason to do it.
a 'childporn.avi' - is a profile pic like an 'avatar' that flags the person
as in a child porn ring but hacking team doesn't do 'rings' - they do
targeted (activists, dissidents etc) surveillance. So that's off and since
it's embedded "placed over the source code" - the LEA is using it to mask
the real reason they are spying on this person
LEA likes to use child porn as a 'plant' - it's like an old school cop
'planting' cocaine on someone they've violated.

be shaming or humiliation, or the fear of not being believed.
It is also our responsibility to create an environment where people feel
safe to come forward. We have always stood for freedom of speech and
expression, which sometimes necessitates the right to anonymity. This is
something that victims of abuse often require. We stand by their right to
be anonymous. Others, like our friend Nick Farr, who decided to go public
with his own difficulties, deserve our respect and support. Everyone will
do this in their own way.
We know that it may be scary, but we also encourage victims to contact
their appropriate local authorities. We understand the complicated
relationship we all have with law enforcement, but there is a time and
place for government intervention. If the most extreme of these allegations
are true, they should be addressed in a court of law, and dealt with
CULT OF THE DEAD COW is known for a lot of things, but treating people
horribly is not one of them. If communities are to thrive and remain
relevant we have to do some housecleaning from time to time. As we have
become aware of the anonymous accusations of sexual assault, as well as the
stories told by individuals we know and trust, we've decided to remove Jake
from the herd effective immediately.

That, coupled with the physical surveillance, allowed the agency to see

*By John Markoff, from* Machines of Loving Grace, *out this month from Ecco
Books. Markoff has been a technology and business reporter for the* New
York Times *since 1988.*
ill Duvall grew up on the peninsula south of San Francisco. The son of a
physicist who was involved in classified research at Stanford Research
Institute (SRI), a military-oriented think tank, Duvall attended UC
Berkeley in the mid-1960s; he took all the university’s
computer-programming courses and dropped out after two years. When he
joined the think tank where his father worked, a few miles from the
Stanford campus, he was assigned to the team of artificial-intelligence
researchers who were building Shakey.
Although *Life* magazine would later dub Shakey the first “electronic
person,” it was basically a six-foot stack of gear, sensors, and motorized
wheels that was tethered — and later wirelessly connected — to a nearby
mainframe. Shakey wasn’t the world’s first mobile robot, but it was the
first that was intended to be truly autonomous. It was designed to reason
about the world around it, to plan its own actions, and to perform tasks.
It could find and push objects and move in a planned way in its highly
structured world.
At both SRI and the nearby Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
(SAIL), which was founded by John McCarthy in 1962, a tightly knit group of
researchers was attempting to build machines that mimicked human
capabilities. To this group, Shakey was a striking portent of the future;
they believed that the scientific breakthrough that would enable machines
to act like humans was coming in just a few short years. Indeed, among the
small community of AI researchers who were working on both coasts during
the mid-Sixties, there was virtually boundless optimism.
But the reality disappointed Duvall. Shakey lived in a large open room with
linoleum floors and a couple of racks of electronics. Box-like objects were
scattered around for the robot to “play” with. Shakey’s sensors would
capture its environment and then it would “think” — standing motionless for
minutes on end — before moving. Even in its closed and controlled world,
the robot frequently broke down or drained its batteries after just minutes
of operation.
Down the hall from the Shakey laboratory, another research group, led by
computer scientist Doug Engelbart, was building a computer to run a program
called NLS — the oN-Line System. Most people who know of Engelbart today
know him as the inventor of the mouse. But the mouse, to Engelbart, was
simply a gadget to improve our ability to interact with computers. His more
encompassing idea was to use computer technologies to make it possible for
small groups of scientists, engineers, and educators to “bootstrap” their
projects by employing an array of ever more powerful software tools to
organize their activities and create a “collective I.Q.” that outstripped
the capabilities of any single individual. During World War II, Engelbart
had stumbled across an article by Vannevar Bush that proposed a
microfilm-based information-retrieval system called Memex to manage all of
the world’s knowledge. He realized that such a system could be assembled
with computers.
The cultural gulf between McCarthy’s artificial intelligence and
Engelbart’s contrarian NLS was already apparent to those on either side.
When Engelbart visited MIT to demonstrate his project, prominent AI
researcher Marvin Minsky complained that he was wasting research dollars on
a glorified word processor. But the idea captivated Bill Duvall. Before
long he switched his allegiance and moved down the hall to work in
Engelbart’s lab.
Late on the evening of October 29, 1969, Duvall connected the NLS system in
Menlo Park, via a data line leased from the phone company, to a computer
controlled by another young hacker in Los Angeles. It was the first time
that two computers connected over the network that would become the
Internet. Duvall’s leap from the Shakey laboratory to Engelbart’s NLS made
him one of the earliest people to stand on both sides of a line that even
today distinguishes two rival engineering communities. One of these
communities has relentlessly pursued the automation of the human
experience — artificial intelligence. The other, human-computer
interaction — what Engelbart called intelligence augmentation — has
concerned itself with “man-machine symbiosis.” What separates AI and IA is
partly their technical approaches, but the distinction also implies
differing ethical stances toward the relationship of man to machine.
uring the 1970s and 1980s the field of artificial intelligence drew a
generation of brilliant engineers, but it often disappointed them in much
the way that it had disappointed Duvall. Like him, many of these engineers
turned to the contrasting ideal of intelligence augmentation. But today, AI
is beginning to meet some of the promises made for it by SAIL and SRI
researchers half a century ago, and artificial intelligence is poised to
have an impact on society that may be greater than the effect of personal
computing and the Internet.
Although their project has now largely been forgotten, the designers of
Shakey pioneered computing technologies that are now used by more than a
billion people. The mapping software in our cars and our smartphones is
based on techniques the team first developed. Their A* algorithm is the
best-known way to find the shortest path between two locations. Toward the
end of the Shakey project, speech control was added as a research task;
Apple’s Siri, whose name is a nod to SRI, is a distant descendent of the
machine that began life as a stack of rolling sensors and actuators.
While Engelbart’s original research led directly to the PC and the
Internet, McCarthy’s lab did not provide a single dramatic breakthrough.
Rather, the falling costs of sensors, computer processing, and information
storage, along with the gradual shift away from symbolic logic and toward
more pragmatic statistical and machine-learning algorithms, have made it
possible for engineers and programmers to create computerized systems that
see, speak, listen, and move around in the world.
As a result, AI has been transformed from an academic curiosity into a
force that is altering countless aspects of the modern world. This has
created an increasingly clear choice for designers — a choice that has
become philosophical and ethical, rather than simply technical: will we
design humans into or out of the systems that transport us, that grow our
food, manufacture our goods, and provide our entertainment?
s computing and robotics systems have grown from laboratory curiosities
into the fabric that weaves together modern life, the AI and IA communities
have continued to speak past each other. The field of human-computer
interface has largely operated within the philosophical framework
originally set down by Engelbart — that computers should be used to assist
humans. In contrast, the artificial-intelligence community has for the most
part remained unconcerned with preserving a role for individual humans in
the systems it creates.
Terry Winograd was one of the first to see the two extremes clearly and to
consider their consequences. As a graduate student at MIT in the 1960s,
Winograd studied human language in order to build a software robot that was
capable of interacting with humans in conversation. During the 1980s, he
was part of a small group of AI researchers who engaged in seminars at
Berkeley with the philosophers Hubert Dreyfus and John Searle. The
philosophers persuaded Winograd that there were real limits to the
capabilities of intelligent machines. In part because of his changing
views, he left the field of artificial intelligence.
A decade later, as the faculty adviser for Google cofounder Larry Page,
Winograd counseled the young graduate student to focus on Web search rather
than more far-fetched technologies. Page’s original PageRank algorithm, the
heart of Google’s search engine, can perhaps be seen as the most powerful
example of human augmentation in history. The algorithm systematically
collected human decisions about the value of information and pooled those
decisions to prioritize search results. Although some criticized the
process for siphoning intellectual labor from vast numbers of unwitting
humans, the algorithm established an unstated social contract: Google mined
the wealth of human knowledge and returned it in searchable form to
society, while reserving for itself the right to monetize the results.
Since it established its search box as the world’s most powerful
information monopoly, Google has yo-yoed between IA and AI applications and
services. The ill-fated Google Glass was intended as a
“reality-augmentation system,” while the company’s driverless-car project
represents a pure AI — replacing human agency and intelligence with a
machine. Recently, Google has undertaken what it loosely identifies as
“brain” projects, which suggests a new wave of AI.
In 2012, Google researchers presented a paper on a machine-vision system.
After training itself on 10 million digital images taken from YouTube
videos, the system dramatically outperformed previous efforts at an
automated-vision network, roughly doubling their accuracy in recognizing
objects from a list of 20,000 distinct items. Among other things, the
system taught itself to recognize cats — perhaps not surprising, given the
overabundance of cat videos on YouTube — with a mechanism that the
scientists described as a cybernetic cousin to what takes place in the
brain’s visual cortex. The experiment was made possible by Google’s immense
computing resources, which allowed researchers to turn loose a cluster of
16,000 processors on the problem — though that number still, of course,
represented a tiny fraction of the billions of neurons in a human brain, a
huge portion of which are devoted to vision.
peculation about whether Google is on the trail of a genuine artificial
brain has become increasingly rampant. There is certainly no question that
a growing group of Silicon Valley engineers and scientists believe
themselves to be closing in on “strong” AI — the creation of a self-aware
machine with human or greater intelligence.
Whether or not this goal is ever achieved, it is becoming increasingly
possible — and “rational” — to design humans out of systems for both
performance and cost reasons. In manufacturing, where robots can directly
replace human labor, the impact of artificial intelligence will be easily
visible. In other cases the direct effects will be more difficult to
discern. Winston Churchill said, “We shape our buildings, and afterwards
our buildings shape us.” Today our computational systems have become
immense edifices that define the way we interact with our society.
In Silicon Valley it is fashionable to celebrate this development, a trend
that is most clearly visible in organizations like the Singularity
Institute and in books like Kevin Kelly’s *What Technology Wants* (2010).
In an earlier book, *Out of Control* (1994), Kelly came down firmly on the
side of the machines:
The problem with our robots today is that we don’t respect them. They are
stuck in factories without windows, doing jobs that humans don’t want to
do. We take machines as slaves, but they are not that. That’s what Marvin
Minsky, the mathematician who pioneered artificial intelligence, tells
anyone who will listen. Minsky goes all the way as an advocate for
downloading human intelligence into a computer. Doug Engelbart, on the
other hand, is the legendary guy who invented word processing, the mouse,
and hypermedia, and who is an advocate for computers-for-the-people. When
the two gurus met at MIT in the 1950s, they are reputed to have had the
following conversation:
minsky: We’re going to make machines intelligent. We are going to make them
engelbart: You’re going to do all that for the machines? What are you going
to do for the people?
This story is usually told by engineers working to make computers more
friendly, more humane, more people centered. But I’m squarely on Minsky’s
side — on the side of the made. People will survive. We’ll train our
machines to serve us. But what are we going to do for the machines?
But to say that people will “survive” understates the possible
consequences: Minsky is said to have responded to a question about the
significance of the arrival of artificial intelligence by saying, “If we’re
lucky, they’ll keep us as pets.”
Until recently, the artificial-intelligence community has largely chosen to
ignore the ethics of systems that they consider merely powerful tools. When
I asked one engineer who is building next-generation robots about the
impact of automation on people, he told me, “You can’t think about that;
you just have to decide that you are going to do the best you can to
improve the world for humanity as a whole.”
AI and machine-learning algorithms have already led to transformative
applications in areas as diverse as science, manufacturing, and
entertainment. Machine vision and pattern recognition have been essential
to improving quality in semiconductor design. Drug-discovery algorithms
have systematized the creation of new pharmaceuticals. The same
breakthroughs have also brought us increased government surveillance and
social-media companies whose business model depends on invading privacy for
Optimists hope that the potential abuses of our computer systems will be
minimized if the application of artificial intelligence, genetic
engineering, and robotics remains focused on humans rather than algorithms.
But the tech industry has not had a track record that speaks to moral
enlightenment. It would be truly remarkable if a Silicon Valley company
rejected a profitable technology for ethical reasons. Today, decisions
about implementing technology are made largely on the basis of
profitability and efficiency. What is needed is a new moral calculus.

*By John Markoff, from* Machines of Loving Grace, *out this month from Ecco
Books. Markoff has been a technology and business reporter for the* New
York Times *since 1988.*
ill Duvall grew up on the peninsula south of San Francisco. The son of a
physicist who was involved in classified research at Stanford Research
Institute (SRI), a military-oriented think tank, Duvall attended UC
Berkeley in the mid-1960s; he took all the university’s
computer-programming courses and dropped out after two years. When he
joined the think tank where his father worked, a few miles from the
Stanford campus, he was assigned to the team of artificial-intelligence
researchers who were building Shakey.
Although *Life* magazine would later dub Shakey the first “electronic
person,” it was basically a six-foot stack of gear, sensors, and motorized
wheels that was tethered — and later wirelessly connected — to a nearby
mainframe. Shakey wasn’t the world’s first mobile robot, but it was the
first that was intended to be truly autonomous. It was designed to reason
about the world around it, to plan its own actions, and to perform tasks.
It could find and push objects and move in a planned way in its highly
structured world.
At both SRI and the nearby Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
(SAIL), which was founded by John McCarthy in 1962, a tightly knit group of
researchers was attempting to build machines that mimicked human
capabilities. To this group, Shakey was a striking portent of the future;
they believed that the scientific breakthrough that would enable machines
to act like humans was coming in just a few short years. Indeed, among the
small community of AI researchers who were working on both coasts during
the mid-Sixties, there was virtually boundless optimism.
But the reality disappointed Duvall. Shakey lived in a large open room with
linoleum floors and a couple of racks of electronics. Box-like objects were
scattered around for the robot to “play” with. Shakey’s sensors would
capture its environment and then it would “think” — standing motionless for
minutes on end — before moving. Even in its closed and controlled world,
the robot frequently broke down or drained its batteries after just minutes
of operation.
Down the hall from the Shakey laboratory, another research group, led by
computer scientist Doug Engelbart, was building a computer to run a program
called NLS — the oN-Line System. Most people who know of Engelbart today
know him as the inventor of the mouse. But the mouse, to Engelbart, was
simply a gadget to improve our ability to interact with computers. His more
encompassing idea was to use computer technologies to make it possible for
small groups of scientists, engineers, and educators to “bootstrap” their
projects by employing an array of ever more powerful software tools to
organize their activities and create a “collective I.Q.” that outstripped
the capabilities of any single individual. During World War II, Engelbart
had stumbled across an article by Vannevar Bush that proposed a
microfilm-based information-retrieval system called Memex to manage all of
the world’s knowledge. He realized that such a system could be assembled
with computers.
The cultural gulf between McCarthy’s artificial intelligence and
Engelbart’s contrarian NLS was already apparent to those on either side.
When Engelbart visited MIT to demonstrate his project, prominent AI
researcher Marvin Minsky complained that he was wasting research dollars on
a glorified word processor. But the idea captivated Bill Duvall. Before
long he switched his allegiance and moved down the hall to work in
Engelbart’s lab.
Late on the evening of October 29, 1969, Duvall connected the NLS system in
Menlo Park, via a data line leased from the phone company, to a computer
controlled by another young hacker in Los Angeles. It was the first time
that two computers connected over the network that would become the
Internet. Duvall’s leap from the Shakey laboratory to Engelbart’s NLS made
him one of the earliest people to stand on both sides of a line that even
today distinguishes two rival engineering communities. One of these
communities has relentlessly pursued the automation of the human
experience — artificial intelligence. The other, human-computer
interaction — what Engelbart called intelligence augmentation — has
concerned itself with “man-machine symbiosis.” What separates AI and IA is
partly their technical approaches, but the distinction also implies
differing ethical stances toward the relationship of man to machine.
uring the 1970s and 1980s the field of artificial intelligence drew a
generation of brilliant engineers, but it often disappointed them in much
the way that it had disappointed Duvall. Like him, many of these engineers
turned to the contrasting ideal of intelligence augmentation. But today, AI
is beginning to meet some of the promises made for it by SAIL and SRI
researchers half a century ago, and artificial intelligence is poised to
have an impact on society that may be greater than the effect of personal
computing and the Internet.
Although their project has now largely been forgotten, the designers of
Shakey pioneered computing technologies that are now used by more than a
billion people. The mapping software in our cars and our smartphones is
based on techniques the team first developed. Their A* algorithm is the
best-known way to find the shortest path between two locations. Toward the
end of the Shakey project, speech control was added as a research task;
Apple’s Siri, whose name is a nod to SRI, is a distant descendent of the
machine that began life as a stack of rolling sensors and actuators.
While Engelbart’s original research led directly to the PC and the
Internet, McCarthy’s lab did not provide a single dramatic breakthrough.
Rather, the falling costs of sensors, computer processing, and information
storage, along with the gradual shift away from symbolic logic and toward
more pragmatic statistical and machine-learning algorithms, have made it
possible for engineers and programmers to create computerized systems that
see, speak, listen, and move around in the world.
As a result, AI has been transformed from an academic curiosity into a
force that is altering countless aspects of the modern world. This has
created an increasingly clear choice for designers — a choice that has
become philosophical and ethical, rather than simply technical: will we
design humans into or out of the systems that transport us, that grow our
food, manufacture our goods, and provide our entertainment?
s computing and robotics systems have grown from laboratory curiosities
into the fabric that weaves together modern life, the AI and IA communities
have continued to speak past each other. The field of human-computer
interface has largely operated within the philosophical framework
originally set down by Engelbart — that computers should be used to assist
humans. In contrast, the artificial-intelligence community has for the most
part remained unconcerned with preserving a role for individual humans in
the systems it creates.
Terry Winograd was one of the first to see the two extremes clearly and to
consider their consequences. As a graduate student at MIT in the 1960s,
Winograd studied human language in order to build a software robot that was
capable of interacting with humans in conversation. During the 1980s, he
was part of a small group of AI researchers who engaged in seminars at
Berkeley with the philosophers Hubert Dreyfus and John Searle. The
philosophers persuaded Winograd that there were real limits to the
capabilities of intelligent machines. In part because of his changing
views, he left the field of artificial intelligence.
A decade later, as the faculty adviser for Google cofounder Larry Page,
Winograd counseled the young graduate student to focus on Web search rather
than more far-fetched technologies. Page’s original PageRank algorithm, the
heart of Google’s search engine, can perhaps be seen as the most powerful
example of human augmentation in history. The algorithm systematically
collected human decisions about the value of information and pooled those
decisions to prioritize search results. Although some criticized the
process for siphoning intellectual labor from vast numbers of unwitting
humans, the algorithm established an unstated social contract: Google mined
the wealth of human knowledge and returned it in searchable form to
society, while reserving for itself the right to monetize the results.
Since it established its search box as the world’s most powerful
information monopoly, Google has yo-yoed between IA and AI applications and
services. The ill-fated Google Glass was intended as a
“reality-augmentation system,” while the company’s driverless-car project
represents a pure AI — replacing human agency and intelligence with a

system taught itself to recognize cats — perhaps not surprising, given the
overabundance of cat videos on YouTube — with a mechanism that the
scientists described as a cybernetic cousin to what takes place in the
brain’s visual cortex. The experiment was made possible by Google’s immense
computing resources, which allowed researchers to turn loose a cluster of
16,000 processors on the problem — though that number still, of course,
represented a tiny fraction of the billions of neurons in a human brain, a
huge portion of which are devoted to vision.
peculation about whether Google is on the trail of a genuine artificial
brain has become increasingly rampant. There is certainly no question that
a growing group of Silicon Valley engineers and scientists believe
themselves to be closing in on “strong” AI — the creation of a self-aware
machine with human or greater intelligence.
Whether or not this goal is ever achieved, it is becoming increasingly
possible — and “rational” — to design humans out of systems for both
performance and cost reasons. In manufacturing, where robots can directly
replace human labor, the impact of artificial intelligence will be easily
visible. In other cases the direct effects will be more difficult to
discern. Winston Churchill said, “We shape our buildings, and afterwards
our buildings shape us.” Today our computational systems have become
immense edifices that define the way we interact with our society.
In Silicon Valley it is fashionable to celebrate this development, a trend
that is most clearly visible in organizations like the Singularity
Institute and in books like Kevin Kelly’s *What Technology Wants* (2010).
In an earlier book, *Out of Control* (1994), Kelly came down firmly on the
side of the machines:
The problem with our robots today is that we don’t respect them. They are
stuck in factories without windows, doing jobs that humans don’t want to
do. We take machines as slaves, but they are not that. That’s what Marvin
Minsky, the mathematician who pioneered artificial intelligence, tells
anyone who will listen. Minsky goes all the way as an advocate for
downloading human intelligence into a computer. Doug Engelbart, on the
other hand, is the legendary guy who invented word processing, the mouse,
and hypermedia, and who is an advocate for computers-for-the-people. When
the two gurus met at MIT in the 1950s, they are reputed to have had the
following conversation:
minsky: We’re going to make machines intelligent. We are going to make them
engelbart: You’re going to do all that for the machines? What are you going
to do for the people?
This story is usually told by engineers working to make computers more
friendly, more humane, more people centered. But I’m squarely on Minsky’s
side — on the side of the made. People will survive. We’ll train our
machines to serve us. But what are we going to do for the machines?
But to say that people will “survive” understates the possible
consequences: Minsky is said to have responded to a question about the
significance of the arrival of artificial intelligence by saying, “If we’re
lucky, they’ll keep us as pets.”
Until recently, the artificial-intelligence community has largely chosen to
ignore the ethics of systems that they consider merely powerful tools. When
I asked one engineer who is building next-generation robots about the
impact of automation on people, he told me, “You can’t think about that;
you just have to decide that you are going to do the best you can to
improve the world for humanity as a whole.”
AI and machine-learning algorithms have already led to transformative
applications in areas as diverse as science, manufacturing, and
entertainment. Machine vision and pattern recognition have been essential
to improving quality in semiconductor design. Drug-discovery algorithms
have systematized the creation of new pharmaceuticals. The same
breakthroughs have also brought us increased government surveillance and
social-media companies whose business model depends on invading privacy for
Optimists hope that the potential abuses of our computer systems will be
minimized if the application of artificial intelligence, genetic
engineering, and robotics remains focused on humans rather than algorithms.
But the tech industry has not had a track record that speaks to moral
enlightenment. It would be truly remarkable if a Silicon Valley company
rejected a profitable technology for ethical reasons. Today, decisions
about implementing technology are made largely on the basis of
profitability and efficiency. What is needed is a new moral calculus.

good and bad things and sometimes what they do that is considered bad ends

The amount of libertarians on the list and not to generalize but racist
libertarians also ... the history of the list reflects
If a white guy is murdered by the state > problem - if a brown guy is
murdered by the state they sing hallelujah
Libertarians are a strange breed - hey libertarians anti-federal government
includes anti-mass murder by the federal government even if the people have
brown skin and don’t talk like you

Transition is a false dichotomy
Paper Money was invented in China and they soon realized it could be faked
and banned it
Life is a build
The problem with bitcoin and blockchain is that the government can become
that also but we cannot let that deter the process
We build a new structure as they are taking on our old structure
Everything is always at play not in stasis
Anarchist rule ????? Wtvf anarchy is not about ruling and it’s so fucked up
