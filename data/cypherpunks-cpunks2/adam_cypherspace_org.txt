Apparently the UK is worse than the US even - less pretense about not spying
on their own subjects, less legal restrictions (to the extent the NSA and
their nominal oversight even respected the restrictions, which clearly they
did not much respect and subverted with clear internal complaints of the
oversight to the extent that the info was disclosed to them.).
You are her majesty's subject not a citizen, and the royal family hasnt
exercised their powers nor even expressed displeasure such is the etiquette
in a century.  The best you've got is the house of lords, however even their
powers have been weakened and dilluted by politically appointed peers by
parliament, which in my view was two steps backwards; at least the
hereditary peers were a break on change, are typically wealthy people who
dont want the politicians to screw up the country and to some extent have
more aligned interests with the people than policitians who typically have
no actual views, just play to opinion with no regard for the direction their
actions push civil society and democracy.
It may well be that for most westerners the best you could do is use a
russian or chinese internet proxy for internet, voice SIP, video chat/IM
etc.  The chinese are interesting in having their own source of backdoors
(electronics manufacturing) possibly rivaling the US software and key
backdoors.  They may have a state level interest and competence to find and
eliminate US originated backdoors.  Similarly for russia.

Without getting into the rights and wrongs of drugs policy, and the case, I
suspect the silk road shutdown is good for bitcoin because it shows that
even if bitcoin were very anonymous (which its not due to being a public
ledger system), people are not completely immune from tracing even aside
from that if they become a big enough target, and it is easy enough to slip
up on security in operating a service.
(Surely the NSA could've figured it out anyway with their Utah datacenter
full of global internet traffic tracking info if anyone cared enough to get
the clout to demand it from them, and from recent news its stated they will
give evidence of crime to law enforcement if they find it as part of foreign
national security activities.  Whether they take requests to go trace things
from law enforcement is a different question - seemingly not hinted
in the Snowden revelations.  But apparently they're not beyond covering up
the source with fake cover stories of how they found the info even to
Also I read somewhere that silk road was using an offchain payment (not
strictly bitcoin but bitcoin converted into some silk road operated server. maybe its described somewhere for people who dont have ToR running, perhaps
it was a chaumian token server?).
Well not so fast there, without slip by operator being reported, that guy in
Ireland operating a ToR focussed mini-ISP got identified, and/or his clients
did and it spilled over on to him, or whatever happened.  (That one based on
some browser bug and jscript attack inserted by law enforcement somehow). High grade security is not for the careless - need to follow advise, eg ToR

@_subject: Pen register request used to force disclosure of SSL private 
[Man there's a lot of names from the old days on this list.  Good to hear
from you Lance :-]
I think the take-away from this issue is CAs should issue certifictes on
keys used for signing only.  Say its a DSA, or ECDSA which is a damn good
choice because it is not even directly possible to encrypt with it (*), and
the key usage will be marked sign only, so there is no argument about its
Then we disable any non-forward-secret ciphersuites (and forward secret
ciphersuites are not coincidentally the only ciphersuites that work with a
signing only server key).  Then the only plausible reason to demand the
signing key is to perform a MITM not to access "encrypted data".
Firstly MITM is more work, and secondly theyd at that point just as well
play nicely and ask the operator with a subpoena to hand over some info
inside the SSL stream if there's anything useful in there.
In some countries there are explicit legal protections for signature only
keys.  At best they subpoena could ask the operator to record the session
keys via the SSL web server, however that feature is not present as far as I
I also think the weak point with lavabit was probably the in-mail and
out-mail, as with silentcircle, and I presume the reason silent circle
disabled email (though they could have secured internal sc-sc mail using eg
the same end2end secure messaging architcture they use for messaging).
A further weak point of lavabit as I understand it is it was actually taking
the password to the server!!  So the user private key was in the server ram
temporarily.  Which is complete misdesign and makes you start to question
Snowden's crypto tradecraft which up to that point was looking pretty damn
strong from the news reports.
Anyway signature only keys and forward-secrecy FTW already.
About software updates, I think we've reached the point of multiple
independent public interest code review bodies with signing authority
together with the software vendor.  The other thing with opensource it can
be forked if the main vendor goes wrong or is coerced.  You see this kind of
reasoning with bitcoin foundation etc as its probably the highest open
software assurance level on the planet protecting > $1bn in bearer bitcoin
value :)
The only possible exception to the coerced code change might be the hushmail
thing thogh I am kind of fuzzy about what exactly did happen.  There were
two versions, one like lavabit (server has key temporarily) and one real
end2end as I recall and one version of the story is it was the non-end2end
one that got the user info info subpoenaed.
(*) Yes yes I know you could abuse DSA public key for another discrete
encryption log algorithm, however such practice is considered risky to reuse
an asymmetric key for two different algorithms in case there is a way to use
one as an oracle to attack the other.

@_subject: how to use Tor securely (Re: Silk Road founder arrested ...) 
But the jscript malware was installed via remote compromise onto the Tor
hidden web server.  Being behind Tor does not particularly add any
protection to your server, in terms of remote hacking.  Probably static
content is safer in general even if it doesnt make flashy cursor hover boxes
and client-side form pre-validation.  Ie instal and turn on noscript - 99%
of jscript is of no particular use other than making your browser blink and
show animated ads ;)
Ideally you need Tor to be in a routing box, not your computer so that there
is no way for your computer to connect to the non Tor network, so your
computer doesnt even know its physical IP and has no power to disclose it.
Or simulate that setup in software you need Tor on the main machine, and a
VM that has access to and knowledge only of Tor network for connectivity. Do not put ANY identifying information inside the vm.  That rules out vmware
because they leak in your disk serial number as a result of a microsoft law
suit.  (Microsoft accused them of making it easy for people to share windows
serial numbers, because the "is this the same machine" calculation based on
various HW serial numbers always comes up with the same answer in a virtual
machine at that level.) Similarly the VM must not know your physical network
card MAC addresses etc.
Thats the way to do it properly on the client side.  There are Tor focused
distros that let you boot into Tor only OS.  For my taste the Tor connection
and code and physical device identifiers (physical MAC addr, HD serial etc)
should be OUTSIDE of a VM and all client software should be inside the VM. The VM should be open so you know they are not leaking physical MAC
addr/serial into the the client in the name of copy-protection.  (It was
microsoft's fault, not vmware).

sanctioned at high levels and carried out by a complicit justice system. The perpetrators in NSA, government and justice system should receive long

Seems to me if people care about anonymous publication security and
robustness they need static content, distributed, encrypted and integrity
protected.  eg like say tahoeLAFS over Tor or something like that.  Of
course not as jscript, form, click etc but thats just asking to be hacked
As I recall Zooko mentioned you can actually do that - back a web server in
LAFS, then the webserver is nothing but a read-only consumer of LAFS data.
Presumably someone can figure out how to route encrypted, authenticated
change sets or form submussions back to the underlying LAFS over Tor.

@_subject: legal game-theory, case for smart-contracts & snow crash (Re: 
I think maybe you are neglecting game theory for the accused, its hard to
incentivize people to act in their collective interests, when they are
thinking of their own future freedom and lost earning capacity.  I imagine
you even have researched the statistics for this, but to summarise the game
theory scenario: plea bargaining clearly results in less accurate justice
(more innocent people do jail time), but has the real-politic benefit of
reducing the cost of implementing justice.  The usual pattern (made up
average numbers) is accept the plea do a discounted (lower than sentencing
guideline) 3 years, reject the plea, the prosecution will make less
reasonable/inflated charges (higher than sentencing guidelines, based on
more tenuous/unlikey to be provable charges) threatening a scary 30 years,
which in reality will be moderated down by a judge if the accused has the
money for a decent lawyer to 5 years, if they lose, or 0 years if they win;
if they are relying on an overworked, less capable public defender because
they dont have the money to buy proper representation, their chances of
winning are lower, and if they lose their post-trial sentencing will be
higher at 10 years.
Now law is a remarkably imprecise subject, especially when muddied with some
not-so-scrupulous and politically motivated prosecutors, police entrapment,
police bias (push for conviction based on opinion/bias, but statements given
disproportionate weight by a system that believes it's officers over the
public).  (Prosecutors and police are politically motivated because their
career depends on conviction rates, headlines).  The system seems to largely
ignore or not give adequate weight to investigating significant
prosecutorial abuse or police bias.  Prosecutorial abuse has to be strongly
proven, and the perpetrators are career ambitiuous, and legally qualified so
know the grey areas they can exploit where the abuse will be unprovable even
when it is very rarely alleged, or actually prosecuted.  Like police they
have the benefit of the doubt, in a judicial system that favors its own
officers, and so they are defacto largely immune from sanction from even
significant systemic abuse, unless stupid enough to be caught red handed
with with a smoking gun.  Which is to say even if you have millions to your
name for the most capable legal defense, and completely innocent with
reasonable but not iron clad alibi, its still subject to a high degree of
randomness depending on political motivations surrounding.
So therefore people will not fully follow game theory of going for the
lowest expected sentencing.  Ie if p is probabity of winning, and the
numbers above: then its 3 vs expected (p*0+(1-p)*5) so even p=2.5 its 2.5
expected vs 3, so if that was an investment you'd say good lets do it.  But
if its choice between 3years and no more stress, vs legal defense cost and
years of stress followed by 5 years if you're unlucky.  The dillema still
holds if the odds p=0.75 and you have lots of money I suspect sadly that
thats about as high as p gets for many areas of law.  You also have to
factor in the loss of income (at the average income for prisoners) into the
equation, and a premium because people would sooner earn less and have their
You cant reform the system via kickstart fund and incentivize people to not
accept pleas, well not at $5k anyway, because they'd need compensation for
lost earnings and a huge loss of liberty premium if they lose, a stress
premium for going to trial, and expenses for high quality legal defense. Those figures may no longer make game theory economic sense for society,
though I do think the centuries old principle that its more important for
one innocent party to go free than 100 guilty to be imprisoned is not
properly incorporated into the current system as plea bargaining removes
most of that intended objective.
Even with best attempts at fairness and balance from police, prosecutor and
judge (and there are genuine public spirited ethical people in some of those
roles, who would ignore the perverse career motivations on principle, so it
probably happens some of the time), the outcome STILL has an unfair plea
imbalance and STILL high randomness.  Its an imperfect system even under the
most favorable conditions.
I think the solution is to politically vote to arbitrarily cap the
incarceration rate to 10,000/annum; the justice system is not allowed to go
over that limit by law.  They will then focus on cases where they think the
incarceration is of most value to society (eg of making the public safer by
taking a violent criminal off the streets).  Maybe the cap should be
adjusted based on false conviction rates, if the false conviction rate
increases, the cap decreases.  Independent review of potential prosecutor
abuses should be increased.  Also the system should be restructured to
remove the career/political motivation for prosecutors to achieve high
conviction rates.  Their conviction rate should include a heavy mallus for a
false conviction, so they strive to avoid convicting innocent people, and
the system should somehow be adjusted to be less adversarial and to remove
sentencing penalties for going to trial.  eg Maybe the trial sentencing
level and charges should be set by an independent neutral body, not the
prosecutor, with the objective of keeping the trial and plea sentencing the
same.  Maybe simpler bargaining should be made illegal.
Another specific problem in the US is its a one dollar one vote system, and
operating privatized prisons is a high profit business.  The prison
operators votes therefore likely outweigh the proportion of the public that
is aware of the system problems or care enough to vote about it.  I believe
other eg european justice systems are in fact less prone to these issues. So another solution is to vote with your feet.
Basically in such a system you want to avoid even interacting with the legal
system or justice system, period.  Even volutarily interacting as a random
by-stander is unfortunately likely to be net loss to your finances or even
freedoms.  Even to complain publicly about the defects of the system is
probably risky once you have interacted with them.  Which is ridiculous but
thats the reality.
And finally some of the laws on the books are ridiculous on their face in
the opinions of the accused's peers.  eg computer abuse act which sees Weev
in jail and such like stories, and the sentencing guidelines are also often
ridiculous and non-proportional eg the sentencing threats to Swartz for what
was probably not even a copyright crime (going on the theory from his
previous activism pattern that he was aiming to republish the subset of
articles that were public domain).  His trial sentencing threat was above a
1st degree homicide with iron clad evidence, something's got to be wrong
with that.  The sentencing board are failing in their task.  Something
should also be done to restrict scope for judicial vengence also - Swartz
made a mockery of a stupid law, with his previous popularly supported
activism stunt, and so prosecutors were out to get him.
Also legal systems generally seem to lag 50-200 years behind the opinions of
the public Some jurisdictions are better than others, but the system of case
law mixed with precedent creates a built in brake on legal theory evolution. Out of touch with reality and public opinion prosecutors, judges and
sentencing another issue.  Probably law should be restricted to 1MByte of
ascii text and any law not approved by 90% referendum (1 person one vote,
not 1 dollar one vote) struck off automatically every year.
This state of significantly imperfect, and hard to reform, high cost legal
system issue is why smart-contracts look so attractive.  Its not even
obvious how to improve the legal systems and they evolve slowly and resist
experimental change.  Mathematical aprior enforcement, deference to mutually
agreed competing impartial arbitrators for dispute.  Pseudonymous
smart-contracting parties FTW.  Of course it doesnt work for in-person
crimes, except in a "Snow Crash" sense (cometing legal systems/governments
in the same physical space) but a justice system that leant heavily on
smart-contracts and refused as a principle to revise contracts where both
parties received competent legal advice, nor overturn arbitrator decisions,
would be a step forward for society.

Great article, good to see bitcoin is at this stage less influenced by news
flow and transaction volume of silk road like activities.  (Silk Road while
interesting to proponents of agoric defacto legal reform by weakening
enforceability of drug laws, which it seems was DPR/Ulbricht was a proponent
of, the strong short-term success might have been hazardous to bitcoin
itself.  And I think doesnt really rely on bitcoin anyway as there are in
many countries cash pre-paid credit-cards and similar types of systems.)
Its a curious effect that part of bitcoins bootstrap to non-toy price, may
have been accelerated by silk road itself historically.  I suppose its not a
unique situation that criminal privacy or non-criminal but privacy sensitive
business areas (eg online porn) are innovators in adopting new technolgy
with some media reputation for privacy.
I am not sure bitcoin is particularly anonymous given the fact exchange
interactions are covered by AML/KYC and all payments publicly logged in the
clear for anyone to see, and that mixing attempts have been shown to be weak
and of questionable effectiveness by statisticians and data analysts
(complete with pretty graphs), and that most clients have no automated coin
control or sub-wallet feature.  There maybe more conventional higher
anonymity systems like perhaps pre-paid credit cards, phone cards and such
things which can actualy be bought for paper cash, and sometimes deposited
electronically (I'm sure criminals and money laundering experts have a
better understanding of which systems provide anonymity, those were just off
the top of head non-bitcoin, non-cash, payment anonymity examples.  An
envelope of cash in the mail probably works too though I think that is
technical illegal to do even with nominal amounts in some countries).  I'm
quite sure the criminal options at all levels of scale for payment remote
and local involve many more options than bitcoin.  At the higher end it
blends with and solicits and obtains likely knowing service from established
but greedy market players.  You can see the odd dataset, eg HSBC being
caught laundering $880m of drug cartel and even dirtier money.
At least to say its clearly quite dangerous to rely strongly on bitcoin
anonymity for non-technical people, or even technical people without serious
operational attention and careful tool analysis and selection.
A few trivia items from the Silk Road story that seem ambiguous - they
opened a package coming from canada to him with fake ids.  Seemingly he
wanted fake ids for some reason relating to operating the servers (more on
that next).  But why did they open his package?  Bad luck random spot check? Or (more plausible) he bought the fake ids from an ongoing fake-id sting
operation in Canada?  Or alternatively evidence of parallel constructon
disguising NSA Tor backtrace?
About why did he even think he needed fake ids.  Surely you only need a
physical fake id if you are renting servers in person.  But why would you do
that - physical servers you interact with physically are a needless risk no
- if backtraced to IP by Tor attack, the physical connection is made?  (Why
not rent cloud servers?  If renting cloud servers why not pay with prepaid
credit cards bought for cash (or bitcoin)?  If need to send fake ID to rent
cloud servers, surely its lower risk to photoshop them than accept physical
delivery of illegal forged ID to your own address, from a criminal or sting
fake-id service with a copy of your photo!  I dont really get it.

Btw speaking of GCHQ or NSA operating Tor nodes, of course that is
inevitable; and to the extent that they are not perfectly policy aligned a
good thing, and they'll try to do a professional job of securing their own
tor nodes :) eg if you are a chinese dissident maybe you want to use them as
one hop.
You just dont want them controlling to many nodes.  And probably the
Russians, French, Israelis, Chinese etc are all running Tor nodes and even
less mutually cooperative.  What we could really do with is North Korea, and
Iran intelligence services running some also.
I suspect to the extent that they are experiencing limited success you could
imagine its because not ony are some nodes controlled by users, but more
that some are operated by mutually distrustful competing intelligence
The intelligence agency nodes are probably better secured than user nodes,
though some user nodes maybe run by security capable and conscious users. The intelligence agencies however have a budget for and hoard of unpublished
0-days on PC & router operating systems so they have a slight edge.
Also the intelligence agency is not going to cave under legal pressure when
someone from law enforcement comes with threats and demands relating to exit
traffic so they have that advantage too.
It would be better to my mind if they just came out and said yes this is our
node and ran it from their own domain tor.gchq.gov.uk or tor.nsa.gov; then
users could opt to use it.  However I suspect they think no one would use
it, or the people they actively want to use it (who they are trying to
trace) would avoid it.  Could be useful if they used an identified one and a
plausibly hidden one.
Speaking of plausibly hidden I notice there is mention of code word 'NEWTONS
CRADLE' in one of the docs for a GCHQ tor node operation, speculating could
that be some MoD funded student at cambridge in their dorm?  (Quite commnon

afterwards or a government career they took a break from.  A couple of my

No matter, its trivial for establishment to provide perfect cover for node
operation, just run from home address, or persuade ISP/telco to route
traffic via DSL lines identifying IP address range as a IP forwarding proxy. They can do whatever they want, you'd think that more likely, however a
university dorm IP address range would look nice and plausible/credible
also, maybe more so than a DSL address.  Probably a university upstream or
the university IT itself (universities often take defense contracts) could
fake it or operate it under contract with intelligence cleared dual-hat
admin if they cared enough.
I do think it would be very useful if the intelligence agencies running tor
nodes also ran one on their own domain.  Then you could route via one who's
government is overtly supportive of your political cause.  (Doesnt protect
you from backroom information exchange deals and horse trading, which I'm
sure happens even with sworn enemies, but its a start if you are
unintersting enough!) However I expect another reason they dont want to do
that is they dont want to enable people to get stronger privacy period. They have a dual hat, they want internet privacy for their own open source
research, but they selfishly dont want other users to have privacy or gain
any privacy as a side-effect from their own.

I dont think that matters so much as that everyone gets the same hashing
power per dollar.  I had some rant I posted on bitcointalk a while back
(first post there) to say using hashcash-scrypt(1) would be better than
hashcash-SHA256.  (scrypt(1) meaning scrypt(iter=1)).
However there are some valid counter arguments.  SHA256 is simple and easy
to put into silicon blurprints for fabrication replicated multiple times. Even small and seemingly significantly incompetent outfits like butterfly
can just about do it.  Apparently many more are coming online.  Thats good
because you could do it yourself with a modest budget and necessary skills.
If the mining function was really complex it would create eg $10m or $100m
barrier to make a very fast implementation of it, then you hae a real
barrier to entry and a mining centralization problem.
The not so good part is maybe anyone with the skills will get the chips
fabricated and mine them themselves.  So it depends on ready market
availility from multiple competitors, that question is a bit up in the air
at present but there is some evidence of improvements in availability.
Dont think mining is a get rich quick scheme, its very easy to lose money at
this stage, as its an arms race as the fab tech used quickly catches up to
moore's law and then tracks it.
Also the miners dont actually have that much power, all they are doing
really is ordering transactions, so for double-spends you can chose the
first one as valid.  A big company or individual who invested millions and
is earning big bucks from their mining operation probably doesnt want to
commit spending fraud - they'll get sued and lose their investment and
Now if governments or other organized criminals do it, thats a different
issue as there is no useful legal sanction at that level.
They cant really censor tansactions btw even then see the committed-coins
proposal if you want to know how that can be fixed.
Rumor is there are people working on a litecoin ASIC.  Scrypt wasnt even
designed to protect against memory-time tradeoffs, nevermind intentional
large design mm^2/minimum gatecount.  I think if you can make the algorithm
complex and dynamic enough, and yet still efficienty verifiable, (and to
have no progress so its like a lottery) you should be able to push thing so
that whoever does make ASICs is basically making a custom multi-core chip
and competing head on with scientific and graphics GPUs.  AMD & Nvidia are
probably going to win there, or if they dont people will buy your dynamic
agile algorithm miners for programmeable scientific uses.
I see you had the same idea, and I dont think thats so unrealistic.  Making
it fast to verify is a bit harder.  For example include all 16 AES
encryption finalists and 16 SHA3 finalists etc and combine them with data
dependent selection of algorithms.  This will push the gate count up.  Scale
that design process a few times and you're there.  Mix in some memory
(apparently memory is not so fun to put on ASICs, if you need lots of memory
per execution instance (whih is not memory cpu tradeable like scrypt) that
makes it expensive to ASIC.
I do think CPUs are probabl a losing bet should aim for GPUs.  Consider they
are largely not made but better CPUs can be made for mining than are sold. eg consider a 100 core intel atom.  They have the gate-count to do it, its
just people would sooner have a faster single thread (via super-scalar
design & higher clocks, better cache etc) lower core chip.  Most of the
silicon on an i7 is wasted in achieving blistering single thread
performance, that is a complete waste for mining.  (atom 47mil transistors, and
there are multiple 4.7 billion transistor GPUs on the market.) If you
succeeded in wedding an algorithm to the intel instruction set, this is what
would get built.  Its remarkably like a GPU really right?  Lots of cores. Clearly if you strip out the intel backwards compat overhead and add SIMD in
groups of 16 cores, you can get 2048 cores per chip as that is what AMD is
doing in the 7970 (or 7990 two cores!) So be careful what you wish for :)
You can always do better in hardware.
The harder part is to have a relatively fast verification, but thats
probably reasonably doable per scrypt design.

The mining pools have no protocol policy control.  The users have control,
if miners change their policy in a protocol incompatible way, they will have
created an alt-coin which contains only them and their mining profits will
evaporate.  See bitcointalk thread on committed coins I posted in previous
post for a big discussion of this topic.  Its much better than you think,
clearly committed-coins are not implemented, but they could be added
relatively easily.
About privacy features its not actually clear if that was intended or not. Some privacy fig leafs are offered in terms of new addresses automatically
and no names on addresses.  But the entire transaction log is public, clear
text for anyone to see.  If credit card transaction logs were that public
(even with just card numbers and no name) people would be outraged.
It also not clear if more privacy would have helped bitcoin to date - too
much privacy too early could be inviting regulatory problems.  Maybe its
better for users to work on privacy themselves, or others to add privacy
separately, or privacy features to be added to alt-coins etc.
See also zerocoin, and homomorphic encrypted value coins.
btw speaking as someone who was fascinated by blind ecash and spent a lot of
energy on this list years ago trying with others to figure out someway to
make something deployable, I have to say bitcoin is a stellar success.
Ever since the digicash betabucks $1m capped coins went out of existence
with digicash filing bankruptcy, it became clear to everyone that a single
company with a cental server was not going to work.  From there we had a lot
of interest to solve that deployment and design problem: hashcash
distributed mining, Wei Dai's B-money/Nick Szabo's bitgold, Hal Finney's
RPOW and finally bitcoin!  As well numerous other cool stuff like David
Wagner's blind-MAC (implemented by Ben Laurie as Lucre) (chaum patent
workaround), Niels Ferguson's single term offline coins (still blindable but
with more efficient offline fraud tracing than Chaum's cut-and-choose),
Stefan Brands ecash/credentials (multiple attributes, efficient, many
features) as well as Sander & Ta-Schma auditable anonymous ecash.  Its not
clear Satoshi is related to the other ones (other than using hashcash like
B-money/bitgold & RPOW), he seemed to not be aware of B-money (or bitgold),
but he couldnt pontificate for risk of narrowing the potential authorship :)
Then you have open transactions.
Anyway for deployed ecash and privacy tech political environment life has
literally never looked better - NSA shot themselves in the foot, so public
opinion is strongly in their dis-favor, the 9/11 death-pall to security vs
privacy arguments finally get swept away.
So by all means lets see some work on improving privacy, security,
decentralization and scalability of bitcoin via alt-coins or direct protocol

talking on the network releaseing RNG output, and the entropy what little
there is is added incrementally so that you can bruteforce the gap (eg
20-bits of entropy added max in one lump) then you can infer what the new
RNG state is.  If the rate of entropy addition is low enough and the
computer too chatty with RNG outputs over the network (eg maybe it gives you
some in TCP sequence numbers or on demand just by hitting it on various
ports) you can then retain knowledge of its state perpetually.

I think the take-away from this issue is CAs should issue certifictes on

the key usage will be marked sign only, so there is no argument about its
Then we disable any non-forward-secret ciphersuites (and forward secret
ciphersuites are not coincidentally the only ciphersuites that work with a

Firstly MITM is more work, and secondly theyd at that point just as well
play nicely and ask the operator with a subpoena to hand over some info
inside the SSL stream if there's anything useful in there.
In some countries there are explicit legal protections for signature only
keys.  At best they subpoena could ask the operator to record the session

I also think the weak point with lavabit was probably the in-mail and
out-mail, as with silentcircle, and I presume the reason silent circle
disabled email (though they could have secured internal sc-sc mail using eg
the same end2end secure messaging architcture they use for messaging).
A further weak point of lavabit as I understand it is it was actually taking
the password to the server!!  So the user private key was in the server ram
temporarily.  Which is complete misdesign and makes you start to question
Snowden's crypto tradecraft which up to that point was looking pretty damn
strong from the news reports.
Anyway signature only keys and forward-secrecy FTW already.
About software updates, I think we've reached the point of multiple
independent public interest code review bodies with signing authority
together with the software vendor.  The other thing with opensource it can
be forked if the main vendor goes wrong or is coerced.  You see this kind of
reasoning with bitcoin foundation etc as its probably the highest open
software assurance level on the planet protecting > $1bn in bearer bitcoin

The only possible exception to the coerced code change might be the hushmail
thing thogh I am kind of fuzzy about what exactly did happen.  There were
two versions, one like lavabit (server has key temporarily) and one real
end2end as I recall and one version of the story is it was the non-end2end

an asymmetric key for two different algorithms in case there is a way to use
one as an oracle to attack the other.

@_subject: how to use Tor securely (Re: Silk Road founder arrested ...) 
But the jscript malware was installed via remote compromise onto the Tor
hidden web server.  Being behind Tor does not particularly add any
protection to your server, in terms of remote hacking.  Probably static
content is safer in general even if it doesnt make flashy cursor hover boxes
and client-side form pre-validation.  Ie instal and turn on noscript - 99%
of jscript is of no particular use other than making your browser blink and
show animated ads ;)
Ideally you need Tor to be in a routing box, not your computer so that there
is no way for your computer to connect to the non Tor network, so your
computer doesnt even know its physical IP and has no power to disclose it.
Or simulate that setup in software you need Tor on the main machine, and a
VM that has access to and knowledge only of Tor network for connectivity. Do not put ANY identifying information inside the vm.  That rules out vmware
because they leak in your disk serial number as a result of a microsoft law
suit.  (Microsoft accused them of making it easy for people to share windows
serial numbers, because the "is this the same machine" calculation based on
various HW serial numbers always comes up with the same answer in a virtual
machine at that level.) Similarly the VM must not know your physical network
card MAC addresses etc.
Thats the way to do it properly on the client side.  There are Tor focused
distros that let you boot into Tor only OS.  For my taste the Tor connection
and code and physical device identifiers (physical MAC addr, HD serial etc)
should be OUTSIDE of a VM and all client software should be inside the VM. The VM should be open so you know they are not leaking physical MAC
addr/serial into the the client in the name of copy-protection.  (It was
microsoft's fault, not vmware).

@_subject: legal game-theory, case for smart-contracts & snow crash (Re: 
I think maybe you are neglecting game theory for the accused, its hard to
incentivize people to act in their collective interests, when they are
thinking of their own future freedom and lost earning capacity.  I imagine
you even have researched the statistics for this, but to summarise the game
theory scenario: plea bargaining clearly results in less accurate justice
(more innocent people do jail time), but has the real-politic benefit of
reducing the cost of implementing justice.  The usual pattern (made up
average numbers) is accept the plea do a discounted (lower than sentencing
guideline) 3 years, reject the plea, the prosecution will make less
reasonable/inflated charges (higher than sentencing guidelines, based on
more tenuous/unlikey to be provable charges) threatening a scary 30 years,
which in reality will be moderated down by a judge if the accused has the
money for a decent lawyer to 5 years, if they lose, or 0 years if they win;
if they are relying on an overworked, less capable public defender because
they dont have the money to buy proper representation, their chances of
winning are lower, and if they lose their post-trial sentencing will be
higher at 10 years.
Now law is a remarkably imprecise subject, especially when muddied with some
not-so-scrupulous and politically motivated prosecutors, police entrapment,
police bias (push for conviction based on opinion/bias, but statements given
disproportionate weight by a system that believes it's officers over the
public).  (Prosecutors and police are politically motivated because their
career depends on conviction rates, headlines).  The system seems to largely
ignore or not give adequate weight to investigating significant
prosecutorial abuse or police bias.  Prosecutorial abuse has to be strongly
proven, and the perpetrators are career ambitiuous, and legally qualified so
know the grey areas they can exploit where the abuse will be unprovable even
when it is very rarely alleged, or actually prosecuted.  Like police they
have the benefit of the doubt, in a judicial system that favors its own
officers, and so they are defacto largely immune from sanction from even
significant systemic abuse, unless stupid enough to be caught red handed
with with a smoking gun.  Which is to say even if you have millions to your
name for the most capable legal defense, and completely innocent with
reasonable but not iron clad alibi, its still subject to a high degree of
randomness depending on political motivations surrounding.
So therefore people will not fully follow game theory of going for the
lowest expected sentencing.  Ie if p is probabity of winning, and the
numbers above: then its 3 vs expected (p*0+(1-p)*5) so even p=2.5 its 2.5
expected vs 3, so if that was an investment you'd say good lets do it.  But
if its choice between 3years and no more stress, vs legal defense cost and
years of stress followed by 5 years if you're unlucky.  The dillema still
holds if the odds p=0.75 and you have lots of money I suspect sadly that
thats about as high as p gets for many areas of law.  You also have to
factor in the loss of income (at the average income for prisoners) into the
equation, and a premium because people would sooner earn less and have their
You cant reform the system via kickstart fund and incentivize people to not
accept pleas, well not at $5k anyway, because they'd need compensation for
lost earnings and a huge loss of liberty premium if they lose, a stress
premium for going to trial, and expenses for high quality legal defense. Those figures may no longer make game theory economic sense for society,
though I do think the centuries old principle that its more important for
one innocent party to go free than 100 guilty to be imprisoned is not
properly incorporated into the current system as plea bargaining removes
most of that intended objective.
Even with best attempts at fairness and balance from police, prosecutor and
judge (and there are genuine public spirited ethical people in some of those
roles, who would ignore the perverse career motivations on principle, so it
probably happens some of the time), the outcome STILL has an unfair plea
imbalance and STILL high randomness.  Its an imperfect system even under the
most favorable conditions.
I think the solution is to politically vote to arbitrarily cap the
incarceration rate to 10,000/annum; the justice system is not allowed to go
over that limit by law.  They will then focus on cases where they think the
incarceration is of most value to society (eg of making the public safer by
taking a violent criminal off the streets).  Maybe the cap should be
adjusted based on false conviction rates, if the false conviction rate
increases, the cap decreases.  Independent review of potential prosecutor
abuses should be increased.  Also the system should be restructured to
remove the career/political motivation for prosecutors to achieve high
conviction rates.  Their conviction rate should include a heavy mallus for a
false conviction, so they strive to avoid convicting innocent people, and
the system should somehow be adjusted to be less adversarial and to remove
sentencing penalties for going to trial.  eg Maybe the trial sentencing
level and charges should be set by an independent neutral body, not the
prosecutor, with the objective of keeping the trial and plea sentencing the
same.  Maybe simpler bargaining should be made illegal.
Another specific problem in the US is its a one dollar one vote system, and
operating privatized prisons is a high profit business.  The prison
operators votes therefore likely outweigh the proportion of the public that
is aware of the system problems or care enough to vote about it.  I believe
other eg european justice systems are in fact less prone to these issues. So another solution is to vote with your feet.
Basically in such a system you want to avoid even interacting with the legal
system or justice system, period.  Even volutarily interacting as a random
by-stander is unfortunately likely to be net loss to your finances or even
freedoms.  Even to complain publicly about the defects of the system is
probably risky once you have interacted with them.  Which is ridiculous but
thats the reality.
And finally some of the laws on the books are ridiculous on their face in
the opinions of the accused's peers.  eg computer abuse act which sees Weev
in jail and such like stories, and the sentencing guidelines are also often
ridiculous and non-proportional eg the sentencing threats to Swartz for what
was probably not even a copyright crime (going on the theory from his
previous activism pattern that he was aiming to republish the subset of
articles that were public domain).  His trial sentencing threat was above a
1st degree homicide with iron clad evidence, something's got to be wrong
with that.  The sentencing board are failing in their task.  Something
should also be done to restrict scope for judicial vengence also - Swartz
made a mockery of a stupid law, with his previous popularly supported
activism stunt, and so prosecutors were out to get him.
Also legal systems generally seem to lag 50-200 years behind the opinions of
the public Some jurisdictions are better than others, but the system of case
law mixed with precedent creates a built in brake on legal theory evolution. Out of touch with reality and public opinion prosecutors, judges and
sentencing another issue.  Probably law should be restricted to 1MByte of
ascii text and any law not approved by 90% referendum (1 person one vote,
not 1 dollar one vote) struck off automatically every year.
This state of significantly imperfect, and hard to reform, high cost legal
system issue is why smart-contracts look so attractive.  Its not even
obvious how to improve the legal systems and they evolve slowly and resist
experimental change.  Mathematical aprior enforcement, deference to mutually
agreed competing impartial arbitrators for dispute.  Pseudonymous
smart-contracting parties FTW.  Of course it doesnt work for in-person
crimes, except in a "Snow Crash" sense (cometing legal systems/governments
in the same physical space) but a justice system that leant heavily on
smart-contracts and refused as a principle to revise contracts where both
parties received competent legal advice, nor overturn arbitrator decisions,
would be a step forward for society.

Great article, good to see bitcoin is at this stage less influenced by news
flow and transaction volume of silk road like activities.  (Silk Road while
interesting to proponents of agoric defacto legal reform by weakening
enforceability of drug laws, which it seems was DPR/Ulbricht was a proponent
of, the strong short-term success might have been hazardous to bitcoin
itself.  And I think doesnt really rely on bitcoin anyway as there are in
many countries cash pre-paid credit-cards and similar types of systems.)
Its a curious effect that part of bitcoins bootstrap to non-toy price, may
have been accelerated by silk road itself historically.  I suppose its not a
unique situation that criminal privacy or non-criminal but privacy sensitive
business areas (eg online porn) are innovators in adopting new technolgy
with some media reputation for privacy.
I am not sure bitcoin is particularly anonymous given the fact exchange
interactions are covered by AML/KYC and all payments publicly logged in the
clear for anyone to see, and that mixing attempts have been shown to be weak
and of questionable effectiveness by statisticians and data analysts
(complete with pretty graphs), and that most clients have no automated coin
control or sub-wallet feature.  There maybe more conventional higher
anonymity systems like perhaps pre-paid credit cards, phone cards and such
things which can actualy be bought for paper cash, and sometimes deposited
electronically (I'm sure criminals and money laundering experts have a
better understanding of which systems provide anonymity, those were just off
the top of head non-bitcoin, non-cash, payment anonymity examples.  An
envelope of cash in the mail probably works too though I think that is
technical illegal to do even with nominal amounts in some countries).  I'm
quite sure the criminal options at all levels of scale for payment remote
and local involve many more options than bitcoin.  At the higher end it
blends with and solicits and obtains likely knowing service from established
but greedy market players.  You can see the odd dataset, eg HSBC being
caught laundering $880m of drug cartel and even dirtier money.
At least to say its clearly quite dangerous to rely strongly on bitcoin
anonymity for non-technical people, or even technical people without serious
operational attention and careful tool analysis and selection.
A few trivia items from the Silk Road story that seem ambiguous - they
opened a package coming from canada to him with fake ids.  Seemingly he
wanted fake ids for some reason relating to operating the servers (more on
that next).  But why did they open his package?  Bad luck random spot check? Or (more plausible) he bought the fake ids from an ongoing fake-id sting
operation in Canada?  Or alternatively evidence of parallel constructon
disguising NSA Tor backtrace?
About why did he even think he needed fake ids.  Surely you only need a
physical fake id if you are renting servers in person.  But why would you do
that - physical servers you interact with physically are a needless risk no
- if backtraced to IP by Tor attack, the physical connection is made?  (Why
not rent cloud servers?  If renting cloud servers why not pay with prepaid
credit cards bought for cash (or bitcoin)?  If need to send fake ID to rent
cloud servers, surely its lower risk to photoshop them than accept physical
delivery of illegal forged ID to your own address, from a criminal or sting
fake-id service with a copy of your photo!  I dont really get it.

Btw speaking of GCHQ or NSA operating Tor nodes, of course that is
inevitable; and to the extent that they are not perfectly policy aligned a
good thing, and they'll try to do a professional job of securing their own
tor nodes :) eg if you are a chinese dissident maybe you want to use them as
one hop.
You just dont want them controlling to many nodes.  And probably the
Russians, French, Israelis, Chinese etc are all running Tor nodes and even
less mutually cooperative.  What we could really do with is North Korea, and
Iran intelligence services running some also.
I suspect to the extent that they are experiencing limited success you could
imagine its because not ony are some nodes controlled by users, but more
that some are operated by mutually distrustful competing intelligence
The intelligence agency nodes are probably better secured than user nodes,
though some user nodes maybe run by security capable and conscious users. The intelligence agencies however have a budget for and hoard of unpublished
0-days on PC & router operating systems so they have a slight edge.
Also the intelligence agency is not going to cave under legal pressure when
someone from law enforcement comes with threats and demands relating to exit
traffic so they have that advantage too.
It would be better to my mind if they just came out and said yes this is our
node and ran it from their own domain tor.gchq.gov.uk or tor.nsa.gov; then
users could opt to use it.  However I suspect they think no one would use
it, or the people they actively want to use it (who they are trying to
trace) would avoid it.  Could be useful if they used an identified one and a
plausibly hidden one.
Speaking of plausibly hidden I notice there is mention of code word 'NEWTONS
CRADLE' in one of the docs for a GCHQ tor node operation, speculating could
that be some MoD funded student at cambridge in their dorm?  (Quite commnon
in the UK for students to be sponsored by a company they will work for
afterwards or a government career they took a break from.  A couple of my
classmates at BSc, University of Exeter (UK) comp sci BSc were openly MoD
No matter, its trivial for establishment to provide perfect cover for node
operation, just run from home address, or persuade ISP/telco to route
traffic via DSL lines identifying IP address range as a IP forwarding proxy. They can do whatever they want, you'd think that more likely, however a
university dorm IP address range would look nice and plausible/credible
also, maybe more so than a DSL address.  Probably a university upstream or
the university IT itself (universities often take defense contracts) could
fake it or operate it under contract with intelligence cleared dual-hat
admin if they cared enough.
I do think it would be very useful if the intelligence agencies running tor
nodes also ran one on their own domain.  Then you could route via one who's
government is overtly supportive of your political cause.  (Doesnt protect
you from backroom information exchange deals and horse trading, which I'm
sure happens even with sworn enemies, but its a start if you are
unintersting enough!) However I expect another reason they dont want to do
that is they dont want to enable people to get stronger privacy period. They have a dual hat, they want internet privacy for their own open source
research, but they selfishly dont want other users to have privacy or gain
any privacy as a side-effect from their own.

I dont think that matters so much as that everyone gets the same hashing
power per dollar.  I had some rant I posted on bitcointalk a while back
(first post there) to say using hashcash-scrypt(1) would be better than
hashcash-SHA256.  (scrypt(1) meaning scrypt(iter=1)).
However there are some valid counter arguments.  SHA256 is simple and easy
to put into silicon blurprints for fabrication replicated multiple times. Even small and seemingly significantly incompetent outfits like butterfly
can just about do it.  Apparently many more are coming online.  Thats good
because you could do it yourself with a modest budget and necessary skills.
If the mining function was really complex it would create eg $10m or $100m
barrier to make a very fast implementation of it, then you hae a real
barrier to entry and a mining centralization problem.
The not so good part is maybe anyone with the skills will get the chips
fabricated and mine them themselves.  So it depends on ready market
availility from multiple competitors, that question is a bit up in the air
at present but there is some evidence of improvements in availability.
Dont think mining is a get rich quick scheme, its very easy to lose money at
this stage, as its an arms race as the fab tech used quickly catches up to
moore's law and then tracks it.
Also the miners dont actually have that much power, all they are doing
really is ordering transactions, so for double-spends you can chose the
first one as valid.  A big company or individual who invested millions and
is earning big bucks from their mining operation probably doesnt want to
commit spending fraud - they'll get sued and lose their investment and
Now if governments or other organized criminals do it, thats a different
issue as there is no useful legal sanction at that level.
They cant really censor tansactions btw even then see the committed-coins
proposal if you want to know how that can be fixed.
Rumor is there are people working on a litecoin ASIC.  Scrypt wasnt even
designed to protect against memory-time tradeoffs, nevermind intentional
large design mm^2/minimum gatecount.  I think if you can make the algorithm
complex and dynamic enough, and yet still efficienty verifiable, (and to
have no progress so its like a lottery) you should be able to push thing so
that whoever does make ASICs is basically making a custom multi-core chip
and competing head on with scientific and graphics GPUs.  AMD & Nvidia are
probably going to win there, or if they dont people will buy your dynamic
agile algorithm miners for programmeable scientific uses.
I see you had the same idea, and I dont think thats so unrealistic.  Making
it fast to verify is a bit harder.  For example include all 16 AES
encryption finalists and 16 SHA3 finalists etc and combine them with data
dependent selection of algorithms.  This will push the gate count up.  Scale
that design process a few times and you're there.  Mix in some memory
(apparently memory is not so fun to put on ASICs, if you need lots of memory
per execution instance (whih is not memory cpu tradeable like scrypt) that
makes it expensive to ASIC.
I do think CPUs are probabl a losing bet should aim for GPUs.  Consider they
are largely not made but better CPUs can be made for mining than are sold. eg consider a 100 core intel atom.  They have the gate-count to do it, its
just people would sooner have a faster single thread (via super-scalar
design & higher clocks, better cache etc) lower core chip.  Most of the
silicon on an i7 is wasted in achieving blistering single thread
performance, that is a complete waste for mining.  (atom 47mil transistors, and
there are multiple 4.7 billion transistor GPUs on the market.) If you
succeeded in wedding an algorithm to the intel instruction set, this is what
would get built.  Its remarkably like a GPU really right?  Lots of cores. Clearly if you strip out the intel backwards compat overhead and add SIMD in
groups of 16 cores, you can get 2048 cores per chip as that is what AMD is
doing in the 7970 (or 7990 two cores!) So be careful what you wish for :)
You can always do better in hardware.
The harder part is to have a relatively fast verification, but thats
probably reasonably doable per scrypt design.

The mining pools have no protocol policy control.  The users have control,
if miners change their policy in a protocol incompatible way, they will have
created an alt-coin which contains only them and their mining profits will
evaporate.  See bitcointalk thread on committed coins I posted in previous
post for a big discussion of this topic.  Its much better than you think,
clearly committed-coins are not implemented, but they could be added
relatively easily.
About privacy features its not actually clear if that was intended or not. Some privacy fig leafs are offered in terms of new addresses automatically
and no names on addresses.  But the entire transaction log is public, clear
text for anyone to see.  If credit card transaction logs were that public
(even with just card numbers and no name) people would be outraged.
It also not clear if more privacy would have helped bitcoin to date - too
much privacy too early could be inviting regulatory problems.  Maybe its
better for users to work on privacy themselves, or others to add privacy
separately, or privacy features to be added to alt-coins etc.
See also zerocoin, and homomorphic encrypted value coins.
btw speaking as someone who was fascinated by blind ecash and spent a lot of
energy on this list years ago trying with others to figure out someway to
make something deployable, I have to say bitcoin is a stellar success.
Ever since the digicash betabucks $1m capped coins went out of existence
with digicash filing bankruptcy, it became clear to everyone that a single
company with a cental server was not going to work.  From there we had a lot
of interest to solve that deployment and design problem: hashcash
distributed mining, Wei Dai's B-money/Nick Szabo's bitgold, Hal Finney's
RPOW and finally bitcoin!  As well numerous other cool stuff like David
Wagner's blind-MAC (implemented by Ben Laurie as Lucre) (chaum patent
workaround), Niels Ferguson's single term offline coins (still blindable but
with more efficient offline fraud tracing than Chaum's cut-and-choose),
Stefan Brands ecash/credentials (multiple attributes, efficient, many
features) as well as Sander & Ta-Schma auditable anonymous ecash.  Its not
clear Satoshi is related to the other ones (other than using hashcash like
B-money/bitgold & RPOW), he seemed to not be aware of B-money (or bitgold),
but he couldnt pontificate for risk of narrowing the potential authorship :)
Then you have open transactions.
Anyway for deployed ecash and privacy tech political environment life has
literally never looked better - NSA shot themselves in the foot, so public
opinion is strongly in their dis-favor, the 9/11 death-pall to security vs

nice things about the way they were added.  For example if you start a

talking on the network releaseing RNG output, and the entropy what little
there is is added incrementally so that you can bruteforce the gap (eg
20-bits of entropy added max in one lump) then you can infer what the new
RNG state is.  If the rate of entropy addition is low enough and the
computer too chatty with RNG outputs over the network (eg maybe it gives you
some in TCP sequence numbers or on demand just by hitting it on various

did and it spilled over on to him, or whatever happened.  (That one based on
some browser bug and jscript attack inserted by law enforcement somehow). High grade security is not for the careless - need to follow advise, eg ToR

[Man there's a lot of names from the old days on this list.  Good to hear
from you Lance :-]
I think the take-away from this issue is CAs should issue certifictes on
keys used for signing only.  Say its a DSA, or ECDSA which is a damn good
choice because it is not even directly possible to encrypt with it (*), and
the key usage will be marked sign only, so there is no argument about its
Then we disable any non-forward-secret ciphersuites (and forward secret
ciphersuites are not coincidentally the only ciphersuites that work with a
signing only server key).  Then the only plausible reason to demand the
signing key is to perform a MITM not to access "encrypted data".
Firstly MITM is more work, and secondly theyd at that point just as well
play nicely and ask the operator with a subpoena to hand over some info
inside the SSL stream if there's anything useful in there.
In some countries there are explicit legal protections for signature only
keys.  At best they subpoena could ask the operator to record the session
keys via the SSL web server, however that feature is not present as far as I
I also think the weak point with lavabit was probably the in-mail and
out-mail, as with silentcircle, and I presume the reason silent circle
disabled email (though they could have secured internal sc-sc mail using eg
the same end2end secure messaging architcture they use for messaging).
A further weak point of lavabit as I understand it is it was actually taking
the password to the server!!  So the user private key was in the server ram
temporarily.  Which is complete misdesign and makes you start to question
Snowden's crypto tradecraft which up to that point was looking pretty damn
strong from the news reports.
Anyway signature only keys and forward-secrecy FTW already.
About software updates, I think we've reached the point of multiple
independent public interest code review bodies with signing authority
together with the software vendor.  The other thing with opensource it can
be forked if the main vendor goes wrong or is coerced.  You see this kind of
reasoning with bitcoin foundation etc as its probably the highest open
software assurance level on the planet protecting > $1bn in bearer bitcoin
value :)
The only possible exception to the coerced code change might be the hushmail
thing thogh I am kind of fuzzy about what exactly did happen.  There were
two versions, one like lavabit (server has key temporarily) and one real
end2end as I recall and one version of the story is it was the non-end2end
one that got the user info info subpoenaed.
(*) Yes yes I know you could abuse DSA public key for another discrete
encryption log algorithm, however such practice is considered risky to reuse
an asymmetric key for two different algorithms in case there is a way to use
one as an oracle to attack the other.

@_subject: how to use Tor securely (Re: Silk Road founder arrested ...) 
But the jscript malware was installed via remote compromise onto the Tor
hidden web server.  Being behind Tor does not particularly add any
protection to your server, in terms of remote hacking.  Probably static
content is safer in general even if it doesnt make flashy cursor hover boxes
and client-side form pre-validation.  Ie instal and turn on noscript - 99%
of jscript is of no particular use other than making your browser blink and
show animated ads ;)
Ideally you need Tor to be in a routing box, not your computer so that there
is no way for your computer to connect to the non Tor network, so your
computer doesnt even know its physical IP and has no power to disclose it.
Or simulate that setup in software you need Tor on the main machine, and a
VM that has access to and knowledge only of Tor network for connectivity. Do not put ANY identifying information inside the vm.  That rules out vmware
because they leak in your disk serial number as a result of a microsoft law
suit.  (Microsoft accused them of making it easy for people to share windows
serial numbers, because the "is this the same machine" calculation based on
various HW serial numbers always comes up with the same answer in a virtual
machine at that level.) Similarly the VM must not know your physical network
card MAC addresses etc.
Thats the way to do it properly on the client side.  There are Tor focused
distros that let you boot into Tor only OS.  For my taste the Tor connection
and code and physical device identifiers (physical MAC addr, HD serial etc)
should be OUTSIDE of a VM and all client software should be inside the VM. The VM should be open so you know they are not leaking physical MAC
addr/serial into the the client in the name of copy-protection.  (It was
microsoft's fault, not vmware).

@_subject: legal game-theory, case for smart-contracts & snow crash (Re: 
I think maybe you are neglecting game theory for the accused, its hard to
incentivize people to act in their collective interests, when they are
thinking of their own future freedom and lost earning capacity.  I imagine
you even have researched the statistics for this, but to summarise the game
theory scenario: plea bargaining clearly results in less accurate justice
(more innocent people do jail time), but has the real-politic benefit of
reducing the cost of implementing justice.  The usual pattern (made up
average numbers) is accept the plea do a discounted (lower than sentencing
guideline) 3 years, reject the plea, the prosecution will make less
reasonable/inflated charges (higher than sentencing guidelines, based on
more tenuous/unlikey to be provable charges) threatening a scary 30 years,
which in reality will be moderated down by a judge if the accused has the
money for a decent lawyer to 5 years, if they lose, or 0 years if they win;
if they are relying on an overworked, less capable public defender because
they dont have the money to buy proper representation, their chances of
winning are lower, and if they lose their post-trial sentencing will be
higher at 10 years.
Now law is a remarkably imprecise subject, especially when muddied with some
not-so-scrupulous and politically motivated prosecutors, police entrapment,
police bias (push for conviction based on opinion/bias, but statements given
disproportionate weight by a system that believes it's officers over the
public).  (Prosecutors and police are politically motivated because their
career depends on conviction rates, headlines).  The system seems to largely
ignore or not give adequate weight to investigating significant
prosecutorial abuse or police bias.  Prosecutorial abuse has to be strongly
proven, and the perpetrators are career ambitiuous, and legally qualified so
know the grey areas they can exploit where the abuse will be unprovable even
when it is very rarely alleged, or actually prosecuted.  Like police they
have the benefit of the doubt, in a judicial system that favors its own
officers, and so they are defacto largely immune from sanction from even
significant systemic abuse, unless stupid enough to be caught red handed
with with a smoking gun.  Which is to say even if you have millions to your
name for the most capable legal defense, and completely innocent with
reasonable but not iron clad alibi, its still subject to a high degree of
randomness depending on political motivations surrounding.
So therefore people will not fully follow game theory of going for the
lowest expected sentencing.  Ie if p is probabity of winning, and the
numbers above: then its 3 vs expected (p*0+(1-p)*5) so even p=2.5 its 2.5
expected vs 3, so if that was an investment you'd say good lets do it.  But
if its choice between 3years and no more stress, vs legal defense cost and
years of stress followed by 5 years if you're unlucky.  The dillema still
holds if the odds p=0.75 and you have lots of money I suspect sadly that
thats about as high as p gets for many areas of law.  You also have to
factor in the loss of income (at the average income for prisoners) into the
equation, and a premium because people would sooner earn less and have their
You cant reform the system via kickstart fund and incentivize people to not
accept pleas, well not at $5k anyway, because they'd need compensation for
lost earnings and a huge loss of liberty premium if they lose, a stress
premium for going to trial, and expenses for high quality legal defense. Those figures may no longer make game theory economic sense for society,
though I do think the centuries old principle that its more important for
one innocent party to go free than 100 guilty to be imprisoned is not
properly incorporated into the current system as plea bargaining removes
most of that intended objective.
Even with best attempts at fairness and balance from police, prosecutor and
judge (and there are genuine public spirited ethical people in some of those
roles, who would ignore the perverse career motivations on principle, so it
probably happens some of the time), the outcome STILL has an unfair plea
imbalance and STILL high randomness.  Its an imperfect system even under the
most favorable conditions.
I think the solution is to politically vote to arbitrarily cap the
incarceration rate to 10,000/annum; the justice system is not allowed to go
over that limit by law.  They will then focus on cases where they think the
incarceration is of most value to society (eg of making the public safer by
taking a violent criminal off the streets).  Maybe the cap should be
adjusted based on false conviction rates, if the false conviction rate
increases, the cap decreases.  Independent review of potential prosecutor
abuses should be increased.  Also the system should be restructured to
remove the career/political motivation for prosecutors to achieve high
conviction rates.  Their conviction rate should include a heavy mallus for a
false conviction, so they strive to avoid convicting innocent people, and
the system should somehow be adjusted to be less adversarial and to remove
sentencing penalties for going to trial.  eg Maybe the trial sentencing
level and charges should be set by an independent neutral body, not the
prosecutor, with the objective of keeping the trial and plea sentencing the
same.  Maybe simpler bargaining should be made illegal.
Another specific problem in the US is its a one dollar one vote system, and
operating privatized prisons is a high profit business.  The prison
operators votes therefore likely outweigh the proportion of the public that
is aware of the system problems or care enough to vote about it.  I believe
other eg european justice systems are in fact less prone to these issues. So another solution is to vote with your feet.
Basically in such a system you want to avoid even interacting with the legal
system or justice system, period.  Even volutarily interacting as a random
by-stander is unfortunately likely to be net loss to your finances or even
freedoms.  Even to complain publicly about the defects of the system is
probably risky once you have interacted with them.  Which is ridiculous but
thats the reality.
And finally some of the laws on the books are ridiculous on their face in
the opinions of the accused's peers.  eg computer abuse act which sees Weev
in jail and such like stories, and the sentencing guidelines are also often
ridiculous and non-proportional eg the sentencing threats to Swartz for what
was probably not even a copyright crime (going on the theory from his
previous activism pattern that he was aiming to republish the subset of
articles that were public domain).  His trial sentencing threat was above a
1st degree homicide with iron clad evidence, something's got to be wrong
with that.  The sentencing board are failing in their task.  Something
should also be done to restrict scope for judicial vengence also - Swartz
made a mockery of a stupid law, with his previous popularly supported
activism stunt, and so prosecutors were out to get him.
Also legal systems generally seem to lag 50-200 years behind the opinions of
the public Some jurisdictions are better than others, but the system of case
law mixed with precedent creates a built in brake on legal theory evolution. Out of touch with reality and public opinion prosecutors, judges and
sentencing another issue.  Probably law should be restricted to 1MByte of
ascii text and any law not approved by 90% referendum (1 person one vote,
not 1 dollar one vote) struck off automatically every year.
This state of significantly imperfect, and hard to reform, high cost legal
system issue is why smart-contracts look so attractive.  Its not even
obvious how to improve the legal systems and they evolve slowly and resist
experimental change.  Mathematical aprior enforcement, deference to mutually
agreed competing impartial arbitrators for dispute.  Pseudonymous
smart-contracting parties FTW.  Of course it doesnt work for in-person
crimes, except in a "Snow Crash" sense (cometing legal systems/governments
in the same physical space) but a justice system that leant heavily on
smart-contracts and refused as a principle to revise contracts where both
parties received competent legal advice, nor overturn arbitrator decisions,
would be a step forward for society.

Great article, good to see bitcoin is at this stage less influenced by news
flow and transaction volume of silk road like activities.  (Silk Road while
interesting to proponents of agoric defacto legal reform by weakening
enforceability of drug laws, which it seems was DPR/Ulbricht was a proponent
of, the strong short-term success might have been hazardous to bitcoin
itself.  And I think doesnt really rely on bitcoin anyway as there are in
many countries cash pre-paid credit-cards and similar types of systems.)
Its a curious effect that part of bitcoins bootstrap to non-toy price, may
have been accelerated by silk road itself historically.  I suppose its not a
unique situation that criminal privacy or non-criminal but privacy sensitive
business areas (eg online porn) are innovators in adopting new technolgy
with some media reputation for privacy.
I am not sure bitcoin is particularly anonymous given the fact exchange
interactions are covered by AML/KYC and all payments publicly logged in the
clear for anyone to see, and that mixing attempts have been shown to be weak
and of questionable effectiveness by statisticians and data analysts
(complete with pretty graphs), and that most clients have no automated coin
control or sub-wallet feature.  There maybe more conventional higher
anonymity systems like perhaps pre-paid credit cards, phone cards and such
things which can actualy be bought for paper cash, and sometimes deposited
electronically (I'm sure criminals and money laundering experts have a
better understanding of which systems provide anonymity, those were just off
the top of head non-bitcoin, non-cash, payment anonymity examples.  An
envelope of cash in the mail probably works too though I think that is
technical illegal to do even with nominal amounts in some countries).  I'm
quite sure the criminal options at all levels of scale for payment remote
and local involve many more options than bitcoin.  At the higher end it
blends with and solicits and obtains likely knowing service from established
but greedy market players.  You can see the odd dataset, eg HSBC being
caught laundering $880m of drug cartel and even dirtier money.
At least to say its clearly quite dangerous to rely strongly on bitcoin
anonymity for non-technical people, or even technical people without serious
operational attention and careful tool analysis and selection.
A few trivia items from the Silk Road story that seem ambiguous - they
opened a package coming from canada to him with fake ids.  Seemingly he
wanted fake ids for some reason relating to operating the servers (more on
that next).  But why did they open his package?  Bad luck random spot check? Or (more plausible) he bought the fake ids from an ongoing fake-id sting
operation in Canada?  Or alternatively evidence of parallel constructon
disguising NSA Tor backtrace?
About why did he even think he needed fake ids.  Surely you only need a
physical fake id if you are renting servers in person.  But why would you do
that - physical servers you interact with physically are a needless risk no
- if backtraced to IP by Tor attack, the physical connection is made?  (Why
not rent cloud servers?  If renting cloud servers why not pay with prepaid
credit cards bought for cash (or bitcoin)?  If need to send fake ID to rent
cloud servers, surely its lower risk to photoshop them than accept physical
delivery of illegal forged ID to your own address, from a criminal or sting
fake-id service with a copy of your photo!  I dont really get it.

Btw speaking of GCHQ or NSA operating Tor nodes, of course that is
inevitable; and to the extent that they are not perfectly policy aligned a
good thing, and they'll try to do a professional job of securing their own
tor nodes :) eg if you are a chinese dissident maybe you want to use them as
one hop.
You just dont want them controlling to many nodes.  And probably the
Russians, French, Israelis, Chinese etc are all running Tor nodes and even
less mutually cooperative.  What we could really do with is North Korea, and
Iran intelligence services running some also.
I suspect to the extent that they are experiencing limited success you could
imagine its because not ony are some nodes controlled by users, but more
that some are operated by mutually distrustful competing intelligence
The intelligence agency nodes are probably better secured than user nodes,
though some user nodes maybe run by security capable and conscious users. The intelligence agencies however have a budget for and hoard of unpublished
0-days on PC & router operating systems so they have a slight edge.
Also the intelligence agency is not going to cave under legal pressure when
someone from law enforcement comes with threats and demands relating to exit
traffic so they have that advantage too.
It would be better to my mind if they just came out and said yes this is our
node and ran it from their own domain tor.gchq.gov.uk or tor.nsa.gov; then
users could opt to use it.  However I suspect they think no one would use
it, or the people they actively want to use it (who they are trying to
trace) would avoid it.  Could be useful if they used an identified one and a
plausibly hidden one.
Speaking of plausibly hidden I notice there is mention of code word 'NEWTONS
CRADLE' in one of the docs for a GCHQ tor node operation, speculating could
that be some MoD funded student at cambridge in their dorm?  (Quite commnon
in the UK for students to be sponsored by a company they will work for
afterwards or a government career they took a break from.  A couple of my
classmates at BSc, University of Exeter (UK) comp sci BSc were openly MoD
No matter, its trivial for establishment to provide perfect cover for node
operation, just run from home address, or persuade ISP/telco to route
traffic via DSL lines identifying IP address range as a IP forwarding proxy. They can do whatever they want, you'd think that more likely, however a
university dorm IP address range would look nice and plausible/credible
also, maybe more so than a DSL address.  Probably a university upstream or
the university IT itself (universities often take defense contracts) could
fake it or operate it under contract with intelligence cleared dual-hat
admin if they cared enough.
I do think it would be very useful if the intelligence agencies running tor
nodes also ran one on their own domain.  Then you could route via one who's
government is overtly supportive of your political cause.  (Doesnt protect
you from backroom information exchange deals and horse trading, which I'm
sure happens even with sworn enemies, but its a start if you are
unintersting enough!) However I expect another reason they dont want to do
that is they dont want to enable people to get stronger privacy period. They have a dual hat, they want internet privacy for their own open source
research, but they selfishly dont want other users to have privacy or gain
any privacy as a side-effect from their own.

I dont think that matters so much as that everyone gets the same hashing
power per dollar.  I had some rant I posted on bitcointalk a while back
(first post there) to say using hashcash-scrypt(1) would be better than
hashcash-SHA256.  (scrypt(1) meaning scrypt(iter=1)).
However there are some valid counter arguments.  SHA256 is simple and easy
to put into silicon blurprints for fabrication replicated multiple times. Even small and seemingly significantly incompetent outfits like butterfly
can just about do it.  Apparently many more are coming online.  Thats good
because you could do it yourself with a modest budget and necessary skills.
If the mining function was really complex it would create eg $10m or $100m
barrier to make a very fast implementation of it, then you hae a real
barrier to entry and a mining centralization problem.
The not so good part is maybe anyone with the skills will get the chips
fabricated and mine them themselves.  So it depends on ready market
availility from multiple competitors, that question is a bit up in the air
at present but there is some evidence of improvements in availability.
Dont think mining is a get rich quick scheme, its very easy to lose money at
this stage, as its an arms race as the fab tech used quickly catches up to
moore's law and then tracks it.
Also the miners dont actually have that much power, all they are doing
really is ordering transactions, so for double-spends you can chose the
first one as valid.  A big company or individual who invested millions and
is earning big bucks from their mining operation probably doesnt want to
commit spending fraud - they'll get sued and lose their investment and
Now if governments or other organized criminals do it, thats a different
issue as there is no useful legal sanction at that level.
They cant really censor tansactions btw even then see the committed-coins
proposal if you want to know how that can be fixed.
Rumor is there are people working on a litecoin ASIC.  Scrypt wasnt even
designed to protect against memory-time tradeoffs, nevermind intentional
large design mm^2/minimum gatecount.  I think if you can make the algorithm
complex and dynamic enough, and yet still efficienty verifiable, (and to
have no progress so its like a lottery) you should be able to push thing so
that whoever does make ASICs is basically making a custom multi-core chip
and competing head on with scientific and graphics GPUs.  AMD & Nvidia are
probably going to win there, or if they dont people will buy your dynamic
agile algorithm miners for programmeable scientific uses.
I see you had the same idea, and I dont think thats so unrealistic.  Making
it fast to verify is a bit harder.  For example include all 16 AES
encryption finalists and 16 SHA3 finalists etc and combine them with data
dependent selection of algorithms.  This will push the gate count up.  Scale
that design process a few times and you're there.  Mix in some memory
(apparently memory is not so fun to put on ASICs, if you need lots of memory
per execution instance (whih is not memory cpu tradeable like scrypt) that
makes it expensive to ASIC.
I do think CPUs are probabl a losing bet should aim for GPUs.  Consider they
are largely not made but better CPUs can be made for mining than are sold. eg consider a 100 core intel atom.  They have the gate-count to do it, its
just people would sooner have a faster single thread (via super-scalar
design & higher clocks, better cache etc) lower core chip.  Most of the
silicon on an i7 is wasted in achieving blistering single thread
performance, that is a complete waste for mining.  (atom 47mil transistors, and
there are multiple 4.7 billion transistor GPUs on the market.) If you
succeeded in wedding an algorithm to the intel instruction set, this is what
would get built.  Its remarkably like a GPU really right?  Lots of cores. Clearly if you strip out the intel backwards compat overhead and add SIMD in
groups of 16 cores, you can get 2048 cores per chip as that is what AMD is
doing in the 7970 (or 7990 two cores!) So be careful what you wish for :)
You can always do better in hardware.
The harder part is to have a relatively fast verification, but thats
probably reasonably doable per scrypt design.

The mining pools have no protocol policy control.  The users have control,
if miners change their policy in a protocol incompatible way, they will have
created an alt-coin which contains only them and their mining profits will
evaporate.  See bitcointalk thread on committed coins I posted in previous

clearly committed-coins are not implemented, but they could be added
relatively easily.
About privacy features its not actually clear if that was intended or not. Some privacy fig leafs are offered in terms of new addresses automatically
and no names on addresses.  But the entire transaction log is public, clear
text for anyone to see.  If credit card transaction logs were that public
(even with just card numbers and no name) people would be outraged.
It also not clear if more privacy would have helped bitcoin to date - too
much privacy too early could be inviting regulatory problems.  Maybe its
better for users to work on privacy themselves, or others to add privacy
separately, or privacy features to be added to alt-coins etc.
See also zerocoin, and homomorphic encrypted value coins.
btw speaking as someone who was fascinated by blind ecash and spent a lot of
energy on this list years ago trying with others to figure out someway to
make something deployable, I have to say bitcoin is a stellar success.
Ever since the digicash betabucks $1m capped coins went out of existence
with digicash filing bankruptcy, it became clear to everyone that a single
company with a cental server was not going to work.  From there we had a lot
of interest to solve that deployment and design problem: hashcash
distributed mining, Wei Dai's B-money/Nick Szabo's bitgold, Hal Finney's
RPOW and finally bitcoin!  As well numerous other cool stuff like David
Wagner's blind-MAC (implemented by Ben Laurie as Lucre) (chaum patent
workaround), Niels Ferguson's single term offline coins (still blindable but
with more efficient offline fraud tracing than Chaum's cut-and-choose),
Stefan Brands ecash/credentials (multiple attributes, efficient, many
features) as well as Sander & Ta-Schma auditable anonymous ecash.  Its not
clear Satoshi is related to the other ones (other than using hashcash like
B-money/bitgold & RPOW), he seemed to not be aware of B-money (or bitgold),
but he couldnt pontificate for risk of narrowing the potential authorship :)
Then you have open transactions.
Anyway for deployed ecash and privacy tech political environment life has
literally never looked better - NSA shot themselves in the foot, so public
opinion is strongly in their dis-favor, the 9/11 death-pall to security vs

It does make a difference even for bootstrap issues.  Years ago at ZKS I
tried watching /dev/random while generating entropy, there was clearly not
nice things about the way they were added.  For example if you start a

talking on the network releaseing RNG output, and the entropy what little
there is is added incrementally so that you can bruteforce the gap (eg
20-bits of entropy added max in one lump) then you can infer what the new
RNG state is.  If the rate of entropy addition is low enough and the
computer too chatty with RNG outputs over the network (eg maybe it gives you
some in TCP sequence numbers or on demand just by hitting it on various
ports) you can then retain knowledge of its state perpetually.

PGP stealth by Henry Hastur has the stego support for pgp2 formats and RSA. (Aside from stripping boiler plate Hal Finney had observed that you have to
make sure the RSA encryption part doesnt narrow down which key it could be
addressed to.  (A message m > user A's n public value could not be addressed
to A (as m is computed mod n, it is always < n)).
Its C code, quite old and not really maintained but perhaps you could use it

I'd say one problem is cultural amongst the security cleared and ex-TLA
people with security people or current double agent security people on the
telco payroll.
Until they internalize that they are part of a dangerous to democracy and
civilization STASI 2.0 system, the problem will continue, because these kind
of gag order things are going to be handled by security cleared people only. In that way they can probably legally hide it from the CEO and the rest of
the company, by gagging the intercept request handling people.  And they can
surely require, if they do not already, that the intercept handling people
be security cleared.  And in that environment its got to be easy on
$250m/year black budget to stack the intercept handling departments in the
important (large) telco's with not just security cleared, but true-believer
ex-TLA types, or simply double agents.  They dont hve to pay the full salary
just an off the books loyalty bonus, as the telco is paying for its own
So I think the main hope which is probably fairly slim, is that society
views shift to make even those ex-TLA people start to question whether they
are on the right side of history to the extent they have any ethics.
Another thought you've got to wonder if people dieing is a problem.  Whats
to stop an extremely conservative risk mentality security cleared person,
writing his memoirs spilling all in complete detail, parked with a lawyer

@_subject: three crypto lists - why and which 
I am not sure if everyone is aware that there is also an unmoderated crypto
list, because I see old familiar names posting on the moderated crypto list
that I do not see posting on the unmoderated list.  The unmoderated list has
been running continuously (new posts in every day with no gaps) since mar
2010, with an interesting relatively low noise, and not firehose volume.
The actual reason for the creation of that list was Perry's list went
through a hiatus when Perry stopped approving/forward posts eg
originally Nov 2009 - Mar 2010 (I presume the mar 2010 restart was motivated
by the creation of randombit list starting in the same month) but more
recently sep 2010 to may 2013 gap (minus traffic in aug 2011).
I have no desire to pry into Perry's personal circumstances as to why this
huge gap happened, and he should be thanked for the significant moderation
effort he has put into create this low noise environment, but despite that
it is bad for cryptography if people's means of technical interaction
spuriously stops.  Perry mentioned recently that he has now backup
moderators, OK so good.
There is now also the cypherpunks list which has picked up, and covers a
wider mix of topics, censorship resistant technology ideas, forays into
ideology etc.  Moderation is even lower than randombit but no spam, noise
slightly higher but quite reasonable so far.  And there is now a domain name
that is not al-quaeda.net (seriously?  is that even funny?): cpunks.org.  At least I enjoy it and see some familiar names posting last seen decade+
Anyway my reason for posting was threefold: a) make people aware of
randombit crypto list, b) rebooted cypherpunks list (*), but c) about how to
use randombit (unmoderated) and metzdowd.  For my tastes sometimes Perry will cut off a discussion that I thought was
just warming up because I wanted to get into the detail, so I tend more
prefer the unmoderated list.  But its kind of a weird situaton because there
are people I want views and comments from who are on the metzdowd list who
as far as I know are not on the crypto list, and there's no convenient way
to migrate a conversation other than everyone subscribing to both.  Cc to
both perhaps works somewhat, I do that sometimes though as a general
principle it can be annoying when people Cc to too many lists.

This bit is interesting so the NSA digitally tails all americans without

So what are we talking about here - jay-walking?  Buying CFDs?  (Widely sold

some types of online gambling are not legal in the US).  And so forth.
Also I'm not sure how you find evidence of a crime from a social graph
analysis without a content wire tap, but maybe a location and time would do
as suspicion or some level of evidence it if there is some crime that was
known to have occurred at a certain place and time range and they have the
phone calling and GPS records.
Anyway it yet again violates the US governments claims: that their citizens
dont have anything to worry about, its just targetted at terrorists.  Not so
- they digitally tail everyone and if they find anything suspicious period
they forward it to law enforcement.

phrase to express his distaste for someone's actions.  Its an expression,
not something literal... but James' black & white, non-PC, absolutist
personality precludes him saying that :)  You just have to read it with a
USENET flame war mentality and parse for what he's actually saying.
Apart from the refusal to bow to PC, James is actually a pretty smart guy

Cypherpunks write code & all that, gives James some brownie points.
About Aaron's case and suicide, it seems to me that Aaron miscalculated, and
the hacking was pretty escalated, engaged in multiple escalating
counter-measures when it was obvious the sysadmins were on to him as an
intruder, he didnt back off but took it to the next level including physical
intrusion & hiding equipment.  But MIT (and to a lesser extent JSTOR) let
him down badly as did some of his academic friends and its tragic that he
was a victim of some extremely over reaching imbalanced law the CFAA [3],
aggressively prosecuted by self-agrandizing politically motivated, and
almost legally immune deeply flawed US federal prosecution and plea bargain
system, which also saw Weev [4] put in jail over the most ridiculous and
egregious abuse of law (noticing a defect in AT&T web site and giving the
information to the media).  Yes Weev enjoys trolling, but thats an art-form
and since when has unpopular speech been illegal, freedom of speech means
unpopular speech too.  Aaron's earlier hacktivism was pretty spectacularly
successful in demonstrating the stupidity of charging for access to publicly
funded legal information, in a way that ultimatey they could find no legal
fault with, though the feds were not doubt pretty pissed that they couldnt
get him for anything.  But even the legal dox hacktivism stunt was very high
risk, the US legal system is hard to rely on, even when you are doing legal
but politically unpopular to things to a subset of the higher echelons of
office holder.  It seems to me that particularly in the US the
political/legal system tends to hold grudges and fail spectacularly at
balance and impartiality and legal independence from political influence. Its better than Russia still, but its falling in world rankings of rule of
law and political indendence for sure.  There are probably some independent
rankings on this aspect of the government/jurisdiction comparison.

@_subject: NSA, FBI creep & rule of law, democracy itself (Re: [cryptography] 
This is indeed an interesting and scary question:
maybe the most interesting and portenteous shift in power towards
Orwellianism and totalitarianism in a century, as it affects the
effectiveness of rule of law, and already weak separation of politics from
law enforcement and justice system in the (current though slipping)
super-power with unfortunate aspirations of extra-territorialism and
international bullying.  We're still a few decades from the cross over of
financial dominance to Asia and BRICs, and most of those places are probably
worse than the US by aspiration if thats possible, though less internet
spying budget and capability.  Unless something shapes up towards democracy
in the super-power competitors we're in for a dismal century seemingly.
That the NSA, and now seemingly FBI, see this I think maybe this FBI mission
creep suggests the national security / law enforcement separation is
slipping badly:
so if even the FBI are getting their nose into the tent of unfetter access
to historical data on everyone, plus informal channels and "tip-offs" on
dirt on politically unpopular pepople - eg say effective security
researchers like Applebaum, or effective journalists like Greenwald.  (No
"foreigners" dont feel very comforted, and the explict acknowledgment of
tip-offs, and inforation channels to US domestic and international law
enforcement, basically puts the entire planet at risk of politicaly
motivated interference.)
With retroactive search of your entire lifes electronic foot print including
every "encrypted" IM, skype voip channel, contacts, emails, attorney client
privileged and not, with no warrant or evidence presented to a judge for
subpoena, the Orwell 2.0 system can probably fabricate or concoct trouble
for 99% of the adult population of the planet.  George Orwell 30 years late.
We're pretty close to fucked as a civilization unless something pretty
radical shifts in the political thinking and authorizations.  And
realistically it not even clear the NSA can politically be controlled
anymore by the political system.  Its very hard to influence something with
that much skull-duggery built into its DNA, that many 10s of billions in
outsourced defense contractor lobbying power, that much inertia and will to
survive as an org, with military PSYOPs to turn on its own populace and
political system, and black bag covert ops ties to dirty tricks in CIA, and
judicial and law virtual immunity.  They probably realistically went full
speed ahead since the 11 Sep 2001, if not earlier on such things, and the
scrapping.  TIA wiki
Probably even before since we nominally won the export regulation debacle
and democractic countries were forced to admit it was inconsistent with
their self-perception as open democratic countries, to be controlling and
banning encryption software.  The 21st century equivalent of book burning.
Can we rectify this with the cypherpunks write code?  Maybe as Schneier said
in a discussion on this topic with Eben Moglen (at Moglen's respective
university) maybe we can make it more expensive by deploying more crypto
that is end to end secure, secure by default.  ie more TOFU, more cert
pinning, more certificate transparency distributed cert validation.  Even
the cert valiation maybe behind the game, perhaps NSA really do already have
a lot of actual SSL private keys via hardware, software hacking and
backdoors with manufacturer complicity or not, as well as just demanding
them with NSL orders, gag orders as Lavabit showed finally with evidence.  I

@_subject: NSA, FBI creep & rule of law, democracy itself (Re: [cryptography] 
This is indeed an interesting and scary question:
maybe the most interesting and portenteous shift in power towards
Orwellianism and totalitarianism in a century, as it affects the
effectiveness of rule of law, and already weak separation of politics from
law enforcement and justice system in the (current though slipping)
super-power with unfortunate aspirations of extra-territorialism and
international bullying.  We're still a few decades from the cross over of
financial dominance to Asia and BRICs, and most of those places are probably
worse than the US by aspiration if thats possible, though less internet
spying budget and capability.  Unless something shapes up towards democracy
in the super-power competitors we're in for a dismal century seemingly.
That the NSA, and now seemingly FBI, see this I think maybe this FBI mission
creep suggests the national security / law enforcement separation is
slipping badly:
so if even the FBI are getting their nose into the tent of unfetter access
to historical data on everyone, plus informal channels and "tip-offs" on
dirt on politically unpopular pepople - eg say effective security
researchers like Applebaum, or effective journalists like Greenwald.  (No
"foreigners" dont feel very comforted, and the explict acknowledgment of
tip-offs, and inforation channels to US domestic and international law
enforcement, basically puts the entire planet at risk of politicaly
motivated interference.)
With retroactive search of your entire lifes electronic foot print including
every "encrypted" IM, skype voip channel, contacts, emails, attorney client
privileged and not, with no warrant or evidence presented to a judge for
subpoena, the Orwell 2.0 system can probably fabricate or concoct trouble
for 99% of the adult population of the planet.  George Orwell 30 years late.
We're pretty close to fucked as a civilization unless something pretty
radical shifts in the political thinking and authorizations.  And
realistically it not even clear the NSA can politically be controlled
anymore by the political system.  Its very hard to influence something with
that much skull-duggery built into its DNA, that many 10s of billions in
outsourced defense contractor lobbying power, that much inertia and will to
survive as an org, with military PSYOPs to turn on its own populace and
political system, and black bag covert ops ties to dirty tricks in CIA, and
judicial and law virtual immunity.  They probably realistically went full
speed ahead since the 11 Sep 2001, if not earlier on such things, and the
scrapping.  TIA wiki
Probably even before since we nominally won the export regulation debacle
and democractic countries were forced to admit it was inconsistent with
their self-perception as open democratic countries, to be controlling and
banning encryption software.  The 21st century equivalent of book burning.
Can we rectify this with the cypherpunks write code?  Maybe as Schneier said
in a discussion on this topic with Eben Moglen (at Moglen's respective
university) maybe we can make it more expensive by deploying more crypto
that is end to end secure, secure by default.  ie more TOFU, more cert
pinning, more certificate transparency distributed cert validation.  Even
the cert valiation maybe behind the game, perhaps NSA really do already have
a lot of actual SSL private keys via hardware, software hacking and
backdoors with manufacturer complicity or not, as well as just demanding
them with NSL orders, gag orders as Lavabit showed finally with evidence.  I
wonder what proportion of SSL certs worldwide the five eyes/Orwell 2.0
shadow orwell 2.0 government have copies of?

financial dominance to Asia and BRICs, and most of those places are probably
worse than the US by aspiration if thats possible, though less internet
spying budget and capability.  Unless something shapes up towards democracy
in the super-power competitors we're in for a dismal century seemingly.
That the NSA, and now seemingly FBI, see this I think maybe this FBI mission
creep suggests the national security / law enforcement separation is
slipping badly:
so if even the FBI are getting their nose into the tent of unfetter access
to historical data on everyone, plus informal channels and "tip-offs" on
dirt on politically unpopular pepople - eg say effective security
researchers like Applebaum, or effective journalists like Greenwald.  (No
"foreigners" dont feel very comforted, and the explict acknowledgment of
tip-offs, and inforation channels to US domestic and international law
enforcement, basically puts the entire planet at risk of politicaly
motivated interference.)
With retroactive search of your entire lifes electronic foot print including
every "encrypted" IM, skype voip channel, contacts, emails, attorney client
privileged and not, with no warrant or evidence presented to a judge for
subpoena, the Orwell 2.0 system can probably fabricate or concoct trouble
for 99% of the adult population of the planet.  George Orwell 30 years late.
We're pretty close to fucked as a civilization unless something pretty
radical shifts in the political thinking and authorizations.  And
realistically it not even clear the NSA can politically be controlled
anymore by the political system.  Its very hard to influence something with
that much skull-duggery built into its DNA, that many 10s of billions in
outsourced defense contractor lobbying power, that much inertia and will to
survive as an org, with military PSYOPs to turn on its own populace and
political system, and black bag covert ops ties to dirty tricks in CIA, and
judicial and law virtual immunity.  They probably realistically went full
speed ahead since the 11 Sep 2001, if not earlier on such things, and the
scrapping.  TIA wiki
Probably even before since we nominally won the export regulation debacle
and democractic countries were forced to admit it was inconsistent with
their self-perception as open democratic countries, to be controlling and
banning encryption software.  The 21st century equivalent of book burning.
Can we rectify this with the cypherpunks write code?  Maybe as Schneier said
in a discussion on this topic with Eben Moglen (at Moglen's respective
university) maybe we can make it more expensive by deploying more crypto
that is end to end secure, secure by default.  ie more TOFU, more cert
pinning, more certificate transparency distributed cert validation.  Even
the cert valiation maybe behind the game, perhaps NSA really do already have
a lot of actual SSL private keys via hardware, software hacking and
backdoors with manufacturer complicity or not, as well as just demanding
them with NSL orders, gag orders as Lavabit showed finally with evidence.  I
wonder what proportion of SSL certs worldwide the five eyes/Orwell 2.0
shadow orwell 2.0 government have copies of?

Yeah I think this might be a claim by Charlie Stross to having outed T C

The article itself is a Charlie Stross bitcoin-hate diatribe.  Amusingly
bitcoin bounced back to $1000 since his doom and gloom of "$500 and falling"
and I personally just bought more at the nice price of $390 and $500, having
confidence in the long term value of the new digital scarcity commodity

not like fiat doesnt have problems and having banksters eat a largely
unearned big % portion of GDP doesnt exactly benefit society and isnt green
either, they could be doing societally useful work instead).
I happened to notice the T C May reference in the Stross replies to comments

not sure if that means he thinks Moldbug is May or the "or" means other

I imagine its all out there on the wikis or interwebs, thats where I read
it, so here I am just repeating what was written about extensively at the
time.  From memory there was some escalation.  He was detected, blocked,
reacted (mac tumble etc) blocked again, then proceed to enter presumably
restricted areas, hide equipment to bypass limits the admins had placed only
on wifi users, and still download the heck out of it.  It was a big risk and
not very smart move.
What do you think a competent sysadmin would do about on on going security
investigation in that situation - try to find the equipment or say "on noes
the hacker is too smart for us - we capitulate".  So they found the
equipment, called the local cops, and found Aaron when he came to collect
the equipment.  Its not as if he asked their permission, nor that they knew
it was someone even authorized to be on campus or to use JSTOR.
Once that happened it spiraled out of control, even though several
influential faculty knew Aaron, and as I recall his father also worked
there; and various people caved or chickened out of supporting him from what
others said on this threa, and the guy was like depressed obviously about
this situation.  From robin hood white knight hacktivist to soon to be felon
with soulless politicaly motivated fed prosecutor trying to make an example
of him by twisting the max out of some already egregious laws.
So yes I am against the state subsidized "copyright" censorship of some bit
strings, patents and monstrosities like CFAA, so I support Aaron's political
objective of his hactivism target there (and on the previous one) but Aaron
did screw up a bit also.  Maybe he got the wrong message from dodging a
justice system bullet on the previous succesful hactivism with the legally

Not that its relevant to the Aaron discussion, but I think you got that
etymology sequence wrong, the original meaning of hacker was more like doing
clever but non-malicious things with computers, aka squeezing interesting
things out of them that they were not intended or expected to do.  And/or
relatedly people were less uptight about computer access as most of them
were in open collaborative university settings so using computers was less
of a locked up possessive mind set.  Those were the days before CFAA and
Weev getting his door kicked in by a swat team for stumbling upon a broken
network API.
Hacker in the sense of cracker was a later and much hated co-option and
perversion of the term.  I expect that's what Rysiek was reacting to partly.
Seems like the original hackers lost that etymology battle however long ago.

A cryptographically secure pseudonym would probably work even better.  Weev

months.  A lawyer is a last resort, step  is not identifying yourself even

Possibly would be advisable to use a laywer for some anonmyity insulation to
even sell a hack to one of the disclosure service pimping sites.  (They
probably are selling them to the NSA/Orwell 2.0 crew so taking their money is
probably dirty money.)
Independent security researcher can be risky.  Get a legal signed doc from

@_subject: maidsafe 
btw apparently maidsafe also patented some things.  Not a fan of
patents really (bit of an understatement - IMO they should be banned).
Maidsafe took some flak for it and tried to claim they were defensive
patents.  I think the misunderstanding is that when startups fail,
patents get sold to the highest bidder.  Ie the entrepreneur who
thinks its a useful thing to do creates 30 years of headache for an
ecosystem from his 2 year time-horizon thinking.  We've even seen it
before in ecash specifically with the digicash patents that were sold
at bankruptcy to infospace and so there was a period where no one
could use basic blind sigs and various work arounds were tried
(blinding agnostic server, Wagner's blind MAC/ZKP/Lucre,
server-privacy/systemix/ricardian server).  That sucked.
I am not sure about Maidsafe.  But there are a lot of scams in
alt-coin space.  Its very easy to take investors money and then fail
to deliver.  The investors are non-qualified investors, so the
legality is also questionable.  But even on an ethical basis, the
investors are not having legal or professional review of the
prospectus, and the "investment contract" is typically ridiculous such
that a professional would ROFL about the proposal.  You own nothing.
Its a pattern repeated a few times in alt-coin space.
The other fallacy in my view is that this is somehow plausible that a
service (aka app-coin) with value could defend a floating valued
alt-coin.  Lets say maidsafe as an example - so far I guess its
vaporware, or under research & development vs zooko's LAFS for example
which has been running and incrementally improving for years.  But
lets say they manage to develop something useful with usable
functionality and reliability etc which is no small task, lets say
they get workably close to matching LAFS functionality after spending
the $10m or whatever they raised.  Now why would people use it over
LAFS which is free?
If maidsafe offered better functionality than LAFS (seems doubtful but
hypothetically) its FOSS software.  Why would someone not fork it and
remove the maidsafe token.  The resources that provide the service are
after all not provided by maidsafe nor the holders of the maidsafe
coins - so why would users and peers in the network choose to support
the enrichment of maidsafe the company nor the naive people who put
money into the "investment".  You often hear people talking about
these schemes as "donations" and thats probably closer to the truth -
if you think the tech is interesting and you donate some money to it
to see it get built, without expectations of getting your money back,
you're going to get less of an unpleasant surprise when it fails to
materialise or it simply gets forked if it even works.
I can see that Zooko for example might look at this and go huh? WTF?
He implemented LAFS with various modest funding models and has a
working system - and yet some folks with hand wavy ideas that may or
may not be mathematically possible even jump into the tech space paint
an exciting hypothetical system picture and grab $10m+ of
non-qualified investor money with an "investment contract" that says
the investor owns nothing (other than sort of undefined value service
tokens, that are not backed by control or ownership of the resources

If nothing else these token sale contracts are fraught with moral
hazard.  Investment contracts are structured the way they are by
mutual negotiation between investor and startup for reasons of
interest alignment and incentive.  Those structures were arrived at
via 100+ years of experience of what works and what doesnt, and prior
generations investment scams and bubbles.  It seems like a bit of a
rerun of some early last century investment scams that motivated the
regulations we currently have to protect investors from scammers.

btw apparently maidsafe also patented some things.  Not a fan of
patents really (bit of an understatement - IMO they should be banned).
Maidsafe took some flak for it and tried to claim they were defensive
patents.  I think the misunderstanding is that when startups fail,
patents get sold to the highest bidder.  Ie the entrepreneur who
thinks its a useful thing to do creates 30 years of headache for an
ecosystem from his 2 year time-horizon thinking.  We've even seen it
before in ecash specifically with the digicash patents that were sold
at bankruptcy to infospace and so there was a period where no one
could use basic blind sigs and various work arounds were tried
(blinding agnostic server, Wagner's blind MAC/ZKP/Lucre,
server-privacy/systemix/ricardian server).  That sucked.
I am not sure about Maidsafe.  But there are a lot of scams in
alt-coin space.  Its very easy to take investors money and then fail
to deliver.  The investors are non-qualified investors, so the
legality is also questionable.  But even on an ethical basis, the
investors are not having legal or professional review of the
prospectus, and the "investment contract" is typically ridiculous such
that a professional would ROFL about the proposal.  You own nothing.
Its a pattern repeated a few times in alt-coin space.
The other fallacy in my view is that this is somehow plausible that a
service (aka app-coin) with value could defend a floating valued
alt-coin.  Lets say maidsafe as an example - so far I guess its
vaporware, or under research & development vs zooko's LAFS for example
which has been running and incrementally improving for years.  But
lets say they manage to develop something useful with usable
functionality and reliability etc which is no small task, lets say
they get workably close to matching LAFS functionality after spending
the $10m or whatever they raised.  Now why would people use it over
LAFS which is free?
If maidsafe offered better functionality than LAFS (seems doubtful but
hypothetically) its FOSS software.  Why would someone not fork it and
remove the maidsafe token.  The resources that provide the service are
after all not provided by maidsafe nor the holders of the maidsafe
coins - so why would users and peers in the network choose to support
the enrichment of maidsafe the company nor the naive people who put
money into the "investment".  You often hear people talking about
these schemes as "donations" and thats probably closer to the truth -
if you think the tech is interesting and you donate some money to it
to see it get built, without expectations of getting your money back,
you're going to get less of an unpleasant surprise when it fails to
materialise or it simply gets forked if it even works.
I can see that Zooko for example might look at this and go huh? WTF?
He implemented LAFS with various modest funding models and has a
working system - and yet some folks with hand wavy ideas that may or
may not be mathematically possible even jump into the tech space paint
an exciting hypothetical system picture and grab $10m+ of
non-qualified investor money with an "investment contract" that says
the investor owns nothing (other than sort of undefined value service
tokens, that are not backed by control or ownership of the resources
that might operate the to-be-implemented service).
If nothing else these token sale contracts are fraught with moral
hazard.  Investment contracts are structured the way they are by
mutual negotiation between investor and startup for reasons of
