2013/11/26 Sean Lynch Please don't confuse an assassination market with Bitcoin. Both can exist
without each other. One does not require the other and none is a direct
result of the other. They are extremely complementary.
Regarding general disagreement with Bitcoin: there's really no point
resisting mathematics. And at this point the deflation of Bitcoin is about
as tied to a mathematical certainty as reality ever gets. It's a market
thingy. Early adopters get *huge* advantages. Knowledge presses the price
harder than risk. Anyway.
Having multiple Bitcoins isn't much going to solve your problems. No other
currency will be without it's own flavor of problems. As a rule of thumb:
if the math is sound but it seems illogical, check yourself. If you can't
check the math, don't trust it.
Having multiple cryptocurrencies would be nice. But Ripple for example
sucks in comparison.
Again, this thread is not about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.
Regarding assassination markets I don't think this particular one isn't too
special. I also think any form of assassination should be communally
prevented. Of course anonymity, which always exists in some form, makes it
impossible. I'm not sure making it as in-your-face as Tor+Bitcoin is doing
it right now is better or worse. Sure is fair when knowledge isn't the
deciding factor.
Bottom line: whatever, I hope it doesn't take off. I like safety and wish
it weren't a marketable good. I'm still not sure how far this extends into
healthcare, but I hope development in the area makes the choice easier
(just take care of them is my preferred answer).

@_subject: bitcoin as a global medium of exchange (was Re: Interesting take 
2013/11/27 Ted Smith Then how can you say his work was published into any sort of market?
Okay. Let me explain it a little bit.
Satoshi (and maybe some buddies in the very-very-early days) is (are?)
estimated to have 1.5MBTC (M for million, m for milli, k?). That's worth
about 900MEUR now. Let's make a generous assumption, that Satoshi started
working on Bitcoin right after DigiCash bankrupted (1998). That assumption
is a bucket of nonesense, I think 2/3 years would be more right.
Thebitcoin wiki
tells us he "has claimed that he has been working on Bitcoin since 2007",
the Bitcoin software was released 2009. Paper distributed in 2008.
Okay so: 1.5MBTC for 2 years. I doubt I'd have to show you that no other
scientist, no matter his contribution, got quite that amount of money for
his efforts. In fact most scientists waive what little they get because
they do not need it (their dedication is to science, not to carnal
pleasures). 1.5MBTC for 11 years is still a pretty high salary. But this is
in "employment terms".
If we compare to people like the creator of SnapChat, a hyperflawed
consequence free multimedia application (media is deleted after being
viewed for a specified amount of seconds), who's product is apperently
worth 4 billion on a functional market. We're doing okay right now, because
something far more usefull (it is) is priced at 1/4th of the price of
However if you believe Bitcoin will stay at around 600 euro's (oh wait it's
700 today already, haha) than that's quite strange. If you think it'll stay
at around 4x more (2400) than you're probably still thinking quite
strangely. See, Bitcoin has a very unusual market mechanic. And Satoshi is
rewarding himself in how much the system is used, the sum of all banks his
software replaces will be his money. But nobody is paying him directly and
his efforts are definitely not a markted good.
Why shouldn't it? Because if satoshi lives in a huge home, spending freely,
with several people assisting him in whatever whilst owning some companies
that'll do things he deems important (squirrle rescue patrol, private
police, education, art displays, helping the poor, etc) then he didn't need
this much. Having this much of what might become world wealth simply isn't
reasonable for what the money stands for. Somewhere I feel it unfair that
someone who works at the top of his abilities in a more profitable field
gets paid more, but it isn't actually unfair. But the amount of buying
power that Satoshi now represents is so exeedingly vast, and will be so
much vaster, I cannot fantom it "fair".
The best we can go for is the amount being "realistic" and "result of a
fair and honest process". And I think that because a buyer of Bitcoin has
no reason to be interested in economic or Satoshi, just in his personal
profits, we have a game-theory situation where Satoshi is paid in a way
that nobody is interested in observing. After all, every Bitcoin you buy
makes the Bitcoin scarcer at your expense and Satoshi profits. And because
of this game theory problem I don't feel there is a market-related effect
being placed on Satoshi's efforts.
The bottom line is: wealth distribution fairness was never a core design
goal of Bitcoin.

2013/11/27 Juan Garofalo I would be totally fine with Bitcoin going darknet. Doesn't lower the
value. Problem is that all legitimate dealings are made much harder, and
humanity's freedom is decreased significantly. I wouldn't say I whined
about it though. And the whole part about evil is just the opinion of the
enforced legal system.
Our dear dread pirate was an insane moron for living in America though.
That doesn't change at all.
How long's the ponzi scheme going to last though?
This is the kind of scheme that could last indefinitely. I visualize a
ponzi scheme as a funnel shaped like piramid growing downwards. Every
"brick" layed at the bottom flows some air up and out through the tip. The
tip flows towards the creator of the system. All the pieces higher in the
piramid get some air too. In bitcoin the hole at the tip is closed.
Although the pressure on the top increases (there's some gravity effect)
there is no money dissapearing.
There's a significant illusion that everyone involved in the system could
"cash out" for a certain price. Market dynamics don't allow such an event
to occur though.
You'll note that all commodities follow the same mechanism, except for
commodities being translatable to other valueable things intrisically.
Currency, USD, EUR, JPY, pretty much all others too, follow the same
mechanism completely except for the fact that governments can (and do)
choose to inflate a currency.
I answered this extensively because people have become allergic to
discussing Bitcoin in the ponzi light. There's definitely similarities
between Bitcoin and a Ponzi scheme. It is *VITAL *to note that
*every currency* has those similarities, but they are not easily seen.

2013/11/29 Patrick Chkoreff I think we disagree here. Game theory doesn't support this standpoint. I am
sure having no crime would be better for humanity than the other way
around. But to commit a crime can be extremely profitable, emotionally or
financially. And for me to protect others is not profitable for me
directly. It's like taxes, it's good for society if everyone just pays
their taxes (provided the taxes are fair). But do I want to pay taxes? I
don't know anyone that looks forward to paying his taxes.
Then why didn't you spend 10% of your wealth/income last year on
investigating crime prevention? I appreciate that you feel this discussion
is helping, and it's helping me get my thoughts clearer, but I truly think
a community cannot be expected to behave in a way good for the community
but bad for the individual.
I don't quite see this argument. A murderer and a police officer have
opposing motives. A person in the street will back away from both to
prevent getting hurt, even if he might help either achieve his/her goal.

@_subject: Interesting take on Sanjuro's Assassination Market 
2013/11/29 Patrick Chkoreff This deserves further explanation. I do think game theory is extremely
present in all of our society. We'd be more happy to have other pay tax and
not us, than to also pay taxes ourselves.
Arguing against "taxes" in the broad sense of the word (contribution to
society as a whole, government is less often the right word) is very
challenging indeed if you ask me. Some things only work when everyone
pitches in. Reducing climate destruction will not be possible without
universally agreed upon rules or very aggressive resistance by ... pretty
much all buying power. The latter hasn't happened ever, not without a
governing organ explicitly "boycotting" something. We're entering a very
murky discussion here which I think shouldn't be required.
Let's say "do something for the good of all of *cared-for-group-name* that
will cost the individual more than the individual will profit from it".
Becoming vegetarian is an example. It doesn't work if just that one person
does it, but it does cost that person something.
You're right in that 10% is pretty darn high. Only Israel gets to that
number. About 5% of gov' taxes goes to defense though. With developed
countries' tax pressure at ~35% (US only ~25%) that makes 0.35 * 0.05 =
0.0175 or about 2% of your money. Only a fifth of what I asked you for.
Then you say you did *additional* things to secure yourself. Let's say 2%
is about right for a personal defense budget.
Knowing that committing a murder is cheaper than preventing one, by a
factor I'm not aware of, and that murder can sometimes have an economic
advantage you will find that murder will exist. (see also estimated victims
and cost of prevention of terrorism. Now see the costs of hitmen (find a
cheap one).)
Having a public market for hitmen will make it cheaper. Having a
crowdfunding posibility will enable a new *class* of people, those with
lesser profit from it, to still contribute to a kill. This model doesn't
show failures and thus misguides hitmen into thinking it is easy money,
distorting the market in the unpreferred direction. Observe how "no
retribution" significantly reduces the estimated cost of a murdering
I simply think you wouldn't get the type of civilization where you could
focus on development of the race as a whole. A way to live more than just
for your own little life, but for that of your family and "comrades".
If you don't do that you choose the most painful way to die; to live.
For real, right? Frikkin' goody two shoeses. Can't understand their
People in your neighborhood have a (perhaps unspoken) currency of
reputation. Their warning to others would be reciprocated. That idea makes
them do it. You don't have to consider this rational or good for the
individual, evolution made sure that it increases the size of the
population. This is not personally advantageous, it's popularly
advantageous. Evolution made you a less rational being to cause your
existence. Very philosophical standpoint. "Humans aren't rational,
therefore they can exist". Anyway.
There might very well be examples of true mutually beneficial cases. For
example if a wallet's finder may keep a percentage of the wallet's
contents. The finder has this dilemma:
Max( wallet.content * captureRiskFactor, wallet.content * rewardFactor +
If the wallet's finder is found out (the owner found him) he will lose the
reward. The risk factor is 0 to 1. 10% chance of getting caught makes
content * 0.1. This is the expected profit. Everyone on this list really
should know about expected returns and all. Only when the rewardFactor is
bigger than his riskfactor will he give the wallet back. You'll find that
even this is not actually mutually beneficial, lets the wallet has
different values for both people. This is generally true, maybe a family
picture, ID's that have to be rerequested at a cost, etc. While the cash is
all that's good to the finder.
The emotional bonus is the thing that causes people to be vegetarian and is
also the typical reason people obey the law. It's part of the unlikely
risk-adverseness common in people nowadays. I guess safely living worse is
better than maybe living better in terms of survival.
Anyway again. Given such proper gametheory you'll find it hard to find
situations where one would be interested in protecting another unrelated
human being.
At some point crime will stabilize at a certain level. That level is where
people are so generally scared of a crime against them, yet not scared of
retribution for their protests against crime, that they'll put efforts (in
financial or other form) into reducing the level of criminality.
You'll find their first move is closing assassination markets to increase
the effective cost and risk of finding a murderer to do one's bidding. It's
by far the cheapest way to reduce murder.
Once there's a string of crimes you'd rather barricade your home than
collectively hire a detective. Maybe you'll have a guard on your street.
But you wouldn't donate to a crime lab doing experimental research. That's
just too little directly visible return. Ad-hoc patchwork solutions.
(Paying safety money for example)
An assassination pool however has very direct and clear payoffs if it ever
happens. Easy to put money towards out of a simple grudge.
Excuses for the subpar use of language. My End Of Day has been reached.
Could you try to summarize the arguments we've been throwing at each other?
I'd like to reach some sort of satisfying answer.
I think you estimate the cost of protection to be comparable to the cost of
attacks. I think protection is far more expensive and although likely a
more popular expense (let's say people are generally good, witchhunts and
discrimination would suggest otherwise but w/e) also more frequently a
smaller expense, as the profit derived from it is very hard to determine
and the profit would hardly alter by a personal contribution. Therewith
creating a game theory scenario (a simple one!) where general safety will
dwindle as to alter our society significantly and make crime an auctioned
commodity. Subverting any way of life not strictly egoistical. (What was
the last time you donated to your police station?)
As you see my summary turned into another piece of argument. Excuses
Eeyorish is a nice word btw. And after a string of crimes is a tad late.
And who'd notice it's a string of crimes?

2013/11/26 Sean Lynch Please don't confuse an assassination market with Bitcoin. Both can exist
without each other. One does not require the other and none is a direct
result of the other. They are extremely complementary.
Regarding general disagreement with Bitcoin: there's really no point
resisting mathematics. And at this point the deflation of Bitcoin is about
as tied to a mathematical certainty as reality ever gets. It's a market
thingy. Early adopters get *huge* advantages. Knowledge presses the price
harder than risk. Anyway.
Having multiple Bitcoins isn't much going to solve your problems. No other
currency will be without it's own flavor of problems. As a rule of thumb:
if the math is sound but it seems illogical, check yourself. If you can't
check the math, don't trust it.
Having multiple cryptocurrencies would be nice. But Ripple for example
sucks in comparison.
Again, this thread is not about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.
Regarding assassination markets I don't think this particular one isn't too
special. I also think any form of assassination should be communally
prevented. Of course anonymity, which always exists in some form, makes it
impossible. I'm not sure making it as in-your-face as Tor+Bitcoin is doing
it right now is better or worse. Sure is fair when knowledge isn't the
deciding factor.
Bottom line: whatever, I hope it doesn't take off. I like safety and wish
it weren't a marketable good. I'm still not sure how far this extends into
healthcare, but I hope development in the area makes the choice easier
(just take care of them is my preferred answer).

@_subject: bitcoin as a global medium of exchange (was Re: Interesting take 
2013/11/27 Ted Smith Then how can you say his work was published into any sort of market?
Okay. Let me explain it a little bit.
Satoshi (and maybe some buddies in the very-very-early days) is (are?)
estimated to have 1.5MBTC (M for million, m for milli, k?). That's worth
about 900MEUR now. Let's make a generous assumption, that Satoshi started
working on Bitcoin right after DigiCash bankrupted (1998). That assumption
is a bucket of nonesense, I think 2/3 years would be more right.
Thebitcoin wiki
tells us he "has claimed that he has been working on Bitcoin since 2007",
the Bitcoin software was released 2009. Paper distributed in 2008.
Okay so: 1.5MBTC for 2 years. I doubt I'd have to show you that no other
scientist, no matter his contribution, got quite that amount of money for
his efforts. In fact most scientists waive what little they get because
they do not need it (their dedication is to science, not to carnal
pleasures). 1.5MBTC for 11 years is still a pretty high salary. But this is
in "employment terms".
If we compare to people like the creator of SnapChat, a hyperflawed
consequence free multimedia application (media is deleted after being
viewed for a specified amount of seconds), who's product is apperently
worth 4 billion on a functional market. We're doing okay right now, because
something far more usefull (it is) is priced at 1/4th of the price of
However if you believe Bitcoin will stay at around 600 euro's (oh wait it's
700 today already, haha) than that's quite strange. If you think it'll stay
at around 4x more (2400) than you're probably still thinking quite
strangely. See, Bitcoin has a very unusual market mechanic. And Satoshi is
rewarding himself in how much the system is used, the sum of all banks his
software replaces will be his money. But nobody is paying him directly and
his efforts are definitely not a markted good.
Why shouldn't it? Because if satoshi lives in a huge home, spending freely,
with several people assisting him in whatever whilst owning some companies
that'll do things he deems important (squirrle rescue patrol, private
police, education, art displays, helping the poor, etc) then he didn't need
this much. Having this much of what might become world wealth simply isn't
reasonable for what the money stands for. Somewhere I feel it unfair that
someone who works at the top of his abilities in a more profitable field
gets paid more, but it isn't actually unfair. But the amount of buying
power that Satoshi now represents is so exeedingly vast, and will be so
much vaster, I cannot fantom it "fair".
The best we can go for is the amount being "realistic" and "result of a
fair and honest process". And I think that because a buyer of Bitcoin has
no reason to be interested in economic or Satoshi, just in his personal
profits, we have a game-theory situation where Satoshi is paid in a way
that nobody is interested in observing. After all, every Bitcoin you buy
makes the Bitcoin scarcer at your expense and Satoshi profits. And because
of this game theory problem I don't feel there is a market-related effect
being placed on Satoshi's efforts.
The bottom line is: wealth distribution fairness was never a core design
goal of Bitcoin.

2013/11/27 Juan Garofalo I would be totally fine with Bitcoin going darknet. Doesn't lower the
value. Problem is that all legitimate dealings are made much harder, and
humanity's freedom is decreased significantly. I wouldn't say I whined
about it though. And the whole part about evil is just the opinion of the
enforced legal system.
Our dear dread pirate was an insane moron for living in America though.
That doesn't change at all.
How long's the ponzi scheme going to last though?
This is the kind of scheme that could last indefinitely. I visualize a
ponzi scheme as a funnel shaped like piramid growing downwards. Every
"brick" layed at the bottom flows some air up and out through the tip. The
tip flows towards the creator of the system. All the pieces higher in the
piramid get some air too. In bitcoin the hole at the tip is closed.
Although the pressure on the top increases (there's some gravity effect)
there is no money dissapearing.
There's a significant illusion that everyone involved in the system could
"cash out" for a certain price. Market dynamics don't allow such an event
to occur though.
You'll note that all commodities follow the same mechanism, except for
commodities being translatable to other valueable things intrisically.
Currency, USD, EUR, JPY, pretty much all others too, follow the same
mechanism completely except for the fact that governments can (and do)
choose to inflate a currency.
I answered this extensively because people have become allergic to
discussing Bitcoin in the ponzi light. There's definitely similarities
between Bitcoin and a Ponzi scheme. It is *VITAL *to note that
*every currency* has those similarities, but they are not easily seen.

2013/11/29 Patrick Chkoreff I think we disagree here. Game theory doesn't support this standpoint. I am
sure having no crime would be better for humanity than the other way
around. But to commit a crime can be extremely profitable, emotionally or
financially. And for me to protect others is not profitable for me
directly. It's like taxes, it's good for society if everyone just pays
their taxes (provided the taxes are fair). But do I want to pay taxes? I
don't know anyone that looks forward to paying his taxes.
Then why didn't you spend 10% of your wealth/income last year on
investigating crime prevention? I appreciate that you feel this discussion
is helping, and it's helping me get my thoughts clearer, but I truly think
a community cannot be expected to behave in a way good for the community
but bad for the individual.
I don't quite see this argument. A murderer and a police officer have
opposing motives. A person in the street will back away from both to
prevent getting hurt, even if he might help either achieve his/her goal.

@_subject: Interesting take on Sanjuro's Assassination Market 
2013/11/29 Patrick Chkoreff This deserves further explanation. I do think game theory is extremely
present in all of our society. We'd be more happy to have other pay tax and
not us, than to also pay taxes ourselves.
Arguing against "taxes" in the broad sense of the word (contribution to
society as a whole, government is less often the right word) is very
challenging indeed if you ask me. Some things only work when everyone
pitches in. Reducing climate destruction will not be possible without
universally agreed upon rules or very aggressive resistance by ... pretty
much all buying power. The latter hasn't happened ever, not without a
governing organ explicitly "boycotting" something. We're entering a very
murky discussion here which I think shouldn't be required.
Let's say "do something for the good of all of *cared-for-group-name* that
will cost the individual more than the individual will profit from it".
Becoming vegetarian is an example. It doesn't work if just that one person
does it, but it does cost that person something.
You're right in that 10% is pretty darn high. Only Israel gets to that
number. About 5% of gov' taxes goes to defense though. With developed
countries' tax pressure at ~35% (US only ~25%) that makes 0.35 * 0.05 =
0.0175 or about 2% of your money. Only a fifth of what I asked you for.
Then you say you did *additional* things to secure yourself. Let's say 2%
is about right for a personal defense budget.
Knowing that committing a murder is cheaper than preventing one, by a
factor I'm not aware of, and that murder can sometimes have an economic
advantage you will find that murder will exist. (see also estimated victims
and cost of prevention of terrorism. Now see the costs of hitmen (find a
cheap one).)
Having a public market for hitmen will make it cheaper. Having a
crowdfunding posibility will enable a new *class* of people, those with
lesser profit from it, to still contribute to a kill. This model doesn't
show failures and thus misguides hitmen into thinking it is easy money,
distorting the market in the unpreferred direction. Observe how "no
retribution" significantly reduces the estimated cost of a murdering
I simply think you wouldn't get the type of civilization where you could
focus on development of the race as a whole. A way to live more than just
for your own little life, but for that of your family and "comrades".
If you don't do that you choose the most painful way to die; to live.
For real, right? Frikkin' goody two shoeses. Can't understand their
People in your neighborhood have a (perhaps unspoken) currency of
reputation. Their warning to others would be reciprocated. That idea makes
them do it. You don't have to consider this rational or good for the
individual, evolution made sure that it increases the size of the
population. This is not personally advantageous, it's popularly
advantageous. Evolution made you a less rational being to cause your
existence. Very philosophical standpoint. "Humans aren't rational,
therefore they can exist". Anyway.
There might very well be examples of true mutually beneficial cases. For
example if a wallet's finder may keep a percentage of the wallet's
contents. The finder has this dilemma:
Max( wallet.content * captureRiskFactor, wallet.content * rewardFactor +
If the wallet's finder is found out (the owner found him) he will lose the
reward. The risk factor is 0 to 1. 10% chance of getting caught makes
content * 0.1. This is the expected profit. Everyone on this list really
should know about expected returns and all. Only when the rewardFactor is
bigger than his riskfactor will he give the wallet back. You'll find that
even this is not actually mutually beneficial, lets the wallet has
different values for both people. This is generally true, maybe a family
picture, ID's that have to be rerequested at a cost, etc. While the cash is
all that's good to the finder.
The emotional bonus is the thing that causes people to be vegetarian and is
also the typical reason people obey the law. It's part of the unlikely
risk-adverseness common in people nowadays. I guess safely living worse is
better than maybe living better in terms of survival.
Anyway again. Given such proper gametheory you'll find it hard to find
situations where one would be interested in protecting another unrelated
human being.
At some point crime will stabilize at a certain level. That level is where
people are so generally scared of a crime against them, yet not scared of
retribution for their protests against crime, that they'll put efforts (in
financial or other form) into reducing the level of criminality.
You'll find their first move is closing assassination markets to increase
the effective cost and risk of finding a murderer to do one's bidding. It's
by far the cheapest way to reduce murder.
Once there's a string of crimes you'd rather barricade your home than
collectively hire a detective. Maybe you'll have a guard on your street.
But you wouldn't donate to a crime lab doing experimental research. That's
just too little directly visible return. Ad-hoc patchwork solutions.
(Paying safety money for example)
An assassination pool however has very direct and clear payoffs if it ever
happens. Easy to put money towards out of a simple grudge.
Excuses for the subpar use of language. My End Of Day has been reached.
Could you try to summarize the arguments we've been throwing at each other?
I'd like to reach some sort of satisfying answer.
I think you estimate the cost of protection to be comparable to the cost of
attacks. I think protection is far more expensive and although likely a
more popular expense (let's say people are generally good, witchhunts and
discrimination would suggest otherwise but w/e) also more frequently a
smaller expense, as the profit derived from it is very hard to determine
and the profit would hardly alter by a personal contribution. Therewith
creating a game theory scenario (a simple one!) where general safety will
dwindle as to alter our society significantly and make crime an auctioned
commodity. Subverting any way of life not strictly egoistical. (What was
the last time you donated to your police station?)
As you see my summary turned into another piece of argument. Excuses
Eeyorish is a nice word btw. And after a string of crimes is a tad late.
And who'd notice it's a string of crimes?

@_subject: RetroShare 
I am presently using it. I have connected with a significant portion of the
network. I find it is largely inert.
The software is not without flaws. It's design is monolithic, causing any
error to crash the entire system. Plugins increase the fatal error surface,
attack surface and functionality.
The greatest problem with plugins is that I'm never sure how they deal with
my anonymity.
I think Retroshare could well be replaced by something alike Tor, but not
Tor, then to have some quantity of programs connect to it to do interesting
things. That makes it more confusing that it exists, because Tor does
already too.
So, why use Retroshare instead of a Tor hidden service with standard chat
relay? Because Tor is a target and RetroShare is not. And because
Retroshare actually does a lot more than relay chat.
I do not have a solid recommendation. I use it for curiosity reasons now.
Although occasionally stimulating in it's novelty I find it unfit
technically and practically for critical work. It still seems to be the
best tool for the job, not unlike the rock-and-stick tools were the best
for cutting lumber in days long past.

2013/11/16 rysiek It's basic concepts are pretty well considered. It's quite like Tor only
the first nodes are "trusted nodes" and not just any random one. That said
I think the whole RetroShare thingy is shot to hell regarding traffic
analysis. That's hard for everyone except the Top Secret level people.
Far as I know there's no deep-communication tactics except
store-and-forward for forums. That's some weakness if you ask me. Finding a
file based on a hash requires broadcasting the request for the hash, which
will likely flood through (part of) the network. Tracing back a flood is
pretty easy with a few nodes.
Invest in it? Not a bad thing to invest in. But it's not that special on
the crypto/security level AFAIK. I think the whole P2P thing is a bigger

2013/11/18 Cathal Garvey Yeah, Retroshare is Tor except with a different mechanism for finding
peers. I don't see how that is the opposite of Tor. The "opposite" of Tor
probably wouldn't use Onion Routing. BitTorrent might be closest to the
opposite of Tor.
Why does the DHT require a cryptographic quality hash? I agree that SHA1 is
too weak to be cryptographic, but a DHT is merely finding chains of other
nodes. Worst that can happen is the adversary manipulating you into
connecting to them with higher chance. Given the whole friend-to-friend
mechanisms I don't see much harm in that. Depends on the plugin that runs
above it.
I must say that this is exactly the sort of thing I think makes RetroShare
risky. Some choices can be conditionally okay. Building a big stack of
software lacks overview easily.

they do not need it (their dedication is to science, not to carnal
pleasures). 1.5MBTC for 11 years is still a pretty high salary. But this is
in "employment terms".

However if you believe Bitcoin will stay at around 600 euro's (oh wait it's
700 today already, haha) than that's quite strange. If you think it'll stay
at around 4x more (2400) than you're probably still thinking quite
strangely. See, Bitcoin has a very unusual market mechanic. And Satoshi is
rewarding himself in how much the system is used, the sum of all banks his
software replaces will be his money. But nobody is paying him directly and
his efforts are definitely not a markted good.
Why shouldn't it? Because if satoshi lives in a huge home, spending freely,
with several people assisting him in whatever whilst owning some companies
that'll do things he deems important (squirrle rescue patrol, private
police, education, art displays, helping the poor, etc) then he didn't need
this much. Having this much of what might become world wealth simply isn't
reasonable for what the money stands for. Somewhere I feel it unfair that
someone who works at the top of his abilities in a more profitable field
gets paid more, but it isn't actually unfair. But the amount of buying
power that Satoshi now represents is so exeedingly vast, and will be so
much vaster, I cannot fantom it "fair".
The best we can go for is the amount being "realistic" and "result of a
fair and honest process". And I think that because a buyer of Bitcoin has
no reason to be interested in economic or Satoshi, just in his personal
profits, we have a game-theory situation where Satoshi is paid in a way
that nobody is interested in observing. After all, every Bitcoin you buy
makes the Bitcoin scarcer at your expense and Satoshi profits. And because
of this game theory problem I don't feel there is a market-related effect
being placed on Satoshi's efforts.
The bottom line is: wealth distribution fairness was never a core design
goal of Bitcoin.

2013/11/27 Juan Garofalo I would be totally fine with Bitcoin going darknet. Doesn't lower the
value. Problem is that all legitimate dealings are made much harder, and
humanity's freedom is decreased significantly. I wouldn't say I whined
about it though. And the whole part about evil is just the opinion of the
enforced legal system.
Our dear dread pirate was an insane moron for living in America though.
That doesn't change at all.
How long's the ponzi scheme going to last though?
This is the kind of scheme that could last indefinitely. I visualize a
ponzi scheme as a funnel shaped like piramid growing downwards. Every
"brick" layed at the bottom flows some air up and out through the tip. The
tip flows towards the creator of the system. All the pieces higher in the
piramid get some air too. In bitcoin the hole at the tip is closed.
Although the pressure on the top increases (there's some gravity effect)
there is no money dissapearing.
There's a significant illusion that everyone involved in the system could
"cash out" for a certain price. Market dynamics don't allow such an event
to occur though.
You'll note that all commodities follow the same mechanism, except for
commodities being translatable to other valueable things intrisically.
Currency, USD, EUR, JPY, pretty much all others too, follow the same
mechanism completely except for the fact that governments can (and do)
choose to inflate a currency.
I answered this extensively because people have become allergic to
discussing Bitcoin in the ponzi light. There's definitely similarities
between Bitcoin and a Ponzi scheme. It is *VITAL *to note that
*every currency* has those similarities, but they are not easily seen.

2013/11/29 Patrick Chkoreff I think we disagree here. Game theory doesn't support this standpoint. I am
sure having no crime would be better for humanity than the other way
around. But to commit a crime can be extremely profitable, emotionally or
financially. And for me to protect others is not profitable for me
directly. It's like taxes, it's good for society if everyone just pays
their taxes (provided the taxes are fair). But do I want to pay taxes? I
don't know anyone that looks forward to paying his taxes.

I don't quite see this argument. A murderer and a police officer have
opposing motives. A person in the street will back away from both to
prevent getting hurt, even if he might help either achieve his/her goal.

@_subject: Interesting take on Sanjuro's Assassination Market 
2013/11/29 Patrick Chkoreff This deserves further explanation. I do think game theory is extremely
present in all of our society. We'd be more happy to have other pay tax and
not us, than to also pay taxes ourselves.
Arguing against "taxes" in the broad sense of the word (contribution to
society as a whole, government is less often the right word) is very
challenging indeed if you ask me. Some things only work when everyone
pitches in. Reducing climate destruction will not be possible without
universally agreed upon rules or very aggressive resistance by ... pretty
much all buying power. The latter hasn't happened ever, not without a
governing organ explicitly "boycotting" something. We're entering a very
murky discussion here which I think shouldn't be required.
Let's say "do something for the good of all of *cared-for-group-name* that
will cost the individual more than the individual will profit from it".
Becoming vegetarian is an example. It doesn't work if just that one person
does it, but it does cost that person something.
You're right in that 10% is pretty darn high. Only Israel gets to that
number. About 5% of gov' taxes goes to defense though. With developed
countries' tax pressure at ~35% (US only ~25%) that makes 0.35 * 0.05 =
0.0175 or about 2% of your money. Only a fifth of what I asked you for.
Then you say you did *additional* things to secure yourself. Let's say 2%
is about right for a personal defense budget.
Knowing that committing a murder is cheaper than preventing one, by a
factor I'm not aware of, and that murder can sometimes have an economic
advantage you will find that murder will exist. (see also estimated victims
and cost of prevention of terrorism. Now see the costs of hitmen (find a
cheap one).)
Having a public market for hitmen will make it cheaper. Having a
crowdfunding posibility will enable a new *class* of people, those with
lesser profit from it, to still contribute to a kill. This model doesn't
show failures and thus misguides hitmen into thinking it is easy money,
distorting the market in the unpreferred direction. Observe how "no
retribution" significantly reduces the estimated cost of a murdering
I simply think you wouldn't get the type of civilization where you could
focus on development of the race as a whole. A way to live more than just
for your own little life, but for that of your family and "comrades".
If you don't do that you choose the most painful way to die; to live.
For real, right? Frikkin' goody two shoeses. Can't understand their
People in your neighborhood have a (perhaps unspoken) currency of
reputation. Their warning to others would be reciprocated. That idea makes
them do it. You don't have to consider this rational or good for the
individual, evolution made sure that it increases the size of the
population. This is not personally advantageous, it's popularly
advantageous. Evolution made you a less rational being to cause your
existence. Very philosophical standpoint. "Humans aren't rational,
therefore they can exist". Anyway.
There might very well be examples of true mutually beneficial cases. For
example if a wallet's finder may keep a percentage of the wallet's
contents. The finder has this dilemma:
Max( wallet.content * captureRiskFactor, wallet.content * rewardFactor +
If the wallet's finder is found out (the owner found him) he will lose the
reward. The risk factor is 0 to 1. 10% chance of getting caught makes
content * 0.1. This is the expected profit. Everyone on this list really
should know about expected returns and all. Only when the rewardFactor is
bigger than his riskfactor will he give the wallet back. You'll find that
even this is not actually mutually beneficial, lets the wallet has
different values for both people. This is generally true, maybe a family
picture, ID's that have to be rerequested at a cost, etc. While the cash is
all that's good to the finder.
The emotional bonus is the thing that causes people to be vegetarian and is
also the typical reason people obey the law. It's part of the unlikely
risk-adverseness common in people nowadays. I guess safely living worse is
better than maybe living better in terms of survival.
Anyway again. Given such proper gametheory you'll find it hard to find
situations where one would be interested in protecting another unrelated
human being.
At some point crime will stabilize at a certain level. That level is where
people are so generally scared of a crime against them, yet not scared of
retribution for their protests against crime, that they'll put efforts (in
financial or other form) into reducing the level of criminality.
You'll find their first move is closing assassination markets to increase
the effective cost and risk of finding a murderer to do one's bidding. It's
by far the cheapest way to reduce murder.
Once there's a string of crimes you'd rather barricade your home than
collectively hire a detective. Maybe you'll have a guard on your street.
But you wouldn't donate to a crime lab doing experimental research. That's
just too little directly visible return. Ad-hoc patchwork solutions.
(Paying safety money for example)
An assassination pool however has very direct and clear payoffs if it ever
happens. Easy to put money towards out of a simple grudge.
Excuses for the subpar use of language. My End Of Day has been reached.
Could you try to summarize the arguments we've been throwing at each other?
I'd like to reach some sort of satisfying answer.
I think you estimate the cost of protection to be comparable to the cost of
attacks. I think protection is far more expensive and although likely a
more popular expense (let's say people are generally good, witchhunts and
discrimination would suggest otherwise but w/e) also more frequently a
smaller expense, as the profit derived from it is very hard to determine
and the profit would hardly alter by a personal contribution. Therewith
creating a game theory scenario (a simple one!) where general safety will
dwindle as to alter our society significantly and make crime an auctioned
commodity. Subverting any way of life not strictly egoistical. (What was
the last time you donated to your police station?)
As you see my summary turned into another piece of argument. Excuses
Eeyorish is a nice word btw. And after a string of crimes is a tad late.
And who'd notice it's a string of crimes?

2013/10/2 Ted Smith If you say anarchy is part of cypherpunkism (if that's a thing) I simply
disagree with you. Truly that idea is shortsighted. Anarchy knows no peace
or focus. There is chaos until there is again order. And chaos, however
pleasing in it's unlimited shape, knows not mercy. Mercy it is that the
masses wish for, usually however it is mercy for their ignorance.
You too, need mercy for you ignorance. As do I.
Proclaiming not to support straight anarchy then what do you support? The
United States of America has, in its founding documents, a guarantee that
the people agree it functions as it should, or rebel to correct it. As it
should is also recorded, including a means of agreeing as a people.
This agreement has led to laws. These laws are executed by a blind
organization. This is as the people have wanted it, and even now permit it
to operate.
Now, I do not want to be part of the USA. This is exceedingly difficult, as
the peoples of the world have allowed it to grow to undeniable and
typically irresistible power.
Now you are saying that those who are willing parts of the USA, have
supported it and not changed it, have failed to adhere to it's laws and
receive the (according to the people of the USA) appropriate treatment. And
you tell me it is unethical to celebrate?
Getting off the high-and-mighty-seat I'd say the guy was a nutcase for

2013/10/2 Juan Garofalo Anarchy as a word does not mean a thing. It's the people in it that shape
it. This is as much as risk as it is a feature. From chaos men makes
shapes, structures. These structures must, by the very absence of it,
reimplement what otherwise a government does. Of course the extends and all
will depend upon the people.
Economically I can fairly say that every function will be taken over by the
group that can do the task as financially efficient as possible. Combining
that with the historic fact that kingdoms and empires, due to people's
ignorance, are the easiest structures to conjure. And that ease makes it
have a good return.
So. My thinking is that anarchy that remains anarchy is in fact quite
chaotic, as no real leaders are permitted to arise. Of course it's possible
to have discussions together, to rule as a non-forcible collective. That's
a very unstable situation however. Just like chaos.
Now if you'd be so kind to tell me why your tone was so insulting and the
reasons for thinking the way you do, then perhaps this can become an
interesting conversation.

2013/10/3 Juan Garofalo This system fails in the sight of coercion by force. In fact coercion of
any kind reduces the ideals *i think *you hold it to have.
The other way around is not true, a system of force is not destroyed by
acting in only voluntary means. Merely by there being no opponents to those
that act forcefully. An essential proposal of government is monopoly on
violence. For if there is none able to combat a singular forceful actor
force is no longer a viable means of coercion.
And other means must be used to coerce. These means are defined in that
same government. In the simplest case an oracle is used to provide right
from wrong, the king or emperor. Nowadays we see faux-democratic
organizations that, ideally, enforce the tyranny of the masses. There's a
contest between tyranny of the masses and exploitation/corruption by those
with financial incentives or a desire for power.
The idea that coercion can be communicated about fairly I support strongly,
it guarantees a minimum amount of power one can have.
I'm not cheering the US (drug) laws. Please try to understand. I simply
recognize the arrested man continued to live in an area where people comply

If you prevent these structures from arising at all there is not even the
ability for two person interaction. If you permit these structures to a
certain level you have (a political problem with no means to deal with it
and) leaders, to the extend you permit.
You are making a very binary distinction between a leader and the
followers, but you must understand that one must always follow an idea.
Whatever presents the idea becomes the leader. That leader may be fair,
however, and this is what governments nowadays pretend to be. In fact, most
people do agree that the way it is done now is the best way we can.
"Many forms of Government have been tried and will be tried in this world
of sin and woe. No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise.
Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government
except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time." and
Churchill was certainly a leader.
You will find that everyone becoming his own country is not a more pleasant
form of governance. Especially not when you will form unions.
I have speculated about that extremism. Of course it is possible to have a
"United Peoples" instead of "United Nations", where every person is
required to contributed the way the UN requires it, and every person must
enter into treaties of his/her liking.
Sadly it fails due to the people's ignorance. The likelihood you will have
a fruitful life, lived pleasantly, becomes lower.
Taking what I said above as the starting point, doesn't it seem likely a
large group of people will enter into a "Trade Union of Amsterdam
Constitutional Treaty" where those people may exclusively trade with each
other, lest explicitly mentioned in the treaty, and there is a committee
assigned for the justitional needs of the union, etc, etc ,etc. You
recreate government with peculiar overhead.
The step towards warring between people is oh so very small. It will be
legal, certainly, but some treaties may demand retribution or punishment of
the war starter. Not unlike a murdered would now be judged and charged and
Freedom is not served by this system. Neither is wealth or comfort.
Now, you can say of course that that's not supposed to happen. Or that that
would make it "not anarchy" anymore. But the truth is then that it is easy
to become "not anarchy" and hard to stay anarchy.
That's what I mean with "That's a very unstable situation".

2013/10/2 Ted Smith If you say anarchy is part of cypherpunkism (if that's a thing) I simply
disagree with you. Truly that idea is shortsighted. Anarchy knows no peace
or focus. There is chaos until there is again order. And chaos, however
pleasing in it's unlimited shape, knows not mercy. Mercy it is that the
masses wish for, usually however it is mercy for their ignorance.
You too, need mercy for you ignorance. As do I.
Proclaiming not to support straight anarchy then what do you support? The
United States of America has, in its founding documents, a guarantee that
the people agree it functions as it should, or rebel to correct it. As it
should is also recorded, including a means of agreeing as a people.
This agreement has led to laws. These laws are executed by a blind
organization. This is as the people have wanted it, and even now permit it
to operate.
Now, I do not want to be part of the USA. This is exceedingly difficult, as
the peoples of the world have allowed it to grow to undeniable and
typically irresistible power.
Now you are saying that those who are willing parts of the USA, have
supported it and not changed it, have failed to adhere to it's laws and
receive the (according to the people of the USA) appropriate treatment. And
you tell me it is unethical to celebrate?
Getting off the high-and-mighty-seat I'd say the guy was a nutcase for
being in America. Completely unnecessary leaking of information about
himself while becoming high profile enough to get scrutiny of the highest
quality. I just can't imagine how he imagined he'd get out underneath it.
He even had the DHS on his footstep and, like everyone else who gets
caught, decided that it was probably no problem (it was just for the ID's!
I will not repeat myself upon what I am celebrating.

You can deny as much as you want that most Americans like the DEA's
function, but that won't save you. The masses are against you because
they're stupid. Realize it, asshole. You should understand what's going on
and what is always going on. Either you stay on its good side, or you
better be damn sure you know what it's thinking. That's more than a full
time job. Waiver a moment and you will fail.
Two things are infinite. The universe and the dumb masses. Both might kill
you on a whim, without the ears to hear your reasons nor the will needed to

At first I frowned and wondered why. Then I thought it was likely a joke
and if it wasn't then what's the problem with al-qaeda? Also a distinct
lack of right-to-left garbage spewing at me.
Of course putting things into the people's hands (truly and irrevocably) is
something that's very cypherpunk. In that sense it's also very anarchist,
as permission from anyone is not required to take that power.
Yet I'd maintain that laws a very much part of every *software *ever

restriction on what you can and what you can't is precise and unforgiving.

2013/10/2 Juan Garofalo Anarchy as a word does not mean a thing. It's the people in it that shape
it. This is as much as risk as it is a feature. From chaos men makes
shapes, structures. These structures must, by the very absence of it,
reimplement what otherwise a government does. Of course the extends and all
will depend upon the people.
Economically I can fairly say that every function will be taken over by the
group that can do the task as financially efficient as possible. Combining
that with the historic fact that kingdoms and empires, due to people's
ignorance, are the easiest structures to conjure. And that ease makes it
have a good return.
So. My thinking is that anarchy that remains anarchy is in fact quite
chaotic, as no real leaders are permitted to arise. Of course it's possible
to have discussions together, to rule as a non-forcible collective. That's
a very unstable situation however. Just like chaos.
Now if you'd be so kind to tell me why your tone was so insulting and the
reasons for thinking the way you do, then perhaps this can become an
interesting conversation.

2013/10/3 Juan Garofalo This system fails in the sight of coercion by force. In fact coercion of
any kind reduces the ideals *i think *you hold it to have.
The other way around is not true, a system of force is not destroyed by
acting in only voluntary means. Merely by there being no opponents to those
that act forcefully. An essential proposal of government is monopoly on
violence. For if there is none able to combat a singular forceful actor
force is no longer a viable means of coercion.
And other means must be used to coerce. These means are defined in that
same government. In the simplest case an oracle is used to provide right
from wrong, the king or emperor. Nowadays we see faux-democratic
organizations that, ideally, enforce the tyranny of the masses. There's a
contest between tyranny of the masses and exploitation/corruption by those
with financial incentives or a desire for power.
The idea that coercion can be communicated about fairly I support strongly,
it guarantees a minimum amount of power one can have.
I'm not cheering the US (drug) laws. Please try to understand. I simply
recognize the arrested man continued to live in an area where people comply
fully to US laws. And I recognize that Americans consider their government
to have the intended functionality for else they would be compelled to
revolt against it. An exercise also guaranteed by their constitution.
Part of it should feel quite provoking to Americans themselves. I hope it
is. If I were American I would be beyond disgusted by my governing and it's
systems. And I would be patriotic, defending the original values by which
the US were founded.

If you want to say something, say it clearly. These statements are of
exclusively emotional value, and they contain no reasons. If you wish to

I would also propose that in fact most governments now are voluntary
societies. However they exert force on those who choose to participate
partially, and choose for some unable to choose. These things I consider
despicable but also to some extend necessary and unavoidable.
As to this man, he was capable to halt his participation in the Union but
he was not willing. This argument does not apply to him.
If 'people' 'reimplement' what government does, then we are not talking
So in anarchy there is no maintenance of dykes, no roads, no legal tender
or banks, no armies, no system of justice and no encouragement of certain
economic operations?
Reimplement, in anarchy, just means do it. For a profit or charity in all
likelihood. I don't really see why you'd be better off with a "private
cooperation" fighting a war over a government fighting a war. You also
recreate the problems of governance in those "private co-operations".
Note that any union of people for a purpose constitutes a cooperation or

If you prevent these structures from arising at all there is not even the
ability for two person interaction. If you permit these structures to a
certain level you have (a political problem with no means to deal with it
and) leaders, to the extend you permit.
You are making a very binary distinction between a leader and the
followers, but you must understand that one must always follow an idea.
Whatever presents the idea becomes the leader. That leader may be fair,
however, and this is what governments nowadays pretend to be. In fact, most
people do agree that the way it is done now is the best way we can.
"Many forms of Government have been tried and will be tried in this world
of sin and woe. No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise.
Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government
except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time." and
Churchill was certainly a leader.
You will find that everyone becoming his own country is not a more pleasant
form of governance. Especially not when you will form unions.
I have speculated about that extremism. Of course it is possible to have a
"United Peoples" instead of "United Nations", where every person is
required to contributed the way the UN requires it, and every person must
enter into treaties of his/her liking.
Sadly it fails due to the people's ignorance. The likelihood you will have
a fruitful life, lived pleasantly, becomes lower.
Taking what I said above as the starting point, doesn't it seem likely a
large group of people will enter into a "Trade Union of Amsterdam
Constitutional Treaty" where those people may exclusively trade with each
other, lest explicitly mentioned in the treaty, and there is a committee
assigned for the justitional needs of the union, etc, etc ,etc. You
recreate government with peculiar overhead.
The step towards warring between people is oh so very small. It will be
legal, certainly, but some treaties may demand retribution or punishment of
the war starter. Not unlike a murdered would now be judged and charged and
Freedom is not served by this system. Neither is wealth or comfort.
Now, you can say of course that that's not supposed to happen. Or that that
would make it "not anarchy" anymore. But the truth is then that it is easy
to become "not anarchy" and hard to stay anarchy.
That's what I mean with "That's a very unstable situation".

you think makes it unclear. There's however provisions for secret rulings
that are still in effect. This law was passed legally and in accordance
with earlier safeguards and with no revolt from the people.
I'd say that if there's agreement on these things being okay, then it must
be "not a crime". Of course it's not "extra-judicial" either.
What we think about it personally, well, that's just not the same question,
is it?
Although it's a good answer. Maybe "sometimes it's legal" would be more
direct. "someone" isn't a specific enough target. "Paying someone $150,000
for an illlegal murder isn't a crime in your country?" would be a better
question, but you can see how it answers itself. "Is paying $150,00 ever
legal in your country?" -"Yes" would be the perfect question.

2013/10/3 Juan Garofalo This system fails in the sight of coercion by force. In fact coercion of
any kind reduces the ideals *i think *you hold it to have.
The other way around is not true, a system of force is not destroyed by
acting in only voluntary means. Merely by there being no opponents to those
that act forcefully. An essential proposal of government is monopoly on
violence. For if there is none able to combat a singular forceful actor
force is no longer a viable means of coercion.
And other means must be used to coerce. These means are defined in that
same government. In the simplest case an oracle is used to provide right
from wrong, the king or emperor. Nowadays we see faux-democratic
organizations that, ideally, enforce the tyranny of the masses. There's a
contest between tyranny of the masses and exploitation/corruption by those
with financial incentives or a desire for power.
The idea that coercion can be communicated about fairly I support strongly,
it guarantees a minimum amount of power one can have.

You are making a very binary distinction between a leader and the
followers, but you must understand that one must always follow an idea.
Whatever presents the idea becomes the leader. That leader may be fair,
however, and this is what governments nowadays pretend to be. In fact, most
people do agree that the way it is done now is the best way we can.
"Many forms of Government have been tried and will be tried in this world
of sin and woe. No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise.
Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government
except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time." and
Churchill was certainly a leader.
You will find that everyone becoming his own country is not a more pleasant
form of governance. Especially not when you will form unions.
I have speculated about that extremism. Of course it is possible to have a
"United Peoples" instead of "United Nations", where every person is
required to contributed the way the UN requires it, and every person must
enter into treaties of his/her liking.
Sadly it fails due to the people's ignorance. The likelihood you will have
a fruitful life, lived pleasantly, becomes lower.
Taking what I said above as the starting point, doesn't it seem likely a
large group of people will enter into a "Trade Union of Amsterdam
Constitutional Treaty" where those people may exclusively trade with each
other, lest explicitly mentioned in the treaty, and there is a committee
assigned for the justitional needs of the union, etc, etc ,etc. You
recreate government with peculiar overhead.
The step towards warring between people is oh so very small. It will be
legal, certainly, but some treaties may demand retribution or punishment of
the war starter. Not unlike a murdered would now be judged and charged and
Freedom is not served by this system. Neither is wealth or comfort.
Now, you can say of course that that's not supposed to happen. Or that that
would make it "not anarchy" anymore. But the truth is then that it is easy
to become "not anarchy" and hard to stay anarchy.
That's what I mean with "That's a very unstable situation".

2013/10/18 James A. Donald This is a syntatic non sequitur. Why would fake entropy interfere with a
microphone's function? How is the microphone guaranteed to have "its
microphone function"? Is a microphone input just the microphone's jack or
an actual soundwave-modulated-magnetic-power-factor?
In either case it's also a semantic non sequitor. If someone plays a darn
loud sine wave in the serverroom you can be sure the microphone will
replicate it. It'd be doable to make any microphone always output it's
maximum value, through a plenty of means. The sad thing is that it's sound,
so it might even be doable at distance!
(scenario: people breaking into a running-but-physically-controlled server
through manipulation of it's random numbers)
I think an internal radioactive source such as a smoke alarm makes great
sense. Be wary to isolate it very well to prevent outside interference. If
it just goes to MAXINT if someone holds his cube of madam curie next to the
server's case it'd be a shame.
 Bell: wouldn't such a ring oscillator aggregate be subject to
patterns? If you have something that can create more out of fewer pieces of
randomness, isn't there plenty bad-randomness-sources to go on?
 Callas:
How is this random generator affected by CPU Interrupts? It seems to be a
feature added for "more randomness", but given interrupts are far from
guaranteed (especially in problematic systems) you cannot depend upon them.
Especially because random numbers are harder on smaller systems I'm not
sure I'd call this solution elegant.
I believe stir-back is not always possible but a very strong feature. If
you can always stir-back, can't you always generate something fairly random
by simulating a x-times-stir-back? If you can't, how can you trust your
stir-backs to be spaced enough for your -x-times-stir-back to not happen
Lastly I feel your way of dealing with the pool-distiller model is finicky.
If you hash a pool your hash will be able to fold onto itself very often
and bits of entropy in different places can have different effects. You're
placing an unusual amount of faith in your hash function on it being
perfect. Diffusion with a partially known sourcetext is very, very murky
business. And with predictable data going into your pool you're essentially
creating a probably partially known plaintext. That's complex, and that'll
do you good, but it is not the kind of nice randomness you'd go for.
A suggestion I'd like to make is a laser & light strength measurement unit.
Neatly self contained and accurate enough it can measure the bending of
spacetime itself. I suppose anything even nearly that accurate will measure
it's direct environment's noise so well it all doesn't matter anyway.
Something like Delta(cpu_magneticness_mid_cycle) would do wonders. Anything
dependent on the activity of the computer itself gives problems with people
manipulating what the computer is doing. More rough it could measure minute
changes in the movement and heat of flowing air.

something insecure. All the while making them believe it's secure.
I suppose the more secure countries are Iran, Cuba, Russia. Those are
(*should be) isolated from NSA developments and should be at about public
level. Russia might not be that ignorant though, best stick with Cuba. Iran
and North Korea should be 100% monitored and likely don't run any Tor
nodes. This is on the basis of their hostility towards America (&friends)
and with that the assumption of isolation from their developments and no
cooperation. China is hard to judge but might also be better than anything
else. Hong Kong might be the best in China. HK is in China's womb yet, like
a baby, it isn't China.
All of the less-than-stable Africa seems like a good target. Too busy
running crime or trying to keep stuff together to have developed
international spy agencies. South Africa might have an agreement with GB/US
(doesn't actually matter which) so I'd avoid them. The northern
"dictator-band" has been/is being disassembled. The US is likely only
involved to protect its interests now that the obedient dummy dictators are
gone. That means there's no telling what the status of surveillance is, but
it might be very good (iow: absent). Regardless the Internet connections
are unreliable and the security will likely be US-colors soon enough.
Asia except for China is hard to judge (for me). Taiwan (aka "Republic of
China", hilarious story that is) is developed and connected but has had
trouble getting recognition/allegiance due to the People's Republic of
China.  No clue about security allegiances. Can imagine it's been declaring
its independence so hard it doesn't have any, and might be a good target.
Any of the not-that-developed countries should be decent exit points (the
whole Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Laos (esp. Laos), Myanmar,  Philippines,
Indonesia group). (There's quite some difference between those countries,
but I *think* they still end up in the same category). Singapore is a total
The whole region around India I have no knowledge off. India and Pakistan
are both very mixed in their level of development to a point where
mass-surveillance just doesn't make sense. They're also nuclear powers,
which does testify to their willingness and ability to stand up to world
powers. Probably good exit points.
All the middle east is probably bad because of oil/militairy interests.
Special mention of Isreal as being extremely bad.
Turkey too is subject to military interests and wants to be EU and whatnot
so let's just avoid them. EU is all surveillance or wants to be
surveillance. Eastern Europe has the developmental backlog that might've
caused them to push it further down the to-do list. Greece, Italy, Spain,
might be so busy not going bankrupt that they've skimped on the
surveillance. Morocco and Algeria are oddballs, close to the EU but nothing
else (deserts) they might've not had purpose for surveillance, yet have
better connections than the rest of Africa. (Tunisia?)
The world feels pretty good about the Nordic countries but I think they
just tie into the US+ spynet so that makes them useless. Iceland's small
population and distance to everything made it really nice, now I'm not so
sure. The amount of attention means the pressure should be rising. No idea
how that'll work out. The population is small enough to be smart. I suppose

mesh networking that I might release once. You have n connections to n
nodes (1 on 1) and you continuously flow (both directions) random data over
it. Occasionally instead of random data you put an encrypted package in it.
The other end continuously (tries to) decrypt packages. This way you never
know if something is being sent or not, at the cost of some bandwidth.
generate random > send buffer
secret package > send buffer
send buffer > stream encryption > transmit buffer
transmit buffer > rate limited connection to peer
on the other side:
receive buffer > stream decryption > package detector > usual way of
dealing with incoming packages.
If you never actually use these trickle connections, but you do have them,
you can deny being the origin of packages (I didn't know what it was! I got
it over a trickle connection!). If you mark packages as "top secret" they
should only be send over trickles and they'll never be network observable
at all.
Additional tricks such as delayed further transmission, network path
mixing, etc. are all possible with what I have in my paper and should be

Street lanterns (depending on the type) might make them invisible at night

bandwidth too. Quite like fiber, except for the ideal transmission.
And that highlights the problems. You have to keep the laser pointed, that

Now, who would just *love *to get people off something secure, and onto
something insecure. All the while making them believe it's secure.
I suppose the more secure countries are Iran, Cuba, Russia. Those are
(*should be) isolated from NSA developments and should be at about public
level. Russia might not be that ignorant though, best stick with Cuba. Iran
and North Korea should be 100% monitored and likely don't run any Tor
nodes. This is on the basis of their hostility towards America (&friends)
and with that the assumption of isolation from their developments and no
cooperation. China is hard to judge but might also be better than anything
else. Hong Kong might be the best in China. HK is in China's womb yet, like
a baby, it isn't China.
All of the less-than-stable Africa seems like a good target. Too busy
running crime or trying to keep stuff together to have developed
international spy agencies. South Africa might have an agreement with GB/US
(doesn't actually matter which) so I'd avoid them. The northern
"dictator-band" has been/is being disassembled. The US is likely only
involved to protect its interests now that the obedient dummy dictators are
gone. That means there's no telling what the status of surveillance is, but
it might be very good (iow: absent). Regardless the Internet connections
are unreliable and the security will likely be US-colors soon enough.
Asia except for China is hard to judge (for me). Taiwan (aka "Republic of
China", hilarious story that is) is developed and connected but has had
trouble getting recognition/allegiance due to the People's Republic of
China.  No clue about security allegiances. Can imagine it's been declaring
its independence so hard it doesn't have any, and might be a good target.
Any of the not-that-developed countries should be decent exit points (the
whole Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Laos (esp. Laos), Myanmar,  Philippines,
Indonesia group). (There's quite some difference between those countries,
but I *think* they still end up in the same category). Singapore is a total
The whole region around India I have no knowledge off. India and Pakistan
are both very mixed in their level of development to a point where
mass-surveillance just doesn't make sense. They're also nuclear powers,
which does testify to their willingness and ability to stand up to world
powers. Probably good exit points.
All the middle east is probably bad because of oil/militairy interests.
Special mention of Isreal as being extremely bad.
Turkey too is subject to military interests and wants to be EU and whatnot
so let's just avoid them. EU is all surveillance or wants to be
surveillance. Eastern Europe has the developmental backlog that might've
caused them to push it further down the to-do list. Greece, Italy, Spain,
might be so busy not going bankrupt that they've skimped on the
surveillance. Morocco and Algeria are oddballs, close to the EU but nothing
else (deserts) they might've not had purpose for surveillance, yet have
better connections than the rest of Africa. (Tunisia?)
The world feels pretty good about the Nordic countries but I think they
just tie into the US+ spynet so that makes them useless. Iceland's small
population and distance to everything made it really nice, now I'm not so

how that'll work out. The population is small enough to be smart. I suppose
they're observed in any non-politically approved but still possible way.

2013/9/4 Kyle Maxwell I'm gonna go ahead and suggest trickle connections. It's in my paper about
mesh networking that I might release once. You have n connections to n
nodes (1 on 1) and you continuously flow (both directions) random data over
it. Occasionally instead of random data you put an encrypted package in it.
The other end continuously (tries to) decrypt packages. This way you never
know if something is being sent or not, at the cost of some bandwidth.
generate random > send buffer
secret package > send buffer
send buffer > stream encryption > transmit buffer
transmit buffer > rate limited connection to peer
on the other side:
receive buffer > stream decryption > package detector > usual way of
dealing with incoming packages.
If you never actually use these trickle connections, but you do have them,
you can deny being the origin of packages (I didn't know what it was! I got
it over a trickle connection!). If you mark packages as "top secret" they
should only be send over trickles and they'll never be network observable
at all.
Additional tricks such as delayed further transmission, network path
mixing, etc. are all possible with what I have in my paper and should be
(easily) doable in Tor.

I haven't been able to satisfy any clear conditions for being good or bad
guys. Not even for being patriots or not.
Ultimately it doesn't matter. Their jobs are inherently evil. Spying always
has been, but this is different because it involves everyone (even without
being suspect) and costs for additional invasion of privacy\surveillance is
negligible. Meaning a single person that doesn't do his/her job can ruin
the world (in *many* scenario's). Looking at Snowden there is not the kind
of security procedures to prevent it, either.
So. Are the NSA guys good guys? Well. They're the enemy of the people, as
they invade their privacy and therewith their safety. If you can be
blackmailed, studied, influenced, etc. you are weak and vulnerable.
Preaching to the choir, I guess. So I cannot call them good guys by a very
long shot.
Are the NSA guys bad guys? Well, they do anything to protect their nation
from whatever attack could happen (bad for non-US; me). They steal secrets
for their government (bad for non-US; me). They assist foreign secret
agencies in subverting or avoiding legal restrictions put in place to
protect citizens as (real/wise/elected) politicians see fit. (very bad for
non-US; me)
Uh. Yeah. I guess they're the bad guys. I usually feel like they are
soldiers on a certain mission, and so no blame comes to them. But I feel
more strongly that the organization is build to produce law-breaking,
privacy-destroying, unethical, unfriendly, aggressive, anticompetative,
distracting and confusing and ultimately just *mean* practices.
So yes: the NSA is *EVIL* to the maximum realistic extend.
The NSA's people enjoy a margin of appreciation. They're doing a job. They
have their reasons. But I do believe most of them are keenly aware of the
extremely large quantity of thoroughly unethical things their organization
is doing, and must be considered at least partially responsible.

A statement like this is trollbait. It might not be intentional, you might
even have a valid point, but presenting it like this will not help.
If you're talking about a step above pure technical you're usually talking
about a software's purpose. Then that purpose can be influenced by a
political believe as vague as anarchy, democracy, communism, capitalism,
liberty, etc. which are words that should be used sparingly and in a way
that acknowledges how terribly vague they are.
I think it's not right to say their technical expertise exists to serve
certain goals, many are doing it just for the hell of it. For the puzzles,
the challenges.

how will you create it?
There's constructive ways to deal with this.
Calling a person psycho is very relative, they have a model of reality.
IMHO it holds well enough for them not to be "psycho". They're definitely
killers, but that's what the military is supposed to be. So afaics
everything is okay.
The (US) government on one angle performing mass surveillance and on the
other hand preventing surveillance makes perfect sense to me. They're
different agencies, different people, different incentives, so the
conclusions (doing/preventing mass surveillance) are the correct ones in
both cases. The government working against itself is extremely common,
sometimes intentional, and a symbol of what's wrong with it.
Sadly it's also a symbol of what's wrong with capitalism. And anarchy (as
you usually advocate) implies capitalism, although it might not be about
capital. Just the struggle for ownership and control and an evolutionary
process of "consumer selection" to find the optimal situation or product.
Sounds idealistic? Now look upon anarchy again.

Do the Tor guys get US GOV funding? Yes.
Does that mean they're biased? It could, but it doesn't guarantee it.
Does it imply they're biased? Kinda, yeah.
Does that mean you can't trust them? Well, I honestly don't know. In some
cases it does.
Does that mean Tor is backdoored? It probably is, and would've been without
USGOV funding. If it wasn't backdoored it's almost certainly (at some
level) exploited, Heartbleed is here to prove that.
Which makes me wonder, why didn't Snowden disclose Heartbleed? I'll make a

Exhaustive list of possibilities (please extend where possible):
A Did not know
B Did not care
C Felt like it would negatively impact the NSA's (legitimate) functioning
D Didn't get around to it yet
E Snowden is an unconventional NSA set up
F Snowden's documents are not recent enough
A, is interesting, as it would show that the NSA has levels of secrecy and
secret data that go further than what they had so far. Something above "TOP
SECRET" should probably exist, and Snowden didn't find it. This actually
makes a lot of sense to me, so it might well be it.
B, he might think it's not very interesting. Using 0-days should be old-hat
and expected. Disclosing specific exploits would not stop the bleeding, the
NSA would just find new ones. He might even consider 0-day hoarding
acceptable business, just not the mass employment of them.
C, he's often maintained a sort of "I'm coming out to the public with this,
but I'm very sorry to hurt the US in a way"- kind of attitude. It would
definitely cripple the NSA if he released novel and important bugs. Think
of how hard it would be to hack-back at China!
D, There's some scheduling going on to maximize impact. He might release

nothing" later, when attention dies down again.
E, Maybe the NSA have become a common thing in popular culture and they
dislike their image of being a completely opaque organization with
potentially unlimited power. So now they are sharing information about the
"outer shell" of the organization, a sort of facade. Meanwhile it seems
like the world is crushing down upon them.
In a few years their image will be renewed. Everyone will think "The NSA
was not that unlimited in it's capabilities and worked very hard. Now that
they have rules and limits it will all be okay". And with that a whole new
level of FUD will have been achieved. Making people believe they are the
evil you know.
Of course, this is religious level conspiracies. And of course, that's
exactly the level the NSA would start to accept. They're the information
and espionage experts. If anyone could pull this off, it'd be them.

merged December 31 2011 (lonely night? sneaky vacation timing?). Assuming
the NSA checks patches (ofc they do) they should've found it in Jan 2012.
Snowden. Ah. Found it. "reenwald began working with Snowden in either
February[113] or in April after Poitras asked Greenwald to meet her in New
York City, at which point Snowden began providing documents to them both"
That'd be April 2013.
He still might've stolen the documents earlier, but who knows?

The problem is that the general public is very slow to learn. Every step
along the way even the wise said things like "OH! The NSA said A, but
they'll *never* say B!". Then two weeks later the docs show that B has not
just been said, it'd been SCREAMED. Then the word is "But they'll never say
C!". Etc. Maybe at some point people will pick it up differently.
It also fits the media format better to drip info. A new news article every
new drip. That makes for a lot more exposure.
It's sad but true. I would *LOVE* instant full disclosure. But it just
wouldn't have the same effect. Maybe you could do selective full
disclosure, but who'd be allowed access? And who'd prevent the store of
data from being leaked again?
Additionally there's the rewriting and securing. Often documents have
person-specific typo's or sentence changes that can identify a specific
instance of a document. There was this company that wanted to use it on
e-books, rewriting "good" to "not bad", etc.
Anyway, mixed bag regarding full disclosure. I think this is easier, safer
and reaches the general public better and as such it's the right choice.
It's a damn shame that it is, sensationalism isn't fun.

I haven't been able to satisfy any clear conditions for being good or bad
guys. Not even for being patriots or not.
Ultimately it doesn't matter. Their jobs are inherently evil. Spying always
has been, but this is different because it involves everyone (even without
being suspect) and costs for additional invasion of privacy\surveillance is
negligible. Meaning a single person that doesn't do his/her job can ruin
the world (in *many* scenario's). Looking at Snowden there is not the kind
of security procedures to prevent it, either.
So. Are the NSA guys good guys? Well. They're the enemy of the people, as
they invade their privacy and therewith their safety. If you can be
blackmailed, studied, influenced, etc. you are weak and vulnerable.
Preaching to the choir, I guess. So I cannot call them good guys by a very
long shot.
Are the NSA guys bad guys? Well, they do anything to protect their nation
from whatever attack could happen (bad for non-US; me). They steal secrets
for their government (bad for non-US; me). They assist foreign secret
agencies in subverting or avoiding legal restrictions put in place to
protect citizens as (real/wise/elected) politicians see fit. (very bad for
non-US; me)
Uh. Yeah. I guess they're the bad guys. I usually feel like they are
soldiers on a certain mission, and so no blame comes to them. But I feel
more strongly that the organization is build to produce law-breaking,
privacy-destroying, unethical, unfriendly, aggressive, anticompetative,
distracting and confusing and ultimately just *mean* practices.
So yes: the NSA is *EVIL* to the maximum realistic extend.
The NSA's people enjoy a margin of appreciation. They're doing a job. They
have their reasons. But I do believe most of them are keenly aware of the
extremely large quantity of thoroughly unethical things their organization
is doing, and must be considered at least partially responsible.

A statement like this is trollbait. It might not be intentional, you might
even have a valid point, but presenting it like this will not help.
If you're talking about a step above pure technical you're usually talking
about a software's purpose. Then that purpose can be influenced by a
political believe as vague as anarchy, democracy, communism, capitalism,
liberty, etc. which are words that should be used sparingly and in a way
that acknowledges how terribly vague they are.
I think it's not right to say their technical expertise exists to serve
certain goals, many are doing it just for the hell of it. For the puzzles,
the challenges.

how will you create it?
There's constructive ways to deal with this.
Calling a person psycho is very relative, they have a model of reality.
IMHO it holds well enough for them not to be "psycho". They're definitely
killers, but that's what the military is supposed to be. So afaics
everything is okay.
The (US) government on one angle performing mass surveillance and on the
other hand preventing surveillance makes perfect sense to me. They're
different agencies, different people, different incentives, so the
conclusions (doing/preventing mass surveillance) are the correct ones in
both cases. The government working against itself is extremely common,
sometimes intentional, and a symbol of what's wrong with it.
Sadly it's also a symbol of what's wrong with capitalism. And anarchy (as
you usually advocate) implies capitalism, although it might not be about
capital. Just the struggle for ownership and control and an evolutionary
process of "consumer selection" to find the optimal situation or product.
Sounds idealistic? Now look upon anarchy again.

A Did not know
B Did not care
C Felt like it would negatively impact the NSA's (legitimate) functioning
D Didn't get around to it yet
E Snowden is an unconventional NSA set up

A, is interesting, as it would show that the NSA has levels of secrecy and
secret data that go further than what they had so far. Something above "TOP
SECRET" should probably exist, and Snowden didn't find it. This actually
makes a lot of sense to me, so it might well be it.
B, he might think it's not very interesting. Using 0-days should be old-hat
and expected. Disclosing specific exploits would not stop the bleeding, the
NSA would just find new ones. He might even consider 0-day hoarding
acceptable business, just not the mass employment of them.
C, he's often maintained a sort of "I'm coming out to the public with this,
but I'm very sorry to hurt the US in a way"- kind of attitude. It would
definitely cripple the NSA if he released novel and important bugs. Think
of how hard it would be to hack-back at China!
D, There's some scheduling going on to maximize impact. He might release
the "0-day-exploit list that endangers live as we know it, and the NSA did

wholeheartedly wish would be 100% effective and fair! Actually if the
government would just TAKE all the violence and write it to /dev/null
that's be PERFECT for me. Then we can start struggling with less demons
such as abuse of power and wealth.
Doesn't it just disgust you to think that anyone could be used sexually in
whatever means, provided sufficient money compensates someone for it? What
kind of violence is it that someone can provide something so compelling
that he/she would do anything to get it? Think of how that used person
convinces him/herself to do something completely unnatural, so disgusting
it makes one retch, sheerly for an imaginary compensation.
I wonder how well that situation is actually the situation for many
prostitutes in present day.
Is this even related? Oh yes, the NSA. Well. Seems this has become a thread
about unnatural and utterly disgusting things.

I think you should start seeing human beings working for something they
believe they need, money or otherwise.
Marx just saw (afaik) people working hard for short term gains they didn't
enjoy, their daily bread, knowing their works' true fruits were not their
property but their bosses'. The core appeal of communism is that a man
should enjoy the fruits of his labor. Interestingly, that's the core appeal
of capitalism too!

This is definitely affecting some markets. It lowers the barrier for entry,
driving competition. But the collaboration between companies outcompetes
any private effort, so there is no choice. It's a neat effect, but hardly
of relevance to Marx or even the GPL. The GPL is just what made the effect
happen "in the wild" so strongly that the MBA's couldn't deny it anymore.
The GPL was for people to know what a computer does on their behalves. To
own what they depend upon. The ability to alter what they dislike. And most
importantly, to saveguard against madness. No arbitrary ristrictions will
exist in a open source program for long.
For example: Sumatra PDF and respecting PDF DRM rules are an interesting
discussion, to say the least.
I think everyones trolling himself, first and foremost.
Note to all: "give what you can, take what you need" is in no way fair, nor
even noble. It's economic suicide.

2014-02-07 Sean Lynch :
The problem is that you've introduced trust into a trust-free system. And
you didn't even pick wisely, you picked wealthy.
The assumption used to justify wealthy is that people that are wealthy will
want to preserve the system, and it's value. They are actually more likely
driven with increasing their wealth.
This, of course, is not unreasonable. But a "pretty cracked up currency" is
still okay to enough people. You can't trust people to judge the
crackedupness of a (psuedonymous) system. This is the same reason "regular
banking" fails.
 this would probably cause some trouble amongst those wealthy people.

No. Rewriting the blockchain gives back those coin days. I imagine it's
pretty hard to use many people's coin days for the same block, whereas a
nonce to a block is very easy to communicate.
Why? If it works it works and if it doesn't it doesn't. A mix between the
two is an extremely political and complicating choice.
I'm stuck with a democracy problem. Is Plutocracy better? Is Democracy
better? Is any Obliarchy better?
I tend to think that the people are incapable of making the best choice.

Ultimately the obliarchs can be trusted to make choices best for them, and
not the rest, in the ideal situation. Thus I feel it is not adequate.
In the end however the social/political/economical power wins anyway. Might
as well hardcode it. Even with all choices made up front a system will only
thrive with the support of people. People can be convinced and coerced with
political or economic power, or the social pressure of their peers.
The standing arguments against POS are:
* "Stake" is reverted/restored when the blockchain is rewritten
* It's a political choice, not so much a functional one
* Bitcoin days become a commodity of it's own (it is now too, as it speeds
up transactions, but it becomes something worth buying not something that's
nice to have. Can you imagine trading 1 btc for 1.2 btc and it being worth
it? Sidetracking by exchanging private keys -_-'.... )
* One's investment might change in a single trade. This might also be true
of mining, but it doesn't have to be.
* Large scale mining is traceable. This is an interesting notion, actually.
It'd seem that POS mining is more government-resistant as it does not
require large energy expenses.
I think if someone can solve the "investedness" in a certain blockchain it
gets very interesting.
The relative cost of an attack. It is also assumed that the overal usage
goes up. Mining not going down is a change I would make.
The everlasting counter argument is that money now is costlier still.
There's a simple trade between fraction of computing power devoted to
mining and security.
There's also stuff like  that, if properly
implemented, could drive down computing costs for scientific application.
I think this sort of clarity is valuable. There's a lot of stuff that needs
additional support. If it has to be trusted it is usually not called a

2014-02-07 Sean Lynch :
The problem is that you've introduced trust into a trust-free system. And
you didn't even pick wisely, you picked wealthy.
The assumption used to justify wealthy is that people that are wealthy will
want to preserve the system, and it's value. They are actually more likely
driven with increasing their wealth.
This, of course, is not unreasonable. But a "pretty cracked up currency" is
still okay to enough people. You can't trust people to judge the
crackedupness of a (psuedonymous) system. This is the same reason "regular
banking" fails.
 this would probably cause some trouble amongst those wealthy people.

No. Rewriting the blockchain gives back those coin days. I imagine it's
pretty hard to use many people's coin days for the same block, whereas a
nonce to a block is very easy to communicate.
Why? If it works it works and if it doesn't it doesn't. A mix between the
two is an extremely political and complicating choice.
I'm stuck with a democracy problem. Is Plutocracy better? Is Democracy
better? Is any Obliarchy better?
I tend to think that the people are incapable of making the best choice.

2014-02-07 Sean Lynch :
The problem is that you've introduced trust into a trust-free system. And
you didn't even pick wisely, you picked wealthy.
The assumption used to justify wealthy is that people that are wealthy will
want to preserve the system, and it's value. They are actually more likely
driven with increasing their wealth.
This, of course, is not unreasonable. But a "pretty cracked up currency" is
still okay to enough people. You can't trust people to judge the
crackedupness of a (psuedonymous) system. This is the same reason "regular
banking" fails.
 this would probably cause some trouble amongst those wealthy people.

No. Rewriting the blockchain gives back those coin days. I imagine it's
pretty hard to use many people's coin days for the same block, whereas a
nonce to a block is very easy to communicate.
Why? If it works it works and if it doesn't it doesn't. A mix between the
two is an extremely political and complicating choice.
I'm stuck with a democracy problem. Is Plutocracy better? Is Democracy
better? Is any Obliarchy better?
I tend to think that the people are incapable of making the best choice.
Things turn into a trust/populism issue as the people thinks emotionally.
Additionally it just often lacks the domain specific knowledge for a good
Thus a form of obliarchy should be better. The selection criteria is the
real problem. Elections typically reintroduce the previous problems.
A higher level of education is a start as it correlates with domain
specific knowledge. It correlates too weakly for my taste. And it lacks
testing for critical thinking and similar skills, although they also
correlate. This also puts a pressure on determining the level of education
that isn't in the best interest of academics.
Simple intelligence testing would be preferable. But it is as of yet
impossible to accurately determine intelligence.
Wealthy is a selector that would work if it were not for a distorted
political situation and different levels of economic engagement present
even amongst the most capable human beings.
Ultimately the obliarchs can be trusted to make choices best for them, and
not the rest, in the ideal situation. Thus I feel it is not adequate.
In the end however the social/political/economical power wins anyway. Might
as well hardcode it. Even with all choices made up front a system will only
thrive with the support of people. People can be convinced and coerced with
political or economic power, or the social pressure of their peers.
The standing arguments against POS are:
* "Stake" is reverted/restored when the blockchain is rewritten
* It's a political choice, not so much a functional one
* Bitcoin days become a commodity of it's own (it is now too, as it speeds
up transactions, but it becomes something worth buying not something that's
nice to have. Can you imagine trading 1 btc for 1.2 btc and it being worth
it? Sidetracking by exchanging private keys -_-'.... )
* One's investment might change in a single trade. This might also be true
of mining, but it doesn't have to be.
* Large scale mining is traceable. This is an interesting notion, actually.
It'd seem that POS mining is more government-resistant as it does not
require large energy expenses.
I think if someone can solve the "investedness" in a certain blockchain it
gets very interesting.
The relative cost of an attack. It is also assumed that the overal usage
goes up. Mining not going down is a change I would make.
The everlasting counter argument is that money now is costlier still.
There's a simple trade between fraction of computing power devoted to
mining and security.
There's also stuff like  that, if properly
implemented, could drive down computing costs for scientific application.
I think this sort of clarity is valuable. There's a lot of stuff that needs
additional support. If it has to be trusted it is usually not called a
third party. The wealth of individuals is definitely something governments
have* a lot* of influence on.
Difficult to corner for who? Why and how do you want to distributed voting
authority, that's the ultimate question. Ideally there wouldn't be such a
thing as votes, just transactions.
Correctly is undefined. If you give people economic incentive the most
profitable choice would be the one taken. Making the voters take a choice
best for the system, thus the most profitable, might also not have
desirable results. Depending, of course, on the ultimate question.
You don't name the cost of voting. They are allowed to extend the
blockchain and get compensated for it. If they were wrong about their
extension, as defined by the mayority of extenders, their payment gets
revoked. This is enough to ensure each will apply the same rule to maximize
You incentivise becoming a greater stakeholder. I also think that people
with a lot of money will have ulterior motives. They don't just sit on
their money.
There's also interplay between many currencies and their exchange. It all
complicates the system tremendously.
The chief concern for the blockchain is ensuring a singular sequence of
transactions. Nothing else is vital. As a side effect the miners can change
the policies, but this is not a pleasant feature.
Voluntary entrance to a system is ideal. No need to run with BitcoinXKE, I
prefer BitcoinXKA. Blockchain forking does enable that. But transactions
could cross between chains where they are legitimate and it could get very
I'm worried about wanting a digital gold and getting a digital euro.
Reducing the flexibility of votes is a good means to that end. In Bitcoin a
policy change is agreed on before hand, a switchover date is arranged, etc,
in order to not lose money. That's pretty good.
You weren't and I'm not sure how this would work. If I sent in a
transaction to the network, someone else can claim reward for it? Do I get
rewarded for it?
This sounds like I'd have to re-announce my presence on the network pretty
frequently, allowing for easier tracking of participants.
ASIC time? But why override? I just change the order and that's enough.
How does POS factor into POW in this case?
I suspect reminting older blocks with more transactions would be feasible.
But you have to link to or explain how you want to do POS.
There may be legitimate incidents of accidental double spending. You're
also only fucking the recipient of the transaction, the sender has it's
trade long behind him.
It even means I could do a legitimate transaction and later destroy the
money I sent. Close but no ball. Without psuedonyms this is more feasible.
You could kill the sender's address, but that won't have much effect.

This is purely to circumvent the "SD card is public space" issue. The only
idea is to have the same measure of security in memory as on the SD card,
to allow for large caches.
So: Private key in memory. Fast encryption streaming algorithm to write and
read to the SD card with the private key in memory. Fast.

You can also manipulate other parts of the machine. With features present
in vPro all that's needed is a "buffer overflow" hidden "bug" that allows
remote control. The "bug" might even be hidden in non-spec gates or code
flashed into it later.
Bottom line: no defense when you use vPro capable Intel chipsets.
This is a massive problem for me as someone who'd like to produce a secure
system. If the NSA can remote enable vPro anytime they like, what am I
going to do at any other level? There's plenty of tricks you can pull to
make it seem they didn't use vPro, as vPro usage is pretty much
undetectable. Think manipulation of random number generation making it seem
they have some unknown random number generator attack, when in fact they
just manipulated it.

Information is too scarce to see if they managed GPU mining somehow.
Although that'd produce it's own set of problems (see also what happened

MTGOX just started serving this:
The requested page was not found on this server
The cold storage has been wiped out due to a leak in the hotwallet
Sorry but you do check your total balance every so often.
I mean you do.
"Injections in coin are most useful (enough to run the exchange) but some
cash is also needed to not run a fractional reserve"
This is actually really decent news. Running a fractional reserve would be
very tolerable. It's interesting they mention turning off trade for a
month, that's quite a lot. And it might just have started right now.
744,408 were stolen
but they have a liability of 624,408 BTC
Those numbers seem in the right order (if everything is kinda effed).
"Coins for equity, coin donations, and cash injections to buy coins at the
cheapMtGox price are some options among many."
I think I could do with some equity. But I wonder if it'd be a good deal,
given their distinct lack of Bitcoin (according to this document).
"To avoid a bank run from customers, the daily amount of bitcoin and
cashwithdrawals will be limited."
Seems nobody got burned. Just for a while.
Anyway. The question of how this happened is not really answered. "Poor
Bitcoin accounting" is an understatement. Your hot wallet leaking is also
not a very realistic thing, unless it was just a steady steal.
How can someone steal all the money and not be detected (by anyone)?
Can we somehow just revert the theft transactions? I'd at least like to
know what happened to the coins. Who has them? Who goes to jail for it?
This is a pretty strange way for all this to turn out if you ask me. I
wonder who didn't get burned.

if the leaked document is correct:
The fundamental problem here was that the guys in charge, especially the
CEO, somehow managed to extract money from the vault (cold storage) and put
it in the counter *without actually ever checking the vault **for years*.
Never checking if the money in the vault fits the money you owe people is a
very extreme way to put your head in the sand. This is obviously negligent,
to a point that it would fall in the category of *criminal negligence* anywhere
The reason I had faith in mtgox is knowing they use cold storage, so if
somehow the vault was draining they'd always have a wide margin to figure
out what the hell was up. Somehow they kept *all their coins* semi-live.
Meaning they could *all *get stolen.
It's *ridiculous* and I couldn't imagine such a wealthy and industry
leading company to not once have thought "maybe we should fix this".
It is, at best, an example that doing a bad job is better than doing no job
at all, and that in the end the bad job will fuck everyone over. Makes me
feel I should go ahead and start my own exchange, 'cause I'd just do so
much better a job than is being done right now.
Except the army. Organization wise the army always deeply impressed me.
Perhaps it's because it's the one big-organization that humanity has had
thousands upon thousands of years of time for perfecting it, and those that
didn't died?
        Banks don't need 'regulators' telling them to keep their vaults
Never underestimate human stupidity.
Or not. If it were up to most regulators, definitely not.
Mtgox was never in a highly competitive environment. If it were it wouldn't
have been on top so steadily with so little improvements in service
This is offtopic to be honest. Whoever needed a money that was totally
centralized, and why does he/she think Bitcoin is it? It's much much much
more decentralized than any other currency. The fact that it's not useless
now is what sets it apart from things like the LibertyDollar, so I'd say
it's working just fine. Can't stand this sort of underinformed bullshitting.

Tor/network layer ish stuff
Application layer stuff
You could give me a steaming pile of NSA honeytrap codepies, as long as
it's GPL I'll trust it with my life and love it feverishly. (joke)
If anyone ever steals this idea I'll point to this e-mail and claim it was
originally mine and it stuck in your head until you thought it was yours**:
Just write the communications layer. Expose it through a socket on the
local machine. Let's say the port will be 33742 (actually a good port
number) (say "eel for tee too") and one can talk
modern-JSON-over-an-HTTP-subset with it.
Platform dependent high-performance stuff like COM objects, maybe some RPC,
etc.  are optional.
This little daemon/server maintains the connection to whatever P2P network
is currently thought to be neat. It may or may not also do DNS-ish stuff
and (if that's the popular P2P thing) it can have a keyring with trusted
peers (aka "friends").
Once you have that you can communicate in an abstracted form. You can send
messages that will pop out on the other side to registered listeners
(method of registration is pretty much irrelevant, but let's say it's
either directly by subscribing to 33742 or by some other sockety means).
The service rendered is "you give me a destination (as per my spec) and a
message and I will make sure it gets there without anyone really knowing if
it was us". So it's like TOR, but a little more explicit and less
You might wonder, why not proxy like? I like it because I never know
whether something is going through the proxy or not. I'd prefer the
application saying "Golly, where is 33742?" than going "You know, I swear
we had this proxy arrangement.... Oh well".
33742 will also* do trickle connections and arbitrarily decide that a
certain application is getting snailservice today. A few (~5?) trickle
connections will always be kept cheerfully active, ticking away a few kbps
of random data, and the occasional fully crypted packet that looks just
like random data. Add some sort of meshing thingy on top of it, and the
requirement that snailservice packets should be snailserviced with at least
an 80% chance and voila every frikkin packet has plausible deniability ("I
got it over trickles/snailservice!").
Then, to make it attractive to actually use it, you write *SEVERAL
DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS WITH SPECIFIC PURPOSES*, because you want to do *one
thing, and do it right*. One of these things should be an IMAP server,
because letter-secret is very nice indeed.
 * Performance
 * Simplicity
 * Stability
 * Security
 * Modularity
 * Ease of extension
 * Separation of concerns
The best part? The longer you think of it, the better the idea becomes.
* if it's good 337.
** or the idea spread from someone that had this or a variation going on.
The point is that I claim this idea. It's not very original because really
it's just Tor++ with some reasonable processing, but that's what we usually
call an original idea so I'll just claim it anyway. (Antartica is mine too
btw, really)
*** If you do enough geometric programming you start to notice that perhaps
"space", geometry and coordinates and things like that, are probably not at
all as natural as they seem to be. Graphics programming gives a similar
sense. Collisions just aren't .. ¿ natural? Crypto really makes
mathematical sense, but geometry, man!

It definitely rings a similar bell, it sure did with me when I heard about

Overall I'm underwhelmed by the design and I think it tries to do too much.
I think It's not fundamental/simple enough. I think Blockchain style
consensus is expensive and not required. Only reason I can think off is
that they want premined coins or something.
There's a whole flux of not-really-working-yet ideas that use the

It's odd to declare IP(v6) addresses bullocks that simply. It's in our

But really, universally unique addresses are just a dream. The only address
I think makes sense is derived off a public key. Any other address should
be network-topology-semantic, not assigned by committee. That way there's
real identity (private-publickey) and real address/location (place

I used XMPP with facebook chat. It didn't support even a quarter of the
cookiejar of features. This was with Pidgin, afaik the only serious rich
crossplatform manyprotocol chat program.
So forgive me for being a little underwhelmed on the protocol itself.
It is also by design the most common denominator, with extensions
infrequently supported (read: less useful). The most common denominator is
of course chat and user accounts.
But chat is not the atomic networked message that we're talking about. VOIP
over base64 also seems kind of like banging your head into the wall.
It feels pretty good though, because it means state of the art can be
improved. It gives some reason for the current state of things. We have a
go-to solution, why improve?

tl;dr: I think it's a good idea, but it is offensive in a vague way.
It's really unfun to suddenly see binary in your JSON file. Both for
automated software that parses HTML (or something) and for people that use
text editors. The motivation for JSON isn't that it's easy and not too
inefficient. It's cleaner and more generic than XML. It's also faster to
write because the { and } are always written in code (you find them more
easily). It's just XML but a bit better.
If you want efficiency you could take to templated binary blobs. It
wouldn't actually be that hard, either, once we have some tools to do it.
You could even have a dual request, where you request "file.binary" and
"filelayout.json", where a JSON file describes the shape of the binary
information file.
It is actually a good idea. Definitely better than any alternatives (all
none of them). Just need plugins for text editors to hide the binary when
you're viewing it. And find some way to prevent binary overflow. You know
how C coders love to believe a length field, then do something bad and
everything goes poof. Maybe port over how attachments work in e-mail.
Actually, please don't it's awful. But it shows the sort of trouble you get.
It's great for some applications. I don't like that it would be good for
the wrong applications too. I also think we should harness more off the
power we already have, instead of thinking of new ways that are
I think I'd rather have a way to put JSON in front of my binary file, than
a way to put binary into my JSON file. It'd be great for metadata for
images, actually I've seen XML in front of PNG's and GIFS. We could use a
.BJSN, a format for a (JSON, Binary) tuple.
References may be better than embedding; flexibility in delivery and
storage, respects both formats more, keeps JSON simpler. That's the only
really valid concern I can come up with.
It depends on the application field. As a webdeveloper I can see the
utility and also the difficulty of good support. I think of previous
trouble with binary overflow, and how it can get really really messy. I'm
pro-possibility though! We should be able to do it, and leave it wherever
we think that's bad.
Maybe we should start calling it "JSON Transfer Protocol", though!
I'm a little under the weather atm so please forgive my awkward verbosity.

At the parser level you would find a "b" character that's not between
brackets, signalling a binary header is coming. A binary header is actually
just the number of bytes that follow in binary format. The following bytes
are then a binary file, to be assigned to a string as if it were a
variable. We have a binarybuffer in javascript, that sort of thing. It
would contain the NULL byte if you like it to.
That may break some parsers, but this is the real life. Parsers must deal
with malformed input securely already > being unaware of bencoding2 should
not cause problems.
If the length-indicating thingy is short of what it should binary will
spill over into your JSON document. It may represent perfectly fine JSON,
and thus opens up binary overflow as a possible JSON hack. Someone that can
alter that number can already hack your JSON, so that doesn't actually
change any attack profile.
If it's too long it will gobble up your JSON file, which opens up reading
the rest of the file and maybe even into random memory and treating it as a
file in your JSON. That's much more serious but requires the JSON parser to
have bugs.
The thing is that if you don't cut yourself in the fingers it can be nice
to have a knife. If you don't write some pretty obvious bugs you will be
I think it's much more serious that you have to serve the BJSON completely
as a binary file. It's not like you can dump it onto a webpage anymore. You
can't slip it into your normal HTTP text transfer bodies either, has to
work with attachments. Attachments should be secure when facing malformed
transfers* etc. Inconvenient, but not the end.
* It would be pretty wack to mess with the HTTP protocol. Maybe you could
confuse a keep-alive connection to serve a file before it should be,
confusing a webapp or sending a redirect. Haven't really looked into it and
haven't really heard about it either. Maybe servers are just secure enough
against those attacks?

@_subject: Browser JS (client side) crypto FUD 
Crypto discussion list Is surprisingly often passed around as if it is the end-all to the idea of
client side JS crypto.
TL;DR: It's a fantastic load of horse crap, mixed in with some extremely
generalized cryptography issues that most people never thought about before
that do not harm JS crypto at all.
I'm not sure why the guy wrote it. Maybe he's NSA motivated? Maybe he's
worked a lot on secure systems and this just gives him the creeps? Maybe
he's the kind of guy that thinks JS dynamic scripted languages
are not a real languages?
Somebody, please, give me something to say against people that claim JS
client side crypto can just never work!
Aside from that it's, well, fundamentally moronic to claim that something
is "harmful" when you actually means it does nothing, it's also just
(almost!) never true that no attacks are prevented.
But, let's go with the flow of the article. Rants won't really settle
Two example usages are given.
The first is client-side hashing of a password, so that it's never sent in
the clear. This is so legitimate it nearly makes me drop my hat, but, the
author decides to use HMAC-SHA1 instead of SHA2 for reasons that are fully
beyond me. Perhaps just trying to make things less secure?
The second is using AES keys to client side encrypt. The author must've
thought he was being helpful when he imagined the scheme for this. Or maybe
he was drunk. "So you generate an AES key for each note, send it to the
user's browser to store locally, forget the key, and let the user wrap and
unwrap their data.". Somehow trusting the transport layer is all back in
vogue. The only key-generation problem in JS is entropy, which is a problem
everywhere tbh. If you really want to ensure entropy, send a random data
blob and XOR it with whatever client-side best-shot at randomness.
The author bluntheadedly claims "They will both fail to secure users". In
principle I agree, his methods sucked balls. He, however, blames it on JS.
Okay.. Let's go on.
REALLY? WHY?
Until those problems are fixed, Javascript isn't a serious crypto research
(points numbered for pointwise addressing)
1 - Yeah. Duh. What do you think of delivering anything client side?
There's the whole SSL infrastructure, if that doesn't cut it for you, well,
welcome to the Internet. (I suggest the next article is about how the
Internet is fundamentally flawed.) I would suggest, however, that once your
delivery pathway is exploited you're fundamentally screwed in every way.
You can't communicate anything, you can't authenticate anyone, you really
can't *do* anything! So let's leave out the "Javascript" part of this
point, and just do whatever we're already doing to alleviate this issue.
2 - This is a conclusion without any basis so far (aside from being..
meaningless to a computer scientist. Hostile?)
3 - Then just look at what data was transferred. Does every crypto
application require checkable source? Is any SSL implementation "considered
harmful" because nobody is able to flawlessly read the code, no compilers
are trusted, etc?
Okay so that chapter meant absolutely nothing. The author goes on to try to
defend his brabble:
"WHAT'S THE "CHICKEN-EGG PROBLEM" WITH DELIVERING JAVASCRIPT CRYPTOGRAPHY?
If you don't trust the network to deliver a password, or, worse, don't
trust the server not to keep user secrets, you can't trust them to deliver
security code. The same attacker who was sniffing passwords or reading
diaries before you introduce crypto is simply hijacking crypto code after
you do."
A fair point against a single thread model. Interestingly the last line
does absolutely not have to hold, sniffing (after the fact) and on-the-fly
rewriting are worlds apart. Take Tempest of Xkeyscore, for example, they
can't do rewrites. They need specialized programs for that. (Conclusion:
nope, nothing to see here)
The next chapter tries to justify the fallacies made earlier on. Equating a
rewrite to a read, ad-homineming the JS crypto "industry" (and failing to
distinguish operational security from actual security), and lastly claiming
that misplaced trust is bad (which is obvious and unrelated).
The next chapter claims SSL is safe, and "real" crypto unlike JS crypto.
Then firmly cements his baseless ridicule by claiming that if you use
non-JS crypto to make JS crypto work, then obviously there's no point.
The next chapter "WHAT'S HARD ABOUT DEPLOYING JAVASCRIPT CRYPTO CODE OVER
SSL/TLS?" claims all the page has to be SSL/TLS and that makes it hard.
It's not hard and you should already be doing it to have /*any*/ security.
Not to mention it's not true, only that interpreted as page contents has to
be SSL'ed (eg, images don't need to be transported over SSL).
So, point 1 has no merit against JS whatsoever. There's also a lot of
FUD-like text that denies reality. Especially the assumption that SSL and
desktop programs are somehow more secure.
So point 2.
(letterized for pointwise addressing)
"HOW ARE BROWSERS HOSTILE TO CRYPTOGRAPHY?
In a dispriting variety of ways, among them:
a - The prevalence of content-controlled code.
b - The malleability of the Javascript runtime.
c - The lack of systems programming primitives needed to implement crypto.
d - The crushing weight of the installed base of users.
Each of these issues creates security gaps that are fatal to secure crypto.
Attackers will exploit them to defeat systems that should otherwise be
secure. There may be no way to address them without fixing browsers."
a, c, d are, at first sight, all rubbish. b is a very genuine point
however. With prototyping and the like it can be VERY hard to see what's
going on. It's an often mentioned thing about JS that it's too powerful in
some ways, and it can be true. The same goes for C and memory control.
Next chapter confirms that a is rubbish.
Chapter after that explains some basic Comp Sci about when you can trust
something (and discredits something that can help in a lot of cases, any if
you do it correctly (which is too hard))
Chapter after that rehashes the idea that you can't trust the environment
unless you trust the whole environment, which is also the same everywhere.
(I also refer to trusting the compiler)
Next chapter is titled "WELL THEN, COULDN'T I WRITE A SIMPLE BROWSER
EXTENSION THAT WOULD ALLOW JAVASCRIPT TO VERIFY ITSELF?". And guess what,
the author agrees. You can indeed do this. If you're just doing it for
yourself or a single kind of crypto you could also make a plugin for that.
Which is what the WhatWG is doing with the HTML5 crypto extension. Then
claims crypto is to PGP as programming languages are to Lisp, which is
The author then goes on to actually talk about random generators. Which are
not always required, but who cares, right? Then Secure erase, which is only
important if you expect the client device to be exploited. Then ?timing
attacks? which is even more specific and can be alleviated easily enough.
Then tries to generalize his claim to remove JS specifically from the
equation, removing is last viable (but not definitive) arguments.
Some hating on key management, which is justified but again bullocks wrt
the main argument. (not to mention it's a problem everywhere, and it can be
solved like everywhere)
Some hate on people running old browsers, which has actually been solved by
background-auto-updating by now. (huzzah for all the added insecurity there)
Then something about graceful degrading. Which is fair except for him not
sufficiently providing any reason JS crypto never works. (and not
relevant). He apparently meant this with d. Depends greatly on the
deployment situation, but in general it's FUD.
"AND WHEN YOU SAID "VIEW-SOURCE TRANSPARENCY WAS ILLUSORY"?
We meant that you can't just look at a Javascript file and know that it's
secure, even in the vanishingly unlikely event that you were a skilled
cryptographer, because of all the reasons we just cited."
Yeah. Welcome to programming. There's absolutely no truth to this claim
btw. Vagely referring to a large body of rubbish is not an argument.
The rest does not even try to take a direct shot anymore. Something about
how users that use 100 programs are more likely to find an insecure one
than people that use only 2 or 3.
He's the kind of guy that claims cracking and rewriting SSL connections is
easy, whereas using AES for a secure "cryptosystem" is hard. I don't know
what's up with this guy.

@_subject: Alleged "microkernel mathematically proven to be bug free" 
I have a rough outline for a "cloud computing grid" that verifiably:
* Exists on many hardware nodes that can be run by untrusted third parties,
as the hardware is "tamper evident" and the "cloud computing grid" is self
healing and distributing.
* Can run programs in a way that geographic location is unknowable - Onion
routing, amongst other features, causes programs to seemingly run on every
node in the network
* Cannot inspect what runs on it - the microkernel programs cannot read
what the programs are doing, nor can programs contact one another unless
they are instances (that potentially run on another hardware node).
* Is fault tolerant, automatically scaling, etc.
* Can still be addressed from the Internet or other networks
You could run something like your Bitcoin wallet in it. It's really
geodistributed, automatically fault tolerant, etc. There's no way to tamper
with the programs running, except as specified before a cluster was created.
Right now you're always stuck with an insane amount of local law, hardware
issues (and features), fault tolerance, accessibility, etc.
With this you could run a program in a nigh-perfect vacuum. Your program
would be networked, but not in any specific place. Nobody can know what it
does, but it can compute and it can communicate as it wishes. Depending on
the grid (grids have to be manifactured in one go, checked by several third
parties, distributed, set and forget) there's some pricing scheme or

Yes, it needs crypto. I said verifably because "proving" an untamperable
hardware box (IOW: you can only plug it in, nothing else) is what the spec
says it is, is, well, impossible.
You'll depend on some observers, audits and where possibly physical
impossibilities, to show that indeed it is what it is. It's not proof, but
with trust you can verify it.
It's as good as it gets, but no better. I don't think that'd surprise
Part of the design involves generations. Eventually you'll have a
generation for which something is questionable in a certain way, nothing to
do about it. Generations will slowly die as the hardware breaks and the
network becomes too small (has too few resources) to uphold anonymity and
fault-tolerance guarantees.
Perhaps a generation will be hybrid with blackbloxes mailed to people and
satellites in space. That generation would be expected to deteriorate fast
in the first 100 years, and then hardly deteriorate at all for many after
All these different grids will have some sort of resource pricing scheme,
that may guarantee a certain runtime, or may be subject to monthly renewals
at new market prices or whatnot. It's a very interesting part of the design.
But yes, the anonymity profits /greatly/ from crypto. Interestingly I think
it could well work without crypto, whereas hardly any other designs could.
It'd lose a lot of convenience though! And P = NP doesn't mean crypto is
useless, just less nice. At the very least there'll be OTPs! Then there may
be (quantum) couple RNGs that can generate secure OTPs. I think there'll
always be ways the newer generations of this idea can continue to function.
It's progress, because now all we need is to specify safely, or find a way
to prove specifications. The rest is somewhat, maybe, experimentally
operational. It'll depend on how well we use it, but it is a step in the
right direction!

What I'm planning doesn't have much in the way of uniqueness of hardware.
The only unique thing is.. wait.. shouldn't I patent this first?
The whole hardware device will be as trusted as any TPM would be. And
probably be more trustworthy than any TPM that exists now. 't Is a tricky
thing. The programs run in a vacuum, even they can't know where they run.
That changes the purpose of a "TPM" significantly.

absolutely no unique (platform) information available, that includes

your own userspace.
is enough. But I'm afraid trustable silicon is only part of the problem.
The trustable silicon will already require some sort of minimalism to allow
for validation, but it gets worse. To prevent data observation the rest of
the casing will have to be able to self-destruct (think harddrives coated
in thermite), and therefore self-observe in known an unknown ways. It also
musn't radiate patterns, which will be exceedingly hard to prove. It will
involve Faraday's cages and the like. Such hardware design is has been
attempted before, but is probably still less effort than the software.
I was thinking of a few millions thrown at companies banks could trust, to
validate proofs, check circuits, observe fabrication, etc. and eventually
undersign responsibility for the validity of the end result.
I don't think that'd be enough. It requires a small horde of experts and a
significant support infrastructure. On top of that the idea is exceedingly
hard to convey. The idea that the cloud can be more secure then an in-house
dedicated server is very foreign. It was to me, when I thought it up.
The upside is that the income model is very simple. Just charge for
resources on the computing grids.
It's not *that *unethical and dangerous, it just wouldn't work! How can you
claim to stay afloat when you're underwater? The hardware that makes op the
grid will probably be a collection of simplistic components bought in
VHDL-form. These simple, trusted, components will likely be in a shroud of
not-vital components that do some practical stuff, like connecting to the
Internet. Fresh ground to find those stupid patents, too.

These proofs tie a meta-specification to the actual code. Look into the

I think you're talking about trusted computing, and I'm not talking about
trusted computing :). I've seen some examples of trusted computing but the
operation set was always not Turing complete. It might work, actually, but
I don't see how.
The system I'm talking about it not just a software system. It also
involves hardware. The hardware will be created centrally, in batches.
Probably by a third party and certainly checked by several independent
observers to make sure it goes according to an open sourced specification.
The devices from those batches can be plugged in and maintained by
untrusted parties. IOW: they're shipped off to individuals who'll plug them
in anywhere. The devices are tamper-proofed to such an extend that that is
possible without exposing the sensitive data kept on them. The software
that (as verified by the third parties present in manufacture) runs on the
devices cannot snoop on the programs running on the system.
The devices network together, likely over the Internet but maybe also
radio. They Onion route all traffic. Etc. etc. Programs run on them but
they cannot know what the program is doing.
They're not updateable. They will all slowly fail and to make sure there's
still places you can run your software there is generations. So a next
batch forms a different computing grid.
I'm repeating bits and peaces, but I want to be sure that you can see that
it's a hardware design made useful by a software solution to fault
proofness and program "location".

You could give me a steaming pile of NSA honeytrap codepies, as long as
it's GPL I'll trust it with my life and love it feverishly. (joke)
If anyone ever steals this idea I'll point to this e-mail and claim it was
originally mine and it stuck in your head until you thought it was yours**:
Just write the communications layer. Expose it through a socket on the
local machine. Let's say the port will be 33742 (actually a good port
number) (say "eel for tee too") and one can talk
modern-JSON-over-an-HTTP-subset with it.
Platform dependent high-performance stuff like COM objects, maybe some RPC,
etc.  are optional.
This little daemon/server maintains the connection to whatever P2P network
is currently thought to be neat. It may or may not also do DNS-ish stuff
and (if that's the popular P2P thing) it can have a keyring with trusted
peers (aka "friends").
Once you have that you can communicate in an abstracted form. You can send
messages that will pop out on the other side to registered listeners
(method of registration is pretty much irrelevant, but let's say it's
either directly by subscribing to 33742 or by some other sockety means).
The service rendered is "you give me a destination (as per my spec) and a
message and I will make sure it gets there without anyone really knowing if
it was us". So it's like TOR, but a little more explicit and less
You might wonder, why not proxy like? I like it because I never know
whether something is going through the proxy or not. I'd prefer the
application saying "Golly, where is 33742?" than going "You know, I swear
we had this proxy arrangement.... Oh well".
33742 will also* do trickle connections and arbitrarily decide that a
certain application is getting snailservice today. A few (~5?) trickle
connections will always be kept cheerfully active, ticking away a few kbps
of random data, and the occasional fully crypted packet that looks just
like random data. Add some sort of meshing thingy on top of it, and the
requirement that snailservice packets should be snailserviced with at least
an 80% chance and voila every frikkin packet has plausible deniability ("I
got it over trickles/snailservice!").
Then, to make it attractive to actually use it, you write *SEVERAL
DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS WITH SPECIFIC PURPOSES*, because you want to do *one
thing, and do it right*. One of these things should be an IMAP server,
because letter-secret is very nice indeed.

Maidsafe is trying to be the cloud but P2P. At Bitcoin2014 I asked as to
why they wanted a blockchain/consistency, that guy didn't know (nice guy
though), left my e-mail address and didn't hear back.
It definitely rings a similar bell, it sure did with me when I heard about
it. I've even pointed to it when saying how things could also be.
Overall I'm underwhelmed by the design and I think it tries to do too much.
I think It's not fundamental/simple enough. I think Blockchain style
consensus is expensive and not required. Only reason I can think off is
that they want premined coins or something.
There's a whole flux of not-really-working-yet ideas that use the
blockchain for no reason other than having premined coins and some P2P
framework. It's interesting and good to see that blockchain-tech is such a
key for people's creativity. And it's a shame that it's probably not the
right tool for the job in most cases.
(Consensus is overrated! Who needs it? You just need things to work the way
you want them for you. What do you care how it looks to people you never
deal with?)

To be honest, too centralized and too arbitrary.
It's odd to declare IP(v6) addresses bullocks that simply. It's in our

But really, universally unique addresses are just a dream. The only address
I think makes sense is derived off a public key. Any other address should
be network-topology-semantic, not assigned by committee. That way there's
real identity (private-publickey) and real address/location (place

I used XMPP with facebook chat. It didn't support even a quarter of the
cookiejar of features. This was with Pidgin, afaik the only serious rich
crossplatform manyprotocol chat program.
So forgive me for being a little underwhelmed on the protocol itself.
It is also by design the most common denominator, with extensions
infrequently supported (read: less useful). The most common denominator is
of course chat and user accounts.
But chat is not the atomic networked message that we're talking about. VOIP
over base64 also seems kind of like banging your head into the wall.
It feels pretty good though, because it means state of the art can be
improved. It gives some reason for the current state of things. We have a

tl;dr: I think it's a good idea, but it is offensive in a vague way.
It's really unfun to suddenly see binary in your JSON file. Both for
automated software that parses HTML (or something) and for people that use
text editors. The motivation for JSON isn't that it's easy and not too
inefficient. It's cleaner and more generic than XML. It's also faster to
write because the { and } are always written in code (you find them more
easily). It's just XML but a bit better.
If you want efficiency you could take to templated binary blobs. It
wouldn't actually be that hard, either, once we have some tools to do it.
You could even have a dual request, where you request "file.binary" and
"filelayout.json", where a JSON file describes the shape of the binary
information file.
It is actually a good idea. Definitely better than any alternatives (all
none of them). Just need plugins for text editors to hide the binary when
you're viewing it. And find some way to prevent binary overflow. You know
how C coders love to believe a length field, then do something bad and
everything goes poof. Maybe port over how attachments work in e-mail.
Actually, please don't it's awful. But it shows the sort of trouble you get.
It's great for some applications. I don't like that it would be good for
the wrong applications too. I also think we should harness more off the
power we already have, instead of thinking of new ways that are
I think I'd rather have a way to put JSON in front of my binary file, than
a way to put binary into my JSON file. It'd be great for metadata for
images, actually I've seen XML in front of PNG's and GIFS. We could use a
.BJSN, a format for a (JSON, Binary) tuple.
References may be better than embedding; flexibility in delivery and
storage, respects both formats more, keeps JSON simpler. That's the only
really valid concern I can come up with.
It depends on the application field. As a webdeveloper I can see the
utility and also the difficulty of good support. I think of previous
trouble with binary overflow, and how it can get really really messy. I'm
pro-possibility though! We should be able to do it, and leave it wherever
we think that's bad.
Maybe we should start calling it "JSON Transfer Protocol", though!
I'm a little under the weather atm so please forgive my awkward verbosity.

At the parser level you would find a "b" character that's not between
brackets, signalling a binary header is coming. A binary header is actually
just the number of bytes that follow in binary format. The following bytes
are then a binary file, to be assigned to a string as if it were a
variable. We have a binarybuffer in javascript, that sort of thing. It
would contain the NULL byte if you like it to.
That may break some parsers, but this is the real life. Parsers must deal
with malformed input securely already > being unaware of bencoding2 should
not cause problems.
If the length-indicating thingy is short of what it should binary will
spill over into your JSON document. It may represent perfectly fine JSON,
and thus opens up binary overflow as a possible JSON hack. Someone that can
alter that number can already hack your JSON, so that doesn't actually
change any attack profile.
If it's too long it will gobble up your JSON file, which opens up reading
the rest of the file and maybe even into random memory and treating it as a
file in your JSON. That's much more serious but requires the JSON parser to
have bugs.
The thing is that if you don't cut yourself in the fingers it can be nice
to have a knife. If you don't write some pretty obvious bugs you will be
I think it's much more serious that you have to serve the BJSON completely
as a binary file. It's not like you can dump it onto a webpage anymore. You
can't slip it into your normal HTTP text transfer bodies either, has to
work with attachments. Attachments should be secure when facing malformed
transfers* etc. Inconvenient, but not the end.
* It would be pretty wack to mess with the HTTP protocol. Maybe you could
confuse a keep-alive connection to serve a file before it should be,
confusing a webapp or sending a redirect. Haven't really looked into it and
haven't really heard about it either. Maybe servers are just secure enough
against those attacks?

@_subject: Browser JS (client side) crypto FUD 
Crypto discussion list Is surprisingly often passed around as if it is the end-all to the idea of
client side JS crypto.
TL;DR: It's a fantastic load of horse crap, mixed in with some extremely
generalized cryptography issues that most people never thought about before
that do not harm JS crypto at all.
I'm not sure why the guy wrote it. Maybe he's NSA motivated? Maybe he's
worked a lot on secure systems and this just gives him the creeps? Maybe
he's the kind of guy that thinks JS dynamic scripted languages
are not a real languages?
Somebody, please, give me something to say against people that claim JS
client side crypto can just never work!
Aside from that it's, well, fundamentally moronic to claim that something
is "harmful" when you actually means it does nothing, it's also just
(almost!) never true that no attacks are prevented.
But, let's go with the flow of the article. Rants won't really settle
Two example usages are given.
The first is client-side hashing of a password, so that it's never sent in
the clear. This is so legitimate it nearly makes me drop my hat, but, the
author decides to use HMAC-SHA1 instead of SHA2 for reasons that are fully
beyond me. Perhaps just trying to make things less secure?
The second is using AES keys to client side encrypt. The author must've
thought he was being helpful when he imagined the scheme for this. Or maybe
he was drunk. "So you generate an AES key for each note, send it to the
user's browser to store locally, forget the key, and let the user wrap and
unwrap their data.". Somehow trusting the transport layer is all back in
vogue. The only key-generation problem in JS is entropy, which is a problem
everywhere tbh. If you really want to ensure entropy, send a random data
blob and XOR it with whatever client-side best-shot at randomness.
The author bluntheadedly claims "They will both fail to secure users". In
principle I agree, his methods sucked balls. He, however, blames it on JS.
Okay.. Let's go on.
REALLY? WHY?
Until those problems are fixed, Javascript isn't a serious crypto research
(points numbered for pointwise addressing)
1 - Yeah. Duh. What do you think of delivering anything client side?
There's the whole SSL infrastructure, if that doesn't cut it for you, well,
welcome to the Internet. (I suggest the next article is about how the
Internet is fundamentally flawed.) I would suggest, however, that once your
delivery pathway is exploited you're fundamentally screwed in every way.
You can't communicate anything, you can't authenticate anyone, you really
can't *do* anything! So let's leave out the "Javascript" part of this
point, and just do whatever we're already doing to alleviate this issue.
2 - This is a conclusion without any basis so far (aside from being..
meaningless to a computer scientist. Hostile?)
3 - Then just look at what data was transferred. Does every crypto
application require checkable source? Is any SSL implementation "considered
harmful" because nobody is able to flawlessly read the code, no compilers
are trusted, etc?
Okay so that chapter meant absolutely nothing. The author goes on to try to
defend his brabble:
"WHAT'S THE "CHICKEN-EGG PROBLEM" WITH DELIVERING JAVASCRIPT CRYPTOGRAPHY?
If you don't trust the network to deliver a password, or, worse, don't
trust the server not to keep user secrets, you can't trust them to deliver
security code. The same attacker who was sniffing passwords or reading
diaries before you introduce crypto is simply hijacking crypto code after
you do."
A fair point against a single thread model. Interestingly the last line
does absolutely not have to hold, sniffing (after the fact) and on-the-fly
rewriting are worlds apart. Take Tempest of Xkeyscore, for example, they
can't do rewrites. They need specialized programs for that. (Conclusion:
nope, nothing to see here)
The next chapter tries to justify the fallacies made earlier on. Equating a
rewrite to a read, ad-homineming the JS crypto "industry" (and failing to
distinguish operational security from actual security), and lastly claiming
that misplaced trust is bad (which is obvious and unrelated).
The next chapter claims SSL is safe, and "real" crypto unlike JS crypto.
Then firmly cements his baseless ridicule by claiming that if you use
non-JS crypto to make JS crypto work, then obviously there's no point.
The next chapter "WHAT'S HARD ABOUT DEPLOYING JAVASCRIPT CRYPTO CODE OVER
SSL/TLS?" claims all the page has to be SSL/TLS and that makes it hard.
It's not hard and you should already be doing it to have /*any*/ security.
Not to mention it's not true, only that interpreted as page contents has to
be SSL'ed (eg, images don't need to be transported over SSL).
So, point 1 has no merit against JS whatsoever. There's also a lot of
FUD-like text that denies reality. Especially the assumption that SSL and
desktop programs are somehow more secure.
So point 2.
(letterized for pointwise addressing)
"HOW ARE BROWSERS HOSTILE TO CRYPTOGRAPHY?
In a dispriting variety of ways, among them:
a - The prevalence of content-controlled code.
b - The malleability of the Javascript runtime.
c - The lack of systems programming primitives needed to implement crypto.
d - The crushing weight of the installed base of users.
Each of these issues creates security gaps that are fatal to secure crypto.
Attackers will exploit them to defeat systems that should otherwise be
secure. There may be no way to address them without fixing browsers."
a, c, d are, at first sight, all rubbish. b is a very genuine point
however. With prototyping and the like it can be VERY hard to see what's
going on. It's an often mentioned thing about JS that it's too powerful in
some ways, and it can be true. The same goes for C and memory control.
Next chapter confirms that a is rubbish.
Chapter after that explains some basic Comp Sci about when you can trust
something (and discredits something that can help in a lot of cases, any if
you do it correctly (which is too hard))
Chapter after that rehashes the idea that you can't trust the environment
unless you trust the whole environment, which is also the same everywhere.
(I also refer to trusting the compiler)
Next chapter is titled "WELL THEN, COULDN'T I WRITE A SIMPLE BROWSER
EXTENSION THAT WOULD ALLOW JAVASCRIPT TO VERIFY ITSELF?". And guess what,
the author agrees. You can indeed do this. If you're just doing it for
yourself or a single kind of crypto you could also make a plugin for that.
Which is what the WhatWG is doing with the HTML5 crypto extension. Then
claims crypto is to PGP as programming languages are to Lisp, which is
The author then goes on to actually talk about random generators. Which are
not always required, but who cares, right? Then Secure erase, which is only
important if you expect the client device to be exploited. Then ?timing
attacks? which is even more specific and can be alleviated easily enough.
Then tries to generalize his claim to remove JS specifically from the
equation, removing is last viable (but not definitive) arguments.
Some hating on key management, which is justified but again bullocks wrt
the main argument. (not to mention it's a problem everywhere, and it can be
solved like everywhere)
Some hate on people running old browsers, which has actually been solved by
background-auto-updating by now. (huzzah for all the added insecurity there)
Then something about graceful degrading. Which is fair except for him not
sufficiently providing any reason JS crypto never works. (and not
relevant). He apparently meant this with d. Depends greatly on the
deployment situation, but in general it's FUD.
"AND WHEN YOU SAID "VIEW-SOURCE TRANSPARENCY WAS ILLUSORY"?
We meant that you can't just look at a Javascript file and know that it's
secure, even in the vanishingly unlikely event that you were a skilled
cryptographer, because of all the reasons we just cited."
Yeah. Welcome to programming. There's absolutely no truth to this claim
btw. Vagely referring to a large body of rubbish is not an argument.
The rest does not even try to take a direct shot anymore. Something about
how users that use 100 programs are more likely to find an insecure one
than people that use only 2 or 3.
He's the kind of guy that claims cracking and rewriting SSL connections is
easy, whereas using AES for a secure "cryptosystem" is hard. I don't know
what's up with this guy.

@_subject: Alleged "microkernel mathematically proven to be bug free" 
I have a rough outline for a "cloud computing grid" that verifiably:
* Exists on many hardware nodes that can be run by untrusted third parties,
as the hardware is "tamper evident" and the "cloud computing grid" is self
healing and distributing.
* Can run programs in a way that geographic location is unknowable - Onion
routing, amongst other features, causes programs to seemingly run on every
node in the network
* Cannot inspect what runs on it - the microkernel programs cannot read
what the programs are doing, nor can programs contact one another unless
they are instances (that potentially run on another hardware node).
* Is fault tolerant, automatically scaling, etc.
* Can still be addressed from the Internet or other networks
You could run something like your Bitcoin wallet in it. It's really
geodistributed, automatically fault tolerant, etc. There's no way to tamper
with the programs running, except as specified before a cluster was created.
Right now you're always stuck with an insane amount of local law, hardware
issues (and features), fault tolerance, accessibility, etc.

would be networked, but not in any specific place. Nobody can know what it
does, but it can compute and it can communicate as it wishes. Depending on
the grid (grids have to be manifactured in one go, checked by several third

Yes, it needs crypto. I said verifably because "proving" an untamperable
hardware box (IOW: you can only plug it in, nothing else) is what the spec
says it is, is, well, impossible.
You'll depend on some observers, audits and where possibly physical
impossibilities, to show that indeed it is what it is. It's not proof, but
with trust you can verify it.
It's as good as it gets, but no better. I don't think that'd surprise
Part of the design involves generations. Eventually you'll have a
generation for which something is questionable in a certain way, nothing to
do about it. Generations will slowly die as the hardware breaks and the
network becomes too small (has too few resources) to uphold anonymity and
fault-tolerance guarantees.
Perhaps a generation will be hybrid with blackbloxes mailed to people and
satellites in space. That generation would be expected to deteriorate fast
in the first 100 years, and then hardly deteriorate at all for many after
All these different grids will have some sort of resource pricing scheme,
that may guarantee a certain runtime, or may be subject to monthly renewals
at new market prices or whatnot. It's a very interesting part of the design.
But yes, the anonymity profits /greatly/ from crypto. Interestingly I think
it could well work without crypto, whereas hardly any other designs could.
It'd lose a lot of convenience though! And P = NP doesn't mean crypto is
useless, just less nice. At the very least there'll be OTPs! Then there may
be (quantum) couple RNGs that can generate secure OTPs. I think there'll
always be ways the newer generations of this idea can continue to function.
It's progress, because now all we need is to specify safely, or find a way
to prove specifications. The rest is somewhat, maybe, experimentally
operational. It'll depend on how well we use it, but it is a step in the
right direction!

What I'm planning doesn't have much in the way of uniqueness of hardware.
The only unique thing is.. wait.. shouldn't I patent this first?
The whole hardware device will be as trusted as any TPM would be. And
probably be more trustworthy than any TPM that exists now. 't Is a tricky
thing. The programs run in a vacuum, even they can't know where they run.

The trustable silicon will already require some sort of minimalism to allow
for validation, but it gets worse. To prevent data observation the rest of
the casing will have to be able to self-destruct (think harddrives coated
in thermite), and therefore self-observe in known an unknown ways. It also
musn't radiate patterns, which will be exceedingly hard to prove. It will
involve Faraday's cages and the like. Such hardware design is has been
attempted before, but is probably still less effort than the software.
I was thinking of a few millions thrown at companies banks could trust, to
validate proofs, check circuits, observe fabrication, etc. and eventually
undersign responsibility for the validity of the end result.
I don't think that'd be enough. It requires a small horde of experts and a
significant support infrastructure. On top of that the idea is exceedingly
hard to convey. The idea that the cloud can be more secure then an in-house
dedicated server is very foreign. It was to me, when I thought it up.
The upside is that the income model is very simple. Just charge for
resources on the computing grids.
It's not *that *unethical and dangerous, it just wouldn't work! How can you
claim to stay afloat when you're underwater? The hardware that makes op the
grid will probably be a collection of simplistic components bought in
VHDL-form. These simple, trusted, components will likely be in a shroud of
not-vital components that do some practical stuff, like connecting to the
Internet. Fresh ground to find those stupid patents, too.

I think you're talking about trusted computing, and I'm not talking about
trusted computing :). I've seen some examples of trusted computing but the
operation set was always not Turing complete. It might work, actually, but
I don't see how.
The system I'm talking about it not just a software system. It also
involves hardware. The hardware will be created centrally, in batches.
Probably by a third party and certainly checked by several independent
observers to make sure it goes according to an open sourced specification.
The devices from those batches can be plugged in and maintained by
untrusted parties. IOW: they're shipped off to individuals who'll plug them
in anywhere. The devices are tamper-proofed to such an extend that that is
possible without exposing the sensitive data kept on them. The software
that (as verified by the third parties present in manufacture) runs on the
devices cannot snoop on the programs running on the system.
The devices network together, likely over the Internet but maybe also
radio. They Onion route all traffic. Etc. etc. Programs run on them but
they cannot know what the program is doing.
They're not updateable. They will all slowly fail and to make sure there's
still places you can run your software there is generations. So a next
batch forms a different computing grid.
I'm repeating bits and peaces, but I want to be sure that you can see that
it's a hardware design made useful by a software solution to fault
proofness and program "location".

Tor/network layer ish stuff
Application layer stuff
You could give me a steaming pile of NSA honeytrap codepies, as long as
it's GPL I'll trust it with my life and love it feverishly. (joke)
If anyone ever steals this idea I'll point to this e-mail and claim it was
originally mine and it stuck in your head until you thought it was yours**:
Just write the communications layer. Expose it through a socket on the
local machine. Let's say the port will be 33742 (actually a good port
number) (say "eel for tee too") and one can talk
modern-JSON-over-an-HTTP-subset with it.
Platform dependent high-performance stuff like COM objects, maybe some RPC,
etc.  are optional.
This little daemon/server maintains the connection to whatever P2P network
is currently thought to be neat. It may or may not also do DNS-ish stuff
and (if that's the popular P2P thing) it can have a keyring with trusted
peers (aka "friends").
Once you have that you can communicate in an abstracted form. You can send
messages that will pop out on the other side to registered listeners
(method of registration is pretty much irrelevant, but let's say it's
either directly by subscribing to 33742 or by some other sockety means).
The service rendered is "you give me a destination (as per my spec) and a
message and I will make sure it gets there without anyone really knowing if
it was us". So it's like TOR, but a little more explicit and less
You might wonder, why not proxy like? I like it because I never know
whether something is going through the proxy or not. I'd prefer the
application saying "Golly, where is 33742?" than going "You know, I swear
we had this proxy arrangement.... Oh well".
33742 will also* do trickle connections and arbitrarily decide that a
certain application is getting snailservice today. A few (~5?) trickle
connections will always be kept cheerfully active, ticking away a few kbps
of random data, and the occasional fully crypted packet that looks just
like random data. Add some sort of meshing thingy on top of it, and the
requirement that snailservice packets should be snailserviced with at least
an 80% chance and voila every frikkin packet has plausible deniability ("I
got it over trickles/snailservice!").
Then, to make it attractive to actually use it, you write *SEVERAL
DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS WITH SPECIFIC PURPOSES*, because you want to do *one
thing, and do it right*. One of these things should be an IMAP server,
because letter-secret is very nice indeed.
 * Performance
 * Simplicity
 * Stability
 * Security
 * Modularity
 * Ease of extension
 * Separation of concerns
The best part? The longer you think of it, the better the idea becomes.
* if it's good 337.
** or the idea spread from someone that had this or a variation going on.
The point is that I claim this idea. It's not very original because really
it's just Tor++ with some reasonable processing, but that's what we usually
call an original idea so I'll just claim it anyway. (Antartica is mine too
btw, really)
*** If you do enough geometric programming you start to notice that perhaps
"space", geometry and coordinates and things like that, are probably not at
all as natural as they seem to be. Graphics programming gives a similar
sense. Collisions just aren't .. ¿ natural? Crypto really makes
mathematical sense, but geometry, man!

I think It's not fundamental/simple enough. I think Blockchain style
consensus is expensive and not required. Only reason I can think off is
that they want premined coins or something.
There's a whole flux of not-really-working-yet ideas that use the
blockchain for no reason other than having premined coins and some P2P
framework. It's interesting and good to see that blockchain-tech is such a

I used XMPP with facebook chat. It didn't support even a quarter of the
cookiejar of features. This was with Pidgin, afaik the only serious rich
crossplatform manyprotocol chat program.
So forgive me for being a little underwhelmed on the protocol itself.
It is also by design the most common denominator, with extensions
infrequently supported (read: less useful). The most common denominator is
of course chat and user accounts.
But chat is not the atomic networked message that we're talking about. VOIP
over base64 also seems kind of like banging your head into the wall.
It feels pretty good though, because it means state of the art can be

tl;dr: I think it's a good idea, but it is offensive in a vague way.
It's really unfun to suddenly see binary in your JSON file. Both for
automated software that parses HTML (or something) and for people that use
text editors. The motivation for JSON isn't that it's easy and not too
inefficient. It's cleaner and more generic than XML. It's also faster to
write because the { and } are always written in code (you find them more
easily). It's just XML but a bit better.
If you want efficiency you could take to templated binary blobs. It
wouldn't actually be that hard, either, once we have some tools to do it.
You could even have a dual request, where you request "file.binary" and
"filelayout.json", where a JSON file describes the shape of the binary
information file.
It is actually a good idea. Definitely better than any alternatives (all
none of them). Just need plugins for text editors to hide the binary when
you're viewing it. And find some way to prevent binary overflow. You know
how C coders love to believe a length field, then do something bad and
everything goes poof. Maybe port over how attachments work in e-mail.
Actually, please don't it's awful. But it shows the sort of trouble you get.
It's great for some applications. I don't like that it would be good for
the wrong applications too. I also think we should harness more off the
power we already have, instead of thinking of new ways that are
I think I'd rather have a way to put JSON in front of my binary file, than
a way to put binary into my JSON file. It'd be great for metadata for
images, actually I've seen XML in front of PNG's and GIFS. We could use a
.BJSN, a format for a (JSON, Binary) tuple.
References may be better than embedding; flexibility in delivery and
storage, respects both formats more, keeps JSON simpler. That's the only
really valid concern I can come up with.
It depends on the application field. As a webdeveloper I can see the
utility and also the difficulty of good support. I think of previous
trouble with binary overflow, and how it can get really really messy. I'm
pro-possibility though! We should be able to do it, and leave it wherever
we think that's bad.
Maybe we should start calling it "JSON Transfer Protocol", though!

At the parser level you would find a "b" character that's not between
brackets, signalling a binary header is coming. A binary header is actually
just the number of bytes that follow in binary format. The following bytes
are then a binary file, to be assigned to a string as if it were a
variable. We have a binarybuffer in javascript, that sort of thing. It
would contain the NULL byte if you like it to.
That may break some parsers, but this is the real life. Parsers must deal
with malformed input securely already > being unaware of bencoding2 should
not cause problems.
If the length-indicating thingy is short of what it should binary will
spill over into your JSON document. It may represent perfectly fine JSON,
and thus opens up binary overflow as a possible JSON hack. Someone that can
alter that number can already hack your JSON, so that doesn't actually
change any attack profile.
If it's too long it will gobble up your JSON file, which opens up reading
the rest of the file and maybe even into random memory and treating it as a
file in your JSON. That's much more serious but requires the JSON parser to
have bugs.
The thing is that if you don't cut yourself in the fingers it can be nice
to have a knife. If you don't write some pretty obvious bugs you will be
I think it's much more serious that you have to serve the BJSON completely
as a binary file. It's not like you can dump it onto a webpage anymore. You
can't slip it into your normal HTTP text transfer bodies either, has to
work with attachments. Attachments should be secure when facing malformed
transfers* etc. Inconvenient, but not the end.
* It would be pretty wack to mess with the HTTP protocol. Maybe you could
confuse a keep-alive connection to serve a file before it should be,
confusing a webapp or sending a redirect. Haven't really looked into it and
haven't really heard about it either. Maybe servers are just secure enough
against those attacks?

@_subject: Browser JS (client side) crypto FUD 
Is surprisingly often passed around as if it is the end-all to the idea of
client side JS crypto.
TL;DR: It's a fantastic load of horse crap, mixed in with some extremely
generalized cryptography issues that most people never thought about before
that do not harm JS crypto at all.
I'm not sure why the guy wrote it. Maybe he's NSA motivated? Maybe he's
worked a lot on secure systems and this just gives him the creeps? Maybe
he's the kind of guy that thinks JS dynamic scripted languages
are not a real languages?
Somebody, please, give me something to say against people that claim JS
client side crypto can just never work!
Aside from that it's, well, fundamentally moronic to claim that something
is "harmful" when you actually means it does nothing, it's also just
(almost!) never true that no attacks are prevented.
But, let's go with the flow of the article. Rants won't really settle
Two example usages are given.
The first is client-side hashing of a password, so that it's never sent in
the clear. This is so legitimate it nearly makes me drop my hat, but, the
author decides to use HMAC-SHA1 instead of SHA2 for reasons that are fully
beyond me. Perhaps just trying to make things less secure?
The second is using AES keys to client side encrypt. The author must've
thought he was being helpful when he imagined the scheme for this. Or maybe
he was drunk. "So you generate an AES key for each note, send it to the
user's browser to store locally, forget the key, and let the user wrap and
unwrap their data.". Somehow trusting the transport layer is all back in
vogue. The only key-generation problem in JS is entropy, which is a problem
everywhere tbh. If you really want to ensure entropy, send a random data
blob and XOR it with whatever client-side best-shot at randomness.
The author bluntheadedly claims "They will both fail to secure users". In
principle I agree, his methods sucked balls. He, however, blames it on JS.
Okay.. Let's go on.
REALLY? WHY?
Until those problems are fixed, Javascript isn't a serious crypto research
(points numbered for pointwise addressing)
1 - Yeah. Duh. What do you think of delivering anything client side?
There's the whole SSL infrastructure, if that doesn't cut it for you, well,
welcome to the Internet. (I suggest the next article is about how the
Internet is fundamentally flawed.) I would suggest, however, that once your
delivery pathway is exploited you're fundamentally screwed in every way.
You can't communicate anything, you can't authenticate anyone, you really
can't *do* anything! So let's leave out the "Javascript" part of this
point, and just do whatever we're already doing to alleviate this issue.
2 - This is a conclusion without any basis so far (aside from being..
meaningless to a computer scientist. Hostile?)
3 - Then just look at what data was transferred. Does every crypto
application require checkable source? Is any SSL implementation "considered
harmful" because nobody is able to flawlessly read the code, no compilers
are trusted, etc?
Okay so that chapter meant absolutely nothing. The author goes on to try to
defend his brabble:
"WHAT'S THE "CHICKEN-EGG PROBLEM" WITH DELIVERING JAVASCRIPT CRYPTOGRAPHY?
If you don't trust the network to deliver a password, or, worse, don't
trust the server not to keep user secrets, you can't trust them to deliver
security code. The same attacker who was sniffing passwords or reading
diaries before you introduce crypto is simply hijacking crypto code after
you do."
A fair point against a single thread model. Interestingly the last line
does absolutely not have to hold, sniffing (after the fact) and on-the-fly
rewriting are worlds apart. Take Tempest of Xkeyscore, for example, they
can't do rewrites. They need specialized programs for that. (Conclusion:
nope, nothing to see here)
The next chapter tries to justify the fallacies made earlier on. Equating a
rewrite to a read, ad-homineming the JS crypto "industry" (and failing to
distinguish operational security from actual security), and lastly claiming
that misplaced trust is bad (which is obvious and unrelated).
The next chapter claims SSL is safe, and "real" crypto unlike JS crypto.
Then firmly cements his baseless ridicule by claiming that if you use
non-JS crypto to make JS crypto work, then obviously there's no point.
The next chapter "WHAT'S HARD ABOUT DEPLOYING JAVASCRIPT CRYPTO CODE OVER
SSL/TLS?" claims all the page has to be SSL/TLS and that makes it hard.
It's not hard and you should already be doing it to have /*any*/ security.
Not to mention it's not true, only that interpreted as page contents has to
be SSL'ed (eg, images don't need to be transported over SSL).
So, point 1 has no merit against JS whatsoever. There's also a lot of
FUD-like text that denies reality. Especially the assumption that SSL and
desktop programs are somehow more secure.
So point 2.
(letterized for pointwise addressing)
"HOW ARE BROWSERS HOSTILE TO CRYPTOGRAPHY?
In a dispriting variety of ways, among them:
a - The prevalence of content-controlled code.
b - The malleability of the Javascript runtime.
c - The lack of systems programming primitives needed to implement crypto.
d - The crushing weight of the installed base of users.
Each of these issues creates security gaps that are fatal to secure crypto.
Attackers will exploit them to defeat systems that should otherwise be
secure. There may be no way to address them without fixing browsers."
a, c, d are, at first sight, all rubbish. b is a very genuine point
however. With prototyping and the like it can be VERY hard to see what's
going on. It's an often mentioned thing about JS that it's too powerful in
some ways, and it can be true. The same goes for C and memory control.
Next chapter confirms that a is rubbish.
Chapter after that explains some basic Comp Sci about when you can trust
something (and discredits something that can help in a lot of cases, any if
you do it correctly (which is too hard))
Chapter after that rehashes the idea that you can't trust the environment
unless you trust the whole environment, which is also the same everywhere.
(I also refer to trusting the compiler)
Next chapter is titled "WELL THEN, COULDN'T I WRITE A SIMPLE BROWSER
EXTENSION THAT WOULD ALLOW JAVASCRIPT TO VERIFY ITSELF?". And guess what,
the author agrees. You can indeed do this. If you're just doing it for
yourself or a single kind of crypto you could also make a plugin for that.
Which is what the WhatWG is doing with the HTML5 crypto extension. Then
claims crypto is to PGP as programming languages are to Lisp, which is
The author then goes on to actually talk about random generators. Which are
not always required, but who cares, right? Then Secure erase, which is only
important if you expect the client device to be exploited. Then ?timing
attacks? which is even more specific and can be alleviated easily enough.
Then tries to generalize his claim to remove JS specifically from the
equation, removing is last viable (but not definitive) arguments.
Some hating on key management, which is justified but again bullocks wrt
the main argument. (not to mention it's a problem everywhere, and it can be
solved like everywhere)
Some hate on people running old browsers, which has actually been solved by
background-auto-updating by now. (huzzah for all the added insecurity there)
Then something about graceful degrading. Which is fair except for him not
sufficiently providing any reason JS crypto never works. (and not
relevant). He apparently meant this with d. Depends greatly on the
deployment situation, but in general it's FUD.
"AND WHEN YOU SAID "VIEW-SOURCE TRANSPARENCY WAS ILLUSORY"?
We meant that you can't just look at a Javascript file and know that it's
secure, even in the vanishingly unlikely event that you were a skilled
cryptographer, because of all the reasons we just cited."
Yeah. Welcome to programming. There's absolutely no truth to this claim
btw. Vagely referring to a large body of rubbish is not an argument.
The rest does not even try to take a direct shot anymore. Something about
how users that use 100 programs are more likely to find an insecure one
than people that use only 2 or 3.
He's the kind of guy that claims cracking and rewriting SSL connections is
easy, whereas using AES for a secure "cryptosystem" is hard. I don't know
what's up with this guy.

I have a rough outline for a "cloud computing grid" that verifiably:

as the hardware is "tamper evident" and the "cloud computing grid" is self
healing and distributing.
* Can run programs in a way that geographic location is unknowable - Onion
routing, amongst other features, causes programs to seemingly run on every
node in the network
* Cannot inspect what runs on it - the microkernel programs cannot read
what the programs are doing, nor can programs contact one another unless
they are instances (that potentially run on another hardware node).
* Is fault tolerant, automatically scaling, etc.
* Can still be addressed from the Internet or other networks

geodistributed, automatically fault tolerant, etc. There's no way to tamper
with the programs running, except as specified before a cluster was created.
Right now you're always stuck with an insane amount of local law, hardware

Yes, it needs crypto. I said verifably because "proving" an untamperable
hardware box (IOW: you can only plug it in, nothing else) is what the spec
says it is, is, well, impossible.
You'll depend on some observers, audits and where possibly physical
impossibilities, to show that indeed it is what it is. It's not proof, but
with trust you can verify it.
It's as good as it gets, but no better. I don't think that'd surprise
Part of the design involves generations. Eventually you'll have a
generation for which something is questionable in a certain way, nothing to
do about it. Generations will slowly die as the hardware breaks and the
network becomes too small (has too few resources) to uphold anonymity and
fault-tolerance guarantees.
Perhaps a generation will be hybrid with blackbloxes mailed to people and
satellites in space. That generation would be expected to deteriorate fast
in the first 100 years, and then hardly deteriorate at all for many after
All these different grids will have some sort of resource pricing scheme,
that may guarantee a certain runtime, or may be subject to monthly renewals
at new market prices or whatnot. It's a very interesting part of the design.
But yes, the anonymity profits /greatly/ from crypto. Interestingly I think
it could well work without crypto, whereas hardly any other designs could.
It'd lose a lot of convenience though! And P = NP doesn't mean crypto is
useless, just less nice. At the very least there'll be OTPs! Then there may
be (quantum) couple RNGs that can generate secure OTPs. I think there'll
always be ways the newer generations of this idea can continue to function.
It's progress, because now all we need is to specify safely, or find a way
to prove specifications. The rest is somewhat, maybe, experimentally
operational. It'll depend on how well we use it, but it is a step in the
right direction!

What I'm planning doesn't have much in the way of uniqueness of hardware.
The only unique thing is.. wait.. shouldn't I patent this first?
The whole hardware device will be as trusted as any TPM would be. And
probably be more trustworthy than any TPM that exists now. 't Is a tricky
thing. The programs run in a vacuum, even they can't know where they run.

your own userspace.
is enough. But I'm afraid trustable silicon is only part of the problem.
The trustable silicon will already require some sort of minimalism to allow
for validation, but it gets worse. To prevent data observation the rest of
the casing will have to be able to self-destruct (think harddrives coated
in thermite), and therefore self-observe in known an unknown ways. It also
musn't radiate patterns, which will be exceedingly hard to prove. It will
involve Faraday's cages and the like. Such hardware design is has been
attempted before, but is probably still less effort than the software.
I was thinking of a few millions thrown at companies banks could trust, to
validate proofs, check circuits, observe fabrication, etc. and eventually
undersign responsibility for the validity of the end result.
I don't think that'd be enough. It requires a small horde of experts and a
significant support infrastructure. On top of that the idea is exceedingly
hard to convey. The idea that the cloud can be more secure then an in-house
dedicated server is very foreign. It was to me, when I thought it up.
The upside is that the income model is very simple. Just charge for
resources on the computing grids.
It's not *that *unethical and dangerous, it just wouldn't work! How can you
claim to stay afloat when you're underwater? The hardware that makes op the
grid will probably be a collection of simplistic components bought in
VHDL-form. These simple, trusted, components will likely be in a shroud of

These proofs tie a meta-specification to the actual code. Look into the
sort of proofs they use. Basically they're saying "the code does what we
said it has to. Only if we accidentally told it to go skynet on us, it will
work perfectly". Things like segfaults would be pretty clearly not as
But of course the specification may also contain bugs as opposed to the
human-intended specification. But this is also something they explain, just
read about their proofs and proof system.

I think you're talking about trusted computing, and I'm not talking about
trusted computing :). I've seen some examples of trusted computing but the
operation set was always not Turing complete. It might work, actually, but
I don't see how.
The system I'm talking about it not just a software system. It also
involves hardware. The hardware will be created centrally, in batches.
Probably by a third party and certainly checked by several independent
observers to make sure it goes according to an open sourced specification.
The devices from those batches can be plugged in and maintained by
untrusted parties. IOW: they're shipped off to individuals who'll plug them
in anywhere. The devices are tamper-proofed to such an extend that that is
possible without exposing the sensitive data kept on them. The software
that (as verified by the third parties present in manufacture) runs on the
devices cannot snoop on the programs running on the system.
The devices network together, likely over the Internet but maybe also
radio. They Onion route all traffic. Etc. etc. Programs run on them but
they cannot know what the program is doing.
They're not updateable. They will all slowly fail and to make sure there's
still places you can run your software there is generations. So a next
batch forms a different computing grid.
I'm repeating bits and peaces, but I want to be sure that you can see that
it's a hardware design made useful by a software solution to fault
proofness and program "location".

2014-03-22 16:55 GMT+01:00 Troy Benjegerdes :
The sad part is that I got scared away from the exchange business because I
thought it would be nearly impossible to get it 100% secure. And if it were
less then 100% secure, how could I take people's money?
I spent days feeling sick because I couldn't figure out a way to do
exchanges distributed over sufficiently geographically disperse points to
avoid trouble with a single government going mad. Then I realized the
Megaupload situation means that any US-ally country is susceptible to a
planned US-exercise.
Once I found that I cannot trust maybe 150 countries in the world with the
rest being mostly unsuitable, that turned into a bit of a problem. Suddenly
you find yourself thinking about how to get servers up in Iran, Irak,
India?, Morocco?, Laos?, Vietnam?, Cuba, Russia, China, North Korea
(scratch that) and maybe Iceland and some micronations.
You're thinking you can't trust others to set up the server, and you don't
want the costs, exposure and actual unsafety that comes with visiting all
America's enemies so you'll end up shipping wholesome servers to be loaded
straight into a rack.
Then you realize you're still not physically secure. The server itself is a
hotbox of 100% exposure. It's exceedingly unusual to want a physically
dispersed leaderless secure computing cluster with hot failover of a large
portion of servers (>49% is impossible, can't determine if you're being
fucked in the BGP).
If you let the box call homes first (homes is the list of other servers) it
can use it's already present crypto to prevent any possible MITM or
listening in. So that's good. Problem is a little liquid nitrogen,
connection on a bus or firewire port, etc. is enough to make the server
bleed information faster than the Titanic ate water. So you have to cut the
firefire connections (USB is okay and convenient AFAIC) and heat-conductive
epoxy the motherboard, RAM and a good margin around the CPU too (use a
taller and wider cooler than usual). Maybe even run some wires through it
to measure breach.
I have some additional ideas that are better obscure than open, but you get
the level of obnoxious. It's still not secure yet though, and that bothers
me a lot.
Then you find out Intel's chips have all sorts of hyperintelligence on it
to allow "remote administration" which just blew my fucking mind halfway
across the galaxy. "Dear NSA, have a backdoor into any PC that has a NIC.
Thank you for making us the industry leader, Kind regards\nX\nIntel". So
I'm thinking you'll probably want the beefiest ARM processor or maybe even
AMD (have to do more research). Of course a wiretap could expose the magic
packets, to prevent the NSA from being able to launder the exploit as some
more simple hack that doesn't point the finger at them. And then their
ability here couldn't be used because they want to reserve it for, you
know, WW3 time (hey China).
Once you have your physical platform you have to make sure the software is
okay. I found that it's entirely impossible to not trust your compiler. And
the likelihood of cutting yourself is way too high with low level
languages. I've so far permitted myself to use Node.js, and I feel plenty
bad about that. You can not trust your SSL unit. You can not trust any
library or database software. But you have to, because you can't do better.
(I did go for OpenBSD, although many things required hand compilation which
I wasn't familiar with )
By now I'm a week further in worrying and researching, I'm sweating more at
night, I don't feel comfortable using my own computer anymore, I don't
understand why the world isn't a chaotic place where no computer ever is
not hacked out of it's guts. I realize it's probably because nobody is
motivated and smart enough to go through the effort, and then also doesn't
get caught except for those that'd pay a high price to hide their
capabilities, which is why you'd never notice.
Knowing all this I quite damn well decided I couldn't make a secure and
reliable centralized exchange. No distributed exchange would earn me a
profit, which I'd need to produce more software to help other people's life
better, so that wouldn't really help either. Aside from the fact that it
would not be popular because it'd be slower and less easy than a "central"
Overall I decided I respect greatly the people that take on this challenge.
This was over a year ago.
Looking at the hacks that happen I'm mostly shocked to find the level of
stupidity. Shocked as much to see how long things just go on without
significant trouble. MtGox failing because money dissapeared over the
years... That was shocking at an unbelievable level. The first thing would
be a BIG CLOCK in the office, showing total supposed amount of Bitcoin
according to the servers and the total amount supposedly in wallets
according to the Blockchain. If not that than at least an alarm on a
dedicated phone, e-mails and a message on the admin interface (if you have
one). Somehow they had none of those. I'm amazed. This is just an aspect.
They run Ubuntu (thick stack linux) and PHP (thick stack webserver), which
are illogical choices. The list goes on.
So I think I'm capable of making an exchange platform that's far better
than what's out there right now. And I will once I have time (I really
don't have it right now, life is such a fuzz).
I still question if it'd be used by anyone. But at least I can try.

Once I'd have done that I'll be half a year further. If it works out
everyone will think it's pretty cool and it'd be totally useless to me
otherwise. I can move on to the next thing, but most likely I'll need some
money and that'll be the end of the fight for freedom.
I much prefer the scenario where the central and quite secure exchange
works and half the profit is poured purely into increased security, the
other half towards the next projects. If it all bloats up enough there'll
be a little horde of people working on those problems I'd have tackled
myself years later.
In that scenario everyone wins much more.

So how do they do that? If there's power failure on a specific box, what
happens? Are all transactions synced to disk before commit, thus minimal
rollbacks? A minimal rollback takes a very small margin of what would
happen in case of power failure on a box. Maybe they have several boxes
advocating a single transaction, so that expectible failures would never
crash a system completely.
I can imagine mitigating this by redundantly processing everything, in
which case sequence must be kept somehow and so I can't imagine it being
ridiculously fast. Maybe you mean the throughput is insane, because that'd
make more sense given the multiple months of CPU being thrown at it. If you
didn't then caching would just slow things down (most of the time).
Finance should run better on SSDs, so I imagine this is an old story.
Overall a bit confusing, and I'd love some more details! Like, why are they
even using disks when fiber and RAM might be faster and similarly reliable?

This sort of mechanism is explicit with the corporate structure. The
suggestion that "Payout% = responsibility%" is highly simplified compared
to the current real-world complexity. Not to mention that usually payout
means everything is A-Okay.
Yeah. Because I really don't see the interesting properties emerge from
Strangecoin as described. Bitcoin has this issue where people think it's
things it's not. In money human perception is vital. Yet (economic) reality
eventually persists trough any veil of beauty.
Strangecoin *seems *to have nothing but very a-typical properties.
Afterwards you seem to describe some properties you'd really like to see. I
cannot judge how well you achieved them.
Even when you've modeled a good ideal-world, there's still the journey
there. With Bitcoin the journey is pretty solid (we're seeing it). The
final situation is a subject of much speculation. I suspect Satoshi just
checked his own value in the final situation and decided "Awh, what the
hell", given it can't go wrong.
So, does Bitcoin have any desirable (inherent) property except that it'll
spread? Maybe, but it would only be that of cold-hearted economics. The
kind humans are exceedingly bad at. Human Failure, much more than economic
failure, causes current situations.
Human Failure is encouraged by soft-economics, as it reduces the penalty
for failure. Things like picking the wrong bank, not spreading risks, etc.
There's no course in primary school for evading Human Failure in this
aspect, even though it's the very core of humanity's current existence. Any
speculation as to why?
Either way, no currency alone will solve Human Failure. Even if Strangecoin
would have very nice properties there will be misunderstanding of it, and
it will be applied wrongly in nearly every situation. It will fail less
than it should, because the "brick wall" that should be hit will also have
the same misconceptions about finance.

I spent days feeling sick because I couldn't figure out a way to do
exchanges distributed over sufficiently geographically disperse points to
avoid trouble with a single government going mad. Then I realized the
Megaupload situation means that any US-ally country is susceptible to a
planned US-exercise.
Once I found that I cannot trust maybe 150 countries in the world with the
rest being mostly unsuitable, that turned into a bit of a problem. Suddenly
you find yourself thinking about how to get servers up in Iran, Irak,
India?, Morocco?, Laos?, Vietnam?, Cuba, Russia, China, North Korea
(scratch that) and maybe Iceland and some micronations.
You're thinking you can't trust others to set up the server, and you don't
want the costs, exposure and actual unsafety that comes with visiting all
America's enemies so you'll end up shipping wholesome servers to be loaded
straight into a rack.
Then you realize you're still not physically secure. The server itself is a
hotbox of 100% exposure. It's exceedingly unusual to want a physically
dispersed leaderless secure computing cluster with hot failover of a large
portion of servers (>49% is impossible, can't determine if you're being
fucked in the BGP).
If you let the box call homes first (homes is the list of other servers) it
can use it's already present crypto to prevent any possible MITM or
listening in. So that's good. Problem is a little liquid nitrogen,
connection on a bus or firewire port, etc. is enough to make the server
bleed information faster than the Titanic ate water. So you have to cut the
firefire connections (USB is okay and convenient AFAIC) and heat-conductive
epoxy the motherboard, RAM and a good margin around the CPU too (use a
taller and wider cooler than usual). Maybe even run some wires through it
to measure breach.
I have some additional ideas that are better obscure than open, but you get
the level of obnoxious. It's still not secure yet though, and that bothers
me a lot.
Then you find out Intel's chips have all sorts of hyperintelligence on it
to allow "remote administration" which just blew my fucking mind halfway
across the galaxy. "Dear NSA, have a backdoor into any PC that has a NIC.
Thank you for making us the industry leader, Kind regards\nX\nIntel". So
I'm thinking you'll probably want the beefiest ARM processor or maybe even
AMD (have to do more research). Of course a wiretap could expose the magic
packets, to prevent the NSA from being able to launder the exploit as some
more simple hack that doesn't point the finger at them. And then their
ability here couldn't be used because they want to reserve it for, you
know, WW3 time (hey China).
Once you have your physical platform you have to make sure the software is
okay. I found that it's entirely impossible to not trust your compiler. And
the likelihood of cutting yourself is way too high with low level
languages. I've so far permitted myself to use Node.js, and I feel plenty
bad about that. You can not trust your SSL unit. You can not trust any
library or database software. But you have to, because you can't do better.
(I did go for OpenBSD, although many things required hand compilation which
I wasn't familiar with )
By now I'm a week further in worrying and researching, I'm sweating more at
night, I don't feel comfortable using my own computer anymore, I don't
understand why the world isn't a chaotic place where no computer ever is
not hacked out of it's guts. I realize it's probably because nobody is
motivated and smart enough to go through the effort, and then also doesn't
get caught except for those that'd pay a high price to hide their
capabilities, which is why you'd never notice.
Knowing all this I quite damn well decided I couldn't make a secure and
reliable centralized exchange. No distributed exchange would earn me a
profit, which I'd need to produce more software to help other people's life
better, so that wouldn't really help either. Aside from the fact that it
would not be popular because it'd be slower and less easy than a "central"
Overall I decided I respect greatly the people that take on this challenge.
This was over a year ago.
Looking at the hacks that happen I'm mostly shocked to find the level of
stupidity. Shocked as much to see how long things just go on without
significant trouble. MtGox failing because money dissapeared over the
years... That was shocking at an unbelievable level. The first thing would
be a BIG CLOCK in the office, showing total supposed amount of Bitcoin
according to the servers and the total amount supposedly in wallets
according to the Blockchain. If not that than at least an alarm on a
dedicated phone, e-mails and a message on the admin interface (if you have
one). Somehow they had none of those. I'm amazed. This is just an aspect.
They run Ubuntu (thick stack linux) and PHP (thick stack webserver), which
are illogical choices. The list goes on.
So I think I'm capable of making an exchange platform that's far better
than what's out there right now. And I will once I have time (I really
don't have it right now, life is such a fuzz).
I still question if it'd be used by anyone. But at least I can try.

So how do they do that? If there's power failure on a specific box, what
happens? Are all transactions synced to disk before commit, thus minimal
rollbacks? A minimal rollback takes a very small margin of what would
happen in case of power failure on a box. Maybe they have several boxes
advocating a single transaction, so that expectible failures would never
crash a system completely.
I can imagine mitigating this by redundantly processing everything, in
which case sequence must be kept somehow and so I can't imagine it being
ridiculously fast. Maybe you mean the throughput is insane, because that'd
make more sense given the multiple months of CPU being thrown at it. If you
didn't then caching would just slow things down (most of the time).
Finance should run better on SSDs, so I imagine this is an old story.

even using disks when fiber and RAM might be faster and similarly reliable?

This sort of mechanism is explicit with the corporate structure. The

Yeah. Because I really don't see the interesting properties emerge from
Strangecoin as described. Bitcoin has this issue where people think it's
things it's not. In money human perception is vital. Yet (economic) reality
eventually persists trough any veil of beauty.
Strangecoin *seems *to have nothing but very a-typical properties.
Afterwards you seem to describe some properties you'd really like to see. I
cannot judge how well you achieved them.
Even when you've modeled a good ideal-world, there's still the journey
there. With Bitcoin the journey is pretty solid (we're seeing it). The
final situation is a subject of much speculation. I suspect Satoshi just
checked his own value in the final situation and decided "Awh, what the
hell", given it can't go wrong.
So, does Bitcoin have any desirable (inherent) property except that it'll
spread? Maybe, but it would only be that of cold-hearted economics. The
kind humans are exceedingly bad at. Human Failure, much more than economic
failure, causes current situations.
Human Failure is encouraged by soft-economics, as it reduces the penalty
for failure. Things like picking the wrong bank, not spreading risks, etc.
There's no course in primary school for evading Human Failure in this
aspect, even though it's the very core of humanity's current existence. Any
speculation as to why?
Either way, no currency alone will solve Human Failure. Even if Strangecoin
would have very nice properties there will be misunderstanding of it, and
it will be applied wrongly in nearly every situation. It will fail less
than it should, because the "brick wall" that should be hit will also have
the same misconceptions about finance.

Why are you always so mad, Juan?
Let's leave governance to the free market, the bigger the capitalist the
more righteous his decrees! Market competition will enforce 100%
transparacy, else people will visit the competition for it! In any true
free market economies of scale don't exist and competition is so closely
tied any offense will cause disappearance! Finance is totally not already
so unbalanced a free market cannot exist!
I fiercely hate anyone telling me what to do or what to think. Vacuum
reality arguments essential to capitalism, and the ease at which they're
propagated, recently anger me about as much.
We have true capitalism already Juan! Governments compete for posession of
the mind! Ideologies live and die in an eternal struggle for superior
infectiousness! Violence, justice, law, masscre, kindness, all these things
are founded in an inherently "free market" reality!
The truth is we're closing on the endgame. The one true ideological
survivor. Some hybrid monster of many governments clustered into a
supergovernment that spans mankind and directs all that is. It's
inevitable; economies of scale at work. Slowly all our diversities will
fade as we live in a completely artificially equalized reality, no ability
to compete due to immense scale. In more ways than not, we're already there.
My suggestion is to welcome our new robotic overlords. Or, steer the
vehicle instead of denying you're in it. Just deal with it somehow.
Maybe we can create such an overgovernment that all our desired freedoms
and abilities are present in the future (unlike today!).
What are you badmouthing nazi's for? Easy on the US cool-aid, mate.

is, governmental terror costs way more. And even with a good government

liberty is a damage paid cheaply with children's lives.
That sounds harsh, but it isn't. Unless they're going to make believable

seatbelt costs lives. Not putting lithium in the water costs lives.
Influenza, and a lack of smart and organized medical spending are the

Android is a really bad environment, security wise. The securephone (or
whatever it's called) did very little to assuage worries. The stack is way
too tall! The attack surface is *huge*. Then through the Google Store,
which is a problem too. Maybe Moxxie decided that any threat model that
include an adversarial Google will result in immediate loss, thus decided
that Google was his friend?

Why are you always so mad, Juan?
Let's leave governance to the free market, the bigger the capitalist the
more righteous his decrees! Market competition will enforce 100%
transparacy, else people will visit the competition for it! In any true
free market economies of scale don't exist and competition is so closely
tied any offense will cause disappearance! Finance is totally not already
so unbalanced a free market cannot exist!
I fiercely hate anyone telling me what to do or what to think. Vacuum
reality arguments essential to capitalism, and the ease at which they're
propagated, recently anger me about as much.
We have true capitalism already Juan! Governments compete for posession of
the mind! Ideologies live and die in an eternal struggle for superior
infectiousness! Violence, justice, law, masscre, kindness, all these things
are founded in an inherently "free market" reality!
The truth is we're closing on the endgame. The one true ideological
survivor. Some hybrid monster of many governments clustered into a
supergovernment that spans mankind and directs all that is. It's
inevitable; economies of scale at work. Slowly all our diversities will
fade as we live in a completely artificially equalized reality, no ability
to compete due to immense scale. In more ways than not, we're already there.
My suggestion is to welcome our new robotic overlords. Or, steer the
vehicle instead of denying you're in it. Just deal with it somehow.
Maybe we can create such an overgovernment that all our desired freedoms
and abilities are present in the future (unlike today!).
What are you badmouthing nazi's for? Easy on the US cool-aid, mate.

Yes and no, precision of language can be greater and smaller. It's much
overlooked. I find especially computer-related law lacks precision. I also
find that precise law is essential, lest it is not law at all. We also see
that the "intention of the lawmaker" is an important factor.
Finally, we even see laws that depend upon interpretation yet to be given
by judges that may oppose directly. Often we see "fundamental law", eg
human rights, opposing more readily changed law. And the readily changed
law wins easily if polticians interpreted laws in ways that make it simple.
Ah, but that wasn't the question. A judge must always give precedence to
constitutional laws. How could a judge explain the second amendment such
that machine guns could be illegal?
I suspect that ruling should be exceedingly controversial and dangerous.

But surprisingly relevant.
Law is supposedly coherent and, nowadays, all encompassing. An argument
valid in the US will hold in all the Western countries, and probably those
are or pretend to be developed nations as well.
I've thought and read about the subject some more. It's relevant, bizarre,
historic and, like many judgements are, of incredible importance.
So, there's no proper judgement on it as of yet. Shocking, given how core
weaponry is to much of the US' image.
My personal opinion is that the 200usd claim cannot constitutionally be
charged, as it could, for some, infringe the ability to bear arms, thus
preventing them from obtaining/executing their right. I do think they could
charge it provided they do not charge it to someone that can trivially
afford it, although avoiding the difficulty in finding that price point has
strong preference.
I say this mostly because of a European Court judgement against The
Netherlands regarding a visa for family members costing a prohibitive per
family member, afterwards a maximum price was determined with no regard to
applicants' ability to apply for it. A still unsatisfactory situation, but
it wouldn't be practical otherwise.
The Supreme Court, however, found other reasons to find that the NFA was
It shouldn't be a big difference. The only thing to do is become part of a
militia, which is a really good idea anyway ("nesssary to the security of a
free State"). The question of which weapons could be of use is easy, ALL OF
Textwise the second amendment is not explitic about which arms must be
allowed to be carried, so there's a bit of a hole there. It wouldn't be a
meaningfull text if it didn't refer to all arms equally.
I would say there's some syntax/semantics going wrong there. If an entity
(item/service/organization/idea/etc) does not contribute to "the common
defense" or such a thing if controlled/used by a disciplined/trained
organization of people, how could it be a weapon? If it is not "arms", then
it could not be protected by the second amendment.
That's a signficantly wider category than arms is typically considered to
be. But making it smaller is difficult against the thorn of time.
So for better or worse, the Supreme Court standard now is that the
That's such a non-sequitor that I feel like I just don't understand, but
it's probably just how it is. If the People let their rights be taken from
them, by those elected by them, then there is no helping it anyway.
It is in many ways their job to interpret the law the way it is commonly
accepted to be.
Treating legal persons, corporate or corporal, similarly is pretty
reasonable. It's just when it disempowers people where it should do the
opposite that angst really starts seeping in. There should be recognition
of capabilities, an individual or small company cannot (may not?) be
expected to be able to perform like a larger company can. Different people
can neither be expected to perform to the same standards, for example in
case of mental illness.
Thank you for the dissertation. It was well received :)
I think no judge can sanely claim gun regulations that restrict the right
to bear arms to be constitutional. Specifically of paramount and
contemporary importance is the protection against a tyranical government,
and foreign attacks from geopolitical powers like China and Russia and,
most Catch-22ish terrorists and murderers, in mass shootings or otherwise.
I would very much appreciate people being encouraged to take arms in the
context of militia's. A single armed man is not reliable enough, nor
capable enough, to contribute meaningfully to the common defense or any
such thing.
I also would bid the United States' federal government to provide an
interpretation of the second amendment that allows the states to prevent
purchase or transfer of certain devices when not in conjunction with a
militia. That militia's may be registered at the state or federal
government, at no charge to them, limited only in that it requires several
natural persons to create it and that these natural persons may only
participate in three militia's. That militia's must in some shape or form
encourage the discipline to comply with laws as they apply in their area of
operation, lest they are an encouragement of criminal behavior and are
indeed not militia's at all. And more such rules as provide a regulated
environment in which one may justly execute his or her right to keep and
bear arms
After all, a device handled by one not trained to use it can never be arms
at all.
To apply this directly to cryptography: export and import could still very
well be made illegal. The truth is that information should be free, because
without free information reality becomes distorted in ways that can cause
harm beyond belief.**

collectively attempted to heat the outside air it was bound to work. I had
a pretty hard time imagining where all the heat must go. It turns out that
cities are actually ~3 degrees (celcius ofc!) warmer because the air is
heated (and slowed bc of buildings). It also turns out we lose insanely
huge amounts of energy to space, yet do not cool down because the sun
blasts in really about as much. So 8 year old me was right in his

to vouch for anything that hurts their bottom line more than it does
America's, given they will have hardly any trouble at all with climate
change. Hell, Russia might become a nice place to visit and China might
have some use for its desert highlands. Burn on, comrades!
Note that the solution is trivial! We have ("share") a certain amount of
destroyable earth, we can only spew so much of this and that over a certain
time period. At the scale at which it matters, global pollution at the
global level (UN), local polution at the local level (provincially or
nationally), the amount of destroyable earth should be estimated* and
auctioned. Sounds atrivial? That's because everyone's fucking incompetent

You'll probably be the offender in their eyes.
The thing is, violence is difficult. You're not allowed to harm a foreign
national (I'd be Dutch, you'd be whatever you'd be) for no reason
whatsoever. So maybe the coast guard will trick you into doing something
wrong, like shooting them first. There's no territorial waters when you're
not a nation, so they'll be allowed to ship right in.
But either they don't have a reason to care (and why would you do it?) or
they cannot do something (which is highly circumstantial) or you're just

For me the reason for a kernel is existing drivers and a proven
infrastructure. You want to make the protocol and data as non-native as
possible, change it around as much as you can, to remove potential
exploits. There's just too many exploits though :(... No way to protect
against an exploited PDF, unless you want to reformat the PDF's (maybe into
JPG?). You could theoretically do that on the fly with L4, but with
bare-metal you'd be hurting yourself a lot.
Which also brings us back to Eugen, Eugen, for what is USB flash Biosafety
4? What do you want to do with these drives? Just moving data in, without
moving data out? Or just preventing some magical build-into-the-chipset
exploits (like is possible with Firewire)?
All of those could be brought with an L4-running device with USB and
another protocol, allowing better connectivity, too. But depending on the
threat model, less might be enough (or more!).
I think an air-gap is supposed to be gapped both ways. one could create a
purpose-specific data format, that can be re-interpreted by the software
running on the L4 device. Then, when transferring a file, the L4 device
will read the stuff from the USB, reinterpret it to ensure correct
formatting, write it out to the other side in whatever way chosen.
Depending on volume it might be feasible to transfer manually, just mash it
into a (radiation isolated!) keyboard.

Yes and no, precision of language can be greater and smaller. It's much
overlooked. I find especially computer-related law lacks precision. I also
find that precise law is essential, lest it is not law at all. We also see
that the "intention of the lawmaker" is an important factor.
Finally, we even see laws that depend upon interpretation yet to be given
by judges that may oppose directly. Often we see "fundamental law", eg
human rights, opposing more readily changed law. And the readily changed
law wins easily if polticians interpreted laws in ways that make it simple.
Ah, but that wasn't the question. A judge must always give precedence to
constitutional laws. How could a judge explain the second amendment such
that machine guns could be illegal?
I suspect that ruling should be exceedingly controversial and dangerous.

But surprisingly relevant.
Law is supposedly coherent and, nowadays, all encompassing. An argument
valid in the US will hold in all the Western countries, and probably those
are or pretend to be developed nations as well.
I've thought and read about the subject some more. It's relevant, bizarre,
historic and, like many judgements are, of incredible importance.
So, there's no proper judgement on it as of yet. Shocking, given how core
weaponry is to much of the US' image.
My personal opinion is that the 200usd claim cannot constitutionally be
charged, as it could, for some, infringe the ability to bear arms, thus
preventing them from obtaining/executing their right. I do think they could
charge it provided they do not charge it to someone that can trivially
afford it, although avoiding the difficulty in finding that price point has
strong preference.
I say this mostly because of a European Court judgement against The
Netherlands regarding a visa for family members costing a prohibitive per
family member, afterwards a maximum price was determined with no regard to
applicants' ability to apply for it. A still unsatisfactory situation, but
it wouldn't be practical otherwise.
The Supreme Court, however, found other reasons to find that the NFA was
It shouldn't be a big difference. The only thing to do is become part of a
militia, which is a really good idea anyway ("nesssary to the security of a
free State"). The question of which weapons could be of use is easy, ALL OF
Textwise the second amendment is not explitic about which arms must be
allowed to be carried, so there's a bit of a hole there. It wouldn't be a
meaningfull text if it didn't refer to all arms equally.
I would say there's some syntax/semantics going wrong there. If an entity
(item/service/organization/idea/etc) does not contribute to "the common
defense" or such a thing if controlled/used by a disciplined/trained
organization of people, how could it be a weapon? If it is not "arms", then
it could not be protected by the second amendment.
That's a signficantly wider category than arms is typically considered to
be. But making it smaller is difficult against the thorn of time.
So for better or worse, the Supreme Court standard now is that the
That's such a non-sequitor that I feel like I just don't understand, but
it's probably just how it is. If the People let their rights be taken from
them, by those elected by them, then there is no helping it anyway.
It is in many ways their job to interpret the law the way it is commonly
accepted to be.
Treating legal persons, corporate or corporal, similarly is pretty
reasonable. It's just when it disempowers people where it should do the
opposite that angst really starts seeping in. There should be recognition
of capabilities, an individual or small company cannot (may not?) be
expected to be able to perform like a larger company can. Different people
can neither be expected to perform to the same standards, for example in
case of mental illness.
Thank you for the dissertation. It was well received :)
I think no judge can sanely claim gun regulations that restrict the right
to bear arms to be constitutional. Specifically of paramount and
contemporary importance is the protection against a tyranical government,
and foreign attacks from geopolitical powers like China and Russia and,
most Catch-22ish terrorists and murderers, in mass shootings or otherwise.
I would very much appreciate people being encouraged to take arms in the
context of militia's. A single armed man is not reliable enough, nor
capable enough, to contribute meaningfully to the common defense or any
such thing.
I also would bid the United States' federal government to provide an
interpretation of the second amendment that allows the states to prevent
purchase or transfer of certain devices when not in conjunction with a
militia. That militia's may be registered at the state or federal
government, at no charge to them, limited only in that it requires several
natural persons to create it and that these natural persons may only
participate in three militia's. That militia's must in some shape or form
encourage the discipline to comply with laws as they apply in their area of
operation, lest they are an encouragement of criminal behavior and are
indeed not militia's at all. And more such rules as provide a regulated
environment in which one may justly execute his or her right to keep and
bear arms
After all, a device handled by one not trained to use it can never be arms
at all.
To apply this directly to cryptography: export and import could still very
well be made illegal. The truth is that information should be free, because
without free information reality becomes distorted in ways that can cause
harm beyond belief.**
I seem to have ran offtopic there. It was meant to prove that information
is going to have a lot of changes to it, and knowledge about crypto is
fundamentally information. Important and export restrictions are silly.

else will be lost, copyright and trade secrets have their place for now.
However, not just our ability to store and examine information is becoming
more and more unlocked. The ability to create and collect information has

Juan a reason to deny an overwhelmingly large body of evidence.
When leaving the doors open my father used to say "we're not heating the
outside air", even as an 8 year old I thought that if all houses
collectively attempted to heat the outside air it was bound to work. I had
a pretty hard time imagining where all the heat must go. It turns out that
cities are actually ~3 degrees (celcius ofc!) warmer because the air is
heated (and slowed bc of buildings). It also turns out we lose insanely
huge amounts of energy to space, yet do not cool down because the sun
blasts in really about as much. So 8 year old me was right in his
curiosity, but ultimately his hope that heating the outside air would work
was a little ignorant of the science facts.

America's, given they will have hardly any trouble at all with climate
change. Hell, Russia might become a nice place to visit and China might
have some use for its desert highlands. Burn on, comrades!
Note that the solution is trivial! We have ("share") a certain amount of
destroyable earth, we can only spew so much of this and that over a certain
time period. At the scale at which it matters, global pollution at the
global level (UN), local polution at the local level (provincially or

They send a Coast Guard Cutter and a squad of marines to escort you back

Unfair doesn't factor into it, if you ask me. Being a gentleman... well..
You'll probably be the offender in their eyes.
The thing is, violence is difficult. You're not allowed to harm a foreign
national (I'd be Dutch, you'd be whatever you'd be) for no reason
whatsoever. So maybe the coast guard will trick you into doing something
wrong, like shooting them first. There's no territorial waters when you're
not a nation, so they'll be allowed to ship right in.
But either they don't have a reason to care (and why would you do it?) or
they cannot do something (which is highly circumstantial) or you're just
not their match and lose. You'd say there's a chance you'd win, but there

infrastructure. You want to make the protocol and data as non-native as
possible, change it around as much as you can, to remove potential
exploits. There's just too many exploits though :(... No way to protect
against an exploited PDF, unless you want to reformat the PDF's (maybe into
JPG?). You could theoretically do that on the fly with L4, but with
bare-metal you'd be hurting yourself a lot.
Which also brings us back to Eugen, Eugen, for what is USB flash Biosafety
4? What do you want to do with these drives? Just moving data in, without
moving data out? Or just preventing some magical build-into-the-chipset
exploits (like is possible with Firewire)?
All of those could be brought with an L4-running device with USB and
another protocol, allowing better connectivity, too. But depending on the
threat model, less might be enough (or more!).
I think an air-gap is supposed to be gapped both ways. one could create a
purpose-specific data format, that can be re-interpreted by the software
running on the L4 device. Then, when transferring a file, the L4 device
will read the stuff from the USB, reinterpret it to ensure correct
formatting, write it out to the other side in whatever way chosen.
Depending on volume it might be feasible to transfer manually, just mash it
into a (radiation isolated!) keyboard.

Yes and no, precision of language can be greater and smaller. It's much
overlooked. I find especially computer-related law lacks precision. I also
find that precise law is essential, lest it is not law at all. We also see
that the "intention of the lawmaker" is an important factor.
Finally, we even see laws that depend upon interpretation yet to be given
by judges that may oppose directly. Often we see "fundamental law", eg
human rights, opposing more readily changed law. And the readily changed
law wins easily if polticians interpreted laws in ways that make it simple.
Ah, but that wasn't the question. A judge must always give precedence to
constitutional laws. How could a judge explain the second amendment such
that machine guns could be illegal?
I suspect that ruling should be exceedingly controversial and dangerous.

But surprisingly relevant.
Law is supposedly coherent and, nowadays, all encompassing. An argument
valid in the US will hold in all the Western countries, and probably those
are or pretend to be developed nations as well.
I've thought and read about the subject some more. It's relevant, bizarre,
historic and, like many judgements are, of incredible importance.
So, there's no proper judgement on it as of yet. Shocking, given how core
weaponry is to much of the US' image.
My personal opinion is that the 200usd claim cannot constitutionally be
charged, as it could, for some, infringe the ability to bear arms, thus
preventing them from obtaining/executing their right. I do think they could
charge it provided they do not charge it to someone that can trivially
afford it, although avoiding the difficulty in finding that price point has
strong preference.
I say this mostly because of a European Court judgement against The
Netherlands regarding a visa for family members costing a prohibitive per
family member, afterwards a maximum price was determined with no regard to
applicants' ability to apply for it. A still unsatisfactory situation, but
it wouldn't be practical otherwise.
The Supreme Court, however, found other reasons to find that the NFA was
It shouldn't be a big difference. The only thing to do is become part of a
militia, which is a really good idea anyway ("nesssary to the security of a
free State"). The question of which weapons could be of use is easy, ALL OF
Textwise the second amendment is not explitic about which arms must be
allowed to be carried, so there's a bit of a hole there. It wouldn't be a
meaningfull text if it didn't refer to all arms equally.
I would say there's some syntax/semantics going wrong there. If an entity
(item/service/organization/idea/etc) does not contribute to "the common
defense" or such a thing if controlled/used by a disciplined/trained
organization of people, how could it be a weapon? If it is not "arms", then
it could not be protected by the second amendment.
That's a signficantly wider category than arms is typically considered to
be. But making it smaller is difficult against the thorn of time.
So for better or worse, the Supreme Court standard now is that the
That's such a non-sequitor that I feel like I just don't understand, but
it's probably just how it is. If the People let their rights be taken from
them, by those elected by them, then there is no helping it anyway.
It is in many ways their job to interpret the law the way it is commonly
accepted to be.
Treating legal persons, corporate or corporal, similarly is pretty
reasonable. It's just when it disempowers people where it should do the
opposite that angst really starts seeping in. There should be recognition
of capabilities, an individual or small company cannot (may not?) be
expected to be able to perform like a larger company can. Different people
can neither be expected to perform to the same standards, for example in
case of mental illness.
Thank you for the dissertation. It was well received :)
I think no judge can sanely claim gun regulations that restrict the right
to bear arms to be constitutional. Specifically of paramount and
contemporary importance is the protection against a tyranical government,
and foreign attacks from geopolitical powers like China and Russia and,
most Catch-22ish terrorists and murderers, in mass shootings or otherwise.
I would very much appreciate people being encouraged to take arms in the
context of militia's. A single armed man is not reliable enough, nor
capable enough, to contribute meaningfully to the common defense or any
such thing.
I also would bid the United States' federal government to provide an
interpretation of the second amendment that allows the states to prevent
purchase or transfer of certain devices when not in conjunction with a
militia. That militia's may be registered at the state or federal
government, at no charge to them, limited only in that it requires several
natural persons to create it and that these natural persons may only
participate in three militia's. That militia's must in some shape or form
encourage the discipline to comply with laws as they apply in their area of
operation, lest they are an encouragement of criminal behavior and are
indeed not militia's at all. And more such rules as provide a regulated
environment in which one may justly execute his or her right to keep and
bear arms
After all, a device handled by one not trained to use it can never be arms
at all.
To apply this directly to cryptography: export and import could still very
well be made illegal. The truth is that information should be free, because
without free information reality becomes distorted in ways that can cause
harm beyond belief.**
I seem to have ran offtopic there. It was meant to prove that information
is going to have a lot of changes to it, and knowledge about crypto is
fundamentally information. Important and export restrictions are silly.

else will be lost, copyright and trade secrets have their place for now.
However, not just our ability to store and examine information is becoming
more and more unlocked. The ability to create and collect information has
been growing at least as explosively. The cost of a networked video

Juan a reason to deny an overwhelmingly large body of evidence.
When leaving the doors open my father used to say "we're not heating the
outside air", even as an 8 year old I thought that if all houses
collectively attempted to heat the outside air it was bound to work. I had
a pretty hard time imagining where all the heat must go. It turns out that
cities are actually ~3 degrees (celcius ofc!) warmer because the air is
heated (and slowed bc of buildings). It also turns out we lose insanely
huge amounts of energy to space, yet do not cool down because the sun
blasts in really about as much. So 8 year old me was right in his
curiosity, but ultimately his hope that heating the outside air would work
was a little ignorant of the science facts.

to vouch for anything that hurts their bottom line more than it does
America's, given they will have hardly any trouble at all with climate
change. Hell, Russia might become a nice place to visit and China might
have some use for its desert highlands. Burn on, comrades!
Note that the solution is trivial! We have ("share") a certain amount of
destroyable earth, we can only spew so much of this and that over a certain
time period. At the scale at which it matters, global pollution at the
global level (UN), local polution at the local level (provincially or
nationally), the amount of destroyable earth should be estimated* and
auctioned. Sounds atrivial? That's because everyone's fucking incompetent

They send a Coast Guard Cutter and a squad of marines to escort you back

declare war without first declaring you a nation, which they won't, because
internationallylegally you aren't.
Unfair doesn't factor into it, if you ask me. Being a gentleman... well..
You'll probably be the offender in their eyes.
The thing is, violence is difficult. You're not allowed to harm a foreign
national (I'd be Dutch, you'd be whatever you'd be) for no reason
whatsoever. So maybe the coast guard will trick you into doing something
wrong, like shooting them first. There's no territorial waters when you're
not a nation, so they'll be allowed to ship right in.
But either they don't have a reason to care (and why would you do it?) or
they cannot do something (which is highly circumstantial) or you're just
not their match and lose. You'd say there's a chance you'd win, but there

I suggested one of the Bitcoin ATM guys to use two boards. One board is
connected like normally to networks and accessories and the like. That one
board also has a custom connection to the other board. The other board
contains all the secrets and performs all the important functions. The one
board just communicates.
The advantage is that once the big bad guys crack your baseband, your
chipset, your system on a chip's trapcards, etc. your secrets are still
safe. If you sign all the packets that pass through the communication board
you can truly abstract away from almost every possible hack that both the
boards could be vulnerable for. (Do you trust your silicon?)

We seriously need a way to detach code from mental models to expose hidden

on your computer, exploits and all, is something you run by choice. But
there's no way you could validate the sheer bulk of code. If you want to
really solve security flaws it'll involve somehow validating the
possibilities of the code run.
It's a discipline that touches on visualization, automated testing and

The problem is that there's either no market for "truly secure" computing,
or there's just nobody filling the gap. Banks with their Cobol are laughed

the technical field. And Cobol is definitely not an ideal language. But
"truly secure" is worth a lot to them. L4 validated is a step in the right
direction, but catches a lot of wind saying it's still imperfect and
therefore worthless.

Heartbleed was a memory leak that eventually, after carefully calculated

Shellshock depends on a lot of environmental details, but is possible

I guess heartbleed was actually worse. Who runs webscripts and stuff in

This is what I'm most concerned about! I think the Intel platform is too
big to not be exploited (more or less) on the hardware level. I have a very
little better feeling about AMD but I don't think it's based on much.
The idea that ARM processors are much much smaller and therefore easier to
audit makes them less attractive exploit targets. That, and that they've
only recently come into use, are build by smaller companies, etc. When you
build a SOC around it, well, that's kind of asking for trouble!
The best avoidance method I've come up with so far is taking two units,
(bitbanging) I2C (or whatever) over the IO pins to do "networking" from one
to the other, connect one to the Internet and the other exclusively over
those IO pins. That way, whatever exploit is present is VERY unlikely to be
triggered. It's... still not 100% of course.. If the exploit is on the
relevant IO pins, well, it just might be trigger-able by manipulating the
network traffic. Maybe write high every so many bits just to meddle? It's
closer then anything else, anyway.
As for less paranoid exploits, you have to tell us the threat model! (the
cell shield will very likely be remote exploitable, but only by the really
bad goodies)

"The 'site name' code ensures that all of your passwords are unique. This
protects you from having all of your passwords compromised by a security
lapse on any individual website."
Totally untrue. If any of the websites has failed to do proper password
hashing (or you password is intercepted due to keylogging, bad HTTPS, bad
remote host, etc) then the security of all your passwords will be VERY low,
depending on the length of the site's name. This is because the beginning
of the password is constant, and the latter part is a (partially
discovered) substitution.
Still, for "ye olde user" this isn't that bad. Could easily be improved
with some sort of substitution-ring-scheme, where you have various
substitutions and select the substitution based upon the website's name.
Shouldn't be much more expensive, but could be a bit bulkier (or less
readable hehe).
Would've been much cooler if they had actually put a display on the thing,
and made it hash the constant key, user secret and website name together.
But the price would be higher, so Yubikeys and the like enter the picture.

This is what I'm most concerned about! I think the Intel platform is too
big to not be exploited (more or less) on the hardware level. I have a very
little better feeling about AMD but I don't think it's based on much.
The idea that ARM processors are much much smaller and therefore easier to
audit makes them less attractive exploit targets. That, and that they've
only recently come into use, are build by smaller companies, etc. When you
build a SOC around it, well, that's kind of asking for trouble!
The best avoidance method I've come up with so far is taking two units,
(bitbanging) I2C (or whatever) over the IO pins to do "networking" from one
to the other, connect one to the Internet and the other exclusively over
those IO pins. That way, whatever exploit is present is VERY unlikely to be
triggered. It's... still not 100% of course.. If the exploit is on the
relevant IO pins, well, it just might be trigger-able by manipulating the
network traffic. Maybe write high every so many bits just to meddle? It's
closer then anything else, anyway.
As for less paranoid exploits, you have to tell us the threat model! (the
cell shield will very likely be remote exploitable, but only by the really
bad goodies)

"The 'site name' code ensures that all of your passwords are unique. This
protects you from having all of your passwords compromised by a security
lapse on any individual website."
Totally untrue. If any of the websites has failed to do proper password
hashing (or you password is intercepted due to keylogging, bad HTTPS, bad
remote host, etc) then the security of all your passwords will be VERY low,
depending on the length of the site's name. This is because the beginning
of the password is constant, and the latter part is a (partially
discovered) substitution.
Still, for "ye olde user" this isn't that bad. Could easily be improved
with some sort of substitution-ring-scheme, where you have various
substitutions and select the substitution based upon the website's name.
Shouldn't be much more expensive, but could be a bit bulkier (or less
readable hehe).
Would've been much cooler if they had actually put a display on the thing,
and made it hash the constant key, user secret and website name together.
But the price would be higher, so Yubikeys and the like enter the picture.

The fun began with the implication that healthcare for everyone is a must.
Good healthcare means not dying in good health. Assuming mental health (too
tricky to deal with for this argument) that leaves people that wish to die
in a precarious position. And what do with so many people?
That might seem a strange argument, but it is not at all. Healthcare is yet
imperfect because it's damn hard and expensive. Less surveillance is
easier, not harder.
The problem is that the general public WANTS surveillance. They want to
give away their liberties for the safety it may bring them. Marx had a huge
audience. I do not believe the hackers do.
"Solving" surveilance for me means aligning it with justice, dignity,
freedom and most significantly, tirrany prevention. With the cost of
surveilance only going down we must consider the endgame. The endgame is
full and continuous surveillance. It is inevitable as long as more
surveillance has any advantage. I am not yet sure how to deal with this
properly, and think it a political question.
As for claiming your own privacy: we're far behind in the game for reasons
beyond me. Most likely some modern variant of imperialism, where money is
stolen from the weak and thrown at surveillance (see also the American
budget for the department of unconsitutionality).
To compare these issues with healthcare is meaningless. Although the
conclusion is correct. If there is not far more effort (=money) expanded on
feature-and-convenience parity for privacy-protecting solutions; we're all
royally fucked.
And no violent revolution will beat back the drone armies that already in
flight. The time that a revolution was feasible was already ending when the
founding fathers decreed Americans must bear arms in militias. Without
similar class weaponry there is no chance, regardless of combatant
quantity. The assault rifle cannot match the helicopter, the APC, the
drone, and is not readily available either. The people's organization
(intelligence and command and control infrastructure) will never again
match that of the army. There will be no more violent revolutions. That is
over now.
So, if everyone would be so kind as to think of what to do about a world
steepled in dysfunctional markets ... Well that would probably solve the
privacy thing as well. We'd know to buy safe. And we'd spend a lot more on
healthcare, too, I'm sure. But perhaps before everyone lived indefinitelt,
we should fix democracy, or adopt whatever *cracy does work. Although,
who's first to shoot me when I suggest no person knows what's best even for
himself, or should be left the freedom to make the wrong choice? Besides,
isn't government merely a product on a less free market?
P.S.: i take back everything i stated in this rant. It's the only way
anyone could make a statement nowadays ;)

The fun began with the implication that healthcare for everyone is a must.
Good healthcare means not dying in good health. Assuming mental health (too
tricky to deal with for this argument) that leaves people that wish to die
in a precarious position. And what do with so many people?
That might seem a strange argument, but it is not at all. Healthcare is yet
imperfect because it's damn hard and expensive. Less surveillance is
easier, not harder.
The problem is that the general public WANTS surveillance. They want to
give away their liberties for the safety it may bring them. Marx had a huge
audience. I do not believe the hackers do.
"Solving" surveilance for me means aligning it with justice, dignity,
freedom and most significantly, tirrany prevention. With the cost of
surveilance only going down we must consider the endgame. The endgame is
full and continuous surveillance. It is inevitable as long as more
surveillance has any advantage. I am not yet sure how to deal with this
properly, and think it a political question.
As for claiming your own privacy: we're far behind in the game for reasons
beyond me. Most likely some modern variant of imperialism, where money is
stolen from the weak and thrown at surveillance (see also the American
budget for the department of unconsitutionality).
To compare these issues with healthcare is meaningless. Although the
conclusion is correct. If there is not far more effort (=money) expanded on
feature-and-convenience parity for privacy-protecting solutions; we're all
royally fucked.
And no violent revolution will beat back the drone armies that already in
flight. The time that a revolution was feasible was already ending when the
founding fathers decreed Americans must bear arms in militias. Without
similar class weaponry there is no chance, regardless of combatant
quantity. The assault rifle cannot match the helicopter, the APC, the
drone, and is not readily available either. The people's organization
(intelligence and command and control infrastructure) will never again
match that of the army. There will be no more violent revolutions. That is
over now.
So, if everyone would be so kind as to think of what to do about a world
steepled in dysfunctional markets ... Well that would probably solve the
privacy thing as well. We'd know to buy safe. And we'd spend a lot more on
healthcare, too, I'm sure. But perhaps before everyone lived indefinitelt,
we should fix democracy, or adopt whatever *cracy does work. Although,
who's first to shoot me when I suggest no person knows what's best even for
himself, or should be left the freedom to make the wrong choice? Besides,
isn't government merely a product on a less free market?
P.S.: i take back everything i stated in this rant. It's the only way

2015-07-02 18:38 GMT+09:00 rysiek :
Saying Gavin knows quite a lot about Bitcoin is not an argument of
authority. It doesn't make him right, but it does make him very likely to
be right. Certainly more likely than the heapings of shitty arguments,
especially those that are technically disconnected from what bitcoin is.
When you listen to the arguments about blocksize it usually goes something
 * Cheaper transactions
 * More truly Bitcoin transactions
 * Simplest way to scale
There's some derivative arguments regarding poor people's access to Bitcoin
and a herd of applications that just require cheap access to the
blockchain. I think the most noteworthy argument is:
 * Bitcoin becomes more competitive/attractive as a result of cheaper
 * We can already fit quite some txs
 * the blockchain will be less wieldable
 * the bandwidth required to keep up with the blockchain (regardless of
storage) will increase
 * we can scale externally
The derivative arguments here are also poor people's access to Bitcoin, wrt
bandwidth, but the argument holds up much worse as SPV would work just fine
over those rare very slow connections. Then there's a lot of downright
fearmongering like "only institutions will run full nodes". Economically
that's just not true, and technologically it's not important - crypto
features allow usability immediately (simplefied (commercial) APIs, "blind"
tx broadcasting), strong guarantees *very *quickly (SPV), and certainty and
independence if you'd like it (a pruning full node), and history novelty at
only minor hassle (less than a day's work). Even a 100 fold increase in
blocksize would not radically change this.
It's pretty annoying to have an even bigger blockchain, don't get me wrong
on that, but that's just the way Bitcoin works: a blockchain that grows
with use. There's no reason for it to truly upset you, either. Running a
full node is already something you don't do for no reason at all. I can't
really make this argument as well as I like. The point is that if you have
a reason you would still do it later, and if you don't you don't already.
Some people noted that the pruning makes it possible to run a full node on
their phones. Cool! But there's no reason to. In fact, you won't because
it'd drain your battery. We'll be okay without the one silly geek that does
it anyway.
So.. these points were already hard to argue against clearly. Then there's
"we can scale externally".... The trouble is that there's so many ways,
like pinning (sidechains/mastercoin), exclusively inter-institutional
settlement, debt based moneys ("the bearer of this token is entitled
to..."), and all of them could work! In fact, we could just abandon Bitcoin
alltogether! And that's the core of my counterargument: we don't have to
cripple Bitcoin, so let's not. Let's not make it more complicated than it
has to be. If we do scale externally, let it be for exceedingly good
reasons and at exceedingly competitive prices.
Mostly I see people haggling over nothing on Reddit, and even here. There's
also confusion about roles in the Bitcoin ecosystem, and about ideals. Then
there's confusion about consent, and how to manage it. It's probably
because all those things are badly fleshed out. Hard-to-achieve consensus
has advantages; Bitcoin will be technologically stable. The roles will
shift anyway. Ideals are not inherent, only cold hard currency is. It's
implications depend on culture and math, both generally not very well
understood. Reddit has never been conducive to quality argument - at
fantastic loss to everyone but the populists.
I think, ultimately, that giving Gavin ultimate authority for 10 years then
freezing the whole ordeal would probably work out rather well. I think it's
ran afoul of his control too soon. We already have some weird bugs in
Bitcoin. Then there's some strange (unstudied) economical effects like the
halving (and why not gradual decrease?). I'm sure lots of people found
similar oddities from their perspectives. There's just not much to do about
it anymore now.
The Chinese mining pools stamping their document regarding increasing the
blocksize to 8mb was extraordinary. They ignored Gavin's 20mb or anything
proposal ("or anything" probably mostly to make 20mb seem reasonable). They
stamped - a thing completely outdated in the West, yet common in Asia (and
pretty badass). They are a group of Chinese making law for everyone.
 Gavin appeased them and provided for
unattended growth with a period 8mb increase. Smart move.
So - conclusively - Gavin is a hero, the Internet's retarded, Bitcoin is in
policy jail but it likes it there. Oh, and the free-est market of the world
is already significantly run by Chinese. If you read this far, thanks.

It is, but also it really isn't. Spending an hour of my lawyer talks to
your lawyer costs more than the whole blockchain, including operational
costs, for a long time. If you'd like to do anything with a bank, for a
fraction of the features at IMMENSELY OVERSIZED WTF prices - just the time
spent negotiating it is outrageously more expensive. We're nowhere near
unacceptable, and it doesn't seem we will ever be. It's something to think
about, and you'll have to use SPV/API's in many cases where there would be
some value to not having to use them. That's definitely not convenient, but
also not that big a deal.
Bitcoin is often misrepresented to be:
 * Private
 * Free
 * Promoting equality (it does the /exact/ opposite!)
 * Jesus
Don't play a satire of the shims, Juan. Whales pay liars, just ignore

Bitcoin is cold hard money - therefore benefiting those that can exploit it

There's absolutely no reason to think the NSA doesn't have a
layered/multi-cell operation wherein a mere contractor is not given access
to nation-essential secrets. If there's a foreign spy you want him to
penetrate what seems like a complete organisation. Why not give them what
they want? There's lots of "more secure than FBI/CIA, less secure than 'we
broke enigma' " work to be done, just put it in the public-facing
independently operating organisation.
Would you publish "we broke enigma" in a memo to the intranet? NSA didn't.
NSA wouldn't get worse at what they do.
The real headbreaker is when this is a problem. It's basically not a
problem until you're a threat to the absolute fundamentals of what the NSA
is designed to protect. And what's that? Is it personal freedom, the
advancement of the human race, and the minimization of suffering? Is it the
maximization of some abstract profit? The concentration of power? Do the
latter two pretty much amount to the first?
Intelligence laundering is a serious issue, of course, but running a clean
organization would make the laundering exceedingly hard.
They're each large organizations with no bottom line that attract people of
I'm in Korea, I talked to a bunch of US soldiers stationed here. They're
exceedingly good-hearted, well-intentioned, high-spirited guys. Many love
their work, the tension, the seriousness and hone their performance for
sport and need. The balance between trigger-happy and accident-adverse is
delicate and they seem extensively coached to preserve the balance properly.
I've talked to some that like their state, but hate the FED. I've talked to
some that think the US is bad but it's enemies are worse. I've talked to
some that have doubts about parts of the US, about corruption, but believe
in democracy such that they believe the US is a fundamental force of good.
The lesson is: very moral people still do very immoral things for many,
sometimes excellent, reasons.
I think there's not much difference between organisations. Make sure
people's motivations are sincere and that they put in the effort. There's
apparently a serious issue with "human resource rot" where worse people get
brought into orgs or people get unfocused or demotivated. Without a bottom
line there's less penalty for it. Doesn't mean it will happen. Snowden sure
shows a certain amount of rot in NSA_Public. The recent Trident leak shows
that the UK's nuclear deterrent program is rotten to a ridiculous point,
but seems to indicate the US does much better.

2015-07-15 2:20 GMT+09:00 Kurt Buff :
"All browsers suck"?.. They run HTML pretty darn well. I'd say HTML is a
document language, not an application language, and now it's trying to be
both and it's a pretty psychotic fit. But it still works pretty darn much
better than anything else out there. I'd like there to be an "all settled
standards compliant fast and secure browser", but the secure is usually
omitted (and there's a rush to support the not-quite-settled standards).
Not much wrong with JavaScript, but I hope they'll soon support several
other languages too. Like perhaps LLVM's intermediary format - so we can
compile whatever into a near-metal language that will run really fast. (and
saving a lot of people the effort of writing/maintaining to-js compilers)
But the cloud is a better computational platform because of:
 * Economies of scale for computer electronics, power, network connections
 * Time sharing on the cloud's hardware
 * Sometimes architecture advantages
But, pushing back, there's:
 * Latency/bandwidth to user
 * Loss of end user's control over essential hardware
 * Massive trust and security issues
We're looking at the following:
- micropower devices; IoT and thinner smartphones (less power usage as
batteries do not seem to develop fast), home automation panels, extra
body-mounted-displays, in-car panels, home-appliance panels (refrigerator
to mixer), televisions, alarm clocks, some tablets and laptops
anything with power or financial constraints. These machines are that which
the user interacts with. Their entire design gives way to human preference
and comfort. They do not compute much, and might contain nothing but a
video-stream-decoder and a "window manager" that decodes simple graphics
statements (hopefully simpler than HTML).
- computers; workstations, desktop pc's, laptops, stand-alone "videocards"
with generic computing support, servers, gaming-appliances
fast computers that are positioned somewhere in the house. Low latency to
the user and with very good price/performance relationships (desktops now
are miracles). Given the single-core-ceiling these machines will typically
fare better than ideal cloud setups for many applications. They can be
rented out to remote users dynamically.
- remote processing; the cloud, the neighbors' computers, etc
time-shared computing that is not in-house. Typically high latency,
extremely high maximum power and lowest cost. Latency constraints force it
to be used only for very expensive operations - such as rendering tasks and
machine learning (for business intelligence or otherwise). If the
set-up-time for such an operation is 2000ms many tasks are still better ran
locally - the application-support-system (OS?) will have to make choices
about this rather fast.
What I've described above is a sort of multi-tier architecture. At the
moment remote or local computing is a wild west with exclusively homebrewed
solutions. At some point we will integrate all our devices, and software's
locality will be managed better as well. Encryption will be applied
automatically at the appropriate places. I think the largest desired
capability is the inaptly named "homomorphic encryption", which should be
optimized and packaged such that heavy processing can be remotely executed
in a safe and trustless manner.
What is to be done? Well, I hope we can avoid the situation where we run
the browsers and they run the software. We're going there now because the
architecture I mentioned does not exist - and because it's a simpler model.
A business could be made out of making hardware that follows the above
model, that would probably be the best way to make it happen. Elsewise
we're all along for the ride that the unknowing public is buying us into.

Parallel construction and intelligence laundering take care of this in case
they want to abuse your data. Big Data is never very much of a privacy
issue, but when they silently use that Big Data for their (or their
companies') profit, well, without competition you'll lose. And then there's
straight business-secret-stealing, which they also do, and which is very
hard to ever find out about (parallel construction is also possible here).
So, yeah, they'll protect their billions in income and valuation. And
they'll use all the intelligence the US can bring to the table to do it.

Anyone care for a law that will:
1. Ban unhackable vehicles and other life-critical devices (meaning:
life-critical software must be rewritable)
2. Require all life-critical software to be released in source format, for
the purpose of public auditing, improving it's safety features and
employing the software on the devices it is intended for.
3. Any tools used to translate the source to writable code must also be
provided in the manner of 2.
These laws should still allow manufacturers to:
1. Spy on their users without that being changed
2. Lock down their code so competitors may not use it (proprietary open
3. Have software in the machines that is not opened; so long as it is
properly (verifiably) isolated from essential systems
4. Legally own the entire machine
5. Drop guarantees when non-security-related modifications have been made
This law should be as precise and immutable as possible. This is not a
matter of "I want to hack things" or "competition would be better if it
were open" or "I want to own what I have/use", etc, etc. Being precise with
the law allows it to pass more readily.
Personally I think if everything were required open source and
self-compiled; that would objectively be better for humanity as a whole.
For protecting innovation there's patents, closing the source is excess.
Etc. etc.
But this is not about fun. This is about extremely basic safety. It is
about national security; if 500,000 cars go haywire at the same time a lot
of deaths, directly and indirectly, can be expected. And it's not just the
cars; it's also the industrial machines, medical equipment, the metro's and
trains, the automated cars and busses and trucks and aircraft, medium sized
hobbyist drones, heaters, stoves and ovens, automated doors, elevators,
fire, smoke and other emergency alarms, etc.
Should a foreign country cyberattack whilst doing any other kind of large
scale attack; the effects could be devastating. Should a person be marked
for assassination, no one would be the wiser.
I'd argue for similar protection for fridges, televisions, smartphones,
etc, etc, as more and more items are expected to become networked and
essential for upholding basic freedoms and ways of life. And I'd argue to
have it for privacy; not just essential safety.
Simply put; the simple version of the law above is imperative for personal
and national security. And it doesn't exist.

trust my government to act as it should if every public servant can be
blackmailed or thoroughly spied upon. It's not hard to improve security;

Saying Gavin knows quite a lot about Bitcoin is not an argument of
authority. It doesn't make him right, but it does make him very likely to
be right. Certainly more likely than the heapings of shitty arguments,
especially those that are technically disconnected from what bitcoin is.
When you listen to the arguments about blocksize it usually goes something
 * Cheaper transactions
 * More truly Bitcoin transactions
 * Simplest way to scale
There's some derivative arguments regarding poor people's access to Bitcoin
and a herd of applications that just require cheap access to the
blockchain. I think the most noteworthy argument is:
 * Bitcoin becomes more competitive/attractive as a result of cheaper
 * We can already fit quite some txs
 * the blockchain will be less wieldable
 * the bandwidth required to keep up with the blockchain (regardless of
storage) will increase
 * we can scale externally
The derivative arguments here are also poor people's access to Bitcoin, wrt
bandwidth, but the argument holds up much worse as SPV would work just fine
over those rare very slow connections. Then there's a lot of downright
fearmongering like "only institutions will run full nodes". Economically
that's just not true, and technologically it's not important - crypto
features allow usability immediately (simplefied (commercial) APIs, "blind"
tx broadcasting), strong guarantees *very *quickly (SPV), and certainty and
independence if you'd like it (a pruning full node), and history novelty at
only minor hassle (less than a day's work). Even a 100 fold increase in
blocksize would not radically change this.
It's pretty annoying to have an even bigger blockchain, don't get me wrong
on that, but that's just the way Bitcoin works: a blockchain that grows
with use. There's no reason for it to truly upset you, either. Running a
full node is already something you don't do for no reason at all. I can't
really make this argument as well as I like. The point is that if you have
a reason you would still do it later, and if you don't you don't already.
Some people noted that the pruning makes it possible to run a full node on
their phones. Cool! But there's no reason to. In fact, you won't because
it'd drain your battery. We'll be okay without the one silly geek that does
it anyway.
So.. these points were already hard to argue against clearly. Then there's
"we can scale externally".... The trouble is that there's so many ways,
like pinning (sidechains/mastercoin), exclusively inter-institutional
settlement, debt based moneys ("the bearer of this token is entitled
to..."), and all of them could work! In fact, we could just abandon Bitcoin
alltogether! And that's the core of my counterargument: we don't have to
cripple Bitcoin, so let's not. Let's not make it more complicated than it
has to be. If we do scale externally, let it be for exceedingly good
reasons and at exceedingly competitive prices.
Mostly I see people haggling over nothing on Reddit, and even here. There's
also confusion about roles in the Bitcoin ecosystem, and about ideals. Then
there's confusion about consent, and how to manage it. It's probably
because all those things are badly fleshed out. Hard-to-achieve consensus
has advantages; Bitcoin will be technologically stable. The roles will
shift anyway. Ideals are not inherent, only cold hard currency is. It's
implications depend on culture and math, both generally not very well
understood. Reddit has never been conducive to quality argument - at
fantastic loss to everyone but the populists.
I think, ultimately, that giving Gavin ultimate authority for 10 years then
freezing the whole ordeal would probably work out rather well. I think it's
ran afoul of his control too soon. We already have some weird bugs in
Bitcoin. Then there's some strange (unstudied) economical effects like the
halving (and why not gradual decrease?). I'm sure lots of people found
similar oddities from their perspectives. There's just not much to do about
it anymore now.
The Chinese mining pools stamping their document regarding increasing the
blocksize to 8mb was extraordinary. They ignored Gavin's 20mb or anything
proposal ("or anything" probably mostly to make 20mb seem reasonable). They
stamped - a thing completely outdated in the West, yet common in Asia (and
pretty badass). They are a group of Chinese making law for everyone.
 Gavin appeased them and provided for
unattended growth with a period 8mb increase. Smart move.
So - conclusively - Gavin is a hero, the Internet's retarded, Bitcoin is in
policy jail but it likes it there. Oh, and the free-est market of the world
is already significantly run by Chinese. If you read this far, thanks.

It is, but also it really isn't. Spending an hour of my lawyer talks to
your lawyer costs more than the whole blockchain, including operational
costs, for a long time. If you'd like to do anything with a bank, for a
fraction of the features at IMMENSELY OVERSIZED WTF prices - just the time
spent negotiating it is outrageously more expensive. We're nowhere near
unacceptable, and it doesn't seem we will ever be. It's something to think
about, and you'll have to use SPV/API's in many cases where there would be
some value to not having to use them. That's definitely not convenient, but
also not that big a deal.
Bitcoin is often misrepresented to be:
 * Private
 * Free
 * Promoting equality (it does the /exact/ opposite!)
 * Jesus

There's absolutely no reason to think the NSA doesn't have a
layered/multi-cell operation wherein a mere contractor is not given access
to nation-essential secrets. If there's a foreign spy you want him to
penetrate what seems like a complete organisation. Why not give them what
they want? There's lots of "more secure than FBI/CIA, less secure than 'we
broke enigma' " work to be done, just put it in the public-facing
independently operating organisation.
Would you publish "we broke enigma" in a memo to the intranet? NSA didn't.
NSA wouldn't get worse at what they do.
The real headbreaker is when this is a problem. It's basically not a
problem until you're a threat to the absolute fundamentals of what the NSA
is designed to protect. And what's that? Is it personal freedom, the
advancement of the human race, and the minimization of suffering? Is it the
maximization of some abstract profit? The concentration of power? Do the
latter two pretty much amount to the first?
Intelligence laundering is a serious issue, of course, but running a clean
organization would make the laundering exceedingly hard.
They're each large organizations with no bottom line that attract people of
I'm in Korea, I talked to a bunch of US soldiers stationed here. They're
exceedingly good-hearted, well-intentioned, high-spirited guys. Many love
their work, the tension, the seriousness and hone their performance for
sport and need. The balance between trigger-happy and accident-adverse is
delicate and they seem extensively coached to preserve the balance properly.
I've talked to some that like their state, but hate the FED. I've talked to
some that think the US is bad but it's enemies are worse. I've talked to
some that have doubts about parts of the US, about corruption, but believe
in democracy such that they believe the US is a fundamental force of good.
The lesson is: very moral people still do very immoral things for many,
sometimes excellent, reasons.
I think there's not much difference between organisations. Make sure
people's motivations are sincere and that they put in the effort. There's
apparently a serious issue with "human resource rot" where worse people get
brought into orgs or people get unfocused or demotivated. Without a bottom
line there's less penalty for it. Doesn't mean it will happen. Snowden sure
shows a certain amount of rot in NSA_Public. The recent Trident leak shows
that the UK's nuclear deterrent program is rotten to a ridiculous point,
but seems to indicate the US does much better.
Who knows! ;)

2015-07-15 2:20 GMT+09:00 Kurt Buff :
"All browsers suck"?.. They run HTML pretty darn well. I'd say HTML is a
document language, not an application language, and now it's trying to be
both and it's a pretty psychotic fit. But it still works pretty darn much
better than anything else out there. I'd like there to be an "all settled
standards compliant fast and secure browser", but the secure is usually
omitted (and there's a rush to support the not-quite-settled standards).
Not much wrong with JavaScript, but I hope they'll soon support several
other languages too. Like perhaps LLVM's intermediary format - so we can
compile whatever into a near-metal language that will run really fast. (and
saving a lot of people the effort of writing/maintaining to-js compilers)
But the cloud is a better computational platform because of:
 * Economies of scale for computer electronics, power, network connections
 * Time sharing on the cloud's hardware
 * Sometimes architecture advantages
But, pushing back, there's:
 * Latency/bandwidth to user
 * Loss of end user's control over essential hardware
 * Massive trust and security issues
We're looking at the following:
- micropower devices; IoT and thinner smartphones (less power usage as
batteries do not seem to develop fast), home automation panels, extra
body-mounted-displays, in-car panels, home-appliance panels (refrigerator
to mixer), televisions, alarm clocks, some tablets and laptops
anything with power or financial constraints. These machines are that which
the user interacts with. Their entire design gives way to human preference
and comfort. They do not compute much, and might contain nothing but a
video-stream-decoder and a "window manager" that decodes simple graphics
statements (hopefully simpler than HTML).
- computers; workstations, desktop pc's, laptops, stand-alone "videocards"
with generic computing support, servers, gaming-appliances
fast computers that are positioned somewhere in the house. Low latency to
the user and with very good price/performance relationships (desktops now
are miracles). Given the single-core-ceiling these machines will typically
fare better than ideal cloud setups for many applications. They can be
rented out to remote users dynamically.
- remote processing; the cloud, the neighbors' computers, etc
time-shared computing that is not in-house. Typically high latency,
extremely high maximum power and lowest cost. Latency constraints force it
to be used only for very expensive operations - such as rendering tasks and
machine learning (for business intelligence or otherwise). If the
set-up-time for such an operation is 2000ms many tasks are still better ran
locally - the application-support-system (OS?) will have to make choices
about this rather fast.
What I've described above is a sort of multi-tier architecture. At the
moment remote or local computing is a wild west with exclusively homebrewed
solutions. At some point we will integrate all our devices, and software's
locality will be managed better as well. Encryption will be applied
automatically at the appropriate places. I think the largest desired
capability is the inaptly named "homomorphic encryption", which should be
optimized and packaged such that heavy processing can be remotely executed
in a safe and trustless manner.
What is to be done? Well, I hope we can avoid the situation where we run
the browsers and they run the software. We're going there now because the
architecture I mentioned does not exist - and because it's a simpler model.
A business could be made out of making hardware that follows the above
model, that would probably be the best way to make it happen. Elsewise
we're all along for the ride that the unknowing public is buying us into.

Parallel construction and intelligence laundering take care of this in case
they want to abuse your data. Big Data is never very much of a privacy
issue, but when they silently use that Big Data for their (or their
companies') profit, well, without competition you'll lose. And then there's
straight business-secret-stealing, which they also do, and which is very
hard to ever find out about (parallel construction is also possible here).
So, yeah, they'll protect their billions in income and valuation. And
they'll use all the intelligence the US can bring to the table to do it.

proposal ("or anything" probably mostly to make 20mb seem reasonable). They
stamped - a thing completely outdated in the West, yet common in Asia (and
pretty badass). They are a group of Chinese making law for everyone.
 Gavin appeased them and provided for
unattended growth with a period 8mb increase. Smart move.
So - conclusively - Gavin is a hero, the Internet's retarded, Bitcoin is in
policy jail but it likes it there. Oh, and the free-est market of the world
is already significantly run by Chinese. If you read this far, thanks.

your lawyer costs more than the whole blockchain, including operational
costs, for a long time. If you'd like to do anything with a bank, for a
fraction of the features at IMMENSELY OVERSIZED WTF prices - just the time
spent negotiating it is outrageously more expensive. We're nowhere near
unacceptable, and it doesn't seem we will ever be. It's something to think

some value to not having to use them. That's definitely not convenient, but

There's absolutely no reason to think the NSA doesn't have a
layered/multi-cell operation wherein a mere contractor is not given access
to nation-essential secrets. If there's a foreign spy you want him to
penetrate what seems like a complete organisation. Why not give them what
they want? There's lots of "more secure than FBI/CIA, less secure than 'we
broke enigma' " work to be done, just put it in the public-facing
independently operating organisation.
Would you publish "we broke enigma" in a memo to the intranet? NSA didn't.
NSA wouldn't get worse at what they do.
The real headbreaker is when this is a problem. It's basically not a
problem until you're a threat to the absolute fundamentals of what the NSA
is designed to protect. And what's that? Is it personal freedom, the
advancement of the human race, and the minimization of suffering? Is it the
maximization of some abstract profit? The concentration of power? Do the
latter two pretty much amount to the first?
Intelligence laundering is a serious issue, of course, but running a clean
organization would make the laundering exceedingly hard.
They're each large organizations with no bottom line that attract people of
I'm in Korea, I talked to a bunch of US soldiers stationed here. They're
exceedingly good-hearted, well-intentioned, high-spirited guys. Many love
their work, the tension, the seriousness and hone their performance for
sport and need. The balance between trigger-happy and accident-adverse is
delicate and they seem extensively coached to preserve the balance properly.
I've talked to some that like their state, but hate the FED. I've talked to
some that think the US is bad but it's enemies are worse. I've talked to
some that have doubts about parts of the US, about corruption, but believe
in democracy such that they believe the US is a fundamental force of good.
The lesson is: very moral people still do very immoral things for many,
sometimes excellent, reasons.
I think there's not much difference between organisations. Make sure
people's motivations are sincere and that they put in the effort. There's
apparently a serious issue with "human resource rot" where worse people get
brought into orgs or people get unfocused or demotivated. Without a bottom
line there's less penalty for it. Doesn't mean it will happen. Snowden sure
shows a certain amount of rot in NSA_Public. The recent Trident leak shows
that the UK's nuclear deterrent program is rotten to a ridiculous point,
but seems to indicate the US does much better.

2015-07-15 2:20 GMT+09:00 Kurt Buff :
"All browsers suck"?.. They run HTML pretty darn well. I'd say HTML is a
document language, not an application language, and now it's trying to be
both and it's a pretty psychotic fit. But it still works pretty darn much
better than anything else out there. I'd like there to be an "all settled
standards compliant fast and secure browser", but the secure is usually
omitted (and there's a rush to support the not-quite-settled standards).
Not much wrong with JavaScript, but I hope they'll soon support several
other languages too. Like perhaps LLVM's intermediary format - so we can
compile whatever into a near-metal language that will run really fast. (and
saving a lot of people the effort of writing/maintaining to-js compilers)
But the cloud is a better computational platform because of:
 * Economies of scale for computer electronics, power, network connections
 * Time sharing on the cloud's hardware
 * Sometimes architecture advantages
But, pushing back, there's:
 * Latency/bandwidth to user
 * Loss of end user's control over essential hardware
 * Massive trust and security issues
We're looking at the following:
- micropower devices; IoT and thinner smartphones (less power usage as
batteries do not seem to develop fast), home automation panels, extra
body-mounted-displays, in-car panels, home-appliance panels (refrigerator
to mixer), televisions, alarm clocks, some tablets and laptops
anything with power or financial constraints. These machines are that which
the user interacts with. Their entire design gives way to human preference
and comfort. They do not compute much, and might contain nothing but a
video-stream-decoder and a "window manager" that decodes simple graphics
statements (hopefully simpler than HTML).
- computers; workstations, desktop pc's, laptops, stand-alone "videocards"
with generic computing support, servers, gaming-appliances
fast computers that are positioned somewhere in the house. Low latency to
the user and with very good price/performance relationships (desktops now
are miracles). Given the single-core-ceiling these machines will typically
fare better than ideal cloud setups for many applications. They can be
rented out to remote users dynamically.
- remote processing; the cloud, the neighbors' computers, etc
time-shared computing that is not in-house. Typically high latency,
extremely high maximum power and lowest cost. Latency constraints force it
to be used only for very expensive operations - such as rendering tasks and
machine learning (for business intelligence or otherwise). If the
set-up-time for such an operation is 2000ms many tasks are still better ran
locally - the application-support-system (OS?) will have to make choices
about this rather fast.
What I've described above is a sort of multi-tier architecture. At the
moment remote or local computing is a wild west with exclusively homebrewed
solutions. At some point we will integrate all our devices, and software's
locality will be managed better as well. Encryption will be applied
automatically at the appropriate places. I think the largest desired
capability is the inaptly named "homomorphic encryption", which should be
optimized and packaged such that heavy processing can be remotely executed
in a safe and trustless manner.
What is to be done? Well, I hope we can avoid the situation where we run
the browsers and they run the software. We're going there now because the
architecture I mentioned does not exist - and because it's a simpler model.
A business could be made out of making hardware that follows the above
model, that would probably be the best way to make it happen. Elsewise
we're all along for the ride that the unknowing public is buying us into.

Parallel construction and intelligence laundering take care of this in case
they want to abuse your data. Big Data is never very much of a privacy
issue, but when they silently use that Big Data for their (or their
companies') profit, well, without competition you'll lose. And then there's
straight business-secret-stealing, which they also do, and which is very
hard to ever find out about (parallel construction is also possible here).
So, yeah, they'll protect their billions in income and valuation. And
they'll use all the intelligence the US can bring to the table to do it.

Anyone care for a law that will:
1. Ban unhackable vehicles and other life-critical devices (meaning:
life-critical software must be rewritable)
2. Require all life-critical software to be released in source format, for
the purpose of public auditing, improving it's safety features and
employing the software on the devices it is intended for.
3. Any tools used to translate the source to writable code must also be
provided in the manner of 2.
These laws should still allow manufacturers to:
1. Spy on their users without that being changed
2. Lock down their code so competitors may not use it (proprietary open
3. Have software in the machines that is not opened; so long as it is
properly (verifiably) isolated from essential systems
4. Legally own the entire machine
5. Drop guarantees when non-security-related modifications have been made
This law should be as precise and immutable as possible. This is not a
matter of "I want to hack things" or "competition would be better if it
were open" or "I want to own what I have/use", etc, etc. Being precise with
the law allows it to pass more readily.
Personally I think if everything were required open source and
self-compiled; that would objectively be better for humanity as a whole.
For protecting innovation there's patents, closing the source is excess.
Etc. etc.
But this is not about fun. This is about extremely basic safety. It is
about national security; if 500,000 cars go haywire at the same time a lot
of deaths, directly and indirectly, can be expected. And it's not just the
cars; it's also the industrial machines, medical equipment, the metro's and
trains, the automated cars and busses and trucks and aircraft, medium sized
hobbyist drones, heaters, stoves and ovens, automated doors, elevators,
fire, smoke and other emergency alarms, etc.
Should a foreign country cyberattack whilst doing any other kind of large
scale attack; the effects could be devastating. Should a person be marked
for assassination, no one would be the wiser.
I'd argue for similar protection for fridges, televisions, smartphones,
etc, etc, as more and more items are expected to become networked and
essential for upholding basic freedoms and ways of life. And I'd argue to
have it for privacy; not just essential safety.
Simply put; the simple version of the law above is imperative for personal
and national security. And it doesn't exist.
(note: all countries should be more worried about cybersecurity. I cannot
trust my government to act as it should if every public servant can be
blackmailed or thoroughly spied upon. It's not hard to improve security;
but it's much harder now that nobody's doing it, and now that it's given no

Why should a heart implant be different than a car? Because there's experts
involved? There's always experts involved! Because it's so life critical?
It's always "so life critical"!
Legally difficult is the differences between "owner" and "user". I think
whomever actually uses the device should be the one to be able to hack it.
That includes leases, rents, corporate ownership, and everything else. "I
drive it, I decide the software it runs". This follows from the idea that
"the software's choices are my choices" - in case of such direct life
affectors that choice should never be taken away.
It's funny; I think this evolved into an equivalent of the "forced
inoculation" argument... There's some point to be made for experts truly
knowing better, and nobody having any reason to go against the experts'
opinions. I think that, in that case, any rational person should be able to
reach that same conclusion. If they don't, well, that's a more general
problem to be approached separately.

I went on this trip to the South of South Korea. It was organized by some
enthusiasts/travelers that regularly organize stuff. I thought at first
they were a semi-company (unregistered doing travelling agency like
activities) that don't pay tax and make a little buck while travelling,
especially as they mentioned no insurance and also carried a brandname and
logo, and had very regular activities. Operating through meetup.com,
though, always skirts the fine line between professional and amateur.
Certainly, though, the notion that they might make a profit even with cheap
tours (hint: no taxes) or that acting like a company kind of makes you into
one, was certainly lost on them.
The trip I went on was half paid for by the Boseong government. Given that
county was far away from anything touristic and, well, there was probably
hardly anything there, I thought they were just getting some
try-out-and-spread-the-word tourists. This was definitely true, the housing
was brand new (and empty). They managed to herd us into a
"Boseong-Kazagstan sister city project" presentation televised in
Kazakhstan (note: countries can be cities).
During the main activity a photographer's event was coincidentally planned.
Naturally, I was very unhappy about all this. Confronting others I found
that none of the 80 other participants shared my feelings to any extend.
Notably, most considered that they should do something back for the Boseong
government, for having paid half their trip, and so this was all fine. They
also gave enormous leeway for the volunteers that happily organized this
tour, and simply didn't see the harm of being taken pictures of (for
whatever purpose). (I got a horde of childish remarks, apparently most 20
somethings abroad are still living their highschool dreams)
The age of privacy, and everything with it, including the freedom of
association and separation of public and private life, is ending. The
public is smiling merrily along the road. 1984 is coming, but the public is
not scared or suppressed. They are smiling happy people, obedient and
cheerful, and they take the best of care of their keepers.
This is neither a hyperbole, not that much of a doomsday scenario. It is
simply inevitable and true. The cost of surveillance is decreasing, the
abuse of surveillance is mild or absent - and has passed from the people's
minds. People are not concerned with the eventual consequences of tracking
all their activities, they are concerned with having more fun.

trained to perform some arbitrary tests, one of which involved repeating

hang out near sensitive person areas - if the sensitive person area's are

have no control. There's no way to distinguish a local influential sneaky

nothing is permitted.

I went on this trip to the South of South Korea. It was organized by some
enthusiasts/travelers that regularly organize stuff. I thought at first
they were a semi-company (unregistered doing travelling agency like
activities) that don't pay tax and make a little buck while travelling,
especially as they mentioned no insurance and also carried a brandname and
logo, and had very regular activities. Operating through meetup.com,
though, always skirts the fine line between professional and amateur.
Certainly, though, the notion that they might make a profit even with cheap
tours (hint: no taxes) or that acting like a company kind of makes you into
one, was certainly lost on them.
The trip I went on was half paid for by the Boseong government. Given that
county was far away from anything touristic and, well, there was probably
hardly anything there, I thought they were just getting some
try-out-and-spread-the-word tourists. This was definitely true, the housing
was brand new (and empty). They managed to herd us into a
"Boseong-Kazagstan sister city project" presentation televised in
Kazakhstan (note: countries can be cities).
During the main activity a photographer's event was coincidentally planned.
Naturally, I was very unhappy about all this. Confronting others I found
that none of the 80 other participants shared my feelings to any extend.
Notably, most considered that they should do something back for the Boseong
government, for having paid half their trip, and so this was all fine. They
also gave enormous leeway for the volunteers that happily organized this
tour, and simply didn't see the harm of being taken pictures of (for
whatever purpose). (I got a horde of childish remarks, apparently most 20
somethings abroad are still living their highschool dreams)
The age of privacy, and everything with it, including the freedom of
association and separation of public and private life, is ending. The
public is smiling merrily along the road. 1984 is coming, but the public is
not scared or suppressed. They are smiling happy people, obedient and
cheerful, and they take the best of care of their keepers.
This is neither a hyperbole, not that much of a doomsday scenario. It is
simply inevitable and true. The cost of surveillance is decreasing, the
abuse of surveillance is mild or absent - and has passed from the people's
minds. People are not concerned with the eventual consequences of tracking
all their activities, they are concerned with having more fun.

Guys, chill.
Most religious people are only mildly so, adhering only in the vaguest
sense to their religions. If they do not adhere to religion their ideas are
about as inaccurate and dangerous, but they are less synchronized.
Many people utilize faith for productivity or resolution to the existential
crisis. Without their faith they would be worse people.
I think it would be better to write a bible-for-atheists, with guidance for
living in the modern world. This new scripture should motivate critical
thinking, max(independence + transparancy), productivity (meaning,
advancement of the race or a derivative race/structure) and satisfaction.
Some understanding of the implications of evolutionary effects (selection,
and how it reflects on the currently existing), mathematics, and the nature
of energy and the universe (including entropy) must be included for a
complete and worthwhile picture. Spirituality must be explained as a
function of the brain, mythical events through statistics and human
capacity ("No gods but man").
Simply because we're crazed monkeys and desperately require (very)
approximate models in order to function. And simply because our emotions
run amok of us more often than not.
Until we have this well-reasoned word-of-sanity, the bible (or the
apparently more recent Koran) might be a better alternative to madness. A
simple way to soothe troubled souls. Through the evolution applied before
it's popularity, hard to disprove, infectious and attractive. The dark
question you might be asking yourself is, where and with whom does that
leave me?
I'm very deeply concerned about religion influencing law. This has happened
forever, and will happen for the foreseeable future. Another demon for
democracy, which leaves the innocent and well-intentioned, but ultimately
foolish mass in charge. Or.. doesn't it :) ? (hint: chill)

Not sure why the response to cop-killing is so hefty, isn't it fairly
common in the US? Isn't it to be expected sometimes? It's a bit wild west,
but that's nothing new in America.
Further I do not see any problems solved by privatizing violence (or,
actually, policing). If you'd like policing to change, use the democratic
means to do so. If you don't like the democratic means, fix that. It's
vital. If you're a libertarian you're usually still democratic of sorts.

The how is slightly easier to answer, it is just a how-to-get-there. The
where to go is the real issue.
Is this the problem? Human collective madness seems to have fostered first
kings and such royalty, whom then managed things as they did. Now we live
in a more Roman-like empire, where populism rules because the crowd does. I
suspect intentional market-expansion tactics found a happy marriage with
"American Imperialism" in providing a certain brand of democracy around the
world. It's not even obvious if that's good or bad. It sure has a certain
efficiency to it. And with the expert management of the superwealthy we're
practically guaranteed of capitalistic democracy's success.
I simply do not know what's best. So I tried to avoid the discussion for
the nonce. I am certain that a world in which people's lives are
continuously on the line is not one I'd like to live in. Less violence is
more efficient, too, as less is materially lost in conflict. The police are
not brainy philosophy types, so long as they do what they're supposed to
(represent the law, that is) you should not blame them at all. Better to be
systematic about solving issues.
Petty crime and petty policing is a mayor grievance. Why have the petty
laws? If it's hidden taxation, maybe it's just better that way. Why else is
it done? Don't hate the player, hate the game. Current politics puts the
masses in charge. They chose them that chose these laws.
There is. The answer changes depending on what you care about, but there is.
The democracy discussion is an exceedingly uncomfortable one. The largest
problem is pragmatism. Reality is cruel, yet I'd like not to be. A simple
example is having longer or shorter working days. Longer working days
(might, it's just an example) make a more productive society, yet it is not
something I'd necessarily want.
Reality is also intricate in it's interconnections, and amazing in it's
diversity. It is exceedingly hard to talk about. I suspect we'll continue
muddling in murky waters until we find a way to collaboratively apply
something like First Order Formal Logic. A sort of Wikipedia, but it would
be an encyclopedia of arguments. Enter your axiom's and get your logical
conclusions. Unfortunately, ArgueOnlineTM is a project I'd rather watch
than start.
Seems much like I just need to troll harder... I don't see much in terms of
discussion solutions at all.
I've been thinking frequently about map-reduce politics. I feel like a lot
of trouble comes from a lack of involvement in politics, partly due to
corruption and whatnot making involvement mostly a pesky annoyance. And
partly because people don't know how to be involved, can't be bothered to
spend the time to learn, and well, because it doesn't matter anyway.
Individual opinions are irrelevant, unless you're elected, in which case it
matters quite much quite suddenly.
So, what we do:
Starting with a population we convene in groups of 20. These groups elect a
single person to represent them (not to rule them, but to represent). They
can do so with a 16/20 agreement, if they fail to achieve that agreement
they will not be represented. The grouping method should be geographic by
default, but allow people to form groups at will. A variation with
randomized groups provides weaker convergence as geography correlates with
cultural norms, and does not provide greater safety per se.
This first level electorate (1 person out of every 20) will also form into
groups of 20, and again elect a single person. This causes a tree like
structure, leading up to a top level of less than 20 people which will not
select an elected (there is no president of the world).
It scales decently
^1 20 (very small school class)
^2 400 (a moderate/small school)
^3 8,000
^4 160,000 (two very large football stadiums (like Real Madrid's)
^5 3,200,000 (~population of Kuwait/Uruguay/Lithuania)
^6 64,000,000 (~population of the UK/Thailand)
^7 1,280,000,000 (~population of India/China)
^8 25,600,000,000 (about 4 times humanity, top council will be 6 people)
(group size rationale, skip if you don't care) I chose 20 because larger
groups are favorable, to cause lower levels to have a higher degree of
professionalism. Additionally 20 * 7 (=140) is still an almost
first-name-possible group size. I also think 8 layers seems like a good
quantity. Reducing the group size to 10 causes there to be 10 levels, with
the highest being 7/10 filled. There's some chance there'll exist an 11th
level in the not-too-distant future, the 20 groupings are expected to be
stable even with "optimistic" population growth estimates. Importantly, I
think 20 provides a good balance of being able to get to know people, yet
not uncomfortably personally. Culture and other factors may make tweaking
of group sizes favorable. Especially in remote regions it may be
hardly/unfeasible to group into neat groups. This effect is noncritical.
Every level is allowed to make law for the levels below it. The extend of
permissible law is limited by higher level law.  In accordance with the
laws the levels may levy taxes and manage budgets. If law permits they may
contract natural/legal persons to perform tasks, even legal persons of
their own making.
Somewhat interesting to note is that this is not at all a peaceful setup.
Every representative will continue to fight for it's group's unfair
advantage. I would hope the highest level will create a legal person that
is exclusively granted military rights, with elaborate safeguards, so as to
enforce a demilitarized planet (let's at least get that out of the way as
best we can..). Similarly I imagine multiple levels of courts. I wish for
free migration, because we are all human and our place of birth was not a
choice, but who am I?
After all it will be an exceedingly fair struggle. A very pure form of
democracy, with exceptional clarity of authority and robustness in growth.
It would fail only because of the people. But to my sorrow, it just might.

Cool! I like the cipher-cascade :)
Regarding the FS: if Keccak loses some entropy in it's hashing, the entropy
in the key used would slowly degrade. Certainly Keccak doesn't preserve all
entropy, but it probably doesn't leak it fast enough to matter. You could
probably add some new entropy from the random generators. To prevent
padding, you could replace, say, merely the last bit as Keccak doesn't
(seem to) lose a bit of entropy per cycle. Could someone more knowledgeable
comment on this issue? It's probably inconsequential so long as Keccak is
what it seems, but it's much weaker-looking than the cipher-cascade.
I'm also impressed by the idea of data diodes. At first I thought they were

Write a "microservice" that fronts two other processes, with separated user
accounts, and allows only data in or data out. Formally prove the fronting
microservice (it's small enough) and any error in your own code becomes far
less harmful (side channels are still there; cache- ,DOS, timing-attacks,

When you look upon a person their wealth is not apparent in any way. Some
people have serious skills, but no currency. Some people have currency but
no serious skills. Some people fit a norm and some don't. Capacity to earn
currency is the great selector, but in an economic reality detached from
reality by countless systems and arbitrary human judgement, the selector is
detached and arbitrary too.
It is well imaginable that ownership and currency are ineffective; but it
is so ingrained in society that we never consider it anymore.

Guys, chill.
Most religious people are only mildly so, adhering only in the vaguest
sense to their religions. If they do not adhere to religion their ideas are
about as inaccurate and dangerous, but they are less synchronized.
Many people utilize faith for productivity or resolution to the existential
crisis. Without their faith they would be worse people.
I think it would be better to write a bible-for-atheists, with guidance for
living in the modern world. This new scripture should motivate critical
thinking, max(independence + transparancy), productivity (meaning,
advancement of the race or a derivative race/structure) and satisfaction.
Some understanding of the implications of evolutionary effects (selection,
and how it reflects on the currently existing), mathematics, and the nature
of energy and the universe (including entropy) must be included for a
complete and worthwhile picture. Spirituality must be explained as a
function of the brain, mythical events through statistics and human
capacity ("No gods but man").
Simply because we're crazed monkeys and desperately require (very)
approximate models in order to function. And simply because our emotions
run amok of us more often than not.
Until we have this well-reasoned word-of-sanity, the bible (or the
apparently more recent Koran) might be a better alternative to madness. A
simple way to soothe troubled souls. Through the evolution applied before
it's popularity, hard to disprove, infectious and attractive. The dark
question you might be asking yourself is, where and with whom does that
leave me?
I'm very deeply concerned about religion influencing law. This has happened
forever, and will happen for the foreseeable future. Another demon for
democracy, which leaves the innocent and well-intentioned, but ultimately
foolish mass in charge. Or.. doesn't it :) ? (hint: chill)

Is there something you guys are going for?
Two cops got shot, the executive arm of the government has significant
issues as a result. No other conclusions can be made.
Not sure why the response to cop-killing is so hefty, isn't it fairly
common in the US? Isn't it to be expected sometimes? It's a bit wild west,
but that's nothing new in America.
Further I do not see any problems solved by privatizing violence (or,
actually, policing). If you'd like policing to change, use the democratic
means to do so. If you don't like the democratic means, fix that. It's
vital. If you're a libertarian you're usually still democratic of sorts.

The how is slightly easier to answer, it is just a how-to-get-there. The
where to go is the real issue.
Is this the problem? Human collective madness seems to have fostered first
kings and such royalty, whom then managed things as they did. Now we live
in a more Roman-like empire, where populism rules because the crowd does. I
suspect intentional market-expansion tactics found a happy marriage with
"American Imperialism" in providing a certain brand of democracy around the
world. It's not even obvious if that's good or bad. It sure has a certain
efficiency to it. And with the expert management of the superwealthy we're
practically guaranteed of capitalistic democracy's success.
I simply do not know what's best. So I tried to avoid the discussion for
the nonce. I am certain that a world in which people's lives are
continuously on the line is not one I'd like to live in. Less violence is
more efficient, too, as less is materially lost in conflict. The police are
not brainy philosophy types, so long as they do what they're supposed to
(represent the law, that is) you should not blame them at all. Better to be
systematic about solving issues.
Petty crime and petty policing is a mayor grievance. Why have the petty
laws? If it's hidden taxation, maybe it's just better that way. Why else is
it done? Don't hate the player, hate the game. Current politics puts the
masses in charge. They chose them that chose these laws.
There is. The answer changes depending on what you care about, but there is.
The democracy discussion is an exceedingly uncomfortable one. The largest
problem is pragmatism. Reality is cruel, yet I'd like not to be. A simple
example is having longer or shorter working days. Longer working days
(might, it's just an example) make a more productive society, yet it is not
something I'd necessarily want.
Reality is also intricate in it's interconnections, and amazing in it's
diversity. It is exceedingly hard to talk about. I suspect we'll continue
muddling in murky waters until we find a way to collaboratively apply
something like First Order Formal Logic. A sort of Wikipedia, but it would
be an encyclopedia of arguments. Enter your axiom's and get your logical
conclusions. Unfortunately, ArgueOnlineTM is a project I'd rather watch
than start.
Seems much like I just need to troll harder... I don't see much in terms of
discussion solutions at all.
I've been thinking frequently about map-reduce politics. I feel like a lot
of trouble comes from a lack of involvement in politics, partly due to
corruption and whatnot making involvement mostly a pesky annoyance. And
partly because people don't know how to be involved, can't be bothered to
spend the time to learn, and well, because it doesn't matter anyway.
Individual opinions are irrelevant, unless you're elected, in which case it
matters quite much quite suddenly.
So, what we do:
Starting with a population we convene in groups of 20. These groups elect a
single person to represent them (not to rule them, but to represent). They
can do so with a 16/20 agreement, if they fail to achieve that agreement
they will not be represented. The grouping method should be geographic by
default, but allow people to form groups at will. A variation with
randomized groups provides weaker convergence as geography correlates with
cultural norms, and does not provide greater safety per se.
This first level electorate (1 person out of every 20) will also form into
groups of 20, and again elect a single person. This causes a tree like
structure, leading up to a top level of less than 20 people which will not
select an elected (there is no president of the world).
It scales decently
^1 20 (very small school class)
^2 400 (a moderate/small school)
^3 8,000
^4 160,000 (two very large football stadiums (like Real Madrid's)
^5 3,200,000 (~population of Kuwait/Uruguay/Lithuania)
^6 64,000,000 (~population of the UK/Thailand)
^7 1,280,000,000 (~population of India/China)
^8 25,600,000,000 (about 4 times humanity, top council will be 6 people)
(group size rationale, skip if you don't care) I chose 20 because larger
groups are favorable, to cause lower levels to have a higher degree of
professionalism. Additionally 20 * 7 (=140) is still an almost
first-name-possible group size. I also think 8 layers seems like a good
quantity. Reducing the group size to 10 causes there to be 10 levels, with
the highest being 7/10 filled. There's some chance there'll exist an 11th
level in the not-too-distant future, the 20 groupings are expected to be
stable even with "optimistic" population growth estimates. Importantly, I
think 20 provides a good balance of being able to get to know people, yet
not uncomfortably personally. Culture and other factors may make tweaking
of group sizes favorable. Especially in remote regions it may be
hardly/unfeasible to group into neat groups. This effect is noncritical.
Every level is allowed to make law for the levels below it. The extend of
permissible law is limited by higher level law.  In accordance with the
laws the levels may levy taxes and manage budgets. If law permits they may
contract natural/legal persons to perform tasks, even legal persons of
their own making.
Somewhat interesting to note is that this is not at all a peaceful setup.
Every representative will continue to fight for it's group's unfair
advantage. I would hope the highest level will create a legal person that
is exclusively granted military rights, with elaborate safeguards, so as to
enforce a demilitarized planet (let's at least get that out of the way as
best we can..). Similarly I imagine multiple levels of courts. I wish for
free migration, because we are all human and our place of birth was not a
choice, but who am I?
After all it will be an exceedingly fair struggle. A very pure form of
democracy, with exceptional clarity of authority and robustness in growth.
It would fail only because of the people. But to my sorrow, it just might.

Guys, chill.
Most religious people are only mildly so, adhering only in the vaguest
sense to their religions. If they do not adhere to religion their ideas are
about as inaccurate and dangerous, but they are less synchronized.
Many people utilize faith for productivity or resolution to the existential
crisis. Without their faith they would be worse people.
I think it would be better to write a bible-for-atheists, with guidance for
living in the modern world. This new scripture should motivate critical
thinking, max(independence + transparancy), productivity (meaning,
advancement of the race or a derivative race/structure) and satisfaction.
Some understanding of the implications of evolutionary effects (selection,
and how it reflects on the currently existing), mathematics, and the nature
of energy and the universe (including entropy) must be included for a
complete and worthwhile picture. Spirituality must be explained as a
function of the brain, mythical events through statistics and human
capacity ("No gods but man").
Simply because we're crazed monkeys and desperately require (very)
approximate models in order to function. And simply because our emotions
run amok of us more often than not.
Until we have this well-reasoned word-of-sanity, the bible (or the
apparently more recent Koran) might be a better alternative to madness. A
simple way to soothe troubled souls. Through the evolution applied before
it's popularity, hard to disprove, infectious and attractive. The dark
question you might be asking yourself is, where and with whom does that
leave me?
I'm very deeply concerned about religion influencing law. This has happened
forever, and will happen for the foreseeable future. Another demon for
democracy, which leaves the innocent and well-intentioned, but ultimately
foolish mass in charge. Or.. doesn't it :) ? (hint: chill)

Two cops got shot, the executive arm of the government has significant
issues as a result. No other conclusions can be made.
Not sure why the response to cop-killing is so hefty, isn't it fairly
common in the US? Isn't it to be expected sometimes? It's a bit wild west,
but that's nothing new in America.
Further I do not see any problems solved by privatizing violence (or,
actually, policing). If you'd like policing to change, use the democratic
means to do so. If you don't like the democratic means, fix that. It's
vital. If you're a libertarian you're usually still democratic of sorts.

The how is slightly easier to answer, it is just a how-to-get-there. The
where to go is the real issue.
Is this the problem? Human collective madness seems to have fostered first
kings and such royalty, whom then managed things as they did. Now we live
in a more Roman-like empire, where populism rules because the crowd does. I
suspect intentional market-expansion tactics found a happy marriage with
"American Imperialism" in providing a certain brand of democracy around the
world. It's not even obvious if that's good or bad. It sure has a certain
efficiency to it. And with the expert management of the superwealthy we're
practically guaranteed of capitalistic democracy's success.
I simply do not know what's best. So I tried to avoid the discussion for
the nonce. I am certain that a world in which people's lives are
continuously on the line is not one I'd like to live in. Less violence is
more efficient, too, as less is materially lost in conflict. The police are
not brainy philosophy types, so long as they do what they're supposed to
(represent the law, that is) you should not blame them at all. Better to be
systematic about solving issues.
Petty crime and petty policing is a mayor grievance. Why have the petty
laws? If it's hidden taxation, maybe it's just better that way. Why else is
it done? Don't hate the player, hate the game. Current politics puts the
masses in charge. They chose them that chose these laws.
There is. The answer changes depending on what you care about, but there is.
The democracy discussion is an exceedingly uncomfortable one. The largest
problem is pragmatism. Reality is cruel, yet I'd like not to be. A simple
example is having longer or shorter working days. Longer working days
(might, it's just an example) make a more productive society, yet it is not
something I'd necessarily want.
Reality is also intricate in it's interconnections, and amazing in it's
diversity. It is exceedingly hard to talk about. I suspect we'll continue
muddling in murky waters until we find a way to collaboratively apply
something like First Order Formal Logic. A sort of Wikipedia, but it would
be an encyclopedia of arguments. Enter your axiom's and get your logical
conclusions. Unfortunately, ArgueOnlineTM is a project I'd rather watch
than start.
Seems much like I just need to troll harder... I don't see much in terms of
discussion solutions at all.
I've been thinking frequently about map-reduce politics. I feel like a lot
of trouble comes from a lack of involvement in politics, partly due to
corruption and whatnot making involvement mostly a pesky annoyance. And
partly because people don't know how to be involved, can't be bothered to
spend the time to learn, and well, because it doesn't matter anyway.
Individual opinions are irrelevant, unless you're elected, in which case it
matters quite much quite suddenly.
So, what we do:
Starting with a population we convene in groups of 20. These groups elect a
single person to represent them (not to rule them, but to represent). They
can do so with a 16/20 agreement, if they fail to achieve that agreement
they will not be represented. The grouping method should be geographic by
default, but allow people to form groups at will. A variation with
randomized groups provides weaker convergence as geography correlates with
cultural norms, and does not provide greater safety per se.
This first level electorate (1 person out of every 20) will also form into
groups of 20, and again elect a single person. This causes a tree like
structure, leading up to a top level of less than 20 people which will not
select an elected (there is no president of the world).
It scales decently
^1 20 (very small school class)
^2 400 (a moderate/small school)
^3 8,000
^4 160,000 (two very large football stadiums (like Real Madrid's)
^5 3,200,000 (~population of Kuwait/Uruguay/Lithuania)
^6 64,000,000 (~population of the UK/Thailand)
^7 1,280,000,000 (~population of India/China)
^8 25,600,000,000 (about 4 times humanity, top council will be 6 people)
(group size rationale, skip if you don't care) I chose 20 because larger
groups are favorable, to cause lower levels to have a higher degree of
professionalism. Additionally 20 * 7 (=140) is still an almost
first-name-possible group size. I also think 8 layers seems like a good
quantity. Reducing the group size to 10 causes there to be 10 levels, with
the highest being 7/10 filled. There's some chance there'll exist an 11th
level in the not-too-distant future, the 20 groupings are expected to be
stable even with "optimistic" population growth estimates. Importantly, I
think 20 provides a good balance of being able to get to know people, yet
not uncomfortably personally. Culture and other factors may make tweaking
of group sizes favorable. Especially in remote regions it may be
hardly/unfeasible to group into neat groups. This effect is noncritical.
Every level is allowed to make law for the levels below it. The extend of
permissible law is limited by higher level law.  In accordance with the
laws the levels may levy taxes and manage budgets. If law permits they may
contract natural/legal persons to perform tasks, even legal persons of
their own making.
Somewhat interesting to note is that this is not at all a peaceful setup.
Every representative will continue to fight for it's group's unfair
advantage. I would hope the highest level will create a legal person that
is exclusively granted military rights, with elaborate safeguards, so as to
enforce a demilitarized planet (let's at least get that out of the way as
best we can..). Similarly I imagine multiple levels of courts. I wish for
free migration, because we are all human and our place of birth was not a
choice, but who am I?
After all it will be an exceedingly fair struggle. A very pure form of
democracy, with exceptional clarity of authority and robustness in growth.
It would fail only because of the people. But to my sorrow, it just might.

Cool! I like the cipher-cascade :)
Regarding the FS: if Keccak loses some entropy in it's hashing, the entropy
in the key used would slowly degrade. Certainly Keccak doesn't preserve all
entropy, but it probably doesn't leak it fast enough to matter. You could
probably add some new entropy from the random generators. To prevent
padding, you could replace, say, merely the last bit as Keccak doesn't
(seem to) lose a bit of entropy per cycle. Could someone more knowledgeable
comment on this issue? It's probably inconsequential so long as Keccak is
what it seems, but it's much weaker-looking than the cipher-cascade.
I'm also impressed by the idea of data diodes. At first I thought they were
in software, and already thought "what an effective way to limit risk!".
Write a "microservice" that fronts two other processes, with separated user
accounts, and allows only data in or data out. Formally prove the fronting
microservice (it's small enough) and any error in your own code becomes far
less harmful (side channels are still there; cache- ,DOS, timing-attacks,
etc). Doing it in hardware is even better. It's highly likely that it
works, and that's *very cool*.

Free markets, as a model, are realistic and optimizing. But the results are
not good because the agents in the system do not force it to behave well.

you're saying.
2015-10-30 22:32 GMT+01:00 Juan :
Because it helps you. Consistently applied and effective justice reduces
the crime rates. By defining crime to be behaviors that are:
* Game theory wise bad - like driving (very) fast being good for you, bad
for everyone else. Or contract enforcement - having serious enforcement
even for less valuable contracts is very hard (=expensive) to do. The edge
of acceptable is sought, and usually differs significantly per person.
(Asbestos processing company CEO saying it's a good thing workers are
unaware of the dangers, it makes for greater profit, and therefore prevents
informing the workers. Past the line? Maybe, but it was legal and didn't
cause public retaliation*)
* Fragile but preferable - no petty theft (like jackets) makes it much
easier to be in shared spaces, but any enforcement is more expensive than
the jacket stolen. It's very hard to prevent petty theft. But also
shoplifting, being honest about products (Volkswagen's lies might've forced
other manufacturers to perform fraud), etc
* Simply too unkind - fraud, murder, serious harassment (although the
border is hard to place), theft of freedom (rape is both harassment and
theft of freedom), (not all but many ways of) causing pain or injury, etc
I think it's important to create law that's conservative and very morally
and ethically neutral. For me that's the difference between being a force
for evil and a force for good.
I ran into a fascinating example yesterday, a group of women was mad a
friend for leaving without saying she would (which is a strange thing to
do, why not say bye?), and for leaving with a guy although she has a
boyfriend. I don't know her boyfriend arrangement, or how they're doing,
but seemingly that made no difference in the first place. They were forming
a loyal monogamy cartel! They did not respect their friend's ethical/moral
choice. But I can't say it was entirely unreasonable, if she claimed to be
exclusive to the guy it's probably very unkind.
To clarify; this was a case of micro-oppression. Their friends were clearly
intend on excluding her and otherwise sanctioning her for her behavior,
although her behavior was, well, her conscious choice. They could've
decided not to care about her, and they wouldn't be upset about her
leaving. But they cared and sanctioned instead. If you don't like a person
you should attempt to disconnect and isolate first, I think.
I think justice should not depend upon ethics very much at all. If it does
it should incorporate the ethics of those involved into it's judgement, but
if you do this justice will become arbitrary complex and faults are likely.
(faulty justice is severe unkindness)
* justice increases the cost of retaliation - this is one of the biggest
disadvantages. An eye for several eyes might seem pretty reasonable as for
retaliation, but we punish this severely everywhere now. (I'd prefer not
wasting an eye) (real world: you may not stop NAM - a Dutch natural gas
company - from draining so much gas beneath the earth underneath your feet
that the earth gives way and fills the void with your house, because the
gas draining is legal, because it's hard to estimate the risk of pumping
the gas, and because it's very profitable (maybe worth more than the house
It's a fucking for virginity kind of thing. And it's because our states are
so well matched - you need only be comfortably more armstrong than the
other wrestlers. (why that means you need to be able to nuke the entire
enemy a few times over, even after considering countermeasures, well, uhm,
we all make mistakes. Either that or the propaganda lies about the
countermeasures' effectiveness! So, is the USGOV incompetent or shrewd? )
True, but we have made it far easier by ways of state. Certain arrangements
are impossible without an allmighty third party. For example, you will
never expend 100 euro's to retrieve 50. So, a promise of paying 50 euro's
is not a very good promise if there's no cheaper way of enforcing that
payment. This is often possible, through reputation or the like, but not
always, and it's always difficult (=costs).
Having a third party say "I'll suffer any expense, and I sure can, to
ensure the enforcement of this promise, and will be sure punish the
violator severely", means the total enforcement cost becomes 0 - not even a
fool will challenge an adversary that truly means that.
That entity needn't be the state, but it's better the more
disproportionately powerful it is. Also because of vagueness. In "maybe
more powerful" situations a test of power is sometimes required. And if
there's more than two powerful parties they will weaken oneself with such a
test. (what doesn't kill you wounds you still)
Economies of scale is one reason. The other is singular ginormous efforts.
The pyramids are an example, but also the space race, this boat
terraforming projects, and huge softwares too. And soon astroid mining,
space solar, eradication of certain diseases, etc, etc, etc, etc
Not just commerce; CERN is awesome!
(but big is also scary)
It's tricky. I meant that, one way or another, we arrive at "political"
decisions. One could say that the parts involved in arriving at that
decision are a system. If the system sucks, we're screwed.
It's much better to have a system that generates "appropriate" choices.
Sometimes the right choice is undefined, but a choice must be made still.
For example; a carbon emission auctioning system, which is the right choice
given Capitalism, Game Theory and something bad increasing with carbon
emission, is not implementable without filling out an essential parameter,
how bad do we accept things to get?

value of cesspool + value of profit.) CNGOV decided that was a good trade,
and I (strongly) agree. The BBC
 did
not. (lake here
(game theory and fluctuating public opinion makes natural protection not a
good thing to leave to markets)
I meant, if we have a good way to generate general interest choices (or,
idk, "appropriate" interest choices) then we should use it.
I think the "special interest" should be humanity as a whole, averaged with
Through the political system. It depends on the system of course.
I think we can produce a formal logic for politics. It can model the
effects of a policy choice, and project them into a single dimension. The
single dimension is "desirability" or "euro's", it's supposed to be the
same thing anyway.
It'll be very challenging to do that formal logic properly. I don't think
it's useful in every situation. Mapping is easy for economic situations,
but very hard for emotions.
Particularly challenging would be, say, family law. When is it reasonable
to split a family? When Suffering_family < Suffering_society? Not if you
prefer to leave people alone, then it's Suffering_family + neutrality_bias
< Suffering_society. Also, both Suffering_family and Suffering_society will
be the results of combining a very large amount of factors.
One could model the amount of coercion upon an actor, how much a tax
exemption would create incentives.
I'm sorry for not having good examples. My understanding of formal logic is
not that great, and I haven't actually tried to model a government's
considerations. I think formal logic is the successor of "legalese", harder
to speak and read, but once the mapping and relating is done the reasoning
is absolute. Much easier to find mistakes, be precise, and much harder to
make mistakes regarding governance.
(note: formal logics dealing with fuzziness are even much harder to
write/read, but will be a definite must)
For the system's actors to behave as they should, as determined by the
system. In a republic a politician is intended to act in the best interest
of its supporters. Businesses can at times provide great enough incentive
to causes them to act otherwise.
Does what it says on the tin.
Freedom is not very strongly defined anyway. It means you can't be "forced"
to do something, but it's very rare for death not to be an alternative
choice. Reality narrows our choices most significantly, but through law and
enforcement we can change the "economic landscape" and cause what once was
the best choice ('deepest valley') to become only meh, or very not good
('high ridge'). I guess freedom is when you have no (clear) optimal
choices, which isn't actually preferable.
But I think we understand people so badly that it's better to make them
responsible for their own mistakes, rather than sometimes make a wrong
choice for them. As our understanding of "the human condition" grows, so
does our ability to make choices that are actually better according to
certain measures (certain measures because nihilism informs clearly that
nothing truly matters). Perhaps freedom is being allowed to choose the
Mathematically it makes sense to have competition and free markets. In
practice the actors do not obey perfectly, and cause a lot of reality.
Additionally, while a market is finding it's optimum (the best way to do a
certain thing) competition actually has significant cost. Sometimes reality
shifts faster than markets anneal, and we get stuck with a lot of
competition instead of expediting that energy to moving towards the ideal
solution. (also game theory)
There you go using criminal as if it means something :)
Uhm, the ideal criminal monopoly, to me, would be criminal enough to ensure
it's own existence, and do things I like as well. Like advancing humanity.
(competing with the aliens that might already be underway, or finding a way
for them to want to join our superior political system so we may advance
together against yet more aliens that might not exist, and then to delay
the heat death of the universe, I suppose)
Depends on what it does. It sure beats having competing governments.
Racism, inflation and excessive military power are what you get, not much
more afaik. (and replication of efforts)
Rights are defined by government, a self restraint alike "I'll never drink
again". But I don't think that's very meaningful. Rights are supposed to be
impossible to violate. If the government is incapable of violating the
right, then it's a right. But by that point it's synonymous with a
citizen's power. In practice "rights" are barriers, not absolute restraints.
Ugh, linguistics.
        You are misunderstanding what natural rights are. Natural
Natural rights are entirely different from rights. It is as you say, a plea
for encoding some specific morality into law. Claiming something is a
natural right seems to imply that it's been a right since before the
politics determined what is and isn't a right. I think it's pretty
meaningless, but I deeply empathize with the emotions involved.
I could hear myself screaming that my natural rights are being violated.
(as a futile plea after I give up hope)
I think if humans have natural rights, then why don't animals? Maybe you
think they do, maybe you think they don't. But the same goes for humans,
some people think something should be a right, some people don't. But for
justice to be applied consistently we need there to be a clearly defined
set of rules, so we should agree upon that set of rules. We're not very
good at it :(
Can't ignore a mountain's natural rights, man.
I think my understanding is still not aligned. What states pretend to get
their powers from 'natural rights'? I thought it used to be "God played
lottery and my name came up" for kings, queens and pharaohs. And at some
point that line could just be omitted because of legacy/buy-in.
I think when a (messenger of) the state comes up and goes "you better pay
your tax or I'll whip your ass" then that's, well, where they get their
power, and natural rights don't really come into the whipping.
Pretty sure it's more about whipping.
If it really was consent I could send a letter to the king informing him
I've had enough of his shit and I'll just fend for myself in the western
sahara, or on a boat or something, but I think they'll still come get me if
I break the law ((most) Dutch law applies to citizens abroad).
It's my plan for world domination. I just make a system that's so nice
everyone will come running. Probably easier than whipping everyone into
obedience. It could even be no-conflict with the governments, running two
systems in parallel until either gets attention starved.
Thanks for showing me the word mercantile. It's like a newspeak
thinkbarrier is lifted.
Ah, yes. The syntactic similarity of right and rights.

Hence I am upset with it.
What, because law is made by criminals, for criminals? idk why you don't
like law. I guess you'd rather grab a horse, a sack, and a rope, and call
that justice.
Ethical considerations like animal rights should not encode into strict
law. Same goes for drugs, sexuality, etc. Because these things are
difficult and I am not going to hurt people (punish them) for something
that might be fine, depending on how you look at it.
You know, when I answer with a joke it's probably because I couldn't bother
to bridge to your level of stupidity. Sorry for letting that out, but
compare the Wild West to the Roman Empire, compare African tribes to old
Japan. Structured violence can decrease overall violence.
If that's beyond you, well, I guess that's why 100% consent is not an
 > > As to the complex arrangements
I explained in detail why this is. If you didn't get the "costs of
enforcement" argument you're allowed to admit it. Hell, you might try
providing any argument yourself instead of responding to mine.
(to recap: if it costs 100 bucks to enforce a contract, the contract will
not at all protect any damage below 100 bucks. Without governance the cost
of strict enforcement is huge. You may also be in no position at all to
enforce a contract, like when your adversary is more powerful than you)
You're like a redneck piece of shit or something. To call CERN scammers ...
you must be seriously troubled.
And, actually, yeah, I think humanity is pretty much nothing but little pet
projects. I think bigger and cooler pet projects are practically all we can
hope for.
I know it's hard to reason with undefined variables, but the system was
instantiated as "some organization that can generate 'appropriate'
political decisions", where I marked "appropriate" such that you might
understand it is an undefined variable, that I cannot fill in just like
It's not the first time you've failed to grasp my meaning, and responded

Nah, I'm fundamental. If you think the word freedom has a good exact
meaning, well, fuck you for keeping it to yourself.
Continuing in the same vein as the CERN comment. Sad.
Well, at least I don't think I'm the source and means of justice.
Like, I dunno Juan, I'm really trying here. I thought you were about to
start explaining what you think, but here you are, spewing meaningless
offense again.
I mean, I learned some formal logic, you'd say that's a superset of basic
logic. UKGOV (through cie ) even certified me for
critical thinking which, I think, involved some logic. I mean I got a
pretty bad grade, but I think it is because I merely skimmed the book the
day before the exam and dedicated my essay to shitting on the BBC and how
they're pressured for time in a world with bad journalism and lack specific
expertise to discuss complex topics, but whatever.
Doctors say no, Juan says yes, the mystery continues...

I rather like this calmer tone. It makes it much easier to think about what
you're saying.
2015-10-30 22:32 GMT+01:00 Juan :
Because it helps you. Consistently applied and effective justice reduces
the crime rates. By defining crime to be behaviors that are:
* Game theory wise bad - like driving (very) fast being good for you, bad
for everyone else. Or contract enforcement - having serious enforcement
even for less valuable contracts is very hard (=expensive) to do. The edge
of acceptable is sought, and usually differs significantly per person.
(Asbestos processing company CEO saying it's a good thing workers are
unaware of the dangers, it makes for greater profit, and therefore prevents
informing the workers. Past the line? Maybe, but it was legal and didn't
cause public retaliation*)
* Fragile but preferable - no petty theft (like jackets) makes it much
easier to be in shared spaces, but any enforcement is more expensive than
the jacket stolen. It's very hard to prevent petty theft. But also
shoplifting, being honest about products (Volkswagen's lies might've forced
other manufacturers to perform fraud), etc
* Simply too unkind - fraud, murder, serious harassment (although the
border is hard to place), theft of freedom (rape is both harassment and
theft of freedom), (not all but many ways of) causing pain or injury, etc
I think it's important to create law that's conservative and very morally
and ethically neutral. For me that's the difference between being a force
for evil and a force for good.
I ran into a fascinating example yesterday, a group of women was mad a
friend for leaving without saying she would (which is a strange thing to
do, why not say bye?), and for leaving with a guy although she has a
boyfriend. I don't know her boyfriend arrangement, or how they're doing,
but seemingly that made no difference in the first place. They were forming
a loyal monogamy cartel! They did not respect their friend's ethical/moral
choice. But I can't say it was entirely unreasonable, if she claimed to be
exclusive to the guy it's probably very unkind.
To clarify; this was a case of micro-oppression. Their friends were clearly
intend on excluding her and otherwise sanctioning her for her behavior,
although her behavior was, well, her conscious choice. They could've
decided not to care about her, and they wouldn't be upset about her
leaving. But they cared and sanctioned instead. If you don't like a person
you should attempt to disconnect and isolate first, I think.
I think justice should not depend upon ethics very much at all. If it does
it should incorporate the ethics of those involved into it's judgement, but
if you do this justice will become arbitrary complex and faults are likely.
(faulty justice is severe unkindness)
* justice increases the cost of retaliation - this is one of the biggest
disadvantages. An eye for several eyes might seem pretty reasonable as for
retaliation, but we punish this severely everywhere now. (I'd prefer not
wasting an eye) (real world: you may not stop NAM - a Dutch natural gas
company - from draining so much gas beneath the earth underneath your feet
that the earth gives way and fills the void with your house, because the
gas draining is legal, because it's hard to estimate the risk of pumping
the gas, and because it's very profitable (maybe worth more than the house
It's a fucking for virginity kind of thing. And it's because our states are
so well matched - you need only be comfortably more armstrong than the
other wrestlers. (why that means you need to be able to nuke the entire
enemy a few times over, even after considering countermeasures, well, uhm,
we all make mistakes. Either that or the propaganda lies about the
countermeasures' effectiveness! So, is the USGOV incompetent or shrewd? )
True, but we have made it far easier by ways of state. Certain arrangements
are impossible without an allmighty third party. For example, you will
never expend 100 euro's to retrieve 50. So, a promise of paying 50 euro's
is not a very good promise if there's no cheaper way of enforcing that
payment. This is often possible, through reputation or the like, but not
always, and it's always difficult (=costs).
Having a third party say "I'll suffer any expense, and I sure can, to
ensure the enforcement of this promise, and will be sure punish the
violator severely", means the total enforcement cost becomes 0 - not even a
fool will challenge an adversary that truly means that.
That entity needn't be the state, but it's better the more
disproportionately powerful it is. Also because of vagueness. In "maybe
more powerful" situations a test of power is sometimes required. And if
there's more than two powerful parties they will weaken oneself with such a
test. (what doesn't kill you wounds you still)
Economies of scale is one reason. The other is singular ginormous efforts.
The pyramids are an example, but also the space race, this boat
terraforming projects, and huge softwares too. And soon astroid mining,
space solar, eradication of certain diseases, etc, etc, etc, etc
Not just commerce; CERN is awesome!
(but big is also scary)
It's tricky. I meant that, one way or another, we arrive at "political"
decisions. One could say that the parts involved in arriving at that
decision are a system. If the system sucks, we're screwed.
It's much better to have a system that generates "appropriate" choices.
Sometimes the right choice is undefined, but a choice must be made still.
For example; a carbon emission auctioning system, which is the right choice
given Capitalism, Game Theory and something bad increasing with carbon
emission, is not implementable without filling out an essential parameter,
how bad do we accept things to get?
Like, maybe I'm okay trading an "idyllic truly empty desert" for "cesspool
of all things poisonous" if we profit a lot from it. ( if value of desert <
value of cesspool + value of profit.) CNGOV decided that was a good trade,
and I (strongly) agree. The BBC

I think it's important to create law that's conservative and very morally
and ethically neutral. For me that's the difference between being a force
for evil and a force for good.
I ran into a fascinating example yesterday, a group of women was mad a
friend for leaving without saying she would (which is a strange thing to
do, why not say bye?), and for leaving with a guy although she has a
boyfriend. I don't know her boyfriend arrangement, or how they're doing,
but seemingly that made no difference in the first place. They were forming
a loyal monogamy cartel! They did not respect their friend's ethical/moral
choice. But I can't say it was entirely unreasonable, if she claimed to be
exclusive to the guy it's probably very unkind.
To clarify; this was a case of micro-oppression. Their friends were clearly
intend on excluding her and otherwise sanctioning her for her behavior,
although her behavior was, well, her conscious choice. They could've
decided not to care about her, and they wouldn't be upset about her
leaving. But they cared and sanctioned instead. If you don't like a person
you should attempt to disconnect and isolate first, I think.
I think justice should not depend upon ethics very much at all. If it does
it should incorporate the ethics of those involved into it's judgement, but
if you do this justice will become arbitrary complex and faults are likely.
(faulty justice is severe unkindness)
* justice increases the cost of retaliation - this is one of the biggest
disadvantages. An eye for several eyes might seem pretty reasonable as for
retaliation, but we punish this severely everywhere now. (I'd prefer not
wasting an eye) (real world: you may not stop NAM - a Dutch natural gas
company - from draining so much gas beneath the earth underneath your feet
that the earth gives way and fills the void with your house, because the
gas draining is legal, because it's hard to estimate the risk of pumping
the gas, and because it's very profitable (maybe worth more than the house
It's a fucking for virginity kind of thing. And it's because our states are
so well matched - you need only be comfortably more armstrong than the
other wrestlers. (why that means you need to be able to nuke the entire
enemy a few times over, even after considering countermeasures, well, uhm,
we all make mistakes. Either that or the propaganda lies about the
countermeasures' effectiveness! So, is the USGOV incompetent or shrewd? )
True, but we have made it far easier by ways of state. Certain arrangements
are impossible without an allmighty third party. For example, you will
never expend 100 euro's to retrieve 50. So, a promise of paying 50 euro's
is not a very good promise if there's no cheaper way of enforcing that
payment. This is often possible, through reputation or the like, but not
always, and it's always difficult (=costs).
Having a third party say "I'll suffer any expense, and I sure can, to
ensure the enforcement of this promise, and will be sure punish the
violator severely", means the total enforcement cost becomes 0 - not even a
fool will challenge an adversary that truly means that.
That entity needn't be the state, but it's better the more
disproportionately powerful it is. Also because of vagueness. In "maybe
more powerful" situations a test of power is sometimes required. And if
there's more than two powerful parties they will weaken oneself with such a
test. (what doesn't kill you wounds you still)
Economies of scale is one reason. The other is singular ginormous efforts.
The pyramids are an example, but also the space race, this boat
terraforming projects, and huge softwares too. And soon astroid mining,
space solar, eradication of certain diseases, etc, etc, etc, etc
Not just commerce; CERN is awesome!
(but big is also scary)
It's tricky. I meant that, one way or another, we arrive at "political"
decisions. One could say that the parts involved in arriving at that
decision are a system. If the system sucks, we're screwed.
It's much better to have a system that generates "appropriate" choices.
Sometimes the right choice is undefined, but a choice must be made still.
For example; a carbon emission auctioning system, which is the right choice
given Capitalism, Game Theory and something bad increasing with carbon
emission, is not implementable without filling out an essential parameter,
how bad do we accept things to get?
Like, maybe I'm okay trading an "idyllic truly empty desert" for "cesspool
of all things poisonous" if we profit a lot from it. ( if value of desert <
value of cesspool + value of profit.) CNGOV decided that was a good trade,
and I (strongly) agree. The BBC
 did
not. (lake here
(game theory and fluctuating public opinion makes natural protection not a
good thing to leave to markets)
I meant, if we have a good way to generate general interest choices (or,
idk, "appropriate" interest choices) then we should use it.
I think the "special interest" should be humanity as a whole, averaged with
Through the political system. It depends on the system of course.
I think we can produce a formal logic for politics. It can model the
effects of a policy choice, and project them into a single dimension. The
single dimension is "desirability" or "euro's", it's supposed to be the
same thing anyway.
It'll be very challenging to do that formal logic properly. I don't think
it's useful in every situation. Mapping is easy for economic situations,
but very hard for emotions.
Particularly challenging would be, say, family law. When is it reasonable
to split a family? When Suffering_family < Suffering_society? Not if you
prefer to leave people alone, then it's Suffering_family + neutrality_bias
< Suffering_society. Also, both Suffering_family and Suffering_society will
be the results of combining a very large amount of factors.
One could model the amount of coercion upon an actor, how much a tax
exemption would create incentives.
I'm sorry for not having good examples. My understanding of formal logic is
not that great, and I haven't actually tried to model a government's
considerations. I think formal logic is the successor of "legalese", harder
to speak and read, but once the mapping and relating is done the reasoning
is absolute. Much easier to find mistakes, be precise, and much harder to
make mistakes regarding governance.
(note: formal logics dealing with fuzziness are even much harder to
write/read, but will be a definite must)
For the system's actors to behave as they should, as determined by the
system. In a republic a politician is intended to act in the best interest
of its supporters. Businesses can at times provide great enough incentive
to causes them to act otherwise.
Does what it says on the tin.
Freedom is not very strongly defined anyway. It means you can't be "forced"
to do something, but it's very rare for death not to be an alternative
choice. Reality narrows our choices most significantly, but through law and
enforcement we can change the "economic landscape" and cause what once was
the best choice ('deepest valley') to become only meh, or very not good
('high ridge'). I guess freedom is when you have no (clear) optimal
choices, which isn't actually preferable.
But I think we understand people so badly that it's better to make them
responsible for their own mistakes, rather than sometimes make a wrong
choice for them. As our understanding of "the human condition" grows, so
does our ability to make choices that are actually better according to
certain measures (certain measures because nihilism informs clearly that
nothing truly matters). Perhaps freedom is being allowed to choose the
Mathematically it makes sense to have competition and free markets. In
practice the actors do not obey perfectly, and cause a lot of reality.
Additionally, while a market is finding it's optimum (the best way to do a
certain thing) competition actually has significant cost. Sometimes reality
shifts faster than markets anneal, and we get stuck with a lot of
competition instead of expediting that energy to moving towards the ideal
solution. (also game theory)
There you go using criminal as if it means something :)
Uhm, the ideal criminal monopoly, to me, would be criminal enough to ensure
it's own existence, and do things I like as well. Like advancing humanity.
(competing with the aliens that might already be underway, or finding a way
for them to want to join our superior political system so we may advance
together against yet more aliens that might not exist, and then to delay
the heat death of the universe, I suppose)
Depends on what it does. It sure beats having competing governments.
Racism, inflation and excessive military power are what you get, not much
more afaik. (and replication of efforts)
Rights are defined by government, a self restraint alike "I'll never drink
again". But I don't think that's very meaningful. Rights are supposed to be
impossible to violate. If the government is incapable of violating the
right, then it's a right. But by that point it's synonymous with a
citizen's power. In practice "rights" are barriers, not absolute restraints.
Ugh, linguistics.
        You are misunderstanding what natural rights are. Natural
Natural rights are entirely different from rights. It is as you say, a plea
for encoding some specific morality into law. Claiming something is a
natural right seems to imply that it's been a right since before the
politics determined what is and isn't a right. I think it's pretty
meaningless, but I deeply empathize with the emotions involved.
I could hear myself screaming that my natural rights are being violated.
(as a futile plea after I give up hope)
I think if humans have natural rights, then why don't animals? Maybe you
think they do, maybe you think they don't. But the same goes for humans,
some people think something should be a right, some people don't. But for
justice to be applied consistently we need there to be a clearly defined
set of rules, so we should agree upon that set of rules. We're not very
good at it :(
Can't ignore a mountain's natural rights, man.
I think my understanding is still not aligned. What states pretend to get
their powers from 'natural rights'? I thought it used to be "God played
lottery and my name came up" for kings, queens and pharaohs. And at some
point that line could just be omitted because of legacy/buy-in.
I think when a (messenger of) the state comes up and goes "you better pay
your tax or I'll whip your ass" then that's, well, where they get their
power, and natural rights don't really come into the whipping.
Pretty sure it's more about whipping.
If it really was consent I could send a letter to the king informing him
I've had enough of his shit and I'll just fend for myself in the western
sahara, or on a boat or something, but I think they'll still come get me if
I break the law ((most) Dutch law applies to citizens abroad).
It's my plan for world domination. I just make a system that's so nice
everyone will come running. Probably easier than whipping everyone into
obedience. It could even be no-conflict with the governments, running two
systems in parallel until either gets attention starved.
Thanks for showing me the word mercantile. It's like a newspeak
thinkbarrier is lifted.
Ah, yes. The syntactic similarity of right and rights.

You know, a webpage is supposed to be in a VM too.
With HTML growing so big and so fast it's very hard to know it's secure.
But I see little reason as to why Javascript is the baddest boy on the
block. iPhones Got wrecked by a png rendering library. Interpreting a
programming language is not *that* different from interpreting an image.
Even less different from interpreting HTML/CSS. If you would care for a
secure instead of a fast Javascript interpreter, well, too bad because
nobody's making a secure one. Hah.
Which relates as to why I lost a lot of personal photo's; I didn't use the
cloud backup feature. Now nobody has my pictures, except maybe whomever
stole my phone* =(
Using one of those file hosting sites provides a greater level of
convenience. Perhaps so much greater that without that level of convenience
it would hardly be possible at all. The consumers don't care to invest in
security very much, in fact, hardly at all. Especially when all you're

tl;dr: javascript could be fine if we'd have secure software - as it is
HTML/CSS/images/videos/etc are all also dangerous. Top level security seems

like it so very much) unless we keep ourselves from essential features.

I'm trying to argue we need more convenient + secure
services/applications/workflows/etc. because apparently security wasn't
worth it for the reporters.
I'm also aware of the exceedingly detrimental effect copyright law has had
on general filesharing. Somehow information controls, huge dangers to
freedom of speech, are permissible because ideas aren't free but instead
licensable at owner's whims.
Reg backups - I think you have a far better way of managing things than I
do. It was actually on my mind to fix within the week (earlier if I'd have
found a client-side-crypto-cloud-backup-thing). There's no excuse really -
I just kept delaying it because I never /actually/ lost data before (I
always had a backup somewhere). I've never been very systematic about it
and it feels totally off that it isn't already automated in our operating
systems. (/vent... losing data hurts)
I mean so many of them that we do not have much security now. (btw:
geotagging is cool, it's bad for security, but so are all pictures)
I actually lost (a test server's) data before because I crypted it and
locked it up - and forgot the horrendously complicated extra-long passkeys.
Since then I opt for something easier to remember/derive, because
everything else is detrimental to security. Making physical notes means
"import sec.physical" which is a foolhardy proposition.
It makes you slower. Incompatibility makes you slower. Slowness makes you
irrelevant. Slowness equals failure. (depending on how much slower you'll

US debt has no theoretical limit. Instead debt value is limited by the
amount of inflation incurred.
The way the US rents the finances from the FED is confusing and I'm not

amount of USD in circulation.
The US is not in the situation that it's rent outweighs it's income, and is

people will have to adopt another currency that's not hyperinflating. Then

If you're panscient (know the current state of the world) you could
determine the actual risk precisely. Then you multiply value * risk, and
you know the likely debt, or debt equivalent. If the gamblers are even a
bit conservative (and correct) you will likely find the debt is negative -
these derivatives will probably be positive assets. Why else have them?
Nobody's panscient, but the people that make these bets try to be. They
stake their wealth on their correct guessing. I'd say that gives them the
right incentives.
It's also quite likely that bets are both ways (one person thinks x,
another thinks y), limited in their ability to lose money (stop loss
present), etc, etc. Simply counting them as debt is /wrong/.
The more competitive you need to be, the riskier your bets need to be. You
can abide with little risk, or fly high with intense gambles. Try not to
burn your wings.
This is not the right thing to do.
If you remove risk, the system will not be balanced. You will create a
system that is overly risk-seeking. If you remove the penalty for taking
huge huge gambles, why not stake it? Reduce the penalty for failed bets and
you (directly) increase the amount of failed bets.
Having this advantage only apply to large corps is an even greater
disturbance in the market. Why in gods name would you give big companies
incentive to fail? Larger risks, larger profits. Countries as a whole are
running on their economic hindlegs - running because they can no longer
seem to walk.

Unless we give the general public a reason to be critical of financial
instruments they will not be critical of financial instruments. If there's
no care for something it goes wrong. We're moving towards "communism
without compassion" - a world where you're responsible for yourself and
your financial situation, but government makes it impossible for the sake
of national interests*. An evil system without evil actors. If we're going
to plan our economy together, collaboratively, then why do we need to be so
sneaky about it?
It'd all be fun and games if it weren't my taxes that're being used against
my best interests. Don't think there's much helping it, except paying the
least taxes possible. (And who pays more tax than he needs to, anyway?)
* eg: we have national insurance for salaries, so they may be paid despite
bankruptcy. Employees do not suffer even though their labor was bad for
society (as determined by the markets). At least, we'd know if the markets
weren't already disturbed beyond realism. This leads to companies being
less risk adverse than they should be, which leads to a disturbed market in
which a legitimate, fair, balanced, honest company cannot operate
profitably. Everyone suffers.
P.S.: there's plenty of legitimate reasons for how things are, I'm not

meaning, you plop your eyes a certain amount of characters - not angle. You
read a certain amount of chars per peek, and variable width might confuse
you (maybe).
"If the lines are too short, readers cannot make use of much information in
each fixation. If line lengths are too long, the return sweeps to the
beginning of the next line are difficult."
Pretty straightforward/as expected
"(..) 2.2A + 21 ms (Carpenter 1977), which means that the greater number of
return sweeps with shorter lines will add more to the time than longer
Not sure about the unit of A (amplitude?) but it means you take 21 ms, plus
some measure of distance, to move your eyes from x to y.
The authors seem to be fans of the idea that reading speed simply improves
from longer lines, up to about 130 characters, after which the line becomes
unwieldy. Some in-print research showed 70 or 52 (?) characters to be the
ideal width. I find it amusing that these relate roughly to coders'
standards of 60, 80 or 120 characters.
Ultimately, a bit offtopic and I apologize.

I feel like you are ignoring the cost of time, underestimating people's
expenses, and arbitrarily hate cars and meat.
For most "the latest iCrap" is not a significant expense. 200 euro's a
month or so (phone + laptop) is quite doable, especially given how much
time one spends with iCrap devices. Resale value is nonzero, too, so
really, quite doable.
I know how to fix/repurpose most things. Actually fixing things often
doesn't compare favorably with just buying a new one - time spent at 10
euro's per hour makes most repairs very borderline effective.
Trade what? I do secondhand shopping and selling when appropriate, that
should be good too.
Do, for the things it makes sense for. It takes more effort as you
frequently will not find what you were looking for. (protip: great for
amplifiers and speakers)
Fair trade/wages are determined by the capitalist market, not by me. I'm
simply not that arrogant. If you don't believe in markts you have more work
cut out for you than just buying fair trade branded products. (Protip:
fairtrade is just another way for things to be shiny)
Buying local is even more meaningless. If transport costs do not outweigh
production costs, go ferry it in from Australia, China, Chile, etc. You're
making the efficient choice by doing so.
- Use a bike or public transit whenever possible.  Get rid of your car and
Public transport or Zip Carring add to stress, cost more time, are not
reliable and are not portable storage. I'd like an electric car, but the
initial purchase is so high it skews things like tax and insurance.
Idk why you hate cars so much. They're pretty damn useful, give you lots of
freedom and independence, and just help you get around so much better than
public transport. Their prices also compare with other forms of transport.
(bikes are slow and only really work in villages or compatible cities)
Preparing my own food is a waste of time, other people are cheaper, mass
production is cheaper, I'm very mediocre at cooking.
Going vegan is an interesting choice, all evidence points to it being much
much much better for the environment, etc. but meat is still quite
affordable and quite complimentary to meals. If it truly were 100x easier
on the environment I'd expect to see that in the price, and I hardly do. I
assume there's some sort of sponsoring going on, and until it stops I'll
keep on eating delicious and healthy meat.

Razer also fuzzes about collectivism vs individualism. They used to have
collectivism in many nations. They all lost. I think a society design that
involves individual incentives (the best of capitalism; advanced finance,
legal persons, markets, competition), global optimization (the best of
communism; managed competition, fine tuned production, >designed markets<),
and collective ambition (the best of government/academia; being able to
strife together and make deep, long term investments) would be ideal.

Truecost one or two dead 24 year old foxconn/Bangladeshi sweatshop
Truecost being some unrealistic form of cost determination? We are in a
real world situation when I buy something made in a sweatshop. Governments
skew everything all over the place and cause grave injustice in doing so.
Wealth imbalance is the other great evil, that could be limited by
something like Basic Income, but it is hard to implement.
Other than excessive coercion following wealth imbalance, and government
unmarkets, the price I pay is the Truecost.
The difference between "what I pay now", "what I pay later", "what I lose
in opportunity" etc is very difficult to keep track of, and explains my
desire for "advanced finance". In fact, this is so important that a hedge
fund manager can often make a very big amount, just by fixing wrong
pricing. It offends our natural understanding of things, and that is also
why we suck at it. (And the insane earnings on the markets are also a
direct result of us sucking at markets)
The Zapatistas are a collectivist society and they've far from 'lost'.
Not sure what this is supposed to evidence. Collectives are still in the

I disagree. The purer a system the greater our understanding, and a thing
understood is exceedingly more useful. Fuzziness causes us to make
mistakes, and for mistakes to stack atop mistakes.
Capitalism is definitely murder. It's a natural system, with evolutionary
effects. It kills the weak, flawed, unfit. We can make it kinder, but doing
so makes it less effective. We've already made it a lot kinder. (note: less
effective, but kinder. It's not clear which one would prefer. Truthfully I
think Basic Income is the ideal way to guarantee kindness, but it's hard to

No. In my idealized model politics is quite a different game. There is most
definitely still a "government mafia", that harasses everyone to 1. stay
out of each other's hair and 2. invest in the advancement of the human race
(think space travel, science). But, there is no nations. Interest groups
are inevitable and should not be encouraged or discouraged, merely
understood. That way no interest group can offend justice (meaning:
But, the government *must not* thread into the financial services field. It

That is to say, a mixed economy. Again.
I think some products are best rendered without competition, and some are
best rendered with competition. So long as the drive to do best exists we
do not really need to replicate effort. Eg: Patents are only good for
preventing people from using the best available methods. It's a hack to
make investments more worthwhile, and secrecy less important. If we didn't
need a profit incentive there would be no need for patents.
A similar argument is possible for shrewd advertising, why lie to people if
you do not profit from it? One helps everyone most by providing correct
information. (*this is not true, people regularly need to be coerced to act
in their best interests. But coercion for the better is really not that
In the real world we oft encounter duopolies. Basically a monopoly with a
state-protected laggard. The monopolist ensures the laggard continues
existing, for example by increasing it's own prices to a kind of
unreasonable height. That ensures sales for the laggard, and maximum
profit. Basically this whole system is then fucked, as there is no real
drive for advancement (the laggard cannot overtake the monopolist, it has
not the funds. But it also cannot fail, the monopolist prevents it. So why
even put up a fight?) and humanity is helped no better than the laggard
performs. It happens with all our huge markets, from shipping to silicon to
telecom to food to housing to government to diamonds, etc, etc, etc, etc,

You seem to be speaking from a position where it sounds like money is the
Money is liquid value. Value is the game. It's not at all about money,
money is useless. It's the value it denotes that's what it's all about.
You seem to ignore how seriously amazing pure liquid value is. In an ideal
world; when faced with two choices, the most profitable one is the one
that's bottom line better for humanity. You make an egoistic choice, and
improve the world.
A more profitable solution is either more efficient or provides greater
value. Error is introduced in judgement of value, and unmarket effects can
distort the picture of efficiency.
Other unmarket effects include excessive wealth (where more or less wealth
simply doesn't matter), limited lifespans (who cares if you lose? You'll
die anyway), extreme fuzziness of value, etc, etc.
Ever heard of voluntary simplicity?
I'm happy you're happy. I'm sad you'll not advance and will get your ass
handed to you by an aggressor who does. Real life is competitive by nature.
You may lose happily, and disappear. It doesn't really matter. The universe
dies a heat death anyway.
Not flying high is also a survival tactic though. Who knows, maybe things
will work our okay for you. (probably still better to fly a little higher)
You made some mention of thrift stores providing great value, and
satisfaction/fun from repairs also being value. I agree. I bought things
from thrift shops, and I repaired things for fun (and learning).
You mentioned "true" fair trade. I believe in labor markets, and therefore
do not think fair trade is a thing at all. "Fair trade" is mostly just
stupid trade, unless we get something for it. And NO not just a good
goddamn feeling. I mean "The Formula" like improvements, people causing
less disturbance if they get paid more kind of things. (note: things can
get extremely unfair in a sufficiently unbalanced situation, but so long as
coercion is limited it's fine)
So are you saying that you're okay with people working in slave labor
Yes. I'm saying that the price tells me if it's more efficient or not. If a
European person wants to live like a princess, or wouldn't work at all,
then perhaps I'll just ignore him and have someone else do the work.
Pollution is a difficult subject. It is easily solved:
1. All the earth is vested into a legal person
2. The legal person will auction destroyable earth - licenses to dump
pollutants, manipulate land, cut rainforest, fish, hunt, etc. such that
auction profit is maximized - yet earth preserved as per politically
determined rules. (must support X panda's, Y biodiversity units, Z
radioactivity level, etc)
3. The auction's profits are diverted to causes of common interest (donated
to the world government)
3. ALTERNATIVELY The auctions profits are transferred into (a) fictive
good(s) and destroyed - causing inflation/deflation to distribute the
finances over the owners of the fictive good. The choice of fictive good is
as important as the choice of a cause of common interest - it is merely a
way to exclude government from the process. There is atm no suitable
fictive good.
There's some issues regarding compensation for those most affected.
Chernobyl's responsible legal people (Russian gov, whatever exploitation
company, etc) will be forced to buy the destroyable earth licenses, likely
causing a massive bump to the price. It would have been dearly paid for.
But it would make sense for people more affected by the nuclear fallout to
see a bigger cut of that value. It's complex and political but can be done
Most importantly this preserves the real cost/risk/benefit relationships.
It preserves the markets. It means that if anyone makes the cheapest
choice, it is also the best choice. Drive a car if you think it's worth it!
It all works out in the end.
I don't "want any money", but I do want to travel here and there and
Obtain as much money as you can. Then, if you don't use it, donate it to
causes you care about. Causes that help people. Not earning money is just
sloth, really.
Is the essence of your point to "be mindful" - whether travel, food,
Meaningful? Idk what you mean by that. I think you mean "gives the feeling
of living meaningfully and relaxed". Perhaps Yoga and drugs are your keys.
Drugs to kill any suffering, perhaps heighten joy. Yoga because it
apparently helps people find meaning.

icecream, soylent, a solar panel, etc. I'm sure you want /something/ of
The "Wall St vultures" may be greedy assholes (idk) but the reason they're
effective is because our markets are not. The better our financial system
works, the less money people in the business could make. Perhaps now it
explains everything :P? (I think the obscurity, complexity, gravity of the
subject matter and legal restrictions caused by the aforementioned is why
the financial markets don't work better)
We're all in the same damn boat.  We sink or swim, together.
Or not together, that's the problem. (Also, sometimes people don't care)
Sorry for being verbose. It's very hard to get these arguments across. I'm
quite sure we're all on the same side, it's just so damn hard to speak.

It definitely is. A selective enumeration (which it will always be) is
merely a political tool. A comprehensive enumeration is impossible to
assure and costly to produce. And who should bear the costs of such an
enumeration? Society as a whole?
It is simply not fair to make law requiring such enumerations. It is much

Link 2, by line analysis:
Economics, in its current form, is a very limited science. Classical
Untruth. "Classical economists" are used to not involving terms they
needn't in providing a price quote. I don't pay the costs? I don't charge
the costs. It is logical, simple, practical.
This is the fault of governance, not economics. Simply, the company should
arrange a license to pollute. The license's cost should equal or exceed the
damage to the community - such that individuals in the community are bottom
line not negatively affected by the alteration.
I need a citation on this. It implies there's "environmental value" being
sacrificed for "value of economic size". Apparently the Chinese do think
their economy is worth the damage to the environment. This is also a
cultural issue. Simply put, the author is being an ignorant presumptuous
prick, pushing his values onto the Chinese government planners. There is
absolutely no evidence of economic miscalculations - merely of a different
subjective valuation of nature (or economy). (And even that is not
substantiated in the article)
It merely implies that people that are less rational will lose the economic
game. (it's true, they do generally lose) (it's also untrue, there's no
rational people. Only coincidence of the particular insanity and reality)

I appreciate the idea of a better "how good is your nation doing"
indicator. It's very political, and it's best to avoid bullshit in

True Cost Economics is a way for one nation to tell another it needs to do
something. It's just another way to do politics, not economics.
Oh, and making those responsible bear the cost for their action is
absolutely essential for capitalism. Without it we're only doing the
horrible parts of capitalism, not the magical parts.

I mostly agree. I hope the situation will better. I think one of the big
things that's needed is a superior alternative to Republics. From there,
something so fundamental, perhaps we can see more improvements. (note: I'd
like your suggestions)
There's still wise choices in a skewed system. They're just not always
realistic, sometimes even bizarre. The better the system the better the
wise choice.
        So a criminal monopoly is going to define what 'justice' is,
What's worse, it'll redefine criminal!
        You can keep repeating absurd, mainstream propaganda without
Complex agreements, abstaining from violence, huge organizations, etc.
These are valuable, aren't they?
Ideally, there's a political game that is able to generate "appropriate"
political choices. It's not a republic, a trade union, tribal
understandings, etc, etc, per se, but there's always something.
Without this system we are screwed anyway. If we do have that system we
*should* use it.
And we can use it to determine the absolute widest boundaries of what is
permitted, boundaries which you may not wander out of. We can produce
incentive schemes, to encourage the correct behavior. In fact, if the
system works it needs no restrictions.
We've yet to find a system that works. (also on the account of those pesky
flawed humans making up the systems)
I tried doing homework, but the books were full of propaganda.
Do tell me Juan, how do we prevent a "criminal monopoly"? Isn't it better
to make a very good "criminal monopoly"?
The system spans the globe, the crimes are all the peoples'.
Well, atm I'm still dreaming up the utopia. So far I have no convertees,
either :)
I have the right because I can. Powers *are* rights. Or, rather, rights do
not exist until a criminal monopoly invents justice, and grants people a
promise of abstaining from using power; a right.
IIRC you have this philosophy of inalienable rights, or natural rights, or
rights you would always claim, whatever. It doesn't matter. If you haven't
the power to claim a right, you do not have it. Ask the pigs, cows,
rabbits, ferrits, birds, and all the other animals we do whatever we want
to. Ask the mountains thought to have spirits. Listen to them and you will
hear but weeping for lack of strength.
Ofc, I'm the asshole for saying this.
I think in practice it will be easier to make the system a compelling
opt-in. If you don't want to be in it, it is probably not good enough. It's
important to be a bit selfish, not help people that don't opt-in. It's only
fair ;)
I stated "it makes investments more worthwhile, and secrecy less
important". I think most people that have patents don't need their
investments to be even more worthwhile. I think patent licensing systems
like mpeg, dolby, proprietary connectors, etc, do not help anyone. I think
copyright has crippled the economy and creativity, and served mostly to
produce Justin Bieber.
I do like that there's no more (at least much less) need for secrecy. And I
like the idea that an independent inventor is able to to make a living.
There's some research-only companies that have a very good market position
thanks to copyright law, whereas otherwise they'd be at the whims of
producing companies.
Understand, then improve upon.
I honestly do not know.
This is a very complex issue spanning all industries. I think the patent
system is a steaming pile of mercantile shit. The core idea is not so crazy
though - idea's can be stolen, so they must be property. But you don't lose
the idea when it gets stolen.
It ruins the creative industries - we've made our fantasies protected
property, subject not to the potential for art but the will of businessmen.
Countless stories go untold. The stories that do get told are smudged with
corporate inserts and ruinous inserted political messages. (look for
racism/feminist inserts, they're everywhere and they usually fail to
actually be unracist or feminist)
Software is such a broken industry (thanks huge sw companies!) that any
sense of right or wrong is already pre-broken. I think software was
probably more fun when nobody could protect it. We could develop software
based on bounties. There's another game theory problem, but at least
software would be fun again. (note: copyright is ineffective at protecting
software atm, if it were effective the market might actually be well
developed but still not fun)
Should Kia be allowed to copy exactly what Ford is doing? It seems like
theft to me. Ford invested and created something (a car design), why should
Kia customers not pay for that effort? Secrecy is an expensive (and
impractical) solution.
Fortunately, if we just let them figure it out they will have to find the
optimal way of dealing with it. Not us. I think merging all car companies,
making manufacture a non-market activity (product price = costs + 10%
instead), sales can still do whatever it does now, allow the designers to
self-organize and support the projects they believe in, reward them more
when their products work out.
I don't see where this goes. Perhaps a powers = rights argument?
Microsoft/Apple, Intel/AMD, ATI/Nvidia, most telecoms actually form cartels
with more than 2.
The basic principles are:
* There is a market leader
* There is competition
* If the market leader claims the entire market, it will be destroyed by
government (anti-monopoly law)
* The market leader will calibrate it's effort to stop short of claiming
the entire market (likely preferring to reward shareholders, divest, etc)
* If the competition advances, the market leader will advance as much (it
has more resources to advance, and will typically succeed at maintaining
it's lead)
* Any advance the competition makes is now wasted, as the market leader
will match the advancement
* The competition has no reason to advance, except upon itself (other

But I see little reason as to why Javascript is the baddest boy on the

Even less different from interpreting HTML/CSS. If you would care for a

(and often is) useless - therefore we don't really have it (even when we'd
like it so very much) unless we keep ourselves from essential features.

I'm trying to argue we need more convenient + secure
services/applications/workflows/etc. because apparently security wasn't
worth it for the reporters.
I'm also aware of the exceedingly detrimental effect copyright law has had
on general filesharing. Somehow information controls, huge dangers to
freedom of speech, are permissible because ideas aren't free but instead
licensable at owner's whims.
Reg backups - I think you have a far better way of managing things than I
do. It was actually on my mind to fix within the week (earlier if I'd have
found a client-side-crypto-cloud-backup-thing). There's no excuse really -
I just kept delaying it because I never /actually/ lost data before (I
always had a backup somewhere). I've never been very systematic about it
and it feels totally off that it isn't already automated in our operating
systems. (/vent... losing data hurts)
I mean so many of them that we do not have much security now. (btw:
geotagging is cool, it's bad for security, but so are all pictures)
I actually lost (a test server's) data before because I crypted it and
locked it up - and forgot the horrendously complicated extra-long passkeys.
Since then I opt for something easier to remember/derive, because
everything else is detrimental to security. Making physical notes means
"import sec.physical" which is a foolhardy proposition.
It makes you slower. Incompatibility makes you slower. Slowness makes you
irrelevant. Slowness equals failure. (depending on how much slower you'll

painful, and I wish I just accepted the cloud backup feature. I did not see
why it should not be encrypted locally, but the applications for doing so
manually did not inspire trust, and seemed like a big hassle besides (was

US debt has no theoretical limit. Instead debt value is limited by the
amount of inflation incurred.
The way the US rents the finances from the FED is confusing and I'm not
sure what it means for where the rent goes. Ideally, it just reduces the
amount of USD in circulation.
The US is not in the situation that it's rent outweighs it's income, and is
therefore not killed. Even if it does it mostly means the government and
people will have to adopt another currency that's not hyperinflating. Then
wait for the USD to devaluate the entire debt to a payable level. (Note:
something Bitcoiny would be a pretty good fit for many reasons)

If you're panscient (know the current state of the world) you could
determine the actual risk precisely. Then you multiply value * risk, and
you know the likely debt, or debt equivalent. If the gamblers are even a
bit conservative (and correct) you will likely find the debt is negative -
these derivatives will probably be positive assets. Why else have them?
Nobody's panscient, but the people that make these bets try to be. They
stake their wealth on their correct guessing. I'd say that gives them the
right incentives.
It's also quite likely that bets are both ways (one person thinks x,
another thinks y), limited in their ability to lose money (stop loss
present), etc, etc. Simply counting them as debt is /wrong/.
The more competitive you need to be, the riskier your bets need to be. You
can abide with little risk, or fly high with intense gambles. Try not to
burn your wings.
This is not the right thing to do.
If you remove risk, the system will not be balanced. You will create a
system that is overly risk-seeking. If you remove the penalty for taking
huge huge gambles, why not stake it? Reduce the penalty for failed bets and
you (directly) increase the amount of failed bets.
Having this advantage only apply to large corps is an even greater
disturbance in the market. Why in gods name would you give big companies
incentive to fail? Larger risks, larger profits. Countries as a whole are
running on their economic hindlegs - running because they can no longer
seem to walk.
Recession is when our administrative hacks are realigned with reality.
Sometimes causing so much systemic shock that it affects productivity,
which is real rather than just administrative.
If we all put our faith in a system that did not work, then we deserve the
consequences and should strife for greater resilience. Now we've just
doubled down on our faith. Very all or nothing.
Unless we give the general public a reason to be critical of financial
instruments they will not be critical of financial instruments. If there's
no care for something it goes wrong. We're moving towards "communism
without compassion" - a world where you're responsible for yourself and
your financial situation, but government makes it impossible for the sake
of national interests*. An evil system without evil actors. If we're going
to plan our economy together, collaboratively, then why do we need to be so
sneaky about it?
It'd all be fun and games if it weren't my taxes that're being used against
my best interests. Don't think there's much helping it, except paying the
least taxes possible. (And who pays more tax than he needs to, anyway?)
* eg: we have national insurance for salaries, so they may be paid despite
bankruptcy. Employees do not suffer even though their labor was bad for
society (as determined by the markets). At least, we'd know if the markets
weren't already disturbed beyond realism. This leads to companies being
less risk adverse than they should be, which leads to a disturbed market in
which a legitimate, fair, balanced, honest company cannot operate
profitably. Everyone suffers.
P.S.: there's plenty of legitimate reasons for how things are, I'm not
saying "it's done all wrong" - it's not. By most it's a best effort. This
relates to "evil system without evil actors", which I think is often the

Not true at all. Many people have trouble tracking long lines, partially
because eyes are jumpy (not scrolling). Some people have this very
seriously, but are otherwise fine (far as humans go).
This is also something testable. There's empirical research. According to
this "An empirical demonstration carried out by Morrison and Rayner (1981)
confirmed that saccade size is consistent in terms of number of characters,
and not visual angle"
meaning, you plop your eyes a certain amount of characters - not angle. You
read a certain amount of chars per peek, and variable width might confuse
you (maybe).
"If the lines are too short, readers cannot make use of much information in
each fixation. If line lengths are too long, the return sweeps to the
beginning of the next line are difficult."
Pretty straightforward/as expected
"(..) 2.2A + 21 ms (Carpenter 1977), which means that the greater number of
return sweeps with shorter lines will add more to the time than longer
Not sure about the unit of A (amplitude?) but it means you take 21 ms, plus
some measure of distance, to move your eyes from x to y.
The authors seem to be fans of the idea that reading speed simply improves
from longer lines, up to about 130 characters, after which the line becomes
unwieldy. Some in-print research showed 70 or 52 (?) characters to be the
ideal width. I find it amusing that these relate roughly to coders'
standards of 60, 80 or 120 characters.
Ultimately, a bit offtopic and I apologize.

I feel like you are ignoring the cost of time, underestimating people's
expenses, and arbitrarily hate cars and meat.
For most "the latest iCrap" is not a significant expense. 200 euro's a
month or so (phone + laptop) is quite doable, especially given how much
time one spends with iCrap devices. Resale value is nonzero, too, so
really, quite doable.
I know how to fix/repurpose most things. Actually fixing things often
doesn't compare favorably with just buying a new one - time spent at 10
euro's per hour makes most repairs very borderline effective.
Trade what? I do secondhand shopping and selling when appropriate, that
should be good too.
Do, for the things it makes sense for. It takes more effort as you
frequently will not find what you were looking for. (protip: great for

Fair trade/wages are determined by the capitalist market, not by me. I'm

Buying local is even more meaningless. If transport costs do not outweigh
production costs, go ferry it in from Australia, China, Chile, etc. You're
making the efficient choice by doing so.

Public transport or Zip Carring add to stress, cost more time, are not
reliable and are not portable storage. I'd like an electric car, but the
initial purchase is so high it skews things like tax and insurance.
Idk why you hate cars so much. They're pretty damn useful, give you lots of
freedom and independence, and just help you get around so much better than
public transport. Their prices also compare with other forms of transport.
(bikes are slow and only really work in villages or compatible cities)
Preparing my own food is a waste of time, other people are cheaper, mass
production is cheaper, I'm very mediocre at cooking.
Going vegan is an interesting choice, all evidence points to it being much

assume there's some sort of sponsoring going on, and until it stops I'll
keep on eating delicious and healthy meat.

Wealth imbalance is the other great evil, that could be limited by
something like Basic Income, but it is hard to implement.
Other than excessive coercion following wealth imbalance, and government

The difference between "what I pay now", "what I pay later", "what I lose
in opportunity" etc is very difficult to keep track of, and explains my
desire for "advanced finance". In fact, this is so important that a hedge
fund manager can often make a very big amount, just by fixing wrong
pricing. It offends our natural understanding of things, and that is also
why we suck at it. (And the insane earnings on the markets are also a
direct result of us sucking at markets)

make investments more worthwhile, and secrecy less important. If we didn't

existing, for example by increasing it's own prices to a kind of
unreasonable height. That ensures sales for the laggard, and maximum
profit. Basically this whole system is then fucked, as there is no real
drive for advancement (the laggard cannot overtake the monopolist, it has
not the funds. But it also cannot fail, the monopolist prevents it. So why
even put up a fight?) and humanity is helped no better than the laggard

You seem to be speaking from a position where it sounds like money is the
Money is liquid value. Value is the game. It's not at all about money,
money is useless. It's the value it denotes that's what it's all about.
You seem to ignore how seriously amazing pure liquid value is. In an ideal
world; when faced with two choices, the most profitable one is the one
that's bottom line better for humanity. You make an egoistic choice, and
improve the world.
A more profitable solution is either more efficient or provides greater
value. Error is introduced in judgement of value, and unmarket effects can
distort the picture of efficiency.
Other unmarket effects include excessive wealth (where more or less wealth
simply doesn't matter), limited lifespans (who cares if you lose? You'll
die anyway), extreme fuzziness of value, etc, etc.
Ever heard of voluntary simplicity?
I'm happy you're happy. I'm sad you'll not advance and will get your ass
handed to you by an aggressor who does. Real life is competitive by nature.
You may lose happily, and disappear. It doesn't really matter. The universe
dies a heat death anyway.
Not flying high is also a survival tactic though. Who knows, maybe things
will work our okay for you. (probably still better to fly a little higher)
You made some mention of thrift stores providing great value, and
satisfaction/fun from repairs also being value. I agree. I bought things
from thrift shops, and I repaired things for fun (and learning).
You mentioned "true" fair trade. I believe in labor markets, and therefore
do not think fair trade is a thing at all. "Fair trade" is mostly just
stupid trade, unless we get something for it. And NO not just a good
goddamn feeling. I mean "The Formula" like improvements, people causing
less disturbance if they get paid more kind of things. (note: things can
get extremely unfair in a sufficiently unbalanced situation, but so long as
coercion is limited it's fine)
So are you saying that you're okay with people working in slave labor
Yes. I'm saying that the price tells me if it's more efficient or not. If a
European person wants to live like a princess, or wouldn't work at all,
then perhaps I'll just ignore him and have someone else do the work.
Pollution is a difficult subject. It is easily solved:
1. All the earth is vested into a legal person
2. The legal person will auction destroyable earth - licenses to dump
pollutants, manipulate land, cut rainforest, fish, hunt, etc. such that
auction profit is maximized - yet earth preserved as per politically
determined rules. (must support X panda's, Y biodiversity units, Z
radioactivity level, etc)
3. The auction's profits are diverted to causes of common interest (donated
to the world government)
3. ALTERNATIVELY The auctions profits are transferred into (a) fictive
good(s) and destroyed - causing inflation/deflation to distribute the
finances over the owners of the fictive good. The choice of fictive good is
as important as the choice of a cause of common interest - it is merely a
way to exclude government from the process. There is atm no suitable
fictive good.
There's some issues regarding compensation for those most affected.
Chernobyl's responsible legal people (Russian gov, whatever exploitation
company, etc) will be forced to buy the destroyable earth licenses, likely
causing a massive bump to the price. It would have been dearly paid for.
But it would make sense for people more affected by the nuclear fallout to
see a bigger cut of that value. It's complex and political but can be done
Most importantly this preserves the real cost/risk/benefit relationships.
It preserves the markets. It means that if anyone makes the cheapest
choice, it is also the best choice. Drive a car if you think it's worth it!

I appreciate the idea of a better "how good is your nation doing"

"We should make those responsible bear the cost for their actions" != "True

True Cost Economics is a way for one nation to tell another it needs to do
something. It's just another way to do politics, not economics.
Oh, and making those responsible bear the cost for their action is
absolutely essential for capitalism. Without it we're only doing the
horrible parts of capitalism, not the magical parts.

I mostly agree. I hope the situation will better. I think one of the big
things that's needed is a superior alternative to Republics. From there,
something so fundamental, perhaps we can see more improvements. (note: I'd
like your suggestions)
There's still wise choices in a skewed system. They're just not always
realistic, sometimes even bizarre. The better the system the better the
wise choice.
        So a criminal monopoly is going to define what 'justice' is,
What's worse, it'll redefine criminal!
        You can keep repeating absurd, mainstream propaganda without
Complex agreements, abstaining from violence, huge organizations, etc.
These are valuable, aren't they?
Ideally, there's a political game that is able to generate "appropriate"
political choices. It's not a republic, a trade union, tribal
understandings, etc, etc, per se, but there's always something.
Without this system we are screwed anyway. If we do have that system we
*should* use it.
And we can use it to determine the absolute widest boundaries of what is
permitted, boundaries which you may not wander out of. We can produce
incentive schemes, to encourage the correct behavior. In fact, if the
system works it needs no restrictions.
We've yet to find a system that works. (also on the account of those pesky
flawed humans making up the systems)
I tried doing homework, but the books were full of propaganda.
Do tell me Juan, how do we prevent a "criminal monopoly"? Isn't it better
to make a very good "criminal monopoly"?
The system spans the globe, the crimes are all the peoples'.
Well, atm I'm still dreaming up the utopia. So far I have no convertees,
either :)
I have the right because I can. Powers *are* rights. Or, rather, rights do
not exist until a criminal monopoly invents justice, and grants people a
promise of abstaining from using power; a right.
IIRC you have this philosophy of inalienable rights, or natural rights, or
rights you would always claim, whatever. It doesn't matter. If you haven't
the power to claim a right, you do not have it. Ask the pigs, cows,
rabbits, ferrits, birds, and all the other animals we do whatever we want
to. Ask the mountains thought to have spirits. Listen to them and you will
hear but weeping for lack of strength.
Ofc, I'm the asshole for saying this.
I think in practice it will be easier to make the system a compelling
opt-in. If you don't want to be in it, it is probably not good enough. It's
important to be a bit selfish, not help people that don't opt-in. It's only
fair ;)
I stated "it makes investments more worthwhile, and secrecy less
important". I think most people that have patents don't need their
investments to be even more worthwhile. I think patent licensing systems
like mpeg, dolby, proprietary connectors, etc, do not help anyone. I think
copyright has crippled the economy and creativity, and served mostly to
produce Justin Bieber.
I do like that there's no more (at least much less) need for secrecy. And I
like the idea that an independent inventor is able to to make a living.
There's some research-only companies that have a very good market position
thanks to copyright law, whereas otherwise they'd be at the whims of
producing companies.
Understand, then improve upon.
I honestly do not know.
This is a very complex issue spanning all industries. I think the patent
system is a steaming pile of mercantile shit. The core idea is not so crazy
though - idea's can be stolen, so they must be property. But you don't lose
the idea when it gets stolen.
It ruins the creative industries - we've made our fantasies protected
property, subject not to the potential for art but the will of businessmen.
Countless stories go untold. The stories that do get told are smudged with
corporate inserts and ruinous inserted political messages. (look for
racism/feminist inserts, they're everywhere and they usually fail to
actually be unracist or feminist)
Software is such a broken industry (thanks huge sw companies!) that any
sense of right or wrong is already pre-broken. I think software was
probably more fun when nobody could protect it. We could develop software
based on bounties. There's another game theory problem, but at least
software would be fun again. (note: copyright is ineffective at protecting
software atm, if it were effective the market might actually be well
developed but still not fun)
Should Kia be allowed to copy exactly what Ford is doing? It seems like
theft to me. Ford invested and created something (a car design), why should
Kia customers not pay for that effort? Secrecy is an expensive (and
impractical) solution.
Fortunately, if we just let them figure it out they will have to find the
optimal way of dealing with it. Not us. I think merging all car companies,
making manufacture a non-market activity (product price = costs + 10%
instead), sales can still do whatever it does now, allow the designers to
self-organize and support the projects they believe in, reward them more
when their products work out.
I don't see where this goes. Perhaps a powers = rights argument?
Microsoft/Apple, Intel/AMD, ATI/Nvidia, most telecoms actually form cartels
with more than 2.
The basic principles are:
* There is a market leader
* There is competition
* If the market leader claims the entire market, it will be destroyed by
government (anti-monopoly law)
* The market leader will calibrate it's effort to stop short of claiming
the entire market (likely preferring to reward shareholders, divest, etc)
* If the competition advances, the market leader will advance as much (it
has more resources to advance, and will typically succeed at maintaining
it's lead)
* Any advance the competition makes is now wasted, as the market leader
will match the advancement
* The competition has no reason to advance, except upon itself (other

You know, a webpage is supposed to be in a VM too.
With HTML growing so big and so fast it's very hard to know it's secure.
But I see little reason as to why Javascript is the baddest boy on the
block. iPhones Got wrecked by a png rendering library. Interpreting a
programming language is not *that* different from interpreting an image.
Even less different from interpreting HTML/CSS. If you would care for a
secure instead of a fast Javascript interpreter, well, too bad because
nobody's making a secure one. Hah.
Which relates as to why I lost a lot of personal photo's; I didn't use the
cloud backup feature. Now nobody has my pictures, except maybe whomever
stole my phone* =(
Using one of those file hosting sites provides a greater level of
convenience. Perhaps so much greater that without that level of convenience
it would hardly be possible at all. The consumers don't care to invest in
security very much, in fact, hardly at all. Especially when all you're
securing against sounds like more paranoia - which is what an
invisible-seems-like-its-not-even-there organization will always seem like.
(remember, the NSA lacks the field agents to even be anywhere, and I never
see GCHQ agents either)
* full disk crypto is not a thing in androidland ;(
tl;dr: javascript could be fine if we'd have secure software - as it is
HTML/CSS/images/videos/etc are all also dangerous. Top level security seems
(and often is) useless - therefore we don't really have it (even when we'd
like it so very much) unless we keep ourselves from essential features.

*possible at all *for them*
I'm trying to argue we need more convenient + secure
services/applications/workflows/etc. because apparently security wasn't
worth it for the reporters.
I'm also aware of the exceedingly detrimental effect copyright law has had
on general filesharing. Somehow information controls, huge dangers to
freedom of speech, are permissible because ideas aren't free but instead
licensable at owner's whims.
Reg backups - I think you have a far better way of managing things than I
do. It was actually on my mind to fix within the week (earlier if I'd have
found a client-side-crypto-cloud-backup-thing). There's no excuse really -
I just kept delaying it because I never /actually/ lost data before (I
always had a backup somewhere). I've never been very systematic about it
and it feels totally off that it isn't already automated in our operating
systems. (/vent... losing data hurts)
I mean so many of them that we do not have much security now. (btw:
geotagging is cool, it's bad for security, but so are all pictures)
I actually lost (a test server's) data before because I crypted it and
locked it up - and forgot the horrendously complicated extra-long passkeys.
Since then I opt for something easier to remember/derive, because
everything else is detrimental to security. Making physical notes means
"import sec.physical" which is a foolhardy proposition.
It makes you slower. Incompatibility makes you slower. Slowness makes you
irrelevant. Slowness equals failure. (depending on how much slower you'll

worse still, but now seemingly only marginally so. Having just lost my
personal pictures (which are really not that useful for anyone but me) is
painful, and I wish I just accepted the cloud backup feature. I did not see
why it should not be encrypted locally, but the applications for doing so
manually did not inspire trust, and seemed like a big hassle besides (was
still gonna). Basically, I recommend using automatic cloud backups for
images, and remembering that GOOG/TLA's are watching (which they are

US debt has no theoretical limit. Instead debt value is limited by the
amount of inflation incurred.
The way the US rents the finances from the FED is confusing and I'm not
sure what it means for where the rent goes. Ideally, it just reduces the
amount of USD in circulation.
The US is not in the situation that it's rent outweighs it's income, and is
therefore not killed. Even if it does it mostly means the government and
people will have to adopt another currency that's not hyperinflating. Then
wait for the USD to devaluate the entire debt to a payable level. (Note:

If you're panscient (know the current state of the world) you could
determine the actual risk precisely. Then you multiply value * risk, and
you know the likely debt, or debt equivalent. If the gamblers are even a
bit conservative (and correct) you will likely find the debt is negative -
these derivatives will probably be positive assets. Why else have them?
Nobody's panscient, but the people that make these bets try to be. They
stake their wealth on their correct guessing. I'd say that gives them the
right incentives.
It's also quite likely that bets are both ways (one person thinks x,
another thinks y), limited in their ability to lose money (stop loss
present), etc, etc. Simply counting them as debt is /wrong/.
The more competitive you need to be, the riskier your bets need to be. You
can abide with little risk, or fly high with intense gambles. Try not to
burn your wings.
This is not the right thing to do.
If you remove risk, the system will not be balanced. You will create a
system that is overly risk-seeking. If you remove the penalty for taking
huge huge gambles, why not stake it? Reduce the penalty for failed bets and
you (directly) increase the amount of failed bets.
Having this advantage only apply to large corps is an even greater
disturbance in the market. Why in gods name would you give big companies
incentive to fail? Larger risks, larger profits. Countries as a whole are
running on their economic hindlegs - running because they can no longer
seem to walk.
Recession is when our administrative hacks are realigned with reality.
Sometimes causing so much systemic shock that it affects productivity,
which is real rather than just administrative.
If we all put our faith in a system that did not work, then we deserve the
consequences and should strife for greater resilience. Now we've just
doubled down on our faith. Very all or nothing.
Unless we give the general public a reason to be critical of financial
instruments they will not be critical of financial instruments. If there's
no care for something it goes wrong. We're moving towards "communism
without compassion" - a world where you're responsible for yourself and
your financial situation, but government makes it impossible for the sake
of national interests*. An evil system without evil actors. If we're going
to plan our economy together, collaboratively, then why do we need to be so
sneaky about it?
It'd all be fun and games if it weren't my taxes that're being used against
my best interests. Don't think there's much helping it, except paying the
least taxes possible. (And who pays more tax than he needs to, anyway?)
* eg: we have national insurance for salaries, so they may be paid despite
bankruptcy. Employees do not suffer even though their labor was bad for
society (as determined by the markets). At least, we'd know if the markets
weren't already disturbed beyond realism. This leads to companies being
less risk adverse than they should be, which leads to a disturbed market in
which a legitimate, fair, balanced, honest company cannot operate
profitably. Everyone suffers.
P.S.: there's plenty of legitimate reasons for how things are, I'm not
saying "it's done all wrong" - it's not. By most it's a best effort. This
relates to "evil system without evil actors", which I think is often the
best way to understand a systemic problem. (it also somewhat limits

Not true at all. Many people have trouble tracking long lines, partially
because eyes are jumpy (not scrolling). Some people have this very
seriously, but are otherwise fine (far as humans go).
This is also something testable. There's empirical research. According to
this "An empirical demonstration carried out by Morrison and Rayner (1981)
confirmed that saccade size is consistent in terms of number of characters,
and not visual angle"
meaning, you plop your eyes a certain amount of characters - not angle. You
read a certain amount of chars per peek, and variable width might confuse
you (maybe).
"If the lines are too short, readers cannot make use of much information in
each fixation. If line lengths are too long, the return sweeps to the
beginning of the next line are difficult."
Pretty straightforward/as expected
"(..) 2.2A + 21 ms (Carpenter 1977), which means that the greater number of
return sweeps with shorter lines will add more to the time than longer
Not sure about the unit of A (amplitude?) but it means you take 21 ms, plus
some measure of distance, to move your eyes from x to y.
The authors seem to be fans of the idea that reading speed simply improves
from longer lines, up to about 130 characters, after which the line becomes
unwieldy. Some in-print research showed 70 or 52 (?) characters to be the
ideal width. I find it amusing that these relate roughly to coders'
standards of 60, 80 or 120 characters.

For most "the latest iCrap" is not a significant expense. 200 euro's a

time one spends with iCrap devices. Resale value is nonzero, too, so
really, quite doable.
I know how to fix/repurpose most things. Actually fixing things often
doesn't compare favorably with just buying a new one - time spent at 10
euro's per hour makes most repairs very borderline effective.

Buying local is even more meaningless. If transport costs do not outweigh
production costs, go ferry it in from Australia, China, Chile, etc. You're

Public transport or Zip Carring add to stress, cost more time, are not
reliable and are not portable storage. I'd like an electric car, but the
initial purchase is so high it skews things like tax and insurance.
Idk why you hate cars so much. They're pretty damn useful, give you lots of
freedom and independence, and just help you get around so much better than
public transport. Their prices also compare with other forms of transport.

Preparing my own food is a waste of time, other people are cheaper, mass

legal persons, markets, competition), global optimization (the best of
communism; managed competition, fine tuned production, >designed markets<),
and collective ambition (the best of government/academia; being able to
strife together and make deep, long term investments) would be ideal.

blame anyone for not getting into my response, or even for getting angry

Truecost one or two dead 24 year old foxconn/Bangladeshi sweatshop
Truecost being some unrealistic form of cost determination? We are in a
real world situation when I buy something made in a sweatshop. Governments
skew everything all over the place and cause grave injustice in doing so.
Wealth imbalance is the other great evil, that could be limited by
something like Basic Income, but it is hard to implement.
Other than excessive coercion following wealth imbalance, and government
unmarkets, the price I pay is the Truecost.
The difference between "what I pay now", "what I pay later", "what I lose
in opportunity" etc is very difficult to keep track of, and explains my
desire for "advanced finance". In fact, this is so important that a hedge
fund manager can often make a very big amount, just by fixing wrong
pricing. It offends our natural understanding of things, and that is also
why we suck at it. (And the insane earnings on the markets are also a
direct result of us sucking at markets)
The Zapatistas are a collectivist society and they've far from 'lost'.
Not sure what this is supposed to evidence. Collectives are still in the
individual's advantage? I'm not sure that follows, humans act in bizarre
ways and our power allows the absurdities to be reality.
I disagree. The purer a system the greater our understanding, and a thing
understood is exceedingly more useful. Fuzziness causes us to make
mistakes, and for mistakes to stack atop mistakes.
Capitalism is definitely murder. It's a natural system, with evolutionary
effects. It kills the weak, flawed, unfit. We can make it kinder, but doing
so makes it less effective. We've already made it a lot kinder. (note: less
effective, but kinder. It's not clear which one would prefer. Truthfully I

No. In my idealized model politics is quite a different game. There is most
definitely still a "government mafia", that harasses everyone to 1. stay
out of each other's hair and 2. invest in the advancement of the human race

are inevitable and should not be encouraged or discouraged, merely
understood. That way no interest group can offend justice (meaning:

That is to say, a mixed economy. Again.
I think some products are best rendered without competition, and some are
best rendered with competition. So long as the drive to do best exists we
do not really need to replicate effort. Eg: Patents are only good for
preventing people from using the best available methods. It's a hack to
make investments more worthwhile, and secrecy less important. If we didn't
need a profit incentive there would be no need for patents.
A similar argument is possible for shrewd advertising, why lie to people if
you do not profit from it? One helps everyone most by providing correct
information. (*this is not true, people regularly need to be coerced to act

In the real world we oft encounter duopolies. Basically a monopoly with a
state-protected laggard. The monopolist ensures the laggard continues
existing, for example by increasing it's own prices to a kind of
unreasonable height. That ensures sales for the laggard, and maximum
profit. Basically this whole system is then fucked, as there is no real
drive for advancement (the laggard cannot overtake the monopolist, it has
not the funds. But it also cannot fail, the monopolist prevents it. So why
even put up a fight?) and humanity is helped no better than the laggard
performs. It happens with all our huge markets, from shipping to silicon to
telecom to food to housing to government to diamonds, etc, etc, etc, etc,

You seem to be speaking from a position where it sounds like money is the
Money is liquid value. Value is the game. It's not at all about money,
money is useless. It's the value it denotes that's what it's all about.
You seem to ignore how seriously amazing pure liquid value is. In an ideal
world; when faced with two choices, the most profitable one is the one
that's bottom line better for humanity. You make an egoistic choice, and
improve the world.
A more profitable solution is either more efficient or provides greater
value. Error is introduced in judgement of value, and unmarket effects can
distort the picture of efficiency.
Other unmarket effects include excessive wealth (where more or less wealth
simply doesn't matter), limited lifespans (who cares if you lose? You'll
die anyway), extreme fuzziness of value, etc, etc.
Ever heard of voluntary simplicity?
I'm happy you're happy. I'm sad you'll not advance and will get your ass
handed to you by an aggressor who does. Real life is competitive by nature.
You may lose happily, and disappear. It doesn't really matter. The universe
dies a heat death anyway.
Not flying high is also a survival tactic though. Who knows, maybe things
will work our okay for you. (probably still better to fly a little higher)
You made some mention of thrift stores providing great value, and
satisfaction/fun from repairs also being value. I agree. I bought things
from thrift shops, and I repaired things for fun (and learning).
You mentioned "true" fair trade. I believe in labor markets, and therefore
do not think fair trade is a thing at all. "Fair trade" is mostly just
stupid trade, unless we get something for it. And NO not just a good
goddamn feeling. I mean "The Formula" like improvements, people causing
less disturbance if they get paid more kind of things. (note: things can
get extremely unfair in a sufficiently unbalanced situation, but so long as
coercion is limited it's fine)
So are you saying that you're okay with people working in slave labor
Yes. I'm saying that the price tells me if it's more efficient or not. If a
European person wants to live like a princess, or wouldn't work at all,
then perhaps I'll just ignore him and have someone else do the work.
Pollution is a difficult subject. It is easily solved:
1. All the earth is vested into a legal person
2. The legal person will auction destroyable earth - licenses to dump
pollutants, manipulate land, cut rainforest, fish, hunt, etc. such that
auction profit is maximized - yet earth preserved as per politically
determined rules. (must support X panda's, Y biodiversity units, Z
radioactivity level, etc)
3. The auction's profits are diverted to causes of common interest (donated
to the world government)
3. ALTERNATIVELY The auctions profits are transferred into (a) fictive
good(s) and destroyed - causing inflation/deflation to distribute the
finances over the owners of the fictive good. The choice of fictive good is
as important as the choice of a cause of common interest - it is merely a
way to exclude government from the process. There is atm no suitable
fictive good.
There's some issues regarding compensation for those most affected.
Chernobyl's responsible legal people (Russian gov, whatever exploitation
company, etc) will be forced to buy the destroyable earth licenses, likely
causing a massive bump to the price. It would have been dearly paid for.
But it would make sense for people more affected by the nuclear fallout to
see a bigger cut of that value. It's complex and political but can be done
Most importantly this preserves the real cost/risk/benefit relationships.
It preserves the markets. It means that if anyone makes the cheapest
choice, it is also the best choice. Drive a car if you think it's worth it!
It all works out in the end.
I don't "want any money", but I do want to travel here and there and
Obtain as much money as you can. Then, if you don't use it, donate it to
causes you care about. Causes that help people. Not earning money is just
sloth, really.
Is the essence of your point to "be mindful" - whether travel, food,
Meaningful? Idk what you mean by that. I think you mean "gives the feeling
of living meaningfully and relaxed". Perhaps Yoga and drugs are your keys.
Drugs to kill any suffering, perhaps heighten joy. Yoga because it
apparently helps people find meaning.

icecream, soylent, a solar panel, etc. I'm sure you want /something/ of
The "Wall St vultures" may be greedy assholes (idk) but the reason they're
effective is because our markets are not. The better our financial system
works, the less money people in the business could make. Perhaps now it
explains everything :P? (I think the obscurity, complexity, gravity of the
subject matter and legal restrictions caused by the aforementioned is why
the financial markets don't work better)
We're all in the same damn boat.  We sink or swim, together.
Or not together, that's the problem. (Also, sometimes people don't care)
Sorry for being verbose. It's very hard to get these arguments across. I'm
quite sure we're all on the same side, it's just so damn hard to speak.

It definitely is. A selective enumeration (which it will always be) is
merely a political tool. A comprehensive enumeration is impossible to
assure and costly to produce. And who should bear the costs of such an
enumeration? Society as a whole?
It is simply not fair to make law requiring such enumerations. It is much

Economics, in its current form, is a very limited science. Classical
Untruth. "Classical economists" are used to not involving terms they
needn't in providing a price quote. I don't pay the costs? I don't charge
the costs. It is logical, simple, practical.
This is the fault of governance, not economics. Simply, the company should
arrange a license to pollute. The license's cost should equal or exceed the
damage to the community - such that individuals in the community are bottom
line not negatively affected by the alteration.
I need a citation on this. It implies there's "environmental value" being
sacrificed for "value of economic size". Apparently the Chinese do think
their economy is worth the damage to the environment. This is also a
cultural issue. Simply put, the author is being an ignorant presumptuous
prick, pushing his values onto the Chinese government planners. There is
absolutely no evidence of economic miscalculations - merely of a different
subjective valuation of nature (or economy). (And even that is not

something. It's just another way to do politics, not economics.

absolutely essential for capitalism. Without it we're only doing the

I mostly agree. I hope the situation will better. I think one of the big
things that's needed is a superior alternative to Republics. From there,
something so fundamental, perhaps we can see more improvements. (note: I'd
like your suggestions)
There's still wise choices in a skewed system. They're just not always
realistic, sometimes even bizarre. The better the system the better the
wise choice.
        So a criminal monopoly is going to define what 'justice' is,
What's worse, it'll redefine criminal!
        You can keep repeating absurd, mainstream propaganda without
Complex agreements, abstaining from violence, huge organizations, etc.
These are valuable, aren't they?
Ideally, there's a political game that is able to generate "appropriate"
political choices. It's not a republic, a trade union, tribal
understandings, etc, etc, per se, but there's always something.
Without this system we are screwed anyway. If we do have that system we
*should* use it.
And we can use it to determine the absolute widest boundaries of what is
permitted, boundaries which you may not wander out of. We can produce
incentive schemes, to encourage the correct behavior. In fact, if the
system works it needs no restrictions.
We've yet to find a system that works. (also on the account of those pesky
flawed humans making up the systems)
I tried doing homework, but the books were full of propaganda.
Do tell me Juan, how do we prevent a "criminal monopoly"? Isn't it better
to make a very good "criminal monopoly"?
The system spans the globe, the crimes are all the peoples'.
Well, atm I'm still dreaming up the utopia. So far I have no convertees,
either :)
I have the right because I can. Powers *are* rights. Or, rather, rights do
not exist until a criminal monopoly invents justice, and grants people a
promise of abstaining from using power; a right.
IIRC you have this philosophy of inalienable rights, or natural rights, or
rights you would always claim, whatever. It doesn't matter. If you haven't
the power to claim a right, you do not have it. Ask the pigs, cows,
rabbits, ferrits, birds, and all the other animals we do whatever we want
to. Ask the mountains thought to have spirits. Listen to them and you will
hear but weeping for lack of strength.
Ofc, I'm the asshole for saying this.
I think in practice it will be easier to make the system a compelling
opt-in. If you don't want to be in it, it is probably not good enough. It's
important to be a bit selfish, not help people that don't opt-in. It's only
fair ;)
I stated "it makes investments more worthwhile, and secrecy less
important". I think most people that have patents don't need their
investments to be even more worthwhile. I think patent licensing systems
like mpeg, dolby, proprietary connectors, etc, do not help anyone. I think
copyright has crippled the economy and creativity, and served mostly to
produce Justin Bieber.
I do like that there's no more (at least much less) need for secrecy. And I
like the idea that an independent inventor is able to to make a living.
There's some research-only companies that have a very good market position
thanks to copyright law, whereas otherwise they'd be at the whims of
producing companies.
Understand, then improve upon.
I honestly do not know.
This is a very complex issue spanning all industries. I think the patent
system is a steaming pile of mercantile shit. The core idea is not so crazy
though - idea's can be stolen, so they must be property. But you don't lose
the idea when it gets stolen.
It ruins the creative industries - we've made our fantasies protected
property, subject not to the potential for art but the will of businessmen.
Countless stories go untold. The stories that do get told are smudged with
corporate inserts and ruinous inserted political messages. (look for
racism/feminist inserts, they're everywhere and they usually fail to
actually be unracist or feminist)
Software is such a broken industry (thanks huge sw companies!) that any
sense of right or wrong is already pre-broken. I think software was
probably more fun when nobody could protect it. We could develop software
based on bounties. There's another game theory problem, but at least
software would be fun again. (note: copyright is ineffective at protecting
software atm, if it were effective the market might actually be well
developed but still not fun)
Should Kia be allowed to copy exactly what Ford is doing? It seems like
theft to me. Ford invested and created something (a car design), why should
Kia customers not pay for that effort? Secrecy is an expensive (and
impractical) solution.
Fortunately, if we just let them figure it out they will have to find the
optimal way of dealing with it. Not us. I think merging all car companies,
making manufacture a non-market activity (product price = costs + 10%
instead), sales can still do whatever it does now, allow the designers to
self-organize and support the projects they believe in, reward them more
when their products work out.
I don't see where this goes. Perhaps a powers = rights argument?
Microsoft/Apple, Intel/AMD, ATI/Nvidia, most telecoms actually form cartels
with more than 2.
The basic principles are:
* There is a market leader
* There is competition
* If the market leader claims the entire market, it will be destroyed by
government (anti-monopoly law)
* The market leader will calibrate it's effort to stop short of claiming
the entire market (likely preferring to reward shareholders, divest, etc)
* If the competition advances, the market leader will advance as much (it
has more resources to advance, and will typically succeed at maintaining
it's lead)
* Any advance the competition makes is now wasted, as the market leader
will match the advancement
* The competition has no reason to advance, except upon itself (other

I think I'd feel a bit less anxious in general, knowing the worst that
could happen is living in good comfort. I think 30k per person is too much
though, 15k is really quite enough (at least in NL). This also to prevent
complete perversion of reward-for-labor.
I think the "digital nomad"-compatible family of jobs will lose their
associated risk (if it doesn't work out, you're still fine) and that will
help them. Jobs that are highly paid will likely still be pretty rewarding,
too. It's the jobs that pay little now that get the serious change in their
economics. Who wants to pick up garbage for almost no money, when you have
enough money?
It is also hard to estimate how many people will prefer entirely useless
work, or a minimal lifestyle. Given a tease more automation that should not
be a problem. But, remember, as automation increases the basic income can
become less; as a certain level of comfort is achieved at a lower price.
This also gives governments some new and interesting incentives.
The gamble sometimes seems to be whether some "successful creative and
risky business" produces more value than "cheap labor". (And, well, what
those lousy-job-people will do when they get a lot of time on their hands!)

This is one possible outcome -- but this is FAR from a revolt.
Just as likely is the outcome where Basic Income cattle is herded into
cheap everything arrangements, where they're offered "fun and fulfilling"
work for non-market pay. These humans will be entirely economically
detached. The overlords will reap their Basic Income, and allow them to
live month by month. (note: this already happens, you walk in a
Hyundai/Samsung build appartment block, where Lotte runs all the
supermarkets, and all the entertainment is provided by CJ, Koreans don't
fear big-corps, so they don't hide it, but I think this is probably true in
many places of the world)
Or, as in the amazing Cloud Atlas, we will create a caste-like society with
"producers", "consumers" and perhaps some other groups ("politicians"?
We may move from 99% to 99.9% puppets. It's just a way to generalize the
population, to silence the masses, to present happiness and freedom to be
guaranteed for all. Without alarm the watchers will turn to sleep, and
under that dark moon the world will change.
Simply put, it solves some problems but not all of them. BI can potentially
worsen the situation.
I think the immediate gain of guaranteed personal freedoms; freedom from
labor, freedom to self-improve, freedom to perform altruism, freedom to
perform art, and yes, even freedom to party, are worth a great deal. Yet,
it will create a future where nobody is willing to revolt, and the state is
in even further reaching control.
It also just upsets my minimal-government-preference somewhat. I just don't
like the idea of people living off of money I earned. It only makes sense
because money is already an abstract and perverted item, and because basic
needs will soon drop much further in their cost. (Especially if cheap
living becomes a greater priority)

I meant this would practically guarantee everyone the funds to be healthy,
choose one's daily activity freely, and for lack of want be happy.
That guarantee seems so sufficient that it's as if there will be no more
injustice due to power imbalance. As if the injustice done by the wealthy
is only because of the existence of the "too poor". I think it will lead to
a greater divergence in wealth. I'm not actually sure if that will be a
problem, but if wealth remains so direct a means for power, well, it very
well could be a problem. (note: democracy is more sensitive to
wealth==power due to the effectiveness of funding popular opinion
campaigns, advertising, new magazines, popular culture inserts, etc)
The peace of mind for being guaranteed a minimum of wealth, and the ability
to do what you believe is right. Dwarf Fortress is a unique game started by
someone support by his brother, and it became the inspiration of Minecraft,
which became quite a valuable company. Without years and years of seemingly
unprofitable development, that could not have happened, as Dwarf Fortress
seems to far out to invest in.
I can't even phantom how much better Open Source software would become =)
"Don't bite the hand that feeds" will become very applicable to government.
I think that's a risk. Sometimes the hand of government needs a bite, just
to keep it from fondling too much. I suppose I'm worried popular perception
will move in favor of deep government involvement, also as part of improved
democratic participation and controls, with aspects of economy and personal
life. (ex: why should you own property? If the state owns it and rents it
to people, it's much more manageable! We can make sure all buildings are in
good order, politely force people to move for new construction, ensure
regionally consistent housing, etc)

Tradition, lore, ethnicity, religion, these things fracture markets. A
homogeneous market is easier to sell to, easier to maintain. So too does
democracy create a neat field for the economic game.
It is too offensive to simply do away with these things. More tolerable is
creating meta-culture, culture that must be observed within other culture.
These meta cultures allow people to coexist in a way that's offensive to
everyone, but no so offensive as to cause people to go out-of-bounds.
We've gone and crushed their existing systems. We must now wait for chaos
to consume the resilient. At the same time we must prevent all roads to
order, except that road that leads to maximum economic exploitability; a
privatized free market in a tolerant elections based democratic government.
Aside from making the country impossible to steer, the representative
democratic system is also the most sensitive to (foreign) propaganda, and
still subject to every form of bribery and corruption. I struggle to
envision a system that's more readily exploited.
I do find it peculiar that these places do not readily organize into neat
democracies. I am not the expert of such matters, to me it mostly seems
that people do as they please. Perhaps the children will not struggle quite

they often do. I just love it when they also do makeup; thick eyeshadow,
bronze powered cheeks, vibrant warm lipstick. When they finish up with

of anything else. There's no real point made, except "it's a mess where
NATO went".
Ultimately, I think given the same axioms people should end up making the

correctly, so this is not always true. I can confidently say that men can
maintain a level of composure even when a woman uses a fork, and that most

I think I'd feel a bit less anxious in general, knowing the worst that
could happen is living in good comfort. I think 30k per person is too much
though, 15k is really quite enough (at least in NL). This also to prevent
complete perversion of reward-for-labor.
I think the "digital nomad"-compatible family of jobs will lose their
associated risk (if it doesn't work out, you're still fine) and that will
help them. Jobs that are highly paid will likely still be pretty rewarding,
too. It's the jobs that pay little now that get the serious change in their
economics. Who wants to pick up garbage for almost no money, when you have
enough money?
It is also hard to estimate how many people will prefer entirely useless
work, or a minimal lifestyle. Given a tease more automation that should not
be a problem. But, remember, as automation increases the basic income can
become less; as a certain level of comfort is achieved at a lower price.
This also gives governments some new and interesting incentives.
The gamble sometimes seems to be whether some "successful creative and
risky business" produces more value than "cheap labor". (And, well, what
those lousy-job-people will do when they get a lot of time on their hands!)

This is one possible outcome -- but this is FAR from a revolt.
Just as likely is the outcome where Basic Income cattle is herded into
cheap everything arrangements, where they're offered "fun and fulfilling"
work for non-market pay. These humans will be entirely economically
detached. The overlords will reap their Basic Income, and allow them to
live month by month. (note: this already happens, you walk in a
Hyundai/Samsung build appartment block, where Lotte runs all the
supermarkets, and all the entertainment is provided by CJ, Koreans don't
fear big-corps, so they don't hide it, but I think this is probably true in
many places of the world)
Or, as in the amazing Cloud Atlas, we will create a caste-like society with
"producers", "consumers" and perhaps some other groups ("politicians"?
We may move from 99% to 99.9% puppets. It's just a way to generalize the
population, to silence the masses, to present happiness and freedom to be
guaranteed for all. Without alarm the watchers will turn to sleep, and
under that dark moon the world will change.
Simply put, it solves some problems but not all of them. BI can potentially
worsen the situation.
I think the immediate gain of guaranteed personal freedoms; freedom from
labor, freedom to self-improve, freedom to perform altruism, freedom to
perform art, and yes, even freedom to party, are worth a great deal. Yet,
it will create a future where nobody is willing to revolt, and the state is
in even further reaching control.
It also just upsets my minimal-government-preference somewhat. I just don't
like the idea of people living off of money I earned. It only makes sense
because money is already an abstract and perverted item, and because basic
needs will soon drop much further in their cost. (Especially if cheap
living becomes a greater priority)

I meant this would practically guarantee everyone the funds to be healthy,
choose one's daily activity freely, and for lack of want be happy.
That guarantee seems so sufficient that it's as if there will be no more
injustice due to power imbalance. As if the injustice done by the wealthy
is only because of the existence of the "too poor". I think it will lead to
a greater divergence in wealth. I'm not actually sure if that will be a
problem, but if wealth remains so direct a means for power, well, it very
well could be a problem. (note: democracy is more sensitive to
wealth==power due to the effectiveness of funding popular opinion
campaigns, advertising, new magazines, popular culture inserts, etc)
The peace of mind for being guaranteed a minimum of wealth, and the ability
to do what you believe is right. Dwarf Fortress is a unique game started by
someone support by his brother, and it became the inspiration of Minecraft,
which became quite a valuable company. Without years and years of seemingly
unprofitable development, that could not have happened, as Dwarf Fortress
seems to far out to invest in.
I can't even phantom how much better Open Source software would become =)
"Don't bite the hand that feeds" will become very applicable to government.
I think that's a risk. Sometimes the hand of government needs a bite, just
to keep it from fondling too much. I suppose I'm worried popular perception
will move in favor of deep government involvement, also as part of improved
democratic participation and controls, with aspects of economy and personal
life. (ex: why should you own property? If the state owns it and rents it
to people, it's much more manageable! We can make sure all buildings are in
good order, politely force people to move for new construction, ensure
regionally consistent housing, etc)
We'll see. I like BI as a generalized welfare program, the culture will be
whatever the culture develops into. It could be Star Trek

Reg. US/EU vs CN/RU, CN will overtake economic and thus military capacities

forcing/negotiating a surrender, rather than WW3, on account of our

we should fight if we like democracy and individualistic financial economy,
and that form of "do whatever you want" that we have. That is, if you

pacifist as the west. If you have ever spoken to Chinese, you will know the
latter to be less likely than the former. Of course, the world is banking
on peace - given we are allowing China to advance.
I do hope that China intentionally turns itself pacifist. It would save a
lot of lives, money and time. It's borders are large enough, most would
say. I cannot pretend to know "what China wants", so I cannot really say
how it will behave. My talks with Chinese have shown a pride in their
ignorance of politics. And a government in exclusively self-checked control.
As a side note: I would propose we split the world into countries of equal
population, introducing a GDP based tax to (softly) ease imbalance between
these new nations. It only requires a bye-bye to nationalism. The size of
each nation should be chosen based on evidence of that size being effective
- which sizes of government perform better. The internal structure of a
nation is quite moot. Whatever works. War would be illegal. Natural
resources and permissible pollution should be auctioned on a global market.
We can have a shared (UN?) court for determining things like permissible
pollution and settling lawsuits that are carried all the way up. For
settling disputes between nations, and their adherence to global law.
I'd like to see "timeliness of justice" to exist. I'd like to see the US'
pieces remove it's landmines, and stop it's hollow points etc, and stop
killing it's citizens without due process, and for Israel not to drop white
phosphorous into civil areas, and for Russia not to annex nations, and for
China to stop polluting the planet to beyond critical, for European nations
to make good on their human rights promises regarding immigrants, for
someone, anyone really, to stop ISIS' obvious human rights offenses, etc,
etc, etc.
It should be politics like we're used to. Only we've levelled the players'
fields to make the game better. And stand a chance at forcing good
So, can we achieve this system? Of course not. But would it work? Well, not
trivially, but yes, it would be better than the Pax Americana. Or, I guess,
the peace of those that actually "run" the US. (probably some
association(s?) of people with outrageous capital looking to expand their
circle of capitalism/power to the rest of the world?)
Reg. brainwashing and individual power, I know you want brainwashing to be
responsible, but most likely the brainwashing is generally improving the
situation. People are the problem, not all, but many, and the brainwashing,
through religion, television, smart filtering, is primarily making them
behave in a way that is generally civilised and cooperative. I don't know
what else it does, of course, but without the brainwash people are probably
less nice, not more nice, and individual control is just awful. If only
because less disparity means less friction means less trouble. If you want
to see what anarchy does, basically Detroit. As soon as things start
looking better, it starts looking more like government.

@_subject: [WAR] If Hillary Becomes USA President, 
The way Hillary handled the North/South Korea issues during her term as Sec
of State was simply horrid, leading to the greatest tension in a very very
long time. Basically, showing the US' teeth to a cat in a corner. Just to
see if it really won't back down. It was a moronic policy, and could well
have led to casualties. If she wins and attempts to cause stuff like that
she just might succeed.

We do make sport of improvement plans for the global situation. I feel we
do pretty well, probably on account of tossing history and a lot of feeling
out of the window. More importantly, we ignore the difficulty of reaching
the envisioned state. It is interesting, and could well improve our ideas
of how things should be.
Reg. US/EU vs CN/RU, CN will overtake economic and thus military capacities
well within 20 years. From that moment onward we are subject to Chinese
politics. My guess is they will start with harassment of neighbouring
countries, and just move on from there. Likely eventually
forcing/negotiating a surrender, rather than WW3, on account of our
pacifist intents.
ATM we would win. Perhaps the idiotic US candidates are put forth to
provoke war on our terms. A war we would win - with large casualties. A war
we should fight if we like democracy and individualistic financial economy,
and that form of "do whatever you want" that we have. That is, if you
believe China would actually end up fighting, rather than becoming as
pacifist as the west. If you have ever spoken to Chinese, you will know the
