@_subject: Bitcoin mining efficiency and Botnets 
if you are interested in the economics of it, here you are:
as an example, grab gold mining. claim: the price of gold in the equilibrium state equals to the cost of mining it. proof: if gold is more expensive than the cost of mining, people will invest in opening new gold mines. this, until the total quantity grows, the price falls, and the equilibrium restored. the opposite happens in the reverse case.
not all gold mines operate the same way, some has better technology, some mines are just easier to mine, some companies perform better structurally. therefore the above statement is true "on the margin". the least efficient miner have cost = revenue, thus barely surviving. if gold demand drops, this mine will close. if gold demand rises, one more mine will be opened that is slightly less efficient, and otherwise would generate loss.
the situation is the same with bitcoins, with the twist that mining is made harder or easier adaptively, so the influx is steady. but that does not change the picture: there will be a marginal miner that makes no profit at all. all the other miners will make profit based on how much more efficient they are than the marginal miner. everyone else jumping in the mining business without consideration will realize loss.
it is a false picture that mining always benefits you, albeit only a little. if you are worse than the marginal miner, you are at a net loss, and this follows from the above simple economic rule.

you can make entropy source out of anything that you can access from
your computer. accessing is actually the harder part. you need to find
out how to attach. you need to find out what access interface to use,
how to be cross platform if you want to, how to test it on different
platforms, how to retest if after new releases of said platforms, and
so on. you can run into all sort of driver problems.
another hard-ish part is to estimate the true entropy content. it
might be much smaller than it looks like. understanding the physics of
the underlying phenomenon helps.
once you have your data stream in memory, you just need to use some
whitening. that is the easy part. virtually every cryptographic
primitive can be turned into a secure whitener.
for example, i have implemented a small toy/tool to generate random
data from the noise of the sound card. it is pretty much the same
thing, you just replace the line-in with your data source, and the
whitening part is done. it is for windows only. check it out here:

that is interesting, but does not hurt my tool too much, because my
whitener does chain blocks. i use a keccak sponge that is never
cleared or reset. even if you feed it with all zeros, the output is
indistinguishable from random for a very long time.
certainly, but such tools have their purpose. for example a online
lotteries might want to have high throughput random number generator.
if you really feed some visual noise to a camera, the entropy
production can even be multiple megabytes per second. it dwarfs any
randomness harnessed from a regular desktop.
