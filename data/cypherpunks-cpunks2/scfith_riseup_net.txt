Quantum entanglement is real. Sounds like you have some reading to do. ;) basically once particles are associated they can communicate / stay in sync regardless of distance. Amazing stuff.

I believe our understanding of info transfer needs to change. The data is not traveling anywhere because it appears to exist simultaneously here & there and when one changes the other does without delay. There has to be another dimension of energy / ether we need to discover that would make this make sense. Like looking into a fish pond but the fish don't see surface, only your hand dipping in water as a miraculous occurrence.

Come on now. Same five or six people posting stupid shit full of vitriol. At least in the month I've been on it. Ready to check out myself. I'd rather shut up & code. Bye all. FINGERPRINT: 97CD 1B42 2333 54EF 75C2 731C C71C BC5C 57D3 A771
