@_subject: Red Pike cipher 
Le limited information available on the Red Pike cipher are quite
consistent with the code below: an ARX block cipher, no look-up
tables, virtually no key schedule, and requiring only few lines of
code [1].
With a 64 bit key size the Alleged Red Pike (ARP) is insecure by
modern standards. But it was possibly insecure also in the 1990s.
ARP suffers from a large number of semi-weak keys. Actually, each key
is a semi-weak key. A pair of ARP keys (K1, K2) is said to be
semi-weak if E_K1(E_K2(M)) = M (i.e., encryption with K1 operates as
does decryption with K2). With ARP Feistel structure and its key
schedule,there are 2^63 such pairs, reducing the size of the key space
to 2^63.
The relationship between each semi-weak pairs is:
  K2_L = K1_R - 2^32/phi * 17
  K2_R = K1_L + 2^32/phi * 17
where phi is the golden ratio.
Being semi-weak keys a large fraction of the ARP key space,
implementations cannot apply the standard countermeasures against this
undesirable property. Picking a semi-weak key is inevitable.
The question remains: Is the Alleged Red Pike the cipher designed by the GCHQ?
