 While yes true that most politicians suck. Why all the hate for Trump? He is pro American, pro constitution, pro 2nd amendment, pro border security. Will protect the USA from the invasion Europe is facing, we Americans dont want to go the route of Europe such as France and germany where their society is infected with jihadists that are attacking people, raping women, trashing the cities, defacating in the streets and shooting/blowing people up. France and Germany is a hell hole with defenseless population.
All complaints I have seen people say about Trump are that he is racists or against gays. Such claims are utter lies.

1. I wonder what effects this will have on encryption. Since encryption cannot be "decrypted on demand" if it is good encryption, this means that likely true encryption will be banned in UK?
2. And what are the details on allowing hacking, does this mean that spooks can lawfully bulk hack anyone/everything?
And for those whom say "this does not affect me, I do not live in UK", yes this does affect everyone. Alot of your internet traffic gets routed all over the world including UK before reaching destination. Any data captured by UK on you can be shared with your government without probable cause or suspicion of crime. This is done through intel sharing agreements within spy alliances such as FVEY.
For security concerns I propose we boycott all and any technology, products, services, or businesses based in UK that complies with "the law" and has anything to do with technology or communications out of security concerns.
What government is doing here is fragmenting society and industry by making the "legal white economy" incompetent, weak, and insecure through excessive intervention and laws that are not compatible with modern times. While any company that wants to succeed and keep their data and operations secure will have to resort to the free market system "black economy" since government made rules are incompatible with modern era of technology.
Then the free market will thrive as the "white economy" based businesses will rightfully suffer as a result of compliance.

This is a fun read. And such entertaining countermeasures, which were necessary. Great job Peter.
What I find interesting is this
"Single Point of Failure
As of writing, I’m not aware of any efforts to independently audit the deterministic build process used to create the compute node DVDs that every participant in the trusted setup used. This means there’s a massive single point of failure in the whole process that completely undermines the value of the multi-party computation.
Until the software and deterministic builds are audited, the entire ceremony is a bunch of crypto hocus pocus that means nothing."
"Backdoored Software
As mentioned above, the software used by every compute node was identical and thus a single point of failure that could be backdoored; I actually raised this as a issue publicly with Zooko a few weeks prior to the ceremony on Twitter."
I agree that if everyone used a pre-supplied image given to them for this crypto witchcraft ceremony then it truly is a concern if that software is unaudited from single centralized source.
What exactly was this software image and its source? It would be entertaining to have copy of one of those DVDs or image .iso so it can collectively be audited. Even then how would such DVD be audited fully if it is already pre-compiled?
While I like the idea of zcash, it is concerning having central point of failure like this if it is such. I support idea of privacy for crypto currencies. Right now I believe best way to do that is through privacy layers on top of bitcoin. Bitcoin excels in transparency without need to trust central point.

@_subject: Alex Jones Infowars Censored Off Social Media 
Hash: SHA512
There is no monarchy, I understand you are probably trying to be humorous. But for those whom do not know, Trump was elected.
As for the recent censorship in the USA. It is the same media that
is waging war against Trump, that is also silencing InfoWars.And
Trump is really not a bad evil person like the controlled
mainstream American media is trying to frame him up as. The
controlled propaganda machine is trying to falsely make it seem
that most Americans are anti-Trump (not true), and that Trump
is racist or a Russian spy, or a horrible person (none of which
are true either). They are trying to use the mainstream media,
and manipulating social media (through suppression of speech by
banning or shadow banning) into turning millenials against Trump and
the people whom voted for him. And this same propaganda machine
wants to silence anyone they also disagree with or dislike.
America is so divided right now, and is split between two groups
of people at the moment. This terminology that describes these two
sides might have different definitions in other regions and times,
but here in 2018 in the USA, the descriptions are as follows.
The kind of ideologies that originally built this
nation as reflected in the constitution. That of individual
liberties, free-market system, confined government kept within
due bounds. Most conservatives seem to also be religious and
have a system of moral code (as in non-secular) not reliant on
government. Non secular (by choice) societies are often better
self-governed and self reliant without big government, because
they strive to live by moral codes. This is another reason why
alot of the people whom layed the foundation of the USA were also
reverent people. Hence the motto "In God We Trust".
The other side is the Socialist side:
They often refer to themsevles as "liberal" or "the left", but not liberal as in more individual freedom, but more liberal as in secular.
Liberal as in liberty from moral code. They place their trust more-so in government
than in God. As a result they cannot self govern like religious or
conservative side. The socialist left secular side wants government
to take care of them often at the expense of individual liberty
and at the cost of bigger government. This is also why most people
on this side are also anti 2nd amendment (in the USA this means
the individual right to keep and bear arms for self defense from
criminals both in society and in government), they want less power
for the individual and more power in the government. A socialist
type government can not be successful if it is opt-in, and if the
governed have more power than the government. A socialist type government
seems to also always lead to a larger government with less individual freedoms.
It is this side that is also really angry that their candidate Hillary Clinton
did not win the elections, so they want to delegitimize Trumps
administration (and conservatives) as much as possible.  Its part of
the socialist infiltration of the USA, is the suppression of freedom
of speech and the spreading of misinformation of their opposition.
I am against censorship. Yeah, without censorship you have the risk
of lies. But with censorship, you have the even greater risk of
truth being suppressed, and with lies or misleading information,
or only partial truths, being propagated by the one doing the
censoring. The best solution is to have no censorship and let all
information be tested by the reader or consumer of such media. If
all sides have equal say, the truth shall stand strong in the
midst of challenge. If something be truth, it shall stand. If
something be not truth, it shall fall to truth.
THUS CENSORING ONLY BENEFITS LIES.
Alot of governments censor information because they fear the truth,
the truth is against such governments.
Even if Alex Jones or Infowars is wrong, or propagates information
that some find disagreeable, censorship is not the way. Censorship
is very dangerous and creates a system that can very very easily
be abused. When something cannot win through challenge, it can
only win by suppression of opposing views and information.
It is really concerning when censorship is becoming a reality in
the USA. Even in the UK with the government mandated information
black out on a certain journalist earlier this year. Or when people
are persecuted by their government for voicing their opinion or saying
the wrong things by calling all and any opposing views as "hate speech"
when it isn't.
End the censorship now. Please recogonzie the dangerous world we are entering
for allowing censorship.

Centralized governments will soon be a thing of the past. Once the majority of the economy shifts to decentralized systems including crypto-currency, those governments will be unable to continue control over the economy and collect taxes used to oppress the governed. It is unethical to voluntarily pay any taxes to the USA federal government for so long as they are infringing on our constitutional rights, primarily the 1st, 2nd, and 4th amendment.
I do applaud Defense Distributed for everything they are doing. But we all must realize that you cannot change corrupt systems in their own games. The better way is to build new systems that make the former systems powerless and irrelevant.

The 2nd amendment was created before fighter jets and missiles were invented. If there ever was a fight against an entity that was armed with jets and missiles, then hopefully the state militias whom report to the state governor would side with the people. Doesn't each state have its own military? I know that at least mine does. And alot of the people in the national guard are also patriots.
Even if a puny glorified slingshot (that is all a gun is, a glorified slingshot that throws lead really fast) cannot by itself protect against an army of drones armed with lasers, at least people still have their firearms to protect from radical terrorists, wacko mass murderers, robbers, and other criminals. 3D printable guns insure the liberty of people to preserve life and to defend themselves, especially in regions where governments do not let civillians own guns yet at the same time those same governments do nothing to protect the people.
Just look at UK, where radical islamists just mow down people with machine guns, plow them over with trucks, women can't walk the streets at night without risk of getting raped or robbed, the government prevents them from being able to defend themselves yet does not do anything to protect them. Now with 3D printable guns people anywhere in the world can produce a pistol to defend themselves from criminals.
And yes, the 2nd amendment was intended to be a defender of liberty.

There is no monarchy, I understand you are probably trying to be humorous. But for those whom do not know, Trump was elected.
As for the recent censorship in the USA. It is the same media that
is waging war against Trump, that is also silencing InfoWars.And
Trump is really not a bad evil person like the controlled
mainstream American media is trying to frame him up as. The
controlled propaganda machine is trying to falsely make it seem
that most Americans are anti-Trump (not true), and that Trump
is racist or a Russian spy, or a horrible person (none of which
are true either). They are trying to use the mainstream media,
and manipulating social media (through suppression of speech by
banning or shadow banning) into turning millenials against Trump and
the people whom voted for him. And this same propaganda machine
wants to silence anyone they also disagree with or dislike.
America is so divided right now, and is split between two groups
of people at the moment. This terminology that describes these two
sides might have different definitions in other regions and times,
but here in 2018 in the USA, the descriptions are as follows.
The kind of ideologies that originally built this
nation as reflected in the constitution. That of individual
liberties, free-market system, confined government kept within
due bounds. Most conservatives seem to also be religious and
have a system of moral code (as in non-secular) not reliant on
government. Non secular (by choice) societies are often better
self-governed and self reliant without big government, because
they strive to live by moral codes. This is another reason why
alot of the people whom layed the foundation of the USA were also
reverent people. Hence the motto "In God We Trust".
The other side is the Socialist side:
They often refer to themsevles as "liberal" or "the left", but not liberal as in more individual freedom, but more liberal as in secular.
Liberal as in liberty from moral code. They place their trust more-so in government
than in God. As a result they cannot self govern like religious or
conservative side. The socialist left secular side wants government
to take care of them often at the expense of individual liberty
and at the cost of bigger government. This is also why most people
on this side are also anti 2nd amendment (in the USA this means
the individual right to keep and bear arms for self defense from
criminals both in society and in government), they want less power
for the individual and more power in the government. A socialist
type government can not be successful if it is opt-in, and if the
governed have more power than the government. A socialist type government
seems to also always lead to a larger government with less individual freedoms.
It is this side that is also really angry that their candidate Hillary Clinton
did not win the elections, so they want to delegitimize Trumps
administration (and conservatives) as much as possible.  Its part of
the socialist infiltration of the USA, is the suppression of freedom
of speech and the spreading of misinformation of their opposition.
I am against censorship. Yeah, without censorship you have the risk
of lies. But with censorship, you have the even greater risk of
truth being suppressed, and with lies or misleading information,
or only partial truths, being propagated by the one doing the
censoring. The best solution is to have no censorship and let all
information be tested by the reader or consumer of such media. If
all sides have equal say, the truth shall stand strong in the
midst of challenge. If something be truth, it shall stand. If
something be not truth, it shall fall to truth.
THUS CENSORING ONLY BENEFITS LIES.
Alot of governments censor information because they fear the truth,
the truth is against such governments.
Even if Alex Jones or Infowars is wrong, or propagates information
that some find disagreeable, censorship is not the way. Censorship
is very dangerous and creates a system that can very very easily
be abused. When something cannot win through challenge, it can
only win by suppression of opposing views and information.
It is really concerning when censorship is becoming a reality in
the USA. Even in the UK with the government mandated information
black out on a certain journalist earlier this year. Or when people
are persecuted by their government for voicing their opinion or saying
the wrong things by calling all and any opposing views as "hate speech"
when it isn't.
End the censorship now. Please recogonzie the dangerous world we are entering
for allowing censorship.

Centralized governments will soon be a thing of the past. Once the majority of the economy shifts to decentralized systems including crypto-currency, those governments will be unable to continue control over the economy and collect taxes used to oppress the governed. It is unethical to voluntarily pay any taxes to the USA federal government for so long as they are infringing on our constitutional rights, primarily the 1st, 2nd, and 4th amendment.
I do applaud Defense Distributed for everything they are doing. But we all must realize that you cannot change corrupt systems in their own games. The better way is to build new systems that make the former systems powerless and irrelevant.

For spreading illegal information.
Oops. You're behind the Blue Wall

Sorry, little lamb."
Is a funny page of what users in 20 states and the majority of the world are presented with when trying to get the DEFCAD files.
What is funny though, is that I will openly distribute all of the defcad files to everyone regardless of law. I am not
afraid of any court order or any enforcement attempt. And to any prosecutors or judges, your efforts are a waste.
I am a criminal. My crime, exercising my freedom of speech and taking a stand against censorship.
Thousands of people will upload these files into the public domain. Information cannot be stopped. I am calling on everyone whom ordered these files to upload them into the public domain and
compare the hashes with each other for decentralized distributed integrity verification.

The 2nd amendment was created before fighter jets and missiles were invented. If there ever was a fight against an entity that was armed with jets and missiles, then hopefully the state militias whom report to the state governor would side with the people. Doesn't each state have its own military? I know that at least mine does. And alot of the people in the national guard are also patriots.
