agency, divorce attorney, corporate trial lawyer and government

with various grades of good and bad stories about why they need Apple to
break into Filevault2 partitions demanding help (often for much less
than it costs Apple to provide it and handle the legal costs to validate
the reasons for and authority of the requester to break in) that they
would not wish to share the fact that there is a deliberate backdoor
mechanism to break in or even a known bug that would allow it.
announced backdoor could ever be kept secret and reserved for Apple
alone as it would become an instant target for every hacker and spy and
corporate espionage type to reverse engineer... or steal from inside
national security along with blackmail type arm twisting from certain
governments, I'd not be sure they would not provide help or have not
been forced to design things so they can.   Only a few folks at Apple
probably know the real truth about this... one way or the other.
