@_subject: Info on using Linux operation system? 
In answer to the question in Exchange Issue  WonderPaint gave a pretty darn good explanation of what is going on in windows.  He suggests Linux.  My question is can the current software on my machine use Linux if I were to switch to that OS and if not, how much software is available for Linux.  Seems all I find is for windows and some for the mac.  Thanks.
