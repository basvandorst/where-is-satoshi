I have noticed CloudFlare CAPTCHA screens before I can access some sites via Tor. This begs the question of how much data is CloudFlare gathering from Tor exit nodes and who are they selling it to? Due to links with the US Intelligence community and possibly receiving NSLs, they are in a great position to provide information about what people use Tor for. Perhaps thwarting spammers is a great cover for keeping track of traffic to and from alleged terrorist IPs/Net blocks. Since they also help mitigate DDoS attacks, they can also keep track of alleged Anonymous pwned hosts used for originating DDoS campaigns. They are a great “in the trenches” company that can be very versatile for keeping track of the Bad Guys(tm).
Thank you,

Now that is something I would help crowd fund, the paying of the dude’s contempt of court fines. Who cares about kickstarting some groups game, or help bring a cellphone activated door lock to market. I would rather kick some cash to the guy who did as much as he could to keep his clients data “safe”, even when threatened by three letter agencies. Thats some balls in my book.

Yes. People keep claiming that it is just too hard to encrypt email. There are plugins for all platforms. If you can’t send encrypted email, sending email in the first place is probably too difficult, just txt everyone on your fone. The smartfone has made for such stupid people that if it can’t be done in just a few keystrokes (content included) then it is too hard or tl;dr.
Remember the old days when there wasn’t PPP and SLIP connections? Before broadband. When a conversation on IRC was enjoyable, the right amounts of humor and actual thought? And you knew not to ask for help in  on efnet.
No, everyone can afford a smartfone now a days.
Life is full of levels of grey, and so is security. That password you use on new sites you don’t trust vs your gpg/pgp passphrase. The sheeple don’t have levels of grey with regards to security, either take it to their grave or everyone can see.
Chatting with someone who was looking to start his own desktop Linux distro. I suggested an encrypted messaging platform over the security-hole-riddled platform he was using and he told me he had nothing to hide. I told him he wasn’t the kind of person who should be developing anything security related.
Security takes effort that people are not will to expend.

Started running a Tor relay node yesterday and found myself on the DAN TOR DNS Blacklist.

I am running a relay only node, so the issues with an exit node shouldn’t get me. It looks like this list pulled the server via the Nickname field in the Tor config.

I do it to let the people I am communicating with through plaintext email know that I am setup and configured to handle encrypted communications. All they need to do is pull my pub key off of a key server and then our communications are encrypted from that point forward.
The prevention of being impersonated is also one reason, along with a way to secretly signal to the recipient that I am under duress and my words may not be my own.
Course that all goes out the window when emailing from my cellphone. That ain’t no way I want my private key on my cellphone.

Instead of Zuckerburg calling Obama to complain, how about blocking all federal government IPs for 24 hours? Even better, how about Google? Just call it an “outage” due to having to spend extra time on encrypting all of their traffic between data centers.
DNSBL for known intelligence community IPs? Sure they rotate a lot, but if we can make the cost of doing business higher and higher with no real benefit, someone should eventually cut the funding. Start tracking what companies are providing IP services via contract and then blacklist the IP blocks of those companies. I really don’t care if I ever get an email from Stratfor or they ever visit any of my sites. Had the idea all of about 60 seconds before trying to write it down, so I am sure I am forgetting something (or somethings).

The old argument for convincing people to use crypto when they “have nothing to hide” was the postal analogy. Do you send your snail mail in an envelope? If you have nothing to hide why not use postcards? The idea is that if you are sending everything encrypted, when you do have something to hide it doesn’t stand out. Now people use envelopes for privacy and out of convention. If everyone did the same thing with crypto,used it for privacy and out of convention, intelligence agencies wouldn’t be able flag suspicious communications easily.

If the traffic is garbage (NSA fake social media accounts, intrusion attempts) what is the difference from stopping spam or bonnet traffic? Is some intel operative’s traffic wanted anymore than the 419 spam from kids from a 3rd world country in a cyber cafe? I guess I don’t see this as censorship since I am blocking due to the type of traffic, not what is being said. There are already some programs that block traffic to and from known malware sites, who cares if the malware comes from the NSA or Ethiopia’s Information Network Security Agency?
