The German workers, Bornstadt, Marx, Engels – especially Marx – poison the atmosphere. Vanity, malevolence, gossip, pretentiousness and boasting in theory and cowardice in practice. Dissertations about life, action, and feeling – and complete absence of life, action, and feeling – and complete absence of life. 
Disgusting flattery of the more advanced workers – and empty talk. According to them, Feuerbach is a “bourgeois,” and the epithet BOURGEOIS! is shouted ad nauseam by people who are from head to foot more bourgeois than anyone in a provincial city – in short, foolishness and lies, lies and foolishness.

When Trump tries to give a speech invoking the glories of the American military past, he can't get his parade permits and winds up ranting dementedly about how the Continental Army defeated the RAF by occupying the airports during the Revolution.

Following a relatively recent line of thought from Wheeler to H. Pagels and S. Lloyd our own unique universe increasingly resembles a quantum internet with associated crypto-anarchy.
Since 2015 - with help from E. Verlinde and others - I've begun trying to imagine PKI as a metaphor.
This would involve the ' Crypto Turn ' in cosmology I spoke about on my return here.
Dr Charles Rhodes might have beat me to it with his papers from 2003 and 2010, 2012.
If the universe is more like public key encryption than anything else then so called dark-matter and dark-energy could be related to lost key-halves.
Quantum cryptanalysis is oxymoronic and an impossible science. Nevertheless, using all the mathematical tools available to us we may still discover the long sought bridge between the very large and the very small and how to live better in an anarchist universe.
The search for some sort of ' Ansible ' device is even a good excuse to go barging around this galaxy in search of a friendly alien intelligence that might help. To boldly go in a non-Elon-Musk sort of way that we can rationalize and not spark instant hostility.

What do you think of the following?
Agonism (from Greek ἀγών agon, "struggle") is a political theory that emphasizes the potentially positive aspects of certain (but not all) forms of political conflict. It accepts a permanent place for such conflict and seeks to show how people might accept and channel this " office politics " positively.
Basically, we can resolve all outstanding questions peacefully, but we should allow for a 'dislike ' button first.  We can resolve everything because there are valuable things that are more powerful than any religion &/or nation-state.  These things will be shared with common people even faster as the strong AI arrives.

Nazi-Fag-Morons kill each other all the time over treacherous things like a staunch kamaraden suddenly falling for a pentagon-style-technofascist of Jewish background; like Jacob Appelbaum, for example.

In my blogging over the years I also prepped a " some of my best friends are Jews " post-script since I was attacking Marx and Freud so much. And one time I was stuck with some morons trying to incite some murderous hatefilled bigotry and I asked them if it applied to Dylan.

Mass rollout of experimental mRNA vaccines developed in record-time, with unforeseen long-term consequences and with big pharma companies claiming exemption from all liability, as usual.

These will be necessary to get work, rent an apartment, go to school, buy food, move from state to state, province to province, etc. What's more is that it won't be, "one and done". You will be mandated, on pain of state violence, to line up for "covid shots" every 3 - 4 months. Covid will never go away. Temperature scanning will pave the way for biometric retinal scanning, all under the auspices of contact tracing and public safety.
Further on down the road, cash will be phased out, because, it will be argued, it is a vector of transmission for the virus. Financial privacy will end. Private ownership of vehicles will end. Autonomous drones and cars will patrol the streets and skies. Pretty much every facet of social life will go virtual. Technological innovations like Neuralink will eventually colonize every aspect of daily life and become de facto mandatory much in the same way that cell phones have colonized society and changed it in such a way as to become de facto mandatory.

As measles outbreaks spread across the U.S., our new look at how information about vaccine safety and reliability spreads online suggests that the tide may be turning against the anti-vaccination movement.
Between Jan. 1 and March 28, 387 people contracted measles in 15 U.S. states. Mumps is also coming back, with 151 infections in just the first two months of 2019. Both of these dangerous and deadly diseases can be prevented by getting the MMR vaccine, which is so safe and effective, and so widely used, that measles was declared eliminated from the U.S. in 2000. But more recently, new outbreaks have struck areas with large pockets of unvaccinated people.

professor rat - 2 minutes ago 
Anarcho-anarchist cypherpunk, Matt Taylor, see’s no end to the exploding cryptoanarchy, after anticipating its main features in 2001.
In 2010 he began demanding the USG surrender power to the web. In 2014 he made a strategic investment in Btc, then, the following year, theorized " Split-key-cosmology “using PKI as a powerful metaphor for the entire universe. Taylor is now working at ramping-up cryptoanarchy in order to approach " Cypherpunk 2027” at full warp. Feel the power - live the dream. Beyond is anything.
Above is predicated on earlier c-punks promulgating ' cyber liberty ' more than anything recognizably anarchist. The difference between a Randite-Paultard Moron like Mongo and an anarchist revolutionary like Jim Bell. 
But I could change ' anticipating ' to firmly restating, if youse like. As Jim just showed us there is no privileged frame of reference from which to judge reality.

The so-called " American Century " barely lasted till 2005 when Normies finally outnumbered Merkins online for the first time.  Cryptoanarchy also took a giant step forward in 2003 when the pentagon effectively endorsed APster and Charles K. Rhodes began applying cryptographic methods to cosmology. 
The one-two punch of Wikileaks and Btc then prompted the first call for the USG to surrender to the internet. This was made in 2010 and repeated every year since - with some extra onerous conditions placed in the last few years.
Btc's breakthroughs in 2017 and this year provide yet more evidence that cryptoanarchy is taking over from the US as a sole hyperpower and fascist scum like Pooter and Xi Jinping have been placed on death-lists. There is no other alternative to the present Wilsonian world order.
Anarchism fits the web. Anarchism works. Anarchism has a profound and important back-story as well as its compelling forward narrative thrust. Technological determinism and even quantum-mechanics keep reaffirming and vindicating anarchism. The future keeps happening and quantum computing virtually guarantees it will be cryptoanarchist.

Mong chose ' anarchy ' over ' liberty ' and that is enough to be going on with.

If by ' quantum jumps ' they mean wave-function-collapse then that used to be taught as a metaphor in early 70's vintage Physics textbooks before being described as a real phenomenon a couple of decades later.

Btw, Heinz Pagels has a description of the measurement problem in his 1980's book, " Cosmic code ". Charles K.

COINTELPRO in a broad sense might be justified against those BLM'ers that identify as Marxist since Marxists can't practice ' Need-to-know '  security culture to save their own worthless ' Don't ask - don't tell ' lives.
Its only been sporadically successful against Antifa with that Bridge destruction plot as one example.  The net is a boon to anarchist organizing for those with a certain amount of nous - explains Louis Beam as well. 
Category error to try and attribute BLM and Antifa to Deep State since you never assert conspiracies when stupidity will cover it. October surprise laptop just another tedious exercise in Lol-Gop  ratfucking. Republican party COINTELPRO against Dumpocraps may have peaked with the Brooks Bros riot since they haven't had any great successes since.

Time and time again we see the authorities fail to protect people from anti-social crime enabled by the net. Maybe this particular target deserved some rough justice however my general point remains an obvious glaring fault with our present imperfectly networked circumstances.
The obvious way to minimize net and crypto assisted violence is weaponized prediction markets such as popularized by Robin Hanson for the pentagon and our own APster killer app as designed by Jim Bell.  Perhaps a merger between Augur and the Jim Bell project will cut down on most of these bushwackers running wild out there.
Certainly making a horrible example out of the likes of Assmange, Ulbricht and Hammond couldn't hurt.  Kill three - scare three thousand. Yes Virginia, there is law West of the Pecos.

I bring good tidings about the spread of cryptoanarchy to the edges of the known universe and even Australia. Professor Charles K. Rhodes, a most well-qualified and distinguished senior physics professional, has published several papers every cypherpunk revolutionist ( all three of us ) will want to know about. Search on his name and the dates 2003, 2010 and 2012. I guarantee you won’t be disappointed.
Now 2021 marks my 20th anniversary here so I may resume some semi-blogging here this time next year. Unless youse have something I should know about. Like jamesd was accidently pushed under a bus. Something like that. Check out " Blockchain code" and " crypto-anarchy game’ on Amazon for a cheap laugh at the Nazbol imbeciles expense. Best wishes to JDB and CJ. We finally pulled through. I knew we could do it.
Congrats to all the warriors. Youse were righteous.

Now what I find most significant about these three papers is the specifically cryptographic approach. Your mileage may vary.
Maybe Jim, or fellow cypherpunk revolutionists can drill down with ' Professor Google "  and find some earlier examples using crypto to probe quantum-physics &/or cosmology.
Its would be a huge boost for cryptoanarchy were the TOE ( or GUT - grand unified theory ) be discovered to be based on what looks more and more ( Sear " Wheeler, H. Pagels, S. Lloyd " ) like a public-key-encryption universe.  No string theory below us - above us only ...anything!

Frank Braun, a privacy extremist and a Paralelni Polis old-timer, explains the differences between the philosophies. “The cypherpunk movement is about using technology to provide more privacy and anonymise interactions; and anarchy pushes for personal freedom with minimal or no interference from the state. Cryptoanarchy simply brings those two together.”
This is fine up to 1996 - after that it limits our degrees of freedom.  Cypherpunk revolutionaries fight for 
cryptoanarchism where ' crypto' and ' anarchy' are increasingly seen as just ' anarchism ' in its latest
and greatest incarnation since 1936.  Its not just technology now either - recent advances in physics and cosmology
strongly indicate a crypto-anarchist universe ( Wheeler - Lloyd - CK Rhodes ) and ' anarchy ' can't be read so 
narrowly for us. After all, Bakunin said, " Freedom without anarchism is privilege and injustice "
We also don't accept the continued existence of any state ( or theocracy ) Frank Braun and his ilk might be
just talking about tax-dodgers playing silly word games devoid of meaning just to pass the time.

I have heard two OG C-punks criticize Btc for its lack of privacy but one of them is dead now. 
Anyway, I think we can do better as cryptoanarchist revolutionaries.  A few years ago I began design 
work for a billion-node blockchain, each ' secure node' ( Chaumian term - yuk! ) containing 512 members.
Proof-of-life required to receive ' new coins' provided by a digitally signed and blinded release stating
recipient accepted the new APster justice system.  Individual nodes could be as " Brin' transparent or Dark as 
members want, so long as they observe Metcalfes and don't over-stress the network. Note how nodes can
be regularly halved. This can occur by consensus as quantum computing drives power to the node.
As for economics, I envisage starting with 5k value per year with rate loosely pegged to global GDP.
APster will provide estate-tax ( death tax ) backing and the scheme will bootstrap off global spending boost.
Btc is great - but its like Wittgenstein's ladder - we will have to kick it away at some stage.
And as cypherpunk anarchists we're now called on to take things to the next level. Viva la revolution.

EVERY major call to crusade gave rise to pogroms against Jews. According to Augustine …
“ ...Judaism, since Christ, is a corruption; indeed, Judas is the image of the Jewish people: their understanding of Scripture is carnal; they bear the guilt for the death of the Savior, for through their fathers they have killed Christ...”
". .. they had also turned to scholars for justification of Christian violence and Gregory Vll had found in Anselm of Lucca, a partisan who, through a careful reading of the Fathers, above all Augustine of Hippo, would build a convincing case for Christian violence as something that could be commanded by God, was at the command of the Church and would, when properly used, be an expression of Christian love... ”
( The Crusades by Jonathan Smith )
STASI Punk Lukács accepted STASI Punk Kun’s arguments on the necessity for revolutionary violence, saying later:
" ... we Communists are like Judas. It is our bloody work to crucify Christ. But this sinful work is at the same time our calling: only through death on the cross does Christ become God, and this is necessary to be able to save the world. We Communists then take the sins of the world upon us, in order to be able thereby to save the world ..."

If you read the unauthorized biography you'll see Mange was clearly warned 
about the Swedish legal system.  Previously, John Young warned him off as early 
as 2007.  I warned him not to go to the NY Times ( after Michael-Gordon & Judith 
Millers shitshow of the early noughties ) 
In October 2016 the embassy cut his internet service after WikiLeaks published a trove of damaging emails from then U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Ecuador’s leftist government said the move violated its traditional respect for other nations’ sovereignty.
Shortly after taking office, Moreno dismissed Assange as a “hacker” and said hacking is an activity “I personally reject.” 
Assange responded by saying that Moreno had slandered him as a hacker.
Apr. 2017. Ecuador's President-elect Lenin Moreno warned Julian Assange not to meddle in the country's politics
NEWS story from MAY 10 - 2017. New President Lenin Moreno. 
"We will maintain his [Assange's] political refugee status, but always reminding him that such condition does not allow him to engage in politics, neither in our country, nor in neighboring nations..."
NEWS story from  May 26, 2017 - Moreno -- speaking at a ceremony at Cochasqui archeological site in the northern Andes Thursday -- "respectfully" asked the Australian "not to interfere in Ecuadorian politics, nor in the politics of its allies."
"His status does not allow him to talk about the politics of any country, let alone ours," he said.
NEWS story from Sept. 30, 2017. Moreno has told two international television networks in the past week that Assange should watch his tongue and not harm Ecuador’s relations with its allies.
NEWS story from Nov. 22, 2017. Ecuador Govt statement. Assange has an “...obligation to not make declarations or carry out activities that could affect Ecuador’s international relations, which should be preserved, as in the case of Spain, a country it is united with by historical and cultural ties, as well as links of mutual respect, friendship between its peoples and bilateral cooperation...” 
Nov 22 - 2017. Its being reported today that Assange “has formally committed to observe behavior that is compatible with the will of the Ecuadorian state.” 
NEWS story dated Dec 17, 2017. Ecuador has warned WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange not to interfere in Catalonia's separatist crisis, Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno said in an interview published Sunday. "We have reminded Mr Assange that he has no reason to interfere in Ecuadorian politics because his status does not allow it. Nor in that of nations that are our friends. He does not have the right to do so and he has committed himself to this."

revealing of the Rapist's mindset. Similar to " More ports than a Norwegian crack whore " and as RH
dates from the 90's its the same decade he was working for the Victorian state police and 
sympathetic to the blackshirt " Mens Rights ' gang.  The first ' Leaks ' he was interested in 
was related to tracking down his first wife and harassing her. 
Rubberhose was one of those great c-punk ideas, like HavenCo, that bombed, but were probably 
just premature.  There is a tide in the affairs of all - contra jamesd - that, taken at the flood - or when Btc 
is in the hundreds - leads on to good fortune. Mange was faithful to Mongo's Crypto Winter and so omitted 
the opportunity to run a chainsaw through the Bush-Cheney maladministration.  By the time he got off his 
pasty, white ass it was all over. The net had won ( by 2005! ) and he was just another carpetbagger.

Crying and with compassion, she began to think about the foreskin of Christ, where it may be located [after the Resurrection]. 
And behold, soon she felt with the greatest sweetness on her tongue a little piece of skin alike the skin in an egg, which she swallowed. 
After she had swallowed it, she again felt the little skin on her tongue with sweetness as before, and again she swallowed it. 
And this happened to her about a hundred times. And when she felt it so frequently, she was tempted to touch it with her finger. 
And when she wanted to do so, that little skin went down her throat on its own. 
And it was told to her that the foreskin was resurrected with the Lord on the day of resurrection. 
And so great was the sweetness of tasting that little skin that she felt in all [her] limbs and parts of the limbs a sweet transformation.

So far assassination politics has been mentioned at legal proceedings involving Jim Bell, Carl Johnson and myself.
Proof of concept for APster considered as radical civil-disobedience and also global dissent. I reside in Au.
This approach continued to be tested alongside the slow and steady progress of " Stiffs " dotcom till the

By 2005 it seemed the LEO's were not going to prosecute any more punks for APster.

Then the US Secret Service moved from ' investigating ' all threats against all ' protected persons ' ( Snerk! )
to ' assessing " all threats. Soon after that I started making my regular demands - from 2009 on - for the USG ( and NSA obviously ) to surrender.
Free all Drug War prisoners, reconstitute PAM and let that handle the transition to net rule.  Then - since 1917-8
I added another humiliating condition. They have to mention ' APster' in the announcements.

Most if not all of those 'ideas' take anonimity for granted. Problem is, you need to overthrow govcorp first in order to get anonimity. Most, if not all the commentary on AP doesn't mention Part 10.  There is a ' Black Box " AP system and a ' Public' or ' Soft Drill ' ( Open source , crowdsource, etc ) system or hybrid in Jims original vision. 
I am platform agnostic on how this is implemented and hoped Carl's " Dead Lucky ' and Sanjuro's ' Dead Drop 'would have caught on. Certainly ' Stiffs ' just keeps chugging away even if apolitically ' Just the death certificates, M'am ".
There is certainly something to overthrowing the govt first. But we have that covered with the deadpool on the POTUS running every year for the last 23 years. " Collapse of govts ' is a well known part of crypto-anarchy - and anarchism itself going back to 1847!

The original cypherpunk mailing list, and the first list spin-off, coderpunks, were originally hosted on John Gilmore's toad.com, but after a falling out with the sysop over moderation, the list was migrated to several cross-linked mail-servers in what was called the "distributed mailing list."[15][16] The coderpunks list, open by invitation only, existed for a time. Coderpunks took up more technical matters and had less discussion of public policy implications. There are several lists today that can trace their lineage directly to the original Cypherpunks list: the cryptography list (cryptography at metzdowd.com), the financial cryptography list (fc-announce at ifca.ai), and a small group of closed (invitation-only) lists as well.

To some extent, the cryptography list[18] acts as a successor to cypherpunks; it has many of the people and continues some of the same discussions. However, it is a moderated list, considerably less zany and somewhat more technical

Its encouraging there is increasing interest in linking historical anarchism ( 1840s vintage ) with crypto-anarchy.

But, overall, a rising anarchist tide lifts all anarchist boats. 
1848 -  Bakunin was deported to Belgium. But little more than two months afterward he returned, as the Citizen King fled in the opposite direction from the February Revolution. Bakunin walked over the border and reached Paris as soon as the disrupted railway system would allow him. He lodged among the working-class National Guard who occupied the barracks in the rue Tournon, and spent his days and a large part of his nights in a fever of excitement and activity.
I breathed through all my senses and through all my pores the intoxication of the revolutionary atmosphere [he recollected later in the forced tranquillity of a prison cell]. It was a holiday without beginning and without end. I saw everyone and I saw no one, for each individual was lost in the same innumerable and wandering crowd.

Jamesd thought he could justify wage-labor, factory discipline and hierarchic management by noting that they’re imposed in Leninist regimes as well as under capitalism. Would he accept the same argument for the necessity of repressive sex and drug laws? Like other libertarians, he's is uneasy — hence his gratuitous red-baiting — because libertarianism and Leninism are as different as Coke and Pepsi when it comes to consecrating class society and the source of its power, work. Only upon the firm foundation of factory fascism and office oligarchy do libertarians and Leninists dare to debate the trivial issues dividing them. Toss in the mainstream conservatives who feel just the same and we end up with a veritable trilateralism of pro-work ideology seasoned to taste.
James, who never has to, sees nothing demeaning in taking orders from bosses, for “how else could a large scale factory be organized?” In other words, “wanting to abolish authority in large-scale industry is tantamount to wanting to abolish industry itself.” Jimmy Dumbass again? No, Frederick Engels! Marx agreed: “Go and run one of the Barcelona factories without direction, that is to say, without authority!” (Which is just what the Catalan workers did in 1936 )

"... technology escapes the intentions of its makers. The precursor and backbone of today’s Internet, ARPANet, was created in the late 1960s with the immediate objective of enabling communication between academics but more broadly as part of a strategy to enable U.S. military communications to survive in the event of nuclear war. 
Decentralization was introduced to prevent decapitation. However, the enduring result of ARPANet was the decentralized peer-to-peer network it created. It was TCP/ IP’s reliability, easy adaptability to a wide range of systems, and lack of hierarchy that made it appealing for civilian use. 
The hard-wiring of decentralization into the Internet’s technological platform created unintended consequences for the U.S. government — as far as enabling groups that threaten it also to enjoy communication networks that cannot be decapitated.
The Internet is also attractive to anarchists because its architecture enables a communistic informational economy.

No. I was talking about James A. Dumbfucks position on BDS.  That's all. 
    "I have proposed in the past that we abolish the nation-state of Israel last"     he wants to allgedly 'abolish' ALL STATES except the joo state. Funnily enough the joo state is a chemically pure example of the criminal nature of the state, is the newest, most illegitimate state on the planet, and yet the offensive-to-rats asshole puts it last on the kill list.
You seem to have some reading comprehension issues. I want anarchism to take power with the least amount of effort and that includes not triggering any ' Samson Option'. 
Once Israel see's all threats gone it can dissolve its nuclear-armed, religious apartheid state.

BS "... So you pretend that  your nazi government put you in a cage for excercising your free speech right. .."
No pretense is required with public court records. And its a Governor Generalate, not quite Nazi yet.  Unless you're a religious fascist trying to incite violence - like Zenaan. 
They just deported some dipshit loser like that - tusk tusk. Such Nazi-like behavior. 
"... Now you changed sides and you are the government. .."
As long as the police exist they can find lost dogs and deport religious fascist scum.
"... That is also the reason why you're constantly posting death threats. You know that government agents like you are above 'the law'.
That doesn't follow - its a non sequitur - otherwise Stiffs dotcom would be a govt website.

Taylor v Darkness
In 2002, the Federal Court applied the Act in the case of Jones v Toben. The case involved a complaint about a website which contained material that denied the Holocaust. The Federal Court ruled that the material was a violation of the Act.[2]
Section 474.17 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 makes it an offence to use a carriage service such as the Internet in a manner which reasonable persons would regard as menacing, harassing or offensive.

In my defense I assume plenty of source material at the ' Daily Stormer " and David Dukes preaches race-war and any post calling for Soros to be gassed is hate-filled, religious bigotry preaching Genocide. 
I haven't actually been to the ' Daily Stormer " or David Dukes, so maybe the Nazi, Zenaan, can provide us with more and better information? 
The Nazi, Zenaan's post on gassing Soros speaks for itself. It should be actionable in Vic.
Possibly even federally if we can get the hate-filled, murderous preacher deported.

Fascinating where material science is taking us. 
Since 2015 I've noticed a sort of ' Cryptological Turn ' in scientific fields as diverse as nano-technology and cosmology. More and more scientists apparently devoted to quantum cryptanalysis, once thought an impossible pursuit. But ever since Seth Lloyd wrote about the universe as a quantum computer ( 2006 ) its been implicit that its ' running code' must be quantum-encrypted.

The author of The Blockchain code: Decrypt the Jungle of Complexity to Win the Crypto-Anarchy Game, Dave Kinsey has created an excellent resource that has the right balance between width and breadth. The book is written in a way that makes it very accessible to any reader but goes into a great amount of detail and provides the reader with an astounding amount of information, a great deal of which I had not heard about before. I found the chapters about the connection Blockchain has to the anarchist movement to be exceptionally intriguing. When you read through the chapters, it makes a lot of sense as well as gives a very interesting perspective on where Blockchain may lead to in the future.

The term ' Left anarchist' ought to be a redundancy. Unfortunately we still have idiots calling themselves ' Anarchist Communists '!
The exploding cryptoanarchist revolution might have to sweep out a few ' Soviet Anarchists' in the next few years - even if the alleged majority " Class Struggle anarchists ' just melted into dew.
Funny Btc-anarchist story. I got interested in 2014, buying into a falling market and hodling through the years up to the start of 1917.  Sometimes up slightly - sometimes down, but always in the hundreds, not the thousands. So then I sense a small disturbance in the crypto-cash force and offered to write a short article for " Anarchist News ' on crypto-currencies.  It was planned as a very dry and conservative general outline finishing with a warning to only invest what you could afford to lose.
They declined my offer and even began censoring my comments so it was Shadenfreudalicious to watch the rest of 1917 play out in the Btc market. What makes it even sweeter is they remain resolute no-coiners to this very day.
Such 'anarchists' are really left-communists and nihilist nitwits. The net treats morons like this as damage all the time. Best revenge?
