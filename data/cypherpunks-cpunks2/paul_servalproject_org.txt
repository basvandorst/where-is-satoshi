@_subject: [serval-project-dev] More on mesh addressing. 
Jeremy I think has answered the broadcast issue, so I will focus more on
the entropy issue.
I think clocks are good to use, also.  For the radio RSSI, we could easily
make an entropy gathering mode where the radio hops over quite a wide band,
perhaps from about 870MHz ~ 1000MHz in a random pattern sampling ambient
energy levels, i.e. without talking to a remote radio, just listening.
 Combine that with some clock input, and feeding the RSSI results into the
forward channel selection to help further randomise the hopping sequence
while sampling for RSSI, and we should be able to make a fairly robust
entropy source.  Thoughts?
