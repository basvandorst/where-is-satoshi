It seems pretty clear that this is in fact not why the Navy funded Tor.
Virtually all science in the US is funded by the military in some form.
The stuff that isn't funded by the military is funded by the NSA, and
the stuff that isn't funded by either is funded by the NSF (which is
probably just a front group for the military; or at least functionally
is, as is most of the American government).
Saying "look, this thing was funded by the military" is just not useful.
By that metric, virtually all computer science is a hidden backdoor. You
have to be more specific.

Why develop an open-source tool for a proprietary FDE implementation?
This is an interesting idea -- I'm not sure if it has actual value, but
it's a nice mechanism, and it probably wouldn't be hard to implement on

I can't remember where, but I saw a review paper claiming this was
impossible because individuals with the intelligence to construct a
nuclear device tend not to join terror groups.

I understand your point, but the fact remains that the socio-economic
populations that produce people capable of making homebrew nuclear
weapons and the socio-economic populations that get attacked by drones
are mostly distinct. My earlier point stands if you replace "terror
groups" with "extra-legal terror groups."
It's possibly a sad fact, in the same sense that if the USSR didn't have
nukes, and thus MAD didn't exist, most of Eurasia might be an atomic
wasteland by now.

You're wrong as a matter of historic fact.
Are you one of the people that was too afraid to be on the al-qaeda list

(to clarify, this list used to have the address cyperpunks at al-qaeda.net,
until liberals afraid of their own shadow forced it into more neutral
territory. Many people joined at that point, somewhat diluting the
existing radicalism.)
This isn't a hard concept to grasp.

The hitmen were the extortionists. This is roughly how the exchange went
according to the FBI complaint out of NY:
      * extortionist: Give me 500k.
      * DPR: Why?
      * E: I owe people money.
      * DPR: Put them on the line.
      * People to whom the extortionist owes money (TOTALLY NOT THE
        EXTORTIONIST'S OTHER EMAIL ADDRESS NO WAY THATS CRAZY TALK):
        Hello.
      * DPR: Kill the extortionist.
      * D: That'll be 150k.
      * DPR: I've had people killed for 80k. But sure.
      * D: Okay, transfer bitcoins to this address.
      * DPR: Here you are.
      * D: Have a nice day!
The point of the "murder solicitation" is for DPR to indicate that he's
willing and able to have people whacked if they piss him off too much.
Then the extortionist and DPR both get to solve their mutual problems
without losing face.

The Wired articles mention that the FBI and the operator "struggled for
control of the servers" by changing passwords on each other.
You're ignoring the fact that once a server is exploited, it's an
unbounded road from there to actionable, convictable evidence. Suppose
the Freedom Hosting operator only ever logged in via SSH over another
hidden service endpoint. How would the FBI find him? What if the servers
they compromised were VMs with traffic forced through Tor? What if they
were some other crazy configuration dreamed up by someone hosting a
hidden service hosting service?
For DPR, we know he got lazy, and more than that, that he was extremely
sloppy. I'd bet that the Freedom Hosting guy was a similar situation.
There are plenty of illegal *websites* that haven't been busted yet.

A while ago, a friend and I bought a smoke detector and a webcam, hacked

It actually works; when you view the webcam you can see the little
points of light where an alpha particle hits the sensor.
However, there wasn't really any software to support it as an RNG, so
it's just sitting around.
Is it possible to make an entropy source out of something like that? If
so, it was a really simple (less than two hours IIRC) build, and it cost

        style). I've seen people write Java in OCaml and produce clean,
        modular code.
     2. OCaml is used in industrial environments (it's gotten pretty
        popular on Wall Street) and in open-source projects; the
        toolchain is mature and the community is vibrant.      3. OCaml is memory safe, but more importantly, it's type safe, and
        its type system is capable of encoding a great deal of your
        program's correctness. It will take some time to get your
        program to compile, but when it does you have a much stronger
        assurance that your program is correct than you do in C, C++, or
        Java.
     4. OCaml compiles to native code; I'm not sure if deterministic
        builds have been done but they should be possible.      5. (Performance, the hidden elephant in every language discussion
        room) The OCaml team takes security seriously, and OCaml is

     6. (Weaknesses) OCaml has a global lock due to its garbage

        processes. This is (IMO) cleaner than in similar situations like

paranoid of infiltrators and state repression. There's a certain level
of paranoia that's culturally accepted as necessary "security culture".
This might involve using pseudonyms, but obviously not very secure ones,
because this organization happens primarily in meatspace.
This dovetails nicely with the somewhat nomadic lifestyles of the people
involved, and the self-determinist ethic from the punk scene that's so
wedded to this group of cultures. It's common for people to introduce
themselves with obviously psuedonymous names like "carrot" or "scout",
but these people might even use these names on a personal basis with
people who know their legal names.
This comes back to the threat model -- these activists are scared of at
most an FBI investigation, and at baseline local police keeping tabs on
them. Weak pseudonyms are expensive enough for local police to keep the
community afloat. Likewise, I doubt it would have been very dangerous for adrelanos'

Pax Dickinson was fired for being a rampant misogynist. I can see how
that would upset you, being also a rampant misogynist/racist asshole,
but nobody *really likes* people like you, and surely as an overt
corporatist you must realize that you have no right to be employed if
your employer doesn't want to be around an asshole.
That also rather obviously had nothing to do with "the state" and far
more to do with the massively bad PR that comes from employing openly
misogynist assholes.

@_subject: Fwd: [tor-talk] giving up pseudonymity after collecting 
It's definitely a privilege to be able to do this. In the United States,
the animal liberation activism community (among others) is rightly
paranoid of infiltrators and state repression. There's a certain level
of paranoia that's culturally accepted as necessary "security culture".
This might involve using pseudonyms, but obviously not very secure ones,
because this organization happens primarily in meatspace.
This dovetails nicely with the somewhat nomadic lifestyles of the people
involved, and the self-determinist ethic from the punk scene that's so
wedded to this group of cultures. It's common for people to introduce
themselves with obviously psuedonymous names like "carrot" or "scout",
but these people might even use these names on a personal basis with
people who know their legal names.
This comes back to the threat model -- these activists are scared of at
most an FBI investigation, and at baseline local police keeping tabs on
them. Weak pseudonyms are expensive enough for local police to keep the
community afloat. Likewise, I doubt it would have been very dangerous for adrelanos'
partners or close friends to know their activities as a Whonix
maintainer. Probably a hyperinvestigation leveraging the full powers of
the surveillance states of the world would have penetrated this layer of
psuedonymity, but I doubt this would ever have happened.
It would have been interesting to see how far this could have progressed
along a spectrum from complete psuedonymity to complete ...nymity. How
long would adrelanos have been psychologically capable of keeping up the
act if a single friend had known?

It's "censorship-free" in the sense that a nation-state can't

to a censorship-proof decentralized publishing system like Freenet.
And it's centralized, so as soon as the central authority (the

I think this list is a lost cause at this point. Ever since around the
time it became more discoverable after the switch from al-qaeda.net to
cpunks.org, and some possibly overzealous cross-posting, the discourse
has shifted from actual cypherpunkery to white men complaining about
having their privilege eroded on other mailing lists. There are a number
of quality contributors that no longer post here, reducing the signal
and allowing more noise. I can't bring them back. But I can at least
remind anyone more moderate listening that the cypherpunks list wasn't
always a far-right discussion group, which I think is the reverence due
to the community that used to exist.
I'd appreciate any suggestions, onlist or offline, from anyone who
thinks similarly of the ideological drift of this list from generally
anti-authoritarian to crypto-white nationalism.

Hey Steve,
I've never posted much to CPunks, preferring to listen when people who
now no longer post such as Peter Gutmann, John Young, Eugen Leitl,
Cathal Garvey, Griffen Boyce, and others. My first post to the cpunks
list that I've archived was in early 2010, in a discussion of Mozilla
Perspectives. That was back when the CPunks list discussed things of
that nature, rather than "racial strength," which is assuredly
crypto-white nationalism (in the "attempting to disguise" sense, not in
the "cryptographically secure" sense).
Most of the people I name above no longer post. I notice the first post
I see from you is from 2014, which might indicate you missed this period
of the cpunks list. You might want to read some of the archives from the
previous five years, rather than limiting yourself to the last six
months. This list used to be quite good and contained reasoned
discussion of a variety of technical topics. As for ideology, I use my real name on this list because I'm already
openly anarchist and cypherpunk in my meatspace identity and see no
reason to hide this. However, you seem confused on the nature of
anarchism. As a rejection of all forms of coercion and hierarchy,
anarchism is both implicitly and explicitly feminist, anti-racist,
anti-capitalist, and anti-imperialist. If you're still confused about
this, I suggest "Said the pot to the kettle: Feminism for anarchist
men." It's very basic, but if you find it too basic you can look at the
recommended further readings for more advanced topics. If you do
consider yourself an anarchist, I urge you to meditate on why you chose
to embrace anarchism as an ideology, and whether those reasons also
compel you to embrace feminism and anti-racism as explicitly as
anarchism. If you're a "libertarian," I urge you to stop using a word that
everywhere but the united states means "anarchist" in the sense I have
been using it and in the sense anarchists throughout history have used
it including but not limited to Emma Goldman, Assata Shakur, and Bill
Haywood, and instead say "neo-feudalist" which is perhaps more
appropriate. Cypherpunk technology always appealed to me as an anarchist because it
equalizes all people against those who would attempt to oppress them.
Technology does have the capacity to be liberating. But for that ideal
to be realized, the communities around those technologies need be at
best ideologically neutral. If a black liberationist, who should be the
ally of any anarchist, came on this list today, I'm sure she would be
dissuaded from using any actually secure technology because the tone of
this list has shifted from discussing cypherpunk technology, to "racial
strength" and arguing over whether people should have the "free speech"
right to build fascism. The only way this can happen is if people like you look inside yourself
and decide what side you're on.

I'm a little skeptical of wireless mesh networks as a general solution
to this sort of problem, because they're inherently chatty, and have
very limited reach.
I think a better solution is local wired networks with something like
Freenet running over them providing distributed censorship-proof
storage. The next challenge is to synchronize contents between local
Freenet darknets over sneakernet, which I don't think has been done.

You're totally correct, but the people who actually do control this list have decided it's more important for the obvious CyberCom trolls to drive the list into the ground than it is to violate their concept of ~freedom of speech~. It really sucks that the list has been fucked over by some people who are at worst being paid to do so by a government (a possibility I've become convinced is near to the truth), or at best just assholes who didn't even have the balls to post on the al-qaeda.net version (of course, signatures indicate they were trolling the debian lists during that period).
Every ecosystem attracts parasites, and the best kept gardens die by pacifism. People whom this post/subthread is about: how many people have to say they dislike your posts and killfile your email before you take the hint and stop posting? You are not contributing anything of value, and you aren't liked in this community. If this list was a party, you'd be having your circlejerk in the corner, or screaming alone, while literally everyone else ignored you. Try to feel, just for a second, the shame, isolation, and sense of social ineptitude I'm sure you have at plenty of times in your life if not most of it. That is how you should feel wherever you post to this list.

Juan, I don't know how you could have thought that message referred to you. You're one of the only voices of truth on this list. I read every one of your emails twice, even three times. PLEASE keep posting.

Great cypherpunk content, Zeeman. Can you maybe tie this back to the Jews for us? Nothing is more cypherpunk than ethno-nationalist white supremacy after all.

Is there any evidence of this?   From all appearances, they care about nothing so much as preserving and expanding their funding.
NSA surely doesn't want the publicity, but the DEA is always in search of
positive press.   If they have to listen to 100K conversations in order to bust one kid, picking up a few hundred Oxycodone pills at the Post Office,
is there any reason to suspect they wouldn't do so?
