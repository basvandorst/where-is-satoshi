Group of people who burgled the FBI in 1971
On March 8, 1971, a group of anti-war activists broke into an FBI office in Media, Pennsylvania, and changed the course of history.
The burglars wound up blowing the whistle on illegal surveillance and bullying tactics employed by J. Edgar Hoover and his government agency — and despite one of the biggest FBI dragnets ever, the perpetrators were never caught and their identities remained secret… until now.
The new documentary "1971" reveals these former political radicals as they tell their story on film for the first time. At the time of the break-in, anti-war activists believed they were being watched by the FBI. Bonnie and John Raines, a married couple with three children, had participated in rallies and were photographed by suspected govenment agents. That prompted them to join the group, which eventually swiped more than 1,000 documents.
Billing themselves as 'The Citizens Commission to Investigate the FBI,' the members took serious risks to deliver the stolen FBI documents to the press. "We knew that if we got caught, we were going to face very serious prison time," says John Raines in the film (as seen in the trailer)."If the FBI was suppressing dissent, it was as important to expose that as it was to end the war," says journalist Betty Medsger, who is responsible for exposing the burglars's identities. She wrote the new book "The Burglary" and worked closely with "1971" filmmakers.
"Break into an FBI office, remove files, and mail them to newspapers," says Bonnie Raines of the plan. It was not haphazard. They cased the FBI building in Media for weeks, tracking comings and goings and drawing up detailed maps and a plan.
Multiple setbacks nearly halted the operation. "A couple of weeks before the break-in date, one person in the group dropped out — simply walked away. This person knew every detail of their plans. The risk that he would expose them was huge. They went ahead anyway," says "1971" director and producer Johanna Hamilton. "The break-in itself almost didn't happen. When the chief lock-picker arrived, he found the lock on the FBI's door was different than the one he had been practicing for. So the whole process was much more complicated and tenuous than they originally thought," she tells Yahoo Movies.
Once the documents were taken, the group spent days scanning them to find evidence of FBI wrongdoing, according to a recent New York Times report. They sent copies of the most revealing documents to journalists, one of whom was Medsger of the Washington Post. She was one of few journalists who acted on the information.
The biggest discovery was finding that Hoover ran a covert operation with the code name COINTELPRO, under which the FBI would survey, infiltrate, discredit, and disrupt political groups and U.S. citizens deemed "subversive." Much of the activity was illegal.
The burglary which exposed COINTELPRO led to the first-ever congressional investigation of U.S. intelligence agencies, and as a result the operation was terminated.The documents revealed that a wide array of postal workers, police, and even switchboard operators were used as FBI informants. Martin Luther King Jr. was a major target of COINTELPRO, with agents having him under surveillance and repeatedly bugging his home and hotel rooms.
"What is consistently amazing to me is the fact that only one of the documents they stole contained the caption COINTELPRO. It was that one document that would lead to the full revelation of FBI dirty tricks," says Hamilton.
Another stunning revelation: Hoover's program had been running since 1956. "By 1971 so many people and groups had been put under surveillance," says Hamilton. "Basically there was blanket surveillance of African Americans — both well known, like the Black Panthers, and less known, everyday people, students, people who were active in communal African-American life."
"1971" debuts at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York on April 18.

A revolutionary new method of encrypting confidential information has been patented by scientists at Lancaster University.
Read more at: 
They have been inspired by their discoveries from human biology, which model how the heart and lungs coordinate their rhythms by passing information between each other.
A mathematical model based on the complex interaction between these organs has now been transferred to the world of modern communications. 
This discovery could transform daily life which is reliant on secure electronic communications for everything from mobiles to sensor networks and the internet.
Every device, from your car key to online bank account, contains different identification codes enabling information to be transferred in confidence. But the race to outwit the hackers means there is a continual demand for better encryption methods.
Inspiration for the new method of encryption came from interdisciplinary research in the Physics Department ( by Dr Tomislav Stankovski, Professor Peter McClintock, and Professor Aneta Stefanovska, and the patent includes Dr Robert Young.
Professor McClintock commented that this is a significant discovery.
He said: "This promises an encryption scheme that is so nearly unbreakable that it will be equally unwelcome to internet criminals and official eavesdroppers."
Professor Stefanovska emphasized the interdisciplinary aspect: "As so often happens with important breakthroughs, this discovery was made right on the boundary between two different subjects – because we were applying physics to biology."
Dr Stankovski said: "Here we offer a novel encryption scheme derived from biology, radically different from any earlier procedure. Inspired by the time-varying nature of the cardio-respiratory coupling functions recently discovered in humans, we propose a new encryption scheme that is highly resistant to conventional methods of attack."
The advantage of this discovery is that it offers an infinite number of choices for the secret encryption key shared between the sender and receiver. This makes it virtually impossible for hackers and eavesdroppers to crack the code.
The new method is exceptionally resistant to interference from the random fluctuations or "noise" which affects all communications systems.
It can also transmit several different information streams simultaneously, enabling all the digital devices in the home, for example, to operate on one encryption key instead of dozens of different ones.

@_subject: Acoustic bugging of computers 
(Phys.org) —A trio of researchers in Israel has discovered that it is possible to crack 4096-bit RSA encryption keys using a microphone to listen to high-pitch noises generated by internal computer components. Adi Shamir (co-inventor of RSA), Daniel Genkin and Eran Tromer have published a research paper describing the technique on a Tel Aviv University server.
Read more at: 
Computers make noises, the researchers explain, far beyond the whirring of the fan. The CPU, for example, emits a high pitched noise as it operates, fluctuating depending on which operations it is performing—other components do likewise. Suspecting that they might be able to exploit this characteristic of computers, the researchers set about creating software to interpret noise data obtained using simple microphones and very little other equipment. They also focused exclusively on trying to achieve one single feat: deciphering an RSA encryption key. After much trial and effort, the researchers found it could be done without much effort.
Listening and detecting the noise made by a computer as it processes a single character in an encryption key would be impossible, of course, so the researchers devised a method that causes the noise to be repeated enough times in a row to enable capture of its signal. And that can only happen if the attacker is able to send a cyphertext to the machine that is to be attacked and have it processed. The cyphertext contains code that causes looping. By listening to how the computer processes the cyphertext, the researchers can map the noises made by the computer as it crunches different characters, thereby allowing encryption keys sent by others to be cracked.
What's perhaps most frightening about this method is how easily it can be ported to various machines. The researchers found, for example, that by using a laptop and simple hardware and software they were able to crack encryption keys on a second laptop. Next, they did the same thing using a cell phone as the listening device. They suggest it could also be packaged completely in software and sent out as malware, hacking encryption keys on infected devices and sending them back to the hacker.
As a side-note, the researchers also found that low-bandwidth attacks on computers are also possible by measuring the electrical potential of a computer's chassis while the circuitry is busy doing its work.

Well, I posted the article, but don't necessarily ratify the content.  However, I have never had much confidence in the RF (radio-frequency) security of computers.  That point was driven home to me in mid 1977, when I built a microprocessor-trainer board called a "Dyna Micro"         It was uncased, and I ran it near an AM/FM radio.  While listening to the AM band, away from an active station, it made numerous audio sounds as it went through the program of the keyboard scanner and programs that I entered.  It was obvious that information could be transfered by RF, although at the time I wasn't particularly concerned about the possibility.
In about 1983, I visited Washington DC, and attended some sort of military electronics convention (invited by a customer of my company, SemiDisk Systems, Inc) and I was introduced to the concept of "Tempest" shielding. 
In the summer of 2002, while a guest at the "Gated Community" of USP Atwater, California, I worked for the Federal Prison Industries ("Unicor") tearing apart electronic hardware, mostly computer monitors.  I was the only person there, either prisoner or staff, who understood what the parts were which were on the boards.  Very rarely, a computer monitor came through which I recognized was a shielded, "Tempest"-grade monitor.

Passwords vulnerable after security flaw found
By ANICK JESDANUN
6 hours ago
NEW YORK (AP) — Passwords, credit cards and other sensitive data are at risk after security researchers discovered a problem with an encryption technology used to securely transmit email, e-commerce transactions, social networking posts and other Web traffic.
Related Stories
Security researchers say the threat, known as Heartbleed, is serious, partly because it remained undiscovered for more two years. Attackers can exploit the vulnerability without leaving any trace, so anything sent during that time has potentially been compromised. It's not known, though, whether anyone has actually used it to conduct an attack.
Researchers are advising people to change all of their passwords.
The flaw was discovered independently in recent days by researchers at Google Inc. and the Finnish security firm Codenomicon.
The breach involves SSL/TLS, an encryption technology marked by the small, closed padlock and "https:" on Web browsers to signify that traffic is secure. With the Heartbleed flaw, traffic was subject to snooping even if the padlock had been closed.
The problem affects only the variant of SSL/TLS known as OpenSSL, but that happens to be one of the most common on the Internet.
Researchers at Codenomicon say that OpenSSL is used by two of the most widely used Web server software, Apache and nginx. That means many websites potentially have this security flaw. OpenSSL is also used to secure email, chats and virtual private networks, which are used by employees to connect securely with corporate networks.
Despite the worries, Codenomicon said many large consumer sites don't have the problem because of their "conservative choice" of equipment and software. "Ironically smaller and more progressive services or those who have upgraded to (the) latest and best encryption will be affected most," the security firm added.
A fix came out Monday, but affected websites and service providers must install the update.
Yahoo's Tumblr blogging service uses OpenSSL. In a blog post Tuesday, officials at the service said they had no evidence of any breach and had immediately implemented the fix.
"But this still means that the little lock icon (HTTPS) we all trusted to keep our passwords, personal emails, and credit cards safe, was actually making all that private information accessible to anyone who knew about the exploit," Tumblr's blog post read. "This might be a good day to call in sick and take some time to change your passwords everywhere — especially your high-security services like email, file storage, and banking, which may have been compromised by this bug."
Yahoo Inc. said its other services, including email, Flickr and search, also have the vulnerability. The company said some of the systems have already been fixed, while work is being done on the rest of Yahoo's websites.
The company reiterated its standard recommendation for people to change passwords regularly and to add a backup mobile number to the account. That number can be used to verify a user's identity if there are problems accessing the account because of hacking.
AP Technology Writer Michael Liedtke in San Francisco contributed to this report.

It occurred to me that I haven't heard much on the news about deliberate attacks on the healthcare.gov website, even though it is reputed to be extremely weak.  Might somebody (potentially a supporter of Obama and/or Obamacare) have deliberately 'spammed' it with fake signups, simply to get the number of such signups increased?  How vulnerable would it be to 'invented' names/addresses?  How 'valid' would these names/addresses have to be to keep the system from finding out until some arbitrary stage in the process?  If such an attack had been done, would the public ever find out, and when?

True, but I think they'd prefer to (later on) be able to blame some unknown-named and unidentifiable 'hacker-types' than to implicate themselves.   ("I'm shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!")
This tactic wouldn't be useful at all if follow-on data (like actually-paid accounts) were released.  Probably this explains why those numbers remain elusive even today.

Yes, it's amazing how much security on the Internet is constructed on foundations of sand, 23 years (for example) after the writing of PGP.  Organizations such as the NSA and CIA should be required to show that they are pulling their own weight, by discovering and fixing these kinds of bugs.  After all, ostensibly they exist for the benefit of the citizenry of America, right?  I would question the raison d'etre of the NSA if it found itself more interested in maintaining the existence of security bugs, than of closing them.  The NSA can't claim that nobody else could find them or exploit them.
As for my idea about healthcare.gov vulnerability:  I thought of this many months ago, but I decided not to post it until the deadline had virtually expired.  (Although, it wasn't like I thought I was the only one who could imagine such a thing!).   I was amazed by the lack of discussion in the lamestream media about the potential vulnerabilities of people's personal data.  But, even more obvious to me was the fact that healthcare.gov virtually invited people to enter false data: It refused to provide people information about health care plans until they had entered their own personal information.  A person would be motivated to enter a mostly-fake set of data, solely for the purpose of getting access to the plans.
And, there was a potential 'innocent reason':  Systems like this might get 'stuck', making it difficult to correct data, and people might be tempted to initiate a new account, solely for the purpose of abandoning old data.    I realized that depending on how well healthcare.gov had been written, a cracker with a script could upload thousands or even over a million accounts, presumably for the purpose of making the account-numbers look good.

The major flaw that I see with this case (and others like it) is that it presumes that the defendants actually BELIEVED the statements by the police, and RELIED ON them.  From the article:
"Still, undercover officers with the U.S. Secret Service and Miami Beach police told both clearly that they wanted to buy bitcoins with cash supposedly generated by the hacking of Target Corp. customer information. The undercover officers said during the secretly videotaped meetings that they planned to use the bitcoins to acquire still more stolen credit cards."
I could 'clearly tell' somebody that the Sun orbited the Earth, but that doesn't mean that the statement was factual.  Similarly, the fact that the police told these guys what the article claims they did, doesn't require that the defendants actually BELIEVED the allegations.  My expectation is that these charges will be quietly dropped:  The only ones actually committing the crime(s) are the police themselves:  The police solicited money laundering, when there were no facts (actual underlying crimes) supporting the money laundering predicate.
       Jim Bell
MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Two police officers burst through a hotel room door with guns drawn, yelling "Police! Get Down!" just after an alleged money laundering transaction went down. But instead of briefcases stuffed with a drug dealer's cash, this exchange involved an undercover officer with supposedly stolen credit cards and the virtual currency bitcoin.
The February arrests of Pascal Reid and Michell Espinoza marked the first time any state has brought money laundering charges involving bitcoins, according to Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle. And it's likely to be a closely-watched test of whether criminal law can adapt to new digital forms of payment.
"These cybercriminals are way ahead of the rest of us in terms of trying to figure out ways they can launder dirty money," Rundle said.
Investigators trolled through an online directory of bitcoin traders to find the 29-year-old Reid and 30-year-old Espinoza, setting up separate meetings with each of the men at restaurants and coffee shops. They were arrested at the same Miami Beach hotel on the same day, at different times.
Defense attorneys said the men have no previous criminal records and were simply enthusiasts of the payment format that allows people to convert cash into digital money for online transactions.
Still, undercover officers with the U.S. Secret Service and Miami Beach police told both clearly that they wanted to buy bitcoins with cash supposedly generated by the hacking of Target Corp. customer information. The undercover officers said during the secretly videotaped meetings that they planned to use the bitcoins to acquire still more stolen credit cards.
"My client has never dealt in the area of stolen credit cards," said Espinoza's attorney, Rene Palomino Jr. "My client was simply selling a piece of personal property, which is what a bitcoin is. It has not been recognized as currency yet in the United States."Attorneys for Reid and Espinoza, both of whom have pleaded not guilty, say they will challenge the very legal foundations of the cases, which are being prosecuted separately. The arrest affidavits for both Reid and Espinoza refer to bitcoins as "electronic currency with no central authority."
The Internal Revenue Service issued guidance last month concluding that bitcoins can only be taxed as property and are not legal tender. Federal law enforcement agencies are watching whether bitcoins are used increasingly in criminal activity, such as the now-defunct Silk Road illegal drug marketplace.
"The idea that illicit actors might exploit the vulnerabilities of virtual currency to launder money is not merely theoretical," said Jennifer Shasky Calvery, director of Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, in a recent Florida speech to bankers.
Still, bitcoins have been gaining popularity among mainstream businesses. Overstock.com recently became the first major retailer to accept digital money and the NBA's Sacramento Kings in January announced the team would accept bitcoins, another first. They are increasingly used in restaurants, coffee shops and elsewhere.
The Latin House Grill in Coral Gables is one of the first South Florida restaurants to accept bitcoins and has been hosting meetings to educate people.Bitcoin users exchange cash for digital money using online exchanges, then store it in a computer program that serves as a wallet. The program can transfer payments directly to merchants or individuals around the world, eliminating transaction fees and the need for bank or credit card information.
"This technology can't go away. It's completely disrupted a lot of existing technology that's archaic, that hasn't evolved," said patron Andrew Barnard, who has been using bitcoins for a year.
In the Florida criminal case, Reid and Espinoza each face up to 25 years in prison if convicted of money laundering and engaging in an unlicensed money services business. Reid is free on $100,000 bail but Espinoza has been unable so far to make bail.
The transactions started small — one payment of $500 translated into about half a bitcoin — and eventually built to a proposed swap involving $30,000 in Reid's case.
"Ice cold money. Ice cold cash. Right out of the freezer," the undercover agent, holding a plastic bag of cash tells Reid on the surveillance tape. Just after Reid accepts the bag, the undercover agent says, "We're cooking with gas," an apparent signal to the officers outside to come in.
"You're a cop?" Reid is heard saying on the tape. "You're a cop?"
Reid attorney Ron Lowy said the prosecution was manufactured.
"The government is frightened of bitcoin. Apparently, they see it as an emerging, new type of economic medium of exchange, and they're worried that they're not regulating it close enough," Lowy said. "These facts do not constitute a crime."

White House, spy agencies deny NSA exploited 'Heartbleed' bug 
photoSecurity experts warn there is little Internet users can do to protect themselve\WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House and U.S. intelligence agencies said on Friday neither the National Security Agency nor any other part of the government were aware before this month of the "Heartbleed" bug, denying a report that the spy agency exploited the glitch in widely used Web encryption technology to gather intelligence.
The White House, the NSA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued statements after Bloomberg reported that the NSA was aware of the bug for at least two years and exploited it in order to obtain passwords and other basic information used in hacking operations. The Bloomberg report cited two unnamed sources it said were familiar with the matter.
The Heartbleed bug is considered one of the most serious Internet security flaws to be uncovered in recent years.
"Reports that NSA or any other part of the government were aware of the so-called Heartbleed vulnerability before April 2014 are wrong," White House National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said in a statement.
"This administration takes seriously its responsibility to help maintain an open, interoperable, secure and reliable Internet," Hayden added.
Bloomberg was not immediately available to comment.
The discovery of Heartbleed by researchers with Google Inc and a small security firm, Codenomicon, prompted the U.S. Homeland Security Department to advise businesses on Tuesday to review their servers to see if they were using vulnerable versions of widely used software known as OpenSSL.
OpenSSL is used to encrypt email and other communications and to protect the websites of big Internet companies, including Facebook Inc, Google Inc and Yahoo Inc. The bug, disclosed Monday, allows hackers to steal data without a trace.
NSA spokeswoman Vanee Vines said in a separate statement: "NSA was not aware of the recently identified vulnerability in OpenSSL, the so-called Heartbleed vulnerability, until it was made public in a private-sector cybersecurity report."
Hayden said the federal government relies on OpenSSL to protect the privacy of users of government websites and other online services. "If the federal government, including the intelligence community, had discovered this vulnerability prior to last week, it would have been disclosed to the community responsible for OpenSSL," Hayden added.
Hayden said that when U.S. agencies discover a new vulnerability in commercial and open-source software, "it is in the national interest to responsibly disclose the vulnerability rather than to hold it for an investigative or intelligence purpose." Such vulnerabilities are known as "zero-day" flaws because the software developers have had zero days to fix them.
In December, a five-member advisory panel convened to review electronic surveillance policy urged the White House to sharply curtail the use of undisclosed flaws and stop undercutting encryption standards. The panel included former White House cybersecurity advisor Richard Clarke.
In late February, a senior White House official said the Obama administration was intensively studying both issues.
The administration statements issued on Friday confirmed that the review had already "reinvigorated an interagency process for deciding when to share vulnerabilities" on a case-by-case basis.
The activities of the NSA have come under sharp scrutiny since former agency contractor Edward Snowden leaked numerous documents exposing expansive U.S. surveillance efforts.
Even before Snowden's emergence, former officials, including Clarke, told Reuters that offensive and spying considerations had dominated inside the NSA, causing it to withhold information instead of warning the public about new flaws.
Clarke told Reuters Friday that the NSA had not known of Heartbleed.
The U.S. government warned banks and other businesses on Friday to be on alert for hackers seeking to steal data exposed by the bug, as a German programmer who volunteered with OpenSSL took responsibility for inadvertently launching the security crisis.

I would think that at some point, the NSA would become too embarrassed to admit that they HADN'T discovered and employed such an exploit!
Which leads me to a question:  Presumably, the NSA has billions of emails locked up in Utah, or wherever they had previously used as a data-store.  Does the revelation of the Heartbleed bug mean that the NSA could have quickly logged onto millions of accounts, read emails in the clear, etc?

I strongly doubt the part about reading the newspaper from orbit.  I don't doubt that the pattern of text and pictures on the  front page could be identified from orbit. ('Identifying the difference between Pravda and Izvestia'.)   An approximation I once heard is that a lens or mirror of about 4.5 inch in diameter can resolve an angle of one arc-second.  A mirror of the size of the Hubble Space Telescope (which I assume approximates that of the typical spy satellite today) is about 20x larger, so the resolution should be 20x better, or 1/20 arc-second.  That's 1/(57 degrees per radian)(3600arcseconds per degree)(20) = 1/4,100,000 radian.  From an altitude of 500 kilometers, that's about 1/8 of a meter, or 120 millimeter.  Maybe that's a pixel-pair, but it's far too large to resolve the text on a newspaper.  
The best prospect to improve on this resolution would be to use a 'multiple-mirror-telescope' technology.  Light-gathering capability isn't important in this application; high resolution is.  Making a spy-telescope out of a few different mirrors, held precisely many meters apart, could conceivable achieve resolutions substantially greater than this.

I strongly doubt the part about reading the newspaper from orbit.  I don't doubt that the pattern of text and pictures on the  front page could be identified from orbit. ('Identifying the difference between Pravda and Izvestia'.)   An approximation I once heard is that a lens or mirror of about 4.5 inch in diameter can resolve an angle of one arc-second.  A mirror of the size of the Hubble Space Telescope (which I assume approximates that of the typical spy satellite today) is about 20x larger, so the resolution should be 20x better, or 1/20 arc-second.  That's 1/(57 degrees per radian)(3600arcseconds per degree)(20) = 1/4,100,000 radian.  From an altitude of 500 kilometers, that's about 1/8 of a meter, or 120 millimeter.  Maybe that's a pixel-pair, but it's far too large to resolve the text on a newspaper.

I sure find that difficult to imagine!  Particularly because the assemblage would presumably be flying at about 500 kilometers altitude, and would therefore be buffeted by extremely-small-but-significant orbital winds.  In addition, the amount of information that would have to be interchanged (phase and amplitude, in TWO dimensions!) of an entire field of view would be phenomenal.  
What I suspect the US military would really like to see is a spy satellite at geosync altitude (22,000 miles) with an apparent aperture of perhaps 150 meters, so that it has roughly the same resolution on the ground as existing fast-orbital spy satellites.  (orbital period circa 90 minutes or so).

Curiously, I just saw this article:   (
The United States military's advanced research arm is working on a foldable space telescope that could image Earth in high resolution at a relatively low cost.
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) says the telescope design — known as theMembrane Optical Imager for Real-Time Exploitation, or MOIRE — would be of great use in geosynchronous Earth orbit, the spot 22,000 miles (35,000 kilometers) up where most telecommunications satellites reside.
"Membrane optics could enable us to fit much larger, higher-resolution telescopes in smaller and lighter packages," Lt. Col. Larry Gunn, MOIRE program manager, said in a statement. [Giant Space Telescopes of the Future (Infographic)]
"In that respect, we’re ‘breaking the glass ceiling’ that traditional materials impose on optics design," Gunn added. "We’re hoping our research could also help greatly reduce overall costs and enable more timely deployment using smaller, less expensive launch vehicles."
MOIRE is now in Phase 2 of development since work began in 2010. When this phase is completed, a 16-foot (5 meters) prototype of the telescope's mirror should be completed for ground testing. No space missions have been set for MOIRE yet, DARPA officials said.
There are both advantages and disadvantages to the MOIRE design. The membrane is not as efficient as the usual glass, but it is lighter — which allows prime contractor Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. to make larger lenses to increase the telescope's efficiency. DARPA estimates that a membrane system should weigh 86 percent less than a more traditional system of the same resolution and mass.w gallery
Most telescopes either reflect light (using mirrors) or refract it (using lenses), but MOIRE's behaves differently. Each membrane will instead diffract light using a piece of equipment known as a Fresnel lens.
"It is etched with circular concentric grooves like microscopically thin tree rings, with the grooves hundreds of microns across at the center down to only 4 microns at the outside edge," DARPA officials said in a statement. "The diffractive pattern focuses light on a sensor that the satellite translates into an image."
If the design ever reaches orbit, DARPA envisions the membrane stretching to 66 feet (20 meters) in diameter — about eight times the diameter of the Hubble Space Telescope and more than three times bigger than the mirror for NASA's huge James Webb Space Telescope, which is scheduled to launch in 2018.
The membranes would ride to space as "petals" packed into a tight package about 20 feet (6 m) wide, small enough to fit on a rocket. These petals would then unfurl in orbit, and provide an estimated resolution of 3.3 feet (1 m).

Group of people who burgled the FBI in 1971
On March 8, 1971, a group of anti-war activists broke into an FBI office in Media, Pennsylvania, and changed the course of history.
The burglars wound up blowing the whistle on illegal surveillance and bullying tactics employed by J. Edgar Hoover and his government agency — and despite one of the biggest FBI dragnets ever, the perpetrators were never caught and their identities remained secret… until now.
The new documentary "1971" reveals these former political radicals as they tell their story on film for the first time. At the time of the break-in, anti-war activists believed they were being watched by the FBI. Bonnie and John Raines, a married couple with three children, had participated in rallies and were photographed by suspected govenment agents. That prompted them to join the group, which eventually swiped more than 1,000 documents.
Billing themselves as 'The Citizens Commission to Investigate the FBI,' the members took serious risks to deliver the stolen FBI documents to the press. "We knew that if we got caught, we were going to face very serious prison time," says John Raines in the film (as seen in the trailer)."If the FBI was suppressing dissent, it was as important to expose that as it was to end the war," says journalist Betty Medsger, who is responsible for exposing the burglars's identities. She wrote the new book "The Burglary" and worked closely with "1971" filmmakers.
"Break into an FBI office, remove files, and mail them to newspapers," says Bonnie Raines of the plan. It was not haphazard. They cased the FBI building in Media for weeks, tracking comings and goings and drawing up detailed maps and a plan.
Multiple setbacks nearly halted the operation. "A couple of weeks before the break-in date, one person in the group dropped out — simply walked away. This person knew every detail of their plans. The risk that he would expose them was huge. They went ahead anyway," says "1971" director and producer Johanna Hamilton. "The break-in itself almost didn't happen. When the chief lock-picker arrived, he found the lock on the FBI's door was different than the one he had been practicing for. So the whole process was much more complicated and tenuous than they originally thought," she tells Yahoo Movies.
Once the documents were taken, the group spent days scanning them to find evidence of FBI wrongdoing, according to a recent New York Times report. They sent copies of the most revealing documents to journalists, one of whom was Medsger of the Washington Post. She was one of few journalists who acted on the information.
The biggest discovery was finding that Hoover ran a covert operation with the code name COINTELPRO, under which the FBI would survey, infiltrate, discredit, and disrupt political groups and U.S. citizens deemed "subversive." Much of the activity was illegal.
The burglary which exposed COINTELPRO led to the first-ever congressional investigation of U.S. intelligence agencies, and as a result the operation was terminated.The documents revealed that a wide array of postal workers, police, and even switchboard operators were used as FBI informants. Martin Luther King Jr. was a major target of COINTELPRO, with agents having him under surveillance and repeatedly bugging his home and hotel rooms.
"What is consistently amazing to me is the fact that only one of the documents they stole contained the caption COINTELPRO. It was that one document that would lead to the full revelation of FBI dirty tricks," says Hamilton.
Another stunning revelation: Hoover's program had been running since 1956. "By 1971 so many people and groups had been put under surveillance," says Hamilton. "Basically there was blanket surveillance of African Americans — both well known, like the Black Panthers, and less known, everyday people, students, people who were active in communal African-American life."
"1971" debuts at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York on April 18.

A revolutionary new method of encrypting confidential information has been patented by scientists at Lancaster University.
Read more at: 
They have been inspired by their discoveries from human biology, which model how the heart and lungs coordinate their rhythms by passing information between each other.
A mathematical model based on the complex interaction between these organs has now been transferred to the world of modern communications. 
This discovery could transform daily life which is reliant on secure electronic communications for everything from mobiles to sensor networks and the internet.
Every device, from your car key to online bank account, contains different identification codes enabling information to be transferred in confidence. But the race to outwit the hackers means there is a continual demand for better encryption methods.
Inspiration for the new method of encryption came from interdisciplinary research in the Physics Department ( by Dr Tomislav Stankovski, Professor Peter McClintock, and Professor Aneta Stefanovska, and the patent includes Dr Robert Young.
Professor McClintock commented that this is a significant discovery.
He said: "This promises an encryption scheme that is so nearly unbreakable that it will be equally unwelcome to internet criminals and official eavesdroppers."
Professor Stefanovska emphasized the interdisciplinary aspect: "As so often happens with important breakthroughs, this discovery was made right on the boundary between two different subjects – because we were applying physics to biology."
Dr Stankovski said: "Here we offer a novel encryption scheme derived from biology, radically different from any earlier procedure. Inspired by the time-varying nature of the cardio-respiratory coupling functions recently discovered in humans, we propose a new encryption scheme that is highly resistant to conventional methods of attack."
The advantage of this discovery is that it offers an infinite number of choices for the secret encryption key shared between the sender and receiver. This makes it virtually impossible for hackers and eavesdroppers to crack the code.
The new method is exceptionally resistant to interference from the random fluctuations or "noise" which affects all communications systems.
It can also transmit several different information streams simultaneously, enabling all the digital devices in the home, for example, to operate on one encryption key instead of dozens of different ones.

@_subject: Acoustic bugging of computers 
(Phys.org) —A trio of researchers in Israel has discovered that it is possible to crack 4096-bit RSA encryption keys using a microphone to listen to high-pitch noises generated by internal computer components. Adi Shamir (co-inventor of RSA), Daniel Genkin and Eran Tromer have published a research paper describing the technique on a Tel Aviv University server.
Read more at: 
Computers make noises, the researchers explain, far beyond the whirring of the fan. The CPU, for example, emits a high pitched noise as it operates, fluctuating depending on which operations it is performing—other components do likewise. Suspecting that they might be able to exploit this characteristic of computers, the researchers set about creating software to interpret noise data obtained using simple microphones and very little other equipment. They also focused exclusively on trying to achieve one single feat: deciphering an RSA encryption key. After much trial and effort, the researchers found it could be done without much effort.
Listening and detecting the noise made by a computer as it processes a single character in an encryption key would be impossible, of course, so the researchers devised a method that causes the noise to be repeated enough times in a row to enable capture of its signal. And that can only happen if the attacker is able to send a cyphertext to the machine that is to be attacked and have it processed. The cyphertext contains code that causes looping. By listening to how the computer processes the cyphertext, the researchers can map the noises made by the computer as it crunches different characters, thereby allowing encryption keys sent by others to be cracked.
What's perhaps most frightening about this method is how easily it can be ported to various machines. The researchers found, for example, that by using a laptop and simple hardware and software they were able to crack encryption keys on a second laptop. Next, they did the same thing using a cell phone as the listening device. They suggest it could also be packaged completely in software and sent out as malware, hacking encryption keys on infected devices and sending them back to the hacker.
As a side-note, the researchers also found that low-bandwidth attacks on computers are also possible by measuring the electrical potential of a computer's chassis while the circuitry is busy doing its work.

Well, I posted the article, but don't necessarily ratify the content.  However, I have never had much confidence in the RF (radio-frequency) security of computers.  That point was driven home to me in mid 1977, when I built a microprocessor-trainer board called a "Dyna Micro"         It was uncased, and I ran it near an AM/FM radio.  While listening to the AM band, away from an active station, it made numerous audio sounds as it went through the program of the keyboard scanner and programs that I entered.  It was obvious that information could be transfered by RF, although at the time I wasn't particularly concerned about the possibility.
In about 1983, I visited Washington DC, and attended some sort of military electronics convention (invited by a customer of my company, SemiDisk Systems, Inc) and I was introduced to the concept of "Tempest" shielding. 
In the summer of 2002, while a guest at the "Gated Community" of USP Atwater, California, I worked for the Federal Prison Industries ("Unicor") tearing apart electronic hardware, mostly computer monitors.  I was the only person there, either prisoner or staff, who understood what the parts were which were on the boards.  Very rarely, a computer monitor came through which I recognized was a shielded, "Tempest"-grade monitor.

Passwords vulnerable after security flaw found
By ANICK JESDANUN
6 hours ago
NEW YORK (AP) — Passwords, credit cards and other sensitive data are at risk after security researchers discovered a problem with an encryption technology used to securely transmit email, e-commerce transactions, social networking posts and other Web traffic.
Related Stories
Security researchers say the threat, known as Heartbleed, is serious, partly because it remained undiscovered for more two years. Attackers can exploit the vulnerability without leaving any trace, so anything sent during that time has potentially been compromised. It's not known, though, whether anyone has actually used it to conduct an attack.
Researchers are advising people to change all of their passwords.
The flaw was discovered independently in recent days by researchers at Google Inc. and the Finnish security firm Codenomicon.
The breach involves SSL/TLS, an encryption technology marked by the small, closed padlock and "https:" on Web browsers to signify that traffic is secure. With the Heartbleed flaw, traffic was subject to snooping even if the padlock had been closed.
The problem affects only the variant of SSL/TLS known as OpenSSL, but that happens to be one of the most common on the Internet.
Researchers at Codenomicon say that OpenSSL is used by two of the most widely used Web server software, Apache and nginx. That means many websites potentially have this security flaw. OpenSSL is also used to secure email, chats and virtual private networks, which are used by employees to connect securely with corporate networks.
Despite the worries, Codenomicon said many large consumer sites don't have the problem because of their "conservative choice" of equipment and software. "Ironically smaller and more progressive services or those who have upgraded to (the) latest and best encryption will be affected most," the security firm added.
A fix came out Monday, but affected websites and service providers must install the update.
Yahoo's Tumblr blogging service uses OpenSSL. In a blog post Tuesday, officials at the service said they had no evidence of any breach and had immediately implemented the fix.
"But this still means that the little lock icon (HTTPS) we all trusted to keep our passwords, personal emails, and credit cards safe, was actually making all that private information accessible to anyone who knew about the exploit," Tumblr's blog post read. "This might be a good day to call in sick and take some time to change your passwords everywhere — especially your high-security services like email, file storage, and banking, which may have been compromised by this bug."
Yahoo Inc. said its other services, including email, Flickr and search, also have the vulnerability. The company said some of the systems have already been fixed, while work is being done on the rest of Yahoo's websites.
The company reiterated its standard recommendation for people to change passwords regularly and to add a backup mobile number to the account. That number can be used to verify a user's identity if there are problems accessing the account because of hacking.

Yes, it's amazing how much security on the Internet is constructed on foundations of sand, 23 years (for example) after the writing of PGP.  Organizations such as the NSA and CIA should be required to show that they are pulling their own weight, by discovering and fixing these kinds of bugs.  After all, ostensibly they exist for the benefit of the citizenry of America, right?  I would question the raison d'etre of the NSA if it found itself more interested in maintaining the existence of security bugs, than of closing them.  The NSA can't claim that nobody else could find them or exploit them.
As for my idea about healthcare.gov vulnerability:  I thought of this many months ago, but I decided not to post it until the deadline had virtually expired.  (Although, it wasn't like I thought I was the only one who could imagine such a thing!).   I was amazed by the lack of discussion in the lamestream media about the potential vulnerabilities of people's personal data.  But, even more obvious to me was the fact that healthcare.gov virtually invited people to enter false data: It refused to provide people information about health care plans until they had entered their own personal information.  A person would be motivated to enter a mostly-fake set of data, solely for the purpose of getting access to the plans.
And, there was a potential 'innocent reason':  Systems like this might get 'stuck', making it difficult to correct data, and people might be tempted to initiate a new account, solely for the purpose of abandoning old data.    I realized that depending on how well healthcare.gov had been written, a cracker with a script could upload thousands or even over a million accounts, presumably for the purpose of making the account-numbers look good.

The major flaw that I see with this case (and others like it) is that it presumes that the defendants actually BELIEVED the statements by the police, and RELIED ON them.  From the article:
"Still, undercover officers with the U.S. Secret Service and Miami Beach police told both clearly that they wanted to buy bitcoins with cash supposedly generated by the hacking of Target Corp. customer information. The undercover officers said during the secretly videotaped meetings that they planned to use the bitcoins to acquire still more stolen credit cards."
I could 'clearly tell' somebody that the Sun orbited the Earth, but that doesn't mean that the statement was factual.  Similarly, the fact that the police told these guys what the article claims they did, doesn't require that the defendants actually BELIEVED the allegations.  My expectation is that these charges will be quietly dropped:  The only ones actually committing the crime(s) are the police themselves:  The police solicited money laundering, when there were no facts (actual underlying crimes) supporting the money laundering predicate.
       Jim Bell
MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Two police officers burst through a hotel room door with guns drawn, yelling "Police! Get Down!" just after an alleged money laundering transaction went down. But instead of briefcases stuffed with a drug dealer's cash, this exchange involved an undercover officer with supposedly stolen credit cards and the virtual currency bitcoin.
The February arrests of Pascal Reid and Michell Espinoza marked the first time any state has brought money laundering charges involving bitcoins, according to Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle. And it's likely to be a closely-watched test of whether criminal law can adapt to new digital forms of payment.
"These cybercriminals are way ahead of the rest of us in terms of trying to figure out ways they can launder dirty money," Rundle said.
Investigators trolled through an online directory of bitcoin traders to find the 29-year-old Reid and 30-year-old Espinoza, setting up separate meetings with each of the men at restaurants and coffee shops. They were arrested at the same Miami Beach hotel on the same day, at different times.
Defense attorneys said the men have no previous criminal records and were simply enthusiasts of the payment format that allows people to convert cash into digital money for online transactions.
Still, undercover officers with the U.S. Secret Service and Miami Beach police told both clearly that they wanted to buy bitcoins with cash supposedly generated by the hacking of Target Corp. customer information. The undercover officers said during the secretly videotaped meetings that they planned to use the bitcoins to acquire still more stolen credit cards.
"My client has never dealt in the area of stolen credit cards," said Espinoza's attorney, Rene Palomino Jr. "My client was simply selling a piece of personal property, which is what a bitcoin is. It has not been recognized as currency yet in the United States."Attorneys for Reid and Espinoza, both of whom have pleaded not guilty, say they will challenge the very legal foundations of the cases, which are being prosecuted separately. The arrest affidavits for both Reid and Espinoza refer to bitcoins as "electronic currency with no central authority."
The Internal Revenue Service issued guidance last month concluding that bitcoins can only be taxed as property and are not legal tender. Federal law enforcement agencies are watching whether bitcoins are used increasingly in criminal activity, such as the now-defunct Silk Road illegal drug marketplace.
"The idea that illicit actors might exploit the vulnerabilities of virtual currency to launder money is not merely theoretical," said Jennifer Shasky Calvery, director of Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, in a recent Florida speech to bankers.
Still, bitcoins have been gaining popularity among mainstream businesses. Overstock.com recently became the first major retailer to accept digital money and the NBA's Sacramento Kings in January announced the team would accept bitcoins, another first. They are increasingly used in restaurants, coffee shops and elsewhere.
The Latin House Grill in Coral Gables is one of the first South Florida restaurants to accept bitcoins and has been hosting meetings to educate people.Bitcoin users exchange cash for digital money using online exchanges, then store it in a computer program that serves as a wallet. The program can transfer payments directly to merchants or individuals around the world, eliminating transaction fees and the need for bank or credit card information.
"This technology can't go away. It's completely disrupted a lot of existing technology that's archaic, that hasn't evolved," said patron Andrew Barnard, who has been using bitcoins for a year.
In the Florida criminal case, Reid and Espinoza each face up to 25 years in prison if convicted of money laundering and engaging in an unlicensed money services business. Reid is free on $100,000 bail but Espinoza has been unable so far to make bail.
The transactions started small — one payment of $500 translated into about half a bitcoin — and eventually built to a proposed swap involving $30,000 in Reid's case.
"Ice cold money. Ice cold cash. Right out of the freezer," the undercover agent, holding a plastic bag of cash tells Reid on the surveillance tape. Just after Reid accepts the bag, the undercover agent says, "We're cooking with gas," an apparent signal to the officers outside to come in.
"You're a cop?" Reid is heard saying on the tape. "You're a cop?"
Reid attorney Ron Lowy said the prosecution was manufactured.
"The government is frightened of bitcoin. Apparently, they see it as an emerging, new type of economic medium of exchange, and they're worried that they're not regulating it close enough," Lowy said. "These facts do not constitute a crime."

   Should this idea be patentable?  Is it new?  I haven't heard of it.   Is it useful?  It is now clear why it would be useful...now!!!   Is it 'un-obvious'?  Well, despite the fact that I just thought of it a month ago, and I had never heard it proposed before, I wonder why it shouldn't be called 'obvious'.  If anything, I think it's amazing that it hasn't been implemented before.  People who work in aeronautics and electronics are smart and imaginative...at least I thought they were...until now?
It should also be possible to include in the ping, information  (transmitted by pulse-position information) about the last lat/lon received by the aircraft.

White House, spy agencies deny NSA exploited 'Heartbleed' bug 
photoSecurity experts warn there is little Internet users can do to protect themselve\WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House and U.S. intelligence agencies said on Friday neither the National Security Agency nor any other part of the government were aware before this month of the "Heartbleed" bug, denying a report that the spy agency exploited the glitch in widely used Web encryption technology to gather intelligence.
The White House, the NSA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued statements after Bloomberg reported that the NSA was aware of the bug for at least two years and exploited it in order to obtain passwords and other basic information used in hacking operations. The Bloomberg report cited two unnamed sources it said were familiar with the matter.
The Heartbleed bug is considered one of the most serious Internet security flaws to be uncovered in recent years.
"Reports that NSA or any other part of the government were aware of the so-called Heartbleed vulnerability before April 2014 are wrong," White House National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said in a statement.
"This administration takes seriously its responsibility to help maintain an open, interoperable, secure and reliable Internet," Hayden added.
Bloomberg was not immediately available to comment.
The discovery of Heartbleed by researchers with Google Inc and a small security firm, Codenomicon, prompted the U.S. Homeland Security Department to advise businesses on Tuesday to review their servers to see if they were using vulnerable versions of widely used software known as OpenSSL.
OpenSSL is used to encrypt email and other communications and to protect the websites of big Internet companies, including Facebook Inc, Google Inc and Yahoo Inc. The bug, disclosed Monday, allows hackers to steal data without a trace.
NSA spokeswoman Vanee Vines said in a separate statement: "NSA was not aware of the recently identified vulnerability in OpenSSL, the so-called Heartbleed vulnerability, until it was made public in a private-sector cybersecurity report."
Hayden said the federal government relies on OpenSSL to protect the privacy of users of government websites and other online services. "If the federal government, including the intelligence community, had discovered this vulnerability prior to last week, it would have been disclosed to the community responsible for OpenSSL," Hayden added.
Hayden said that when U.S. agencies discover a new vulnerability in commercial and open-source software, "it is in the national interest to responsibly disclose the vulnerability rather than to hold it for an investigative or intelligence purpose." Such vulnerabilities are known as "zero-day" flaws because the software developers have had zero days to fix them.
In December, a five-member advisory panel convened to review electronic surveillance policy urged the White House to sharply curtail the use of undisclosed flaws and stop undercutting encryption standards. The panel included former White House cybersecurity advisor Richard Clarke.
In late February, a senior White House official said the Obama administration was intensively studying both issues.
The administration statements issued on Friday confirmed that the review had already "reinvigorated an interagency process for deciding when to share vulnerabilities" on a case-by-case basis.
The activities of the NSA have come under sharp scrutiny since former agency contractor Edward Snowden leaked numerous documents exposing expansive U.S. surveillance efforts.
Even before Snowden's emergence, former officials, including Clarke, told Reuters that offensive and spying considerations had dominated inside the NSA, causing it to withhold information instead of warning the public about new flaws.
Clarke told Reuters Friday that the NSA had not known of Heartbleed.
The U.S. government warned banks and other businesses on Friday to be on alert for hackers seeking to steal data exposed by the bug, as a German programmer who volunteered with OpenSSL took responsibility for inadvertently launching the security crisis.

I would think that at some point, the NSA would become too embarrassed to admit that they HADN'T discovered and employed such an exploit!
Which leads me to a question:  Presumably, the NSA has billions of emails locked up in Utah, or wherever they had previously used as a data-store.  Does the revelation of the Heartbleed bug mean that the NSA could have quickly logged onto millions of accounts, read emails in the clear, etc?

I strongly doubt the part about reading the newspaper from orbit.  I don't doubt that the pattern of text and pictures on the  front page could be identified from orbit.

The best prospect to improve on this resolution would be to use a 'multiple-mirror-telescope' technology.  Light-gathering capability isn't important in this application; high resolution is.  Making a spy-telescope out of a few different mirrors, held precisely many meters apart, could conceivable achieve resolutions substantially greater than this.

I sure find that difficult to imagine!  Particularly because the assemblage would presumably be flying at about 500 kilometers altitude, and would therefore be buffeted by extremely-small-but-significant orbital winds.  In addition, the amount of information that would have to be interchanged (phase and amplitude, in TWO dimensions!) of an entire field of view would be phenomenal.  
What I suspect the US military would really like to see is a spy satellite at geosync altitude (22,000 miles) with an apparent aperture of perhaps 150 meters, so that it has roughly the same resolution on the ground as existing fast-orbital spy satellites.  (orbital period circa 90 minutes or so).

Curiously, I just saw this article:   (
The United States military's advanced research arm is working on a foldable space telescope that could image Earth in high resolution at a relatively low cost.
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) says the telescope design — known as theMembrane Optical Imager for Real-Time Exploitation, or MOIRE — would be of great use in geosynchronous Earth orbit, the spot 22,000 miles (35,000 kilometers) up where most telecommunications satellites reside.
"Membrane optics could enable us to fit much larger, higher-resolution telescopes in smaller and lighter packages," Lt. Col. Larry Gunn, MOIRE program manager, said in a statement. [Giant Space Telescopes of the Future (Infographic)]
"In that respect, we’re ‘breaking the glass ceiling’ that traditional materials impose on optics design," Gunn added. "We’re hoping our research could also help greatly reduce overall costs and enable more timely deployment using smaller, less expensive launch vehicles."
MOIRE is now in Phase 2 of development since work began in 2010. When this phase is completed, a 16-foot (5 meters) prototype of the telescope's mirror should be completed for ground testing. No space missions have been set for MOIRE yet, DARPA officials said.
There are both advantages and disadvantages to the MOIRE design. The membrane is not as efficient as the usual glass, but it is lighter — which allows prime contractor Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. to make larger lenses to increase the telescope's efficiency. DARPA estimates that a membrane system should weigh 86 percent less than a more traditional system of the same resolution and mass.w gallery
Most telescopes either reflect light (using mirrors) or refract it (using lenses), but MOIRE's behaves differently. Each membrane will instead diffract light using a piece of equipment known as a Fresnel lens.
"It is etched with circular concentric grooves like microscopically thin tree rings, with the grooves hundreds of microns across at the center down to only 4 microns at the outside edge," DARPA officials said in a statement. "The diffractive pattern focuses light on a sensor that the satellite translates into an image."
If the design ever reaches orbit, DARPA envisions the membrane stretching to 66 feet (20 meters) in diameter — about eight times the diameter of the Hubble Space Telescope and more than three times bigger than the mirror for NASA's huge James Webb Space Telescope, which is scheduled to launch in 2018.
The membranes would ride to space as "petals" packed into a tight package about 20 feet (6 m) wide, small enough to fit on a rocket. These petals would then unfurl in orbit, and provide an estimated resolution of 3.3 feet (1 m).

Group of people who burgled the FBI in 1971
On March 8, 1971, a group of anti-war activists broke into an FBI office in Media, Pennsylvania, and changed the course of history.
The burglars wound up blowing the whistle on illegal surveillance and bullying tactics employed by J. Edgar Hoover and his government agency — and despite one of the biggest FBI dragnets ever, the perpetrators were never caught and their identities remained secret… until now.
The new documentary "1971" reveals these former political radicals as they tell their story on film for the first time. At the time of the break-in, anti-war activists believed they were being watched by the FBI. Bonnie and John Raines, a married couple with three children, had participated in rallies and were photographed by suspected govenment agents. That prompted them to join the group, which eventually swiped more than 1,000 documents.
Billing themselves as 'The Citizens Commission to Investigate the FBI,' the members took serious risks to deliver the stolen FBI documents to the press. "We knew that if we got caught, we were going to face very serious prison time," says John Raines in the film (as seen in the trailer)."If the FBI was suppressing dissent, it was as important to expose that as it was to end the war," says journalist Betty Medsger, who is responsible for exposing the burglars's identities. She wrote the new book "The Burglary" and worked closely with "1971" filmmakers.
"Break into an FBI office, remove files, and mail them to newspapers," says Bonnie Raines of the plan. It was not haphazard. They cased the FBI building in Media for weeks, tracking comings and goings and drawing up detailed maps and a plan.
Multiple setbacks nearly halted the operation. "A couple of weeks before the break-in date, one person in the group dropped out — simply walked away. This person knew every detail of their plans. The risk that he would expose them was huge. They went ahead anyway," says "1971" director and producer Johanna Hamilton. "The break-in itself almost didn't happen. When the chief lock-picker arrived, he found the lock on the FBI's door was different than the one he had been practicing for. So the whole process was much more complicated and tenuous than they originally thought," she tells Yahoo Movies.
Once the documents were taken, the group spent days scanning them to find evidence of FBI wrongdoing, according to a recent New York Times report. They sent copies of the most revealing documents to journalists, one of whom was Medsger of the Washington Post. She was one of few journalists who acted on the information.
The biggest discovery was finding that Hoover ran a covert operation with the code name COINTELPRO, under which the FBI would survey, infiltrate, discredit, and disrupt political groups and U.S. citizens deemed "subversive." Much of the activity was illegal.
The burglary which exposed COINTELPRO led to the first-ever congressional investigation of U.S. intelligence agencies, and as a result the operation was terminated.The documents revealed that a wide array of postal workers, police, and even switchboard operators were used as FBI informants. Martin Luther King Jr. was a major target of COINTELPRO, with agents having him under surveillance and repeatedly bugging his home and hotel rooms.
"What is consistently amazing to me is the fact that only one of the documents they stole contained the caption COINTELPRO. It was that one document that would lead to the full revelation of FBI dirty tricks," says Hamilton.
Another stunning revelation: Hoover's program had been running since 1956. "By 1971 so many people and groups had been put under surveillance," says Hamilton. "Basically there was blanket surveillance of African Americans — both well known, like the Black Panthers, and less known, everyday people, students, people who were active in communal African-American life."
"1971" debuts at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York on April 18.

A revolutionary new method of encrypting confidential information has been patented by scientists at Lancaster University.
Read more at: 
They have been inspired by their discoveries from human biology, which model how the heart and lungs coordinate their rhythms by passing information between each other.
A mathematical model based on the complex interaction between these organs has now been transferred to the world of modern communications. 
This discovery could transform daily life which is reliant on secure electronic communications for everything from mobiles to sensor networks and the internet.
Every device, from your car key to online bank account, contains different identification codes enabling information to be transferred in confidence. But the race to outwit the hackers means there is a continual demand for better encryption methods.
Inspiration for the new method of encryption came from interdisciplinary research in the Physics Department ( by Dr Tomislav Stankovski, Professor Peter McClintock, and Professor Aneta Stefanovska, and the patent includes Dr Robert Young.
Professor McClintock commented that this is a significant discovery.
He said: "This promises an encryption scheme that is so nearly unbreakable that it will be equally unwelcome to internet criminals and official eavesdroppers."
Professor Stefanovska emphasized the interdisciplinary aspect: "As so often happens with important breakthroughs, this discovery was made right on the boundary between two different subjects – because we were applying physics to biology."
Dr Stankovski said: "Here we offer a novel encryption scheme derived from biology, radically different from any earlier procedure. Inspired by the time-varying nature of the cardio-respiratory coupling functions recently discovered in humans, we propose a new encryption scheme that is highly resistant to conventional methods of attack."
The advantage of this discovery is that it offers an infinite number of choices for the secret encryption key shared between the sender and receiver. This makes it virtually impossible for hackers and eavesdroppers to crack the code.
The new method is exceptionally resistant to interference from the random fluctuations or "noise" which affects all communications systems.
It can also transmit several different information streams simultaneously, enabling all the digital devices in the home, for example, to operate on one encryption key instead of dozens of different ones.

@_subject: Acoustic bugging of computers 
(Phys.org) —A trio of researchers in Israel has discovered that it is possible to crack 4096-bit RSA encryption keys using a microphone to listen to high-pitch noises generated by internal computer components. Adi Shamir (co-inventor of RSA), Daniel Genkin and Eran Tromer have published a research paper describing the technique on a Tel Aviv University server.
Read more at: 
Computers make noises, the researchers explain, far beyond the whirring of the fan. The CPU, for example, emits a high pitched noise as it operates, fluctuating depending on which operations it is performing—other components do likewise. Suspecting that they might be able to exploit this characteristic of computers, the researchers set about creating software to interpret noise data obtained using simple microphones and very little other equipment. They also focused exclusively on trying to achieve one single feat: deciphering an RSA encryption key. After much trial and effort, the researchers found it could be done without much effort.
Listening and detecting the noise made by a computer as it processes a single character in an encryption key would be impossible, of course, so the researchers devised a method that causes the noise to be repeated enough times in a row to enable capture of its signal. And that can only happen if the attacker is able to send a cyphertext to the machine that is to be attacked and have it processed. The cyphertext contains code that causes looping. By listening to how the computer processes the cyphertext, the researchers can map the noises made by the computer as it crunches different characters, thereby allowing encryption keys sent by others to be cracked.
What's perhaps most frightening about this method is how easily it can be ported to various machines. The researchers found, for example, that by using a laptop and simple hardware and software they were able to crack encryption keys on a second laptop. Next, they did the same thing using a cell phone as the listening device. They suggest it could also be packaged completely in software and sent out as malware, hacking encryption keys on infected devices and sending them back to the hacker.
As a side-note, the researchers also found that low-bandwidth attacks on computers are also possible by measuring the electrical potential of a computer's chassis while the circuitry is busy doing its work.

Well, I posted the article, but don't necessarily ratify the content.  However, I have never had much confidence in the RF (radio-frequency) security of computers.  That point was driven home to me in mid 1977, when I built a microprocessor-trainer board called a "Dyna Micro"         It was uncased, and I ran it near an AM/FM radio.  While listening to the AM band, away from an active station, it made numerous audio sounds as it went through the program of the keyboard scanner and programs that I entered.  It was obvious that information could be transfered by RF, although at the time I wasn't particularly concerned about the possibility.
In about 1983, I visited Washington DC, and attended some sort of military electronics convention (invited by a customer of my company, SemiDisk Systems, Inc) and I was introduced to the concept of "Tempest" shielding. 
In the summer of 2002, while a guest at the "Gated Community" of USP Atwater, California, I worked for the Federal Prison Industries ("Unicor") tearing apart electronic hardware, mostly computer monitors.  I was the only person there, either prisoner or staff, who understood what the parts were which were on the boards.  Very rarely, a computer monitor came through which I recognized was a shielded, "Tempest"-grade monitor.

Passwords vulnerable after security flaw found
By ANICK JESDANUN
6 hours ago
NEW YORK (AP) — Passwords, credit cards and other sensitive data are at risk after security researchers discovered a problem with an encryption technology used to securely transmit email, e-commerce transactions, social networking posts and other Web traffic.
Related Stories
Security researchers say the threat, known as Heartbleed, is serious, partly because it remained undiscovered for more two years. Attackers can exploit the vulnerability without leaving any trace, so anything sent during that time has potentially been compromised. It's not known, though, whether anyone has actually used it to conduct an attack.
Researchers are advising people to change all of their passwords.
The flaw was discovered independently in recent days by researchers at Google Inc. and the Finnish security firm Codenomicon.
The breach involves SSL/TLS, an encryption technology marked by the small, closed padlock and "https:" on Web browsers to signify that traffic is secure. With the Heartbleed flaw, traffic was subject to snooping even if the padlock had been closed.
The problem affects only the variant of SSL/TLS known as OpenSSL, but that happens to be one of the most common on the Internet.
Researchers at Codenomicon say that OpenSSL is used by two of the most widely used Web server software, Apache and nginx. That means many websites potentially have this security flaw. OpenSSL is also used to secure email, chats and virtual private networks, which are used by employees to connect securely with corporate networks.
Despite the worries, Codenomicon said many large consumer sites don't have the problem because of their "conservative choice" of equipment and software. "Ironically smaller and more progressive services or those who have upgraded to (the) latest and best encryption will be affected most," the security firm added.
A fix came out Monday, but affected websites and service providers must install the update.
Yahoo's Tumblr blogging service uses OpenSSL. In a blog post Tuesday, officials at the service said they had no evidence of any breach and had immediately implemented the fix.
"But this still means that the little lock icon (HTTPS) we all trusted to keep our passwords, personal emails, and credit cards safe, was actually making all that private information accessible to anyone who knew about the exploit," Tumblr's blog post read. "This might be a good day to call in sick and take some time to change your passwords everywhere — especially your high-security services like email, file storage, and banking, which may have been compromised by this bug."
Yahoo Inc. said its other services, including email, Flickr and search, also have the vulnerability. The company said some of the systems have already been fixed, while work is being done on the rest of Yahoo's websites.
The company reiterated its standard recommendation for people to change passwords regularly and to add a backup mobile number to the account. That number can be used to verify a user's identity if there are problems accessing the account because of hacking.

Yes, it's amazing how much security on the Internet is constructed on foundations of sand, 23 years (for example) after the writing of PGP.  Organizations such as the NSA and CIA should be required to show that they are pulling their own weight, by discovering and fixing these kinds of bugs.  After all, ostensibly they exist for the benefit of the citizenry of America, right?  I would question the raison d'etre of the NSA if it found itself more interested in maintaining the existence of security bugs, than of closing them.  The NSA can't claim that nobody else could find them or exploit them.
As for my idea about healthcare.gov vulnerability:  I thought of this many months ago, but I decided not to post it until the deadline had virtually expired.  (Although, it wasn't like I thought I was the only one who could imagine such a thing!).   I was amazed by the lack of discussion in the lamestream media about the potential vulnerabilities of people's personal data.  But, even more obvious to me was the fact that healthcare.gov virtually invited people to enter false data: It refused to provide people information about health care plans until they had entered their own personal information.  A person would be motivated to enter a mostly-fake set of data, solely for the purpose of getting access to the plans.
And, there was a potential 'innocent reason':  Systems like this might get 'stuck', making it difficult to correct data, and people might be tempted to initiate a new account, solely for the purpose of abandoning old data.    I realized that depending on how well healthcare.gov had been written, a cracker with a script could upload thousands or even over a million accounts, presumably for the purpose of making the account-numbers look good.

The major flaw that I see with this case (and others like it) is that it presumes that the defendants actually BELIEVED the statements by the police, and RELIED ON them.  From the article:

I could 'clearly tell' somebody that the Sun orbited the Earth, but that doesn't mean that the statement was factual.  Similarly, the fact that the police told these guys what the article claims they did, doesn't require that the defendants actually BELIEVED the allegations.  My expectation is that these charges will be quietly dropped:  The only ones actually committing the crime(s) are the police themselves:  The police solicited money laundering, when there were no facts (actual underlying crimes) supporting the money laundering predicate.

MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Two police officers burst through a hotel room door with guns drawn, yelling "Police! Get Down!" just after an alleged money laundering transaction went down. But instead of briefcases stuffed with a drug dealer's cash, this exchange involved an undercover officer with supposedly stolen credit cards and the virtual currency bitcoin.
The February arrests of Pascal Reid and Michell Espinoza marked the first time any state has brought money laundering charges involving bitcoins, according to Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle. And it's likely to be a closely-watched test of whether criminal law can adapt to new digital forms of payment.
"These cybercriminals are way ahead of the rest of us in terms of trying to figure out ways they can launder dirty money," Rundle said.
Investigators trolled through an online directory of bitcoin traders to find the 29-year-old Reid and 30-year-old Espinoza, setting up separate meetings with each of the men at restaurants and coffee shops. They were arrested at the same Miami Beach hotel on the same day, at different times.
Defense attorneys said the men have no previous criminal records and were simply enthusiasts of the payment format that allows people to convert cash into digital money for online transactions.
Still, undercover officers with the U.S. Secret Service and Miami Beach police told both clearly that they wanted to buy bitcoins with cash supposedly generated by the hacking of Target Corp. customer information. The undercover officers said during the secretly videotaped meetings that they planned to use the bitcoins to acquire still more stolen credit cards.
"My client has never dealt in the area of stolen credit cards," said Espinoza's attorney, Rene Palomino Jr. "My client was simply selling a piece of personal property, which is what a bitcoin is. It has not been recognized as currency yet in the United States."Attorneys for Reid and Espinoza, both of whom have pleaded not guilty, say they will challenge the very legal foundations of the cases, which are being prosecuted separately. The arrest affidavits for both Reid and Espinoza refer to bitcoins as "electronic currency with no central authority."
The Internal Revenue Service issued guidance last month concluding that bitcoins can only be taxed as property and are not legal tender. Federal law enforcement agencies are watching whether bitcoins are used increasingly in criminal activity, such as the now-defunct Silk Road illegal drug marketplace.
"The idea that illicit actors might exploit the vulnerabilities of virtual currency to launder money is not merely theoretical," said Jennifer Shasky Calvery, director of Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, in a recent Florida speech to bankers.
Still, bitcoins have been gaining popularity among mainstream businesses. Overstock.com recently became the first major retailer to accept digital money and the NBA's Sacramento Kings in January announced the team would accept bitcoins, another first. They are increasingly used in restaurants, coffee shops and elsewhere.
The Latin House Grill in Coral Gables is one of the first South Florida restaurants to accept bitcoins and has been hosting meetings to educate people.Bitcoin users exchange cash for digital money using online exchanges, then store it in a computer program that serves as a wallet. The program can transfer payments directly to merchants or individuals around the world, eliminating transaction fees and the need for bank or credit card information.
"This technology can't go away. It's completely disrupted a lot of existing technology that's archaic, that hasn't evolved," said patron Andrew Barnard, who has been using bitcoins for a year.
In the Florida criminal case, Reid and Espinoza each face up to 25 years in prison if convicted of money laundering and engaging in an unlicensed money services business. Reid is free on $100,000 bail but Espinoza has been unable so far to make bail.
The transactions started small — one payment of $500 translated into about half a bitcoin — and eventually built to a proposed swap involving $30,000 in Reid's case.
"Ice cold money. Ice cold cash. Right out of the freezer," the undercover agent, holding a plastic bag of cash tells Reid on the surveillance tape. Just after Reid accepts the bag, the undercover agent says, "We're cooking with gas," an apparent signal to the officers outside to come in.
"You're a cop?" Reid is heard saying on the tape. "You're a cop?"
Reid attorney Ron Lowy said the prosecution was manufactured.
"The government is frightened of bitcoin. Apparently, they see it as an emerging, new type of economic medium of exchange, and they're worried that they're not regulating it close enough," Lowy said. "These facts do not constitute a crime."

White House, spy agencies deny NSA exploited 'Heartbleed' bug 
photoSecurity experts warn there is little Internet users can do to protect themselve\WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House and U.S. intelligence agencies said on Friday neither the National Security Agency nor any other part of the government were aware before this month of the "Heartbleed" bug, denying a report that the spy agency exploited the glitch in widely used Web encryption technology to gather intelligence.
The White House, the NSA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued statements after Bloomberg reported that the NSA was aware of the bug for at least two years and exploited it in order to obtain passwords and other basic information used in hacking operations. The Bloomberg report cited two unnamed sources it said were familiar with the matter.
The Heartbleed bug is considered one of the most serious Internet security flaws to be uncovered in recent years.
"Reports that NSA or any other part of the government were aware of the so-called Heartbleed vulnerability before April 2014 are wrong," White House National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said in a statement.
"This administration takes seriously its responsibility to help maintain an open, interoperable, secure and reliable Internet," Hayden added.
Bloomberg was not immediately available to comment.
The discovery of Heartbleed by researchers with Google Inc and a small security firm, Codenomicon, prompted the U.S. Homeland Security Department to advise businesses on Tuesday to review their servers to see if they were using vulnerable versions of widely used software known as OpenSSL.
OpenSSL is used to encrypt email and other communications and to protect the websites of big Internet companies, including Facebook Inc, Google Inc and Yahoo Inc. The bug, disclosed Monday, allows hackers to steal data without a trace.
NSA spokeswoman Vanee Vines said in a separate statement: "NSA was not aware of the recently identified vulnerability in OpenSSL, the so-called Heartbleed vulnerability, until it was made public in a private-sector cybersecurity report."
Hayden said the federal government relies on OpenSSL to protect the privacy of users of government websites and other online services. "If the federal government, including the intelligence community, had discovered this vulnerability prior to last week, it would have been disclosed to the community responsible for OpenSSL," Hayden added.
Hayden said that when U.S. agencies discover a new vulnerability in commercial and open-source software, "it is in the national interest to responsibly disclose the vulnerability rather than to hold it for an investigative or intelligence purpose." Such vulnerabilities are known as "zero-day" flaws because the software developers have had zero days to fix them.
In December, a five-member advisory panel convened to review electronic surveillance policy urged the White House to sharply curtail the use of undisclosed flaws and stop undercutting encryption standards. The panel included former White House cybersecurity advisor Richard Clarke.
In late February, a senior White House official said the Obama administration was intensively studying both issues.
The administration statements issued on Friday confirmed that the review had already "reinvigorated an interagency process for deciding when to share vulnerabilities" on a case-by-case basis.
The activities of the NSA have come under sharp scrutiny since former agency contractor Edward Snowden leaked numerous documents exposing expansive U.S. surveillance efforts.
Even before Snowden's emergence, former officials, including Clarke, told Reuters that offensive and spying considerations had dominated inside the NSA, causing it to withhold information instead of warning the public about new flaws.
Clarke told Reuters Friday that the NSA had not known of Heartbleed.
The U.S. government warned banks and other businesses on Friday to be on alert for hackers seeking to steal data exposed by the bug, as a German programmer who volunteered with OpenSSL took responsibility for inadvertently launching the security crisis.

I would think that at some point, the NSA would become too embarrassed to admit that they HADN'T discovered and employed such an exploit!
Which leads me to a question:  Presumably, the NSA has billions of emails locked up in Utah, or wherever they had previously used as a data-store.  Does the revelation of the Heartbleed bug mean that the NSA could have quickly logged onto millions of accounts, read emails in the clear, etc?

I strongly doubt the part about reading the newspaper from orbit.  I don't doubt that the pattern of text and pictures on the  front page could be identified from orbit. ('Identifying the difference between Pravda and Izvestia'.)   An approximation I once heard is that a lens or mirror of about 4.5 inch in diameter can resolve an angle of one arc-second.  A mirror of the size of the Hubble Space Telescope (which I assume approximates that of the typical spy satellite today) is about 20x larger, so the resolution should be 20x better, or 1/20 arc-second.  That's 1/(57 degrees per radian)(3600arcseconds per degree)(20) = 1/4,100,000 radian.  From an altitude of 500 kilometers, that's about 1/8 of a meter, or 120 millimeter.  Maybe that's a pixel-pair, but it's far too large to resolve the text on a newspaper.  
The best prospect to improve on this resolution would be to use a 'multiple-mirror-telescope' technology.  Light-gathering capability isn't important in this application; high resolution is.  Making a spy-telescope out of a few different mirrors, held precisely many meters apart, could conceivable achieve resolutions substantially greater than this.

I sure find that difficult to imagine!  Particularly because the assemblage would presumably be flying at about 500 kilometers altitude, and would therefore be buffeted by extremely-small-but-significant orbital winds.  In addition, the amount of information that would have to be interchanged (phase and amplitude, in TWO dimensions!) of an entire field of view would be phenomenal.  
What I suspect the US military would really like to see is a spy satellite at geosync altitude (22,000 miles) with an apparent aperture of perhaps 150 meters, so that it has roughly the same resolution on the ground as existing fast-orbital spy satellites.  (orbital period circa 90 minutes or so).

Curiously, I just saw this article:   (
The United States military's advanced research arm is working on a foldable space telescope that could image Earth in high resolution at a relatively low cost.
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) says the telescope design — known as theMembrane Optical Imager for Real-Time Exploitation, or MOIRE — would be of great use in geosynchronous Earth orbit, the spot 22,000 miles (35,000 kilometers) up where most telecommunications satellites reside.
"Membrane optics could enable us to fit much larger, higher-resolution telescopes in smaller and lighter packages," Lt. Col. Larry Gunn, MOIRE program manager, said in a statement. [Giant Space Telescopes of the Future (Infographic)]
"In that respect, we’re ‘breaking the glass ceiling’ that traditional materials impose on optics design," Gunn added. "We’re hoping our research could also help greatly reduce overall costs and enable more timely deployment using smaller, less expensive launch vehicles."
MOIRE is now in Phase 2 of development since work began in 2010. When this phase is completed, a 16-foot (5 meters) prototype of the telescope's mirror should be completed for ground testing. No space missions have been set for MOIRE yet, DARPA officials said.
There are both advantages and disadvantages to the MOIRE design. The membrane is not as efficient as the usual glass, but it is lighter — which allows prime contractor Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. to make larger lenses to increase the telescope's efficiency. DARPA estimates that a membrane system should weigh 86 percent less than a more traditional system of the same resolution and mass.w gallery
Most telescopes either reflect light (using mirrors) or refract it (using lenses), but MOIRE's behaves differently. Each membrane will instead diffract light using a piece of equipment known as a Fresnel lens.
"It is etched with circular concentric grooves like microscopically thin tree rings, with the grooves hundreds of microns across at the center down to only 4 microns at the outside edge," DARPA officials said in a statement. "The diffractive pattern focuses light on a sensor that the satellite translates into an image."
If the design ever reaches orbit, DARPA envisions the membrane stretching to 66 feet (20 meters) in diameter — about eight times the diameter of the Hubble Space Telescope and more than three times bigger than the mirror for NASA's huge James Webb Space Telescope, which is scheduled to launch in 2018.
The membranes would ride to space as "petals" packed into a tight package about 20 feet (6 m) wide, small enough to fit on a rocket. These petals would then unfurl in orbit, and provide an estimated resolution of 3.3 feet (1 m).

@_subject: Jim Bell's Email crash:  Why not sue Yahoo AND the NSA? 
I just received a seeming 'boilerplate' (pre-canned) email from Yahoo email, saying that my previous account  (jamesdbell8  will be deleted.  It does not repeat the previous claim of "abuse" on the account, but the timing of the events strongly suggests that the source of the problem was an attack on probably millions of Yahoo email addresses that has occurred over the last week or so.  Naturally, I am completely outraged that they allowed such an event to result in actual loss of 'all' data in the account.  Could it be that Yahoo's system was truly damaged so seriously as to cause the complete loss of my email and address-list database?
    However, I am reminded of the old saying, "If you get lemons, make lemonade".   Because of Edward Snowden's revelations, we have known that the NSA has been storing all domestic, and probably as many foreign, emails as they could get their grubby little hands on.   Why not a class-action lawsuit demanding that Yahoo obtain prior emails from the NSA?
     While it is difficult to sue the US (primarily due to something called "Sovereign Immunity"),  I am aware that the Federal government has already waived Sovereign immunity for everything except money damages.  (In other words, you can sue them for 'declaratory' and 'injunctive' relief:  A court could order the NSA to deliver the data back to Yahoo.)        Does anyone out in the Wide World of Cypherpunks know of an attorney wanting to take on this kind of issue?  It could put the NSA in a world of hurt for taking the data, and make them realize that one consequence of taking hold of such a massive amount of data is that they will ultimately be sued if it is necessary to recover.  It would also put email providers such as Yahoo on notice that they have additional obligations (other than those they think they have) to recover lost emails.

@_subject: Yet another interesting take on assassination markets. 
See the article by Tomasz.Wegrzanowski   (Spell that 5 times really fast!)
    I'd praise this guy's take on assassination markets, but since 90% of it is virtually identical to my own from January 1995 (before I'd published Part 1 of AP), that would pretty much be me patting myself on the back.      Even so, there are some things on which we disagree:  For example, TAW (Tomasz Wegrzanowski) says he believes that today's 'assassination markets' are probably scams.  (I know only of Sanjuro's "Assassination Market", and David's DPL, or Digital Prediction Lottery; Technically, DPL doesn't label itself as an 'assassination market', but for purposes of my analysis I will label it one.)  It is hypothetically possible that either or both of these are some government honey-pot, although I don't think so.  I have previously pointed out that I see little reason for any government to, now, promote a system similar to my AP idea, particularly when I wasn't promoting AP itself since my release from the Federal governments' 'gated communities' in March 2012.  Indeed, to do so would have been about as much a mistake as 2003's FutureMAP system. 
       (And I'm not implying FutureMAP was a bad idea; rather I think that to float the idea as they did led to so much negative reaction that they had to withdraw it, amazingly within one day too!)
     But I also don't believe that either system is likely to be a money- (Bitcoin-) seeking scam, either.  The reason is based on Game theory.  Imagine somebody starts up an AP-type operation.  Imagine further that it is acting is what I'd call a 'healthy' fashion, actively collecting at least dozens of hundreds of individual donations per day.   (This would be strongly impeded if the system collected minimum  donations of 1.0 BTC, like Sanjuro's system started out doing , or it was somehow not sufficiently easy to use, or it did not provide the various proofs of operational security sufficient to induce confidence in potential donors.)  I think if it was 'working', such a system would quickly develop hundreds of target-names, albeit some with tiny reward amounts,  and would certainly collect enough donations within, say, three months to raise the bounties to a level sufficient to result in at least one, uh, 'hit'.  Prior to that, many
 potential donors would still hold back, either because they weren't confident that somebody would be rewarded, or they would wait to see if something 'happened'.
     But suppose that one 'hit' occurred.  Suppose the system demonstrated that some unknown-named person had correctly predicted the date of death of the person listed. (This should be unavoidable:  It should not be possible for the system to conceal the existence of a correct donation; in any case, the public and all potential future donors would insist on the exposure of all relevant donations naming that particular target.) Would the operator 'defect' or 'cooperate' (both are terms used in Game Theory.)  Would the operator of that system actually pay the stated  amount, or would he refuse?  (I am assuming that the system was at least set up to have the technical ability to prove, to the public, that the reward had been paid to the correct predictor.)     To me, it is obvious that if the operator indeed pays the reward, and this fact can be proven to the public without revealing the true name of the correct predictor, for every Bitcoin paid out as a reward, this confidence-building measure will result in at least tens, and probably many hundreds of Bitcoins of further donations from other themselves naming other targets.  In other words, at that point it would become totally illogical for the system operator  to 'defect', to refuse to pay a (relatively) small donation, because by doing that he would be foregoing further donations that would be collectively hundreds of times larger.  (Nobody would donate to a system which provably refused to pay on a correction 'prediction', or failed to sufficiently disprove the non-payment of the reward.)        This same analysis would apply after the second 'hit', and the third, and the fourth, etc.  At no point, I think, would the 'assassination market' system operator find it financially more advantageous to refuse to pay the reward, than to pay it and remain in operation and collect far more donations.  He will always be better off by paying the reward.
    There is, however, one exception that I can think of to this analysis.  A person (or persons, or a government) might conceivably run an 'AM'-type organization, for a while, specifically for the purpose of discrediting the entire concept of AP.  That person might run the system, for a while, even paying off one, or a dozen or two, predictions, and collect a substantial reward in the process, eventually intending to run away, thereby leading to 'fear, uncertainty, and doubt' over the question of whether a credible 'AP'-type system could exist.  The big problem, for that person, is that by doing so he would be inadvertently demonstrating the proper (for awhile) functioning, and effect of, that system.  Once demonstrated to work, for that period of time, it would become obvious that such a system could, indeed, function 'properly' if the person or people involved are motivated to do so.  And, there would be nothing they could do about stopping
 credible, reliable people from initiating and running an honest AP-type organization.  Eventually, reputable systems would win out, because they would build up the longevity leading confidence as to their offers.

It appears that these agencies are trying to teach their staff a way to commit a crime, let's call it "obstruction of justice".  In any criminal prosecution, the defense is entitled to receive various kinds of information, see 'Brady material',   .   My understanding is that the government is required to disclose to the defendant (and his attorney) any potentially exculpatory information.  This could include the method and manner the government obtained the evidence in question.  Similar is 'Jencks material',    , and 'Giglio material',      The purpose of obstructing access to the source of the information is to prevent the defense from identifying and questioning the validity of the information, and to prevent the defense from impeaching witnesses who may otherwise want to remain anonymous.       The prosecution may want to hide behind their putative ignorance of the information, because it is in the hands of some government agency, but I believe that the prosecution is required to investigate and determine such contacts even if they weren't initially aware of them.  The problem is that the prosecution doesn't actually do that, in many cases.  If the defense learns of the possible true source of that information, they can demand that the material be provided, but if they don't get a relevant disclosure, they might not even know what to ask.

At some point, hopefully quite soon, people will see the futility of running a "Silk-Road-type" site, without equipping it with some form of proactive security, perhaps 'AP' or Sanjuro's 'Assassination Market'.

President Merkin Muffley: How is it possible for this thing to be triggered automatically and at the same time impossible to untrigger? 
Dr. Strangelove: Mr. President, it is not only possible, it is essential. That is the whole idea of this machine, you know. Deterrence is the art of producing in the mind of the enemy... the FEAR to attack. And so, because of the automated and irrevocable decision-making process which rules out human meddling, the Doomsday machine is terrifying and simple to understand... and completely credible and convincing.

Here's what Tom Lehrer had to say about "Research".  (From the song, "Nicolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky", circa 1964)
"Be that as it may, some of you may have had occasion to run into mathematicians and to wonder therefore how they got that way, and here, in partial explanation perhaps, is the story of the great Russian mathematician Nicolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky. 
Who made me the genius I am today,
The mathematician that others all quote,
Who's the professor that made me that way?
The greatest that ever got chalk on his coat.
One man deserves the credit,
One man deserves the blame,
And Nicolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky is his name.
Nicolai Ivanovich Lobach-
I am never forget the day I first meet the great Lobachevsky.
In one word he told me secret of success in mathematics:
Let no one else's work evade your eyes,
Remember why the good Lord made your eyes,
So don't shade your eyes,
But plagiarize, plagiarize, plagiarize -
Only be sure always to call it please 'research'.

@_subject: Jim Bell's Email crash:  Why not sue Yahoo AND the NSA? 
I just received a seeming 'boilerplate' (pre-canned) email from Yahoo email, saying that my previous account  (jamesdbell8 at yahoo.com)  will be deleted.  It does not repeat the previous claim of "abuse" on the account, but the timing of the events strongly suggests that the source of the problem was an attack on probably millions of Yahoo email addresses that has occurred over the last week or so.  Naturally, I am completely outraged that they allowed such an event to result in actual loss of 'all' data in the account.  Could it be that Yahoo's system was truly damaged so seriously as to cause the complete loss of my email and address-list database?
    However, I am reminded of the old saying, "If you get lemons, make lemonade".   Because of Edward Snowden's revelations, we have known that the NSA has been storing all domestic, and probably as many foreign, emails as they could get their grubby little hands on.   Why not a class-action lawsuit demanding that Yahoo obtain prior emails from the NSA?
     While it is difficult to sue the US (primarily due to something called "Sovereign Immunity"),  I am aware that the Federal government has already waived Sovereign immunity for everything except money damages.  (In other words, you can sue them for 'declaratory' and 'injunctive' relief:  A court could order the NSA to deliver the data back to Yahoo.)        Does anyone out in the Wide World of Cypherpunks know of an attorney wanting to take on this kind of issue?  It could put the NSA in a world of hurt for taking the data, and make them realize that one consequence of taking hold of such a massive amount of data is that they will ultimately be sued if it is necessary to recover.  It would also put email providers such as Yahoo on notice that they have additional obligations (other than those they think they have) to recover lost emails.

@_subject: Yet another interesting take on assassination markets. 
See the article by Tomasz.Wegrzanowski at gmail.com   (Spell that 5 times really fast!)
    I'd praise this guy's take on assassination markets, but since 90% of it is virtually identical to my own from January 1995 (before I'd published Part 1 of AP), that would pretty much be me patting myself on the back.      Even so, there are some things on which we disagree:  For example, TAW (Tomasz Wegrzanowski) says he believes that today's 'assassination markets' are probably scams.  (I know only of Sanjuro's "Assassination Market", and David's DPL, or Digital Prediction Lottery; Technically, DPL doesn't label itself as an 'assassination market', but for purposes of my analysis I will label it one.)  It is hypothetically possible that either or both of these are some government honey-pot, although I don't think so.  I have previously pointed out that I see little reason for any government to, now, promote a system similar to my AP idea, particularly when I wasn't promoting AP itself since my release from the Federal governments' 'gated communities' in March 2012.  Indeed, to do so would have been about as much a mistake as 2003's FutureMAP system. 
       (And I'm not implying FutureMAP was a bad idea; rather I think that to float the idea as they did led to so much negative reaction that they had to withdraw it, amazingly within one day too!)
     But I also don't believe that either system is likely to be a money- (Bitcoin-) seeking scam, either.  The reason is based on Game theory.  Imagine somebody starts up an AP-type operation.  Imagine further that it is acting is what I'd call a 'healthy' fashion, actively collecting at least dozens of hundreds of individual donations per day.   (This would be strongly impeded if the system collected minimum  donations of 1.0 BTC, like Sanjuro's system started out doing , or it was somehow not sufficiently easy to use, or it did not provide the various proofs of operational security sufficient to induce confidence in potential donors.)  I think if it was 'working', such a system would quickly develop hundreds of target-names, albeit some with tiny reward amounts,  and would certainly collect enough donations within, say, three months to raise the bounties to a level sufficient to result in at least one, uh, 'hit'.  Prior to that, many
 potential donors would still hold back, either because they weren't confident that somebody would be rewarded, or they would wait to see if something 'happened'.
     But suppose that one 'hit' occurred.  Suppose the system demonstrated that some unknown-named person had correctly predicted the date of death of the person listed. (This should be unavoidable:  It should not be possible for the system to conceal the existence of a correct donation; in any case, the public and all potential future donors would insist on the exposure of all relevant donations naming that particular target.) Would the operator 'defect' or 'cooperate' (both are terms used in Game Theory.)  Would the operator of that system actually pay the stated  amount, or would he refuse?  (I am assuming that the system was at least set up to have the technical ability to prove, to the public, that the reward had been paid to the correct predictor.)     To me, it is obvious that if the operator indeed pays the reward, and this fact can be proven to the public without revealing the true name of the correct predictor, for every Bitcoin paid out as a reward, this confidence-building measure will result in at least tens, and probably many hundreds of Bitcoins of further donations from other themselves naming other targets.  In other words, at that point it would become totally illogical for the system operator  to 'defect', to refuse to pay a (relatively) small donation, because by doing that he would be foregoing further donations that would be collectively hundreds of times larger.  (Nobody would donate to a system which provably refused to pay on a correction 'prediction', or failed to sufficiently disprove the non-payment of the reward.)        This same analysis would apply after the second 'hit', and the third, and the fourth, etc.  At no point, I think, would the 'assassination market' system operator find it financially more advantageous to refuse to pay the reward, than to pay it and remain in operation and collect far more donations.  He will always be better off by paying the reward.
    There is, however, one exception that I can think of to this analysis.  A person (or persons, or a government) might conceivably run an 'AM'-type organization, for a while, specifically for the purpose of discrediting the entire concept of AP.  That person might run the system, for a while, even paying off one, or a dozen or two, predictions, and collect a substantial reward in the process, eventually intending to run away, thereby leading to 'fear, uncertainty, and doubt' over the question of whether a credible 'AP'-type system could exist.  The big problem, for that person, is that by doing so he would be inadvertently demonstrating the proper (for awhile) functioning, and effect of, that system.  Once demonstrated to work, for that period of time, it would become obvious that such a system could, indeed, function 'properly' if the person or people involved are motivated to do so.  And, there would be nothing they could do about stopping
 credible, reliable people from initiating and running an honest AP-type organization.  Eventually, reputable systems would win out, because they would build up the longevity leading confidence as to their offers.

I have discovered this article, showing that Yahoo staff like to play games with customers, trying to dissuade them from re-activating old accounts.  But my issue, today, is far stronger:  I did not allow an account to become 'old' and 'unused':  My account (jamesdbell8 at yahoo.com) was quite literally taken from me, one week ago while I was trying to use it daily, even hourly.  (I am now using a new account, 'jamesdbell9 at yahoo.com', to communicate with you.
     Do not try to convince me that you have 'lost' my data.  That's not possible.  No doubt Yahoo has backups of backups of backups.  The data IS, indeed, 'there', somewhere. And if it's not 'there', it's in the NSA where you illegally sent it as it was being generated.  Maybe you don't want to take the time and trouble to access it and restore it to my use, but that merely shows how callous, rude, and malicious your staff really is!  Fix the problem immediately so I am only temporarily damaged, not permanently damaged.

It appears that these agencies are trying to teach their staff a way to commit a crime, let's call it "obstruction of justice".  In any criminal prosecution, the defense is entitled to receive various kinds of information, see 'Brady material',   .   My understanding is that the government is required to disclose to the defendant (and his attorney) any potentially exculpatory information.  This could include the method and manner the government obtained the evidence in question.  Similar is 'Jencks material',    , and 'Giglio material',      The purpose of obstructing access to the source of the information is to prevent the defense from identifying and questioning the validity of the information, and to prevent the defense from impeaching witnesses who may otherwise want to remain anonymous.       The prosecution may want to hide behind their putative ignorance of the information, because it is in the hands of some government agency, but I believe that the prosecution is required to investigate and determine such contacts even if they weren't initially aware of them.  The problem is that the prosecution doesn't actually do that, in many cases.  If the defense learns of the possible true source of that information, they can demand that the material be provided, but if they don't get a relevant disclosure, they might not even know what to ask.

At some point, hopefully quite soon, people will see the futility of running a "Silk-Road-type" site, without equipping it with some form of proactive security, perhaps 'AP' or Sanjuro's 'Assassination Market'.  
As stated by the character "Dr. Strangelove", in the movie of the same name,    "Deterrence is the art of producing in the mind of the enemy... the FEAR to attack." 
           Jim Bell
(from:      )
[discussing the Doomsday machine] 
President Merkin Muffley: How is it possible for this thing to be triggered automatically and at the same time impossible to untrigger? 
Dr. Strangelove: Mr. President, it is not only possible, it is essential. That is the whole idea of this machine, you know. Deterrence is the art of producing in the mind of the enemy... the FEAR to attack. And so, because of the automated and irrevocable decision-making process which rules out human meddling, the Doomsday machine is terrifying and simple to understand... and completely credible and convincing.

Here's what Tom Lehrer had to say about "Research".  (From the song, "Nicolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky", circa 1964)
"Be that as it may, some of you may have had occasion to run into mathematicians and to wonder therefore how they got that way, and here, in partial explanation perhaps, is the story of the great Russian mathematician Nicolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky. 
Who made me the genius I am today,
The mathematician that others all quote,
Who's the professor that made me that way?
The greatest that ever got chalk on his coat.
One man deserves the credit,
One man deserves the blame,
And Nicolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky is his name.
Nicolai Ivanovich Lobach-
I am never forget the day I first meet the great Lobachevsky.
In one word he told me secret of success in mathematics:
Let no one else's work evade your eyes,
Remember why the good Lord made your eyes,
So don't shade your eyes,
But plagiarize, plagiarize, plagiarize -
Only be sure always to call it please 'research'.

About my email crash:  I am merely temporarily going to 'jamesdbell9 to allow me to communicate with yahoo, hopefully to restore my past emails and address book.  Once things are back in place, I will probably migrate to a Gmail account, or something else if people recommend it. (Raising the question:  Is there a reasonably straightforward mechanism to allow a disgusted user to (easily and automatically) transfer all of his emails from one system to another?  Obviously, email service providers are motivated to try to lock in users, but maybe there's a way to fight this.)
 When I think that the hard drive on my computer has probably 300 gigabytes of freespace left, and I doubt whether the space necessary to store ALL of my inbox emails (and a large folder as well)
 probably wouldn't require 1 gigabyte!  One of the major problems with dealing with the 'cloud' computing is that we become dependent on the incompetence of third parties, for storing and maintaining services.  In principle, such people might be _more_ competent and capable, but at this point I very much long for the possibility of maintaining a 'personal backup' of email on my own computer, in parallel with anything stored elsewhere.
    So far, Yahoo has reflexively claimed that the account was terminated for 'abuse', but I think I understand what happened.,  It gave me a request to re-login since it had been a long time since I'd done that (maybe 2 weeks?); cautious about 'phishing', I opened a new window and pointed to 'Yahoo.com' and tried to log in.  I think that the system was confused, because (presumably) I was still logged onto Yahoo, the window requesting that I re-log-in.  (It is possible that this is what the computer interpreted as 'abuse'; in any case the first-level staffers have, so far, merely repeated what their software claimed.)
    In hindsight, what I suspect I SHOULD have done was to completely log off Yahoo, and THEN open up a new window and log back on.  Yahoo had some major outages about December 11, 2013       At least then, they said they'd work to restore people's data; I intend to use that promise against them.
    As for a PGP key:  I have not made a PGP key yet.  I will do so before I come down to the SF area to get it signed.  However, understand that I don't really view any PGP key I generate as being 'safe':  I am virtually assuming that my computer is, inherently, a major honey-pot (simply because it is owned by "Jim Bell"), which means that there are probably a few dozen instances of national-level malware in it, transmitting my every keystroke to NSA, GCHQ, and just about everyone else who cares.  Including, of course, my passphrases.    One thing I will want to have happen in San Francisco is to allow the meeting to exercise their anti-cracker skills to find out just how many nations have compromised my computer.  Might as well.
    I renew my offer to engage in Skype video calls with anyone, as a reasonably good proof of my identity.  It occurred to me that I could disconnect my computer from power and wired (ethernet) Internet service, maintaining WiFi, and walk out the front door of my house, all the while during said Skype call, and show (behind me) my house and car (1995 Suzuki Sidekick JLX), at the address 7214 Corregidor, Vancouver WA 98664 USA.  Anyone who installs Google Earth should be able to 'Streetview', verifying what the house looks like, etc.

@_subject: Pirate Bay co-founder Peter Sunde arrested 
Pirate Bay co-founder Peter Sunde was arrested late Saturday after being on the lam for nearly two years. One of the minds behind the popular-yet-tantalizingly-illegal file-sharing service had been set to serve jail time for copyright violations when he bolted. 
Four men linked to Pirate Bay were originally sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of 32 million crowns ($4.8 million). An appeals court later reduced the prison sentences by varying amounts, but raised the fine to 46 million Swedish crowns ($6.9 million).
Sunde was arrested in southern Sweden, but he was thought to be living in Germany the past few years. The name of his site, Pirate Bay, has become shorthand for digital piracy and the accompanying conversations about how artists and big businesses are impacted by internet sharing.
Somewhat fittingly (if you're willing to indulge in some armchair psychology), the blurriness of boundaries and borders, the ones breached by Pirate Bay and users meeting and operating around the world, have echoes in Sunde's biography. In an interview with a Swedish journalist just a few weeks ago, Sunde offered this insight:
In Sweden I am considered the Finnish-Norwegian, in Norway Finnish-Swedish, and in Finland Swedish-Norwegian. I 've never really belonged anywhere."
Peter Althin, who defended Sunde during his trial, said this to a Swedish news site about Sunde and his work:
It's about being on the cutting edge if one is going to be successful... But if one is too far ahead it is not always about success. Peter fought for file-sharing and in 10 years I think it goes without saying that file-sharing for one's own needs will be allowed."
Nevertheless, as Sunde heads to jail for eight months, Pirate Bay continues to deliver music, movies, games, and other media to users who use the service, which is now based out of the Seychelles.

I just realized that he probably isn't yet returned (extradited) to the US, and thus probably won't be listed in the BOP Inmate locator system.

There is such a thing as a Federal Prison inmate locator.        
I tried it, but it doesn't show him.  ( I don't know his age, etc.)  It would certainly show him if he is convicted, but before?  Let's figure out where (which city) he is in.  Sometimes Federal prisoners are sent to county jails while they are waiting for a trial.

@_subject: Huge Snowden Leak 
On Tuesday, news site The Register published a story containing explosive "above top secret" information about Britain's surveillance programs, including details of a "clandestine British base tapping undersea cables in the Middle East." Reporter Duncan Campbell, who wrote the story, said it was based on documents "leaked by fugitive NSA sysadmin Edward Snowden" that other news outlets had declined to publish. 
However, it's not necessarily clear how Campbell got his hands on Snowden's document stash. 
Glenn Greenwald, who published the first stories based on Snowden's documents in The Guardian, told Business Insider on Tuesday that Snowden has "no source relationship" with Campbell.
"Snowden has no source relationship with Duncan (who is a great journalist), and never provided documents to him directly or indirectly, as Snowden has made clear," Greenwald said in an email. "I can engage in informed speculation about how Duncan got this document — it's certainly a document that several people in the Guardian UK possessed — but how he got it is something only he can answer."
For his part, Campbell is not interested in discussing how he got the documents used for his story.
"Journalists in the UK — just as in the US — do not reveal their sources, or respond to questions as to confidential sources. We protect them. That is our obligation and our duty," Campbell wrote in an email to Business Insider.
This isn't the first story Campbell has published allegedly based on Snowden documents. Last August, Campbell wrote a piece for The Independent about the secret British surveillance base. In that article, Campbell suggested The Guardian "agreed to the Government’s request not to publish any material contained in the Snowden documents that could damage national security," including the existence of the surveillance base.
Greenwald responded with a column that included a statement from Snowden saying he had not worked with Campbell and speculating the documents were actually by the British government as part of an attempt to make the case his leaks were "harmful."
In addition to Snowden's theory that Campbell may have obtained documents from a government source, it also seems possible he was leaked information by a Guardian staffer with access to the documents. Business Insider asked Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger about this possibility on Tuesday and received a response from a representative for the paper who said they have no idea how Campbell obtained any of Snowden's documents. 
"We don't know who Mr Campbell's source is. We have always been open and transparent about all of our reporting partners," the representative  said. 
So it seems someone out there is in possession of Snowden documents other newspapers have declined to publish and is eager to release them. In other words, the Snowden leaks have leaked.
[UPDATE 20:45 EDT] Duncan Campbell told Wired UK that he " was able to look at some of the material provided in Britain to the Guardian  by Edward Snowden last year."
Campbell, who has been reporting about Britain's signals intelligence agency (GCHQ) for more than 30 years,  would not answer a question about whether he has copies of the relevant documents.

@_subject: Cellphone Operator Reveals Scale of Government Snooping 
LONDON (AP) — Government snooping into phone networks is extensive worldwide, one of the world's largest cellphone companies revealed Friday, saying that several countries demand direct access to its networks without warrant or prior notice.
The most explosive revelation was that in six countries, authorities require immediate access to an operator's network — bypassing legal niceties like warrants. It did not name the countries for legal reasons and to safeguard employees working there.The detailed report from Vodafone, which covers the 29 countries in which it operates in Europe, Africa and Asia, provides the most comprehensive look to date at how governments monitor mobile phone communications. It amounts to a call for a debate on the issue as businesses increasingly worry about being seen as worthy of trust.
"In those countries, Vodafone will not receive any form of demand for lawful interception access as the relevant agencies and authorities already have permanent access to customer communications via their own direct link," the report said.
Vodafone's report comes one year after former NSA systems analyst Edward Snowden revealed that U.S. and other countries' intelligence agencies routinely gathered huge amounts of private data belonging to millions of innocent people in America and across the globe.
The revelations have focused particular attention on the role of Western technology and telecommunications firms, which stand accused of facilitating the mass surveillance by giving spies unrestricted access to their networks. Several Silicon Valley companies have since attempted to restore consumers' trust by publishing data on government surveillance.
By making its report public, together with a breakdown on requests for information, Vodafone took the unusual step of entering the international debate about balancing the rights of privacy against security. Rather than being stuck with responsibility and consumer backlash when consumers realize their data has been scooped up without their knowledge, companies like Vodafone have decided it is time to push for a debate.But telecoms companies found themselves in an even more uncomfortable position. Historically closer to governments since many were once state-owned, telecoms companies are much more heavily regulated and have employees on the ground — making them more sensitive to government demands for data.
"Companies are recognizing they have a responsibility to disclose government access," Daniel Castro, senior analyst for the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation in Washington, D.C. "This is new."
The study comes at a time when other businesses are also calling for a revamp of laws too outdated to stand up to the quickly changing telecommunications universe.
Executives in Silicon Valley, for example, have stepped up pressure on President Barack Obama to curb the U.S. government surveillance programs that collect information off the Internet.
"They want their customers to be able to trust them to store their data in a private and secure manner," Castro said.Twitter Inc., LinkedIn Corp., AOL Inc., Google Inc., Apple Inc., Yahoo Inc., Facebook Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are pushing for tighter controls over electronic espionage — fearing that eavesdropping threatens the technology industry's financial livelihood.
Vodafone's report is also seen by some as an effort to turn the page on the company's embarrassing role in the protests that toppled Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak in 2011. As the protests raged, Vodafone bombarded its Egyptian subscribers with pro-government text messages. At the time, the company said it had no choice but to comply, but was severely criticized for its actions. A change in culture followed.
"They took a hard lesson there," said Cynthia Wong, a senior internet researcher at Human Rights Watch. "Even if the government is the ultimate problem, they realized they needed to take steps to mitigate harm to their users."
Civil rights advocates applauded Vodafone for releasing the report, and cracking open the debate, even as they expressed alarm at the infringements into civil rights.
"For governments to access phone calls at the flick of a switch is unprecedented and terrifying," said Shami Chakrabarti, director of the human rights group Liberty, adding that the Snowden revelations showed the Internet was already being treated as "fair game."
"Bluster that all is well is wearing pretty thin - our analogue laws need a digital overhaul," she said.
Though some of the governments included in the report were able to block disclosure of any aspect of how interception was conducted, the report is unique in that it offers insight into how governments conduct surveillance.
Though some of the U.S. operators, such as AT&T and Verizon offered information amid the Snowden allegations, the level of detail is minuscule compared with Friday's report, Wong said.
Civil rights advocates weren't the only ones applauding Vodafone's actions. Norway's Telenor Group, which also has operations across Eastern Europe and Asia, offered support, noting governments have the ultimate responsibility to act.
The countries included in the report are: Albania, Australia, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Congo, Egypt, Fiji, France, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, Kenya, Lesotho, Malta, Mozambique, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, South Africa, Spain, Tanzania, Turkey and the U.K.

In a previous note on Cypherpunks, I believe I read that exposure to one of these Stingrays causes a cell phone to emit its signal at maximum power, causing a battery drain.  This suggests that a simple Stingray-detector could be built, using an old cell-phone, a power-supply with a current-limit-detector connected to an alarm.  If the cell phone emits maximum RF-signal, it will use a considerable DC power, which could be set to trigger the DC-current alarm.  (Am I correct in thinking that the old cell-phone doesn't even have to be 'active', meaning that it doesn't have to have a contracted service associated with it?)

Right now, we're gearing for MuckRock's biggest investigative project
yet, and we need your help. First, a little context.
Local police departments across America are increasingly tapping into
information from your cell phone: Your location, who you're with, who
you are calling. Using fake cell phone towers, often called Stingrays,
they generally don't even need a warrant, and have relatively few
restrictions on who, when, and what they collect. Or how they use it.
Since these programs are often funded by federal grants,  very few
people outside of law enforcement know how, or even if, they're being
used, with almost non-existent debate about if this information should
be collected, and what limits should be set for for how it's used or
how long it's kept.
This is where you come in. We're launching this project on Beacon
Reader, where a donation of just $5, about what it costs for us to
successfully file a request, can make a big difference. Just like with
the Drone Census, often times MuckRock is the *only* group asking for
this information, which otherwise would never be made public.
You can support the project at this link, and, again, even just $5 can
make a huge difference:
If you're not in a position to help financially, we would still really

@_subject: New vulnerability in OpenSSL 
BOSTON — Security researchers have uncovered new bugs in the Web encryption software that caused the pernicious “Heartbleed” Internet threat that surfaced in April.
Experts said the newly discovered vulnerabilities in OpenSSL, which could allow hackers to spy on communications, do not appear to be as serious a threat as Heartbleed.
The new bugs were disclosed on Thursday as the group responsible for developing that software released an OpenSSL update that contains seven security fixes.
Experts said that websites and technology firms that use OpenSSL technology should install the update on their systems as quickly as possible. Still, they said that could take several days or weeks because companies need to first test systems to make sure they are compatible with the update.
"They are going to have to patch. This will take some time," said Lee Weiner, senior vice president with cybersecurity software maker Rapid7.
OpenSSL technology is used on about two-thirds of all websites, including ones run by Amazon.com, Facebook, Google, and Yahoo. It is also incorporated into thousands of technology products from companies, including Cisco Systems, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel, and Oracle.
The widespread Heartbleed bug surfaced in April when it was disclosed that the flaw potentially exposed users of those websites and technologies to attack by hackers who could steal large quantities of data without leaving a trace. That prompted fear that attackers may have compromised large numbers of networks without their knowledge.
Security experts said Thursday that the newly discovered bugs are more difficult to exploit than Heartbleed, making those vulnerabilities less of a threat.
Still, until users of the technology update their systems, “there is a window of opportunity” for sophisticated hackers to launch attacks and exploit the newly uncovered vulnerabilities, said Tal Klein, vice president of strategy with cloud security firm Adallom.

@_subject: Internet Giants erect barriers to spy agencies 
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — Just down the road from Google’s main campus here, engineers for the company are accelerating what has become the newest arms race in modern technology: They are making it far more difficult — and far more expensive — for the National Security Agency and the intelligence arms of other governments around the world to pierce their systems.
As fast as it can, Google is sealing up cracks in its systems that Edward J. Snowden revealed the N.S.A. had brilliantly exploited. It is encrypting more data as it moves among its servers and helping customers encode their own emails. Facebook, Microsoft and Yahoo are taking similar steps.
After years of cooperating with the government, the immediate goal now is to thwart Washington — as well as Beijing and Moscow. The strategy is also intended to preserve business overseas in places like Brazil and Germany that have threatened to entrust data only to local providers.
Google, for example, is laying its own fiber optic cable under the world’s oceans, a project that began as an effort to cut costs and extend its influence, but now has an added purpose: to assure that the company will have more control over the movement of its customer data.
But governments are fighting back, harder than ever. The cellphone giant Vodafone reported on Friday that a “small number” of governments around the world have demanded the ability to tap directly into its communication networks, a level of surveillance that elicited outrage from privacy advocates.A year after Mr. Snowden’s revelations, the era of quiet cooperation is over. Telecommunications companies say they are denying requests to volunteer data not covered by existing law. A.T.&T., Verizon and others say that compared with a year ago, they are far more reluctant to cooperate with the United States government in “gray areas” where there is no explicit requirement for a legal warrant.
Vodafone refused to name the nations on Friday for fear of putting its business and employees at risk there. But in an accounting of the number of legal demands for information that it receives from 14 companies, it noted that some countries did not issue warrants to obtain phone, email or web-searching traffic, because “the relevant agencies and authorities already have permanent access to customer communications via their own direct link.”
The company also said it had to acquiesce to some governments’ requests for data to comply with national laws. Otherwise, it said, it faced losing its license to operate in certain countries.
Eric Grosse, Google’s security chief, suggested in an interview that the N.S.A.’s own behavior invited the new arms race.
“I am willing to help on the purely defensive side of things,” he said, referring to Washington’s efforts to enlist Silicon Valley in cybersecurity efforts. “But signals intercept is totally off the table,” he said, referring to national intelligence gathering.
“No hard feelings, but my job is to make their job hard,” he added.
In Washington, officials acknowledge that covert programs are now far harder to execute because American technology companies, fearful of losing international business, are hardening their networks and saying no to requests for the kind of help they once quietly provided.
Robert S. Litt, the general counsel of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees all 17 American spy agencies, said on Wednesday that it was “an unquestionable loss for our nation that companies are losing the willingness to cooperate legally and voluntarily” with American spy agencies.
“Just as there are technological gaps, there are legal gaps,” he said, speaking at the Wilson Center in Washington, “that leave a lot of gray area” governing what companies could turn over.
In the past, he said, “we have been very successful” in getting that data. But he acknowledged that for now, those days are over, and he predicted that “sooner or later there will be some intelligence failure and people will wonder why the intelligence agencies were not able to protect the nation.”
Companies respond that if that happens, it is the government’s own fault and that intelligence agencies, in their quest for broad data collection, have undermined web security for all.
Many point to an episode in 2012, when Russian security researchers uncovered a state espionage tool, Flame, on Iranian computers. Flame, like the Stuxnet worm, is believed to have been produced at least in part by American intelligence agencies. It was created by exploiting a previously unknown flaw in Microsoft’s operating systems. Companies argue that others could have later taken advantage of this defect.
Worried that such an episode undercuts confidence in its wares, Microsoft is now fully encrypting all its products, including Hotmail and Outlook.com, by the end of this year with 2,048-bit encryption, a stronger protection that would take a government far longer to crack. The software is protected by encryption both when it is in data centers and when data is being sent over the Internet, said Bradford L. Smith, the company’s general counsel.
Mr. Smith also said the company was setting up “transparency centers” abroad so that technical experts of foreign governments could come in and inspect Microsoft’s proprietary source code. That will allow foreign governments to check to make sure there are no “back doors” that would permit snooping by United States intelligence agencies. The first such center is being set up in Brussels.
Microsoft has also pushed back harder in court. In a Seattle case, the government issued a “national security letter” to compel Microsoft to turn over data about a customer, along with a gag order to prevent Microsoft from telling the customer it had been compelled to provide its communications to government officials. Microsoft challenged the gag order as violating the First Amendment. The government backed down.
Hardware firms like Cisco, which makes routers and switches, have found their products a frequent subject of Mr. Snowden’s disclosures, and theirbusiness has declined steadily in countries like Asia, Brazil and Europe over the last year. The company is still struggling to convince foreign customers that their networks are safe from hackers — and free of “back doors” installed by the N.S.A. The frustration, companies here say, is that it is nearly impossible to prove that their systems are N.S.A.-proof.
In one slide from the disclosures, N.S.A. analysts pointed to a sweet spot inside Google’s data centers, where they could catch traffic in unencrypted form. Next to a quickly drawn smiley face, an N.S.A. analyst, referring to an acronym for a common layer of protection, had noted, “SSL added and removed here!”Most American companies said they never knowingly let the N.S.A. weaken their systems, or install back doors. But Mr. Snowden’s documents showed how the agency found a way.
Google was already suspicious that its internal traffic could be read, and had started a program to encrypt the links among its internal data centers, “the last chink in our armor,” Mr. Grosse said. But the slide gave the company proof that it was a regular target of the N.S.A. “It was useful to have proof, in terms of accelerating a project already underway,” he said.
Facebook and Yahoo have also been encrypting traffic among their internal servers. And Facebook, Google and Microsoft have been moving to more strongly encrypt consumer traffic with so-called Perfect Forward Secrecy, specifically devised to make it more labor intensive for the N.S.A. or anyone to read stored encrypted communications.
One of the biggest indirect consequences from the Snowden revelations, technology executives say, has been the surge in demands from foreign governments that saw what kind of access to user information the N.S.A. received — voluntarily or surreptitiously. Now they want the same.
At Facebook, Joe Sullivan, the company’s chief security officer, said it had been fending off those demands and heightened expectations.
Until last year, technology companies were forbidden from acknowledging demands from the United States government under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. But in January, Google, Facebook, Yahoo and Microsoft brokered a deal with the Obama administration to disclose the number of such orders they receive in increments of 1,000.
As part of the agreement, the companies agreed to dismiss their lawsuits before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court
“We’re not running and hiding,” Mr. Sullivan said. “We think it should be a transparent process so that people can judge the appropriate ways to handle these kinds of things.”
The latest move in the war between intelligence agencies and technology companies arrived this week, in the form of a new Google encryption tool. The company released a user-friendly, email encryption method to replace the clunky and often mistake-prone encryption schemes the N.S.A. has readily exploited.
But the best part of the tool was buried in Google’s code, which included a jab at the N.S.A.’s smiley-face slide. The code included the phrase: “ssl-added-and-removed-here-; - )”

@_subject: Article on TLS, Transport Layer Security 
(Note:  I, Jim Bell, am cross posting this article from Yahoo, not because I  believe it to be 'accurate' (I have no opinion on that), but because I believe that we need to not merely hear 'The Truth', but also 'The Story', specifically the story (stories) that the Internet-based news media is telling the public.)
From its start in 1971, Internet-based email has not been known for its high security. As security researcher Bruce Schneier wrote in a 1995 essay for Macworld on the privacy perils of email: “It’s like a postcard that anyone can read along the way.” 
That unfortunate fact is finally fracturing. Email is getting safer for you — provided that your mail service and your correspondent’s both use a standard called “TLS,” short for Transport Layer Security. Finally, Google and other providers are starting to turn on TLS for the public.
Read more: 4 Ways Your Email Provider Can Encrypt Your Messages
TLS, then and now
The move to the use of TLS could have happened more than five years ago: A 1.0 version of the TLS specification emerged only four years after Schneier’s essay, and the current 1.2 version dates to 2008. But even as mail services secured people’s log-ins, they did not take the extra step of scrambling their messages while in transit.
Those who knew this would commonly comfort themselves with the lost-in-the-crowd theory of security: With some 183 billion messages a daysent back and forth, who would possibly have the time to look for one in particular? 
Then one year ago, Edward Snowden began giving a crash course in National Security Agency surveillance, which had the policy and, for the first time in history, the technology to collect everything first and index it later. 
After a few weeks of Snowden’s revelations, CNET’s Declan McCullagh made a simple observation: Gmail supported TLS, but other major email services did not, meaning that a huge chunk of the world’s email could be inspected by the NSA and its ilk, because for TLS to work, both sides of an email conversation have to support it.
To make it more difficult for the NSA to simply absorb the world’s email, more tech companies took an active interest in TLS, including Yahoo Tech’s publisher, Yahoo, which had lagged in its support for encryption, according to the Washington Post.
Progress and confusion
With the growing use of TLS, the odds are now lower that your email is going out on a postcard. In mid-May, a study by Facebook found that 58 percent of the social network’s email notifications to members were going out encrypted. And last week, Google posted similar numbers: 71 percent of messages from Gmail to elsewhere went out encrypted, while 50 percent of those received by Gmail also arrived locked.
There’s your good news: We’ve fixed a core defect in email and reduced the capability of well-meaning friends, family, and business partners to inadvertently risk your privacy by sending sensitive data about you in their own email. And with TLS, you don’t have to install any software or change any settings to get its advantage.
The bad news: It’s hard to figure out if your own provider has done its part. 
Google’s regularly updated transparency report now includes a section on “encryption in transit” that lets you check to see if other large mail services do TLS. But it can yield confusing results, and smaller systems (say, your employer’s) don’t show up. 
You can also check for TLS use on any site at STARTTLS.info.
Should you switch?
If you spend any time experimenting with STARTTLS.info, you’ll quickly see how badly many consumer Internet providers’ mail services lag behind webmail. Comcast is turning on TLS one provider at a time, and CenturyLink already supports it. But Time Warner Cable, Verizon, and Cox have not announced plans to enable TLS.
Among webmail companies, Yahoo followed Gmail by turning on TLS in the first quarter of this year, AOL has done the same, and Microsoft is “currently rolling out TLS,” a spokesperson said. 
Checks of Apple’s services show patchy support, and the company did not answer a request for clarification.
There are good reasons to separate your email from your ISP — starting with not having to worry about running out of online storage or having to send hundreds of change-of-address notices if you switch providers. But webmail has its own privacy issue: Most of these services are paid for by ads that target the words in your messages. 
The price to evade the NSA’s eyes doesn’t have to include subjecting your email to your provider’s advertising robots. Among the four big webmail services that now use TLS, Microsoft and Yahoo let you pay to clean the ads from your account  ( $19.95 a year at Microsoft, $49.99 a year at Yahoo), while Google will open a new, $50/year ad-free Google Apps account  for you at the domain name of your choice.
But how many of you have exercised any of those ad-free options?

@_subject: Amazing NSA excuse 
"One thing that makes reporting on the NSA so difficult is that you have to deconstruct their statements like Derrida to figure out what they're actually saying. (This is why all responsible people read Marcy Wheeler.)
"Luckily, here's an NSA issue anyone can sink their teeth into. It demonstrates the squirmy NSA legal technique, and how by its own logic the agency ought to be broken up or closed altogether.
"The background is that the NSA is being sued around the block by all manner of people over the Snowden revelations. Pertaining to a suit brought by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a previous court order had instructed the NSA to preserve data that it had collected under Section 702 of the Amendments Act to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
"That order has since been reversed, because the NSA has claimed (in addition to the usual business about how stopping this program will grievously harm American citizens) that it physically cannot store all the information it collects under Section 702. As Andrea Peterson atThe Washington Post reported, the NSA's deputy director, Richard Ledgett, wrote a rather astonishing court filing, in which he said that "a requirement to preserve all data acquired under Section 702 presents significant operational problems, only one of which is that the NSA may have to shut down all systems and databases that contain Section 702 information." (Emphasis added.) Ironically, Ledgett claims that previous privacy restrictions that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court placed on the program necessitate deleting the data the EFF wants preserved. You can practically see Ledgett sticking his finger in the eye of the EFF's legal director.
"In any case, as Peterson notes, this puts the EFF in a strange position, since it is now arguing to preserve evidence for legal purposes it would ultimately want destroyed as a policy.
"But aside from the legal arcana, this is an excellent example of the Kafkaesque logic that predominates when it it comes to our intelligence agencies. The NSA is almost saying, "We've got your privacy protections in here, honest, but unfortunately it just so happens that these protections mean we have to destroy all this evidence related to your lawsuit." Whatever the situation, it just so happens that the intelligence apparatus is regretfully excused from accountability. Marcy Wheeler is constantly uncovering various iterations of this stuff.
"I'm skeptical that the data preservation the EFF is asking for is impossible. But the really troubling possibility is that the NSA is actually right. It's anybody's guess precisely how much data the NSAis shifting around, but it's reportedly in the exabytes overall. So yes, it might be impossible for the agency to store more than a few weeks or so of the data it's collecting.
"The NSA's legal squirming is bad enough. But an agency writing itself a blank check to allegedly destroy evidence based on the sheer size and complexity of the possibly illegal program in questionis another thing entirely. There shouldn't be an "unless your dragnet surveillance program is reallybig" exception to the Fourth Amendment.

Note:  I wonder what kind of email system would be:   1.  Used by the Federal Government.  2.  NOT be regularly backed-up.   3.  Would lose up to two (2) years of emails in a crash.
         Jim Bell
[article follows]
WASHINGTON (AP) — Congressional investigators are fuming over revelations that the Internal Revenue Service has lost a trove of emails to and from a central figure in the agency's tea party controversy.
The IRS said Lois Lerner's computer crashed in 2011, wiping out an untold number of emails that were being sought by congressional investigators. The investigators want to see all of Lerner's emails from 2009 to 2013 as part of their probe into the way agents handled applications for tax-exempt status by tea party and other conservative groups.
Lerner headed the IRS division that processes applications for tax-exempt status. The IRS acknowledged last year that agents had improperly scrutinized applications by some conservative groups.
"Do they really expect the American people to believe that, after having withheld these emails for a year, they're just now realizing the most critical time period is missing?" said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the House Oversight Committee. "If there wasn't nefarious conduct that went much higher than Lois Lerner in the IRS targeting scandal, why are they playing these games?"
The Oversight Committee is one of three congressional committees investigating the IRS over its handling of tea party applications from 2010 to 2012. The Justice Department and the IRS inspector general are also investigating.
Congressional investigators have shown that IRS officials in Washington were closely involved in the handling of tea party applications, many of which languished for more than a year without action. But so far, they have not publicly produced evidence that anyone outside the agency directed the targeting or even knew about it.
If anyone in the Obama administration outside the agency was involved, investigators were hoping for clues in Lerner's emails.
"The fact that I am just learning about this, over a year into the investigation, is completely unacceptable and now calls into question the credibility of the IRS' response to congressional inquiries," said Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. "There needs to be an immediate investigation and forensic audit by Department of Justice as well as the inspector general."
The IRS said technicians went to great lengths trying to recover data from Lerner's computer in 2011. In emails provided by the IRS, technicians said they sent the computer to a forensic lab run by the agency's criminal investigations unit. But to no avail.
The IRS was able to generate 24,000 Lerner emails from the 2009 to 2011 because Lerner had copied in other IRS employees. The agency said it pieced together the emails from the computers of 82 other IRS employees.
But an untold number are gone. Camp's office said the missing emails are mainly ones to and from people outside the IRS, "such as the White House, Treasury, Department of Justice, FEC, or Democrat offices."
Anti-tax advocate Grover Norquist called the episode "the worst attempt to blame technology in service of a cover-up since the infamous 18-minute gap" in former President Richard Nixon's Watergate tapes.
The IRS said in a statement that more than 250 IRS employees have been working to assist congressional investigations, spending nearly $10 million to produce more than 750,000 documents.
Overall, the IRS said it is producing a total of 67,000 emails to and from Lerner, covering the period from 2009 to 2013.
"The IRS is committed to working with Congress," the IRS said in a statement. "The IRS has remained focused on being thorough and responding as quickly as possible to the wide-ranging requests from Congress while taking steps to protect underlying taxpayer information."
Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, called Friday's disclosure "an outrageous impediment" to the committee's investigation.
"Even more egregious is the fact we are learning about this a full year after our initial request to provide the committee with any and all documents relating to our investigation," Hatch said.
Lerner has emerged as a key figure in the tea party probe. In May 2013, she was the first IRS official to publicly acknowledge that agents had improperly scrutinized applications.
About two weeks later, Lerner was subpoenaed to testify at a congressional hearing. But after making a brief statement in which she said she had done nothing wrong, Lerner refused to answer questions, invoking her constitutional right against self-incrimination.
The IRS placed Lerner on administrative leave shortly after the congressional hearing. She retired last fall.
In May, the House voted to hold Lerner in contempt of Congress. Her case has been turned over to the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia.

Excellent point!  Although, that Utah operation might not have been functioning in 2011.  But presumably the NSA had a smaller operation somewhere else prior to that.
So, who wants to REMIND the prosecutors in IRS-gate that somebody else has these emails?
Maybe the future for the NSA will be as a type of "super-backwards-Carbonite" operation?  But instead of, "Pay us money and we'll back up your emails", it'll be, "Pay us money and we WON'T back up your emails"!!!

The Clever Way GOP Congressman Is Pushing Back After IRS Claims Lois Lerner Emails Were ‘Erased by a Glitch’
Jun. 13, 2014 5:56pm Jason Howerton
Rep. Steve Stockman (R-Texas) asked the National Security Agency on Friday to turn over all the metadata it has collected on the email accounts of former IRS official Lois Lerner from January 2009 to April 2011. Stockman’s clever move comes hours after the tax agency apparently claimed it had lost Lerner’s emails from that same time period due to a computer glitch.
“I have asked NSA Director Rogers to send me all metadata his agency has collected on Lois Lerner’s email accounts for the period which the House sought records,” Stockmansaid in a press release. “The metadata will establish who Lerner contacted and when, which helps investigators determine the extent of illegal activity by the IRS.”
“The claim incriminating communications were erased by a glitch conjures memories of Rose Mary Woods,” the congressman added.  “Barack Obama has brought us Jimmy Carter’s economy and Richard Nixon’s excuses.”
Congress requested all emails sent from Lerner to and from other IRS employees from early 2009 to April 2011. After promising to turn them over, the IRS said Friday it can’t find any of those emails.
Stockman isn’t the only member of Congress who isn’t buying the excuse. Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) asked, “If there wasn’t nefarious conduct that went much higher than Lois Lerner in the IRS targeting scandal, why are they playing these games?”
TheBlaze has reached out to Frederick R. Chang, a recognized national expert in cyber security and SMU professor, to see if there are ways the emails “lost” due to a glitch or crash could be recovered. We will update this story should he respond.

Congressman Asks NSA To Restore Two Years Of "Lost" Lois Lerner IRS Emails
Submitted by Tyler Durden on 06/14/2014 21:47 -0400
Yesterday, the republican campaign to get to the bottom of IRS' targeting of conservative groups was dealt an absolutely idiotic blow when the IRS, in all seriousness, announced that it had lost two years worth of emails to and from the chief subject of the investigation: former agency official Lois Lerner.
As House Ways and Means Commitee chairman Dave Camp said, "The fact that I am just learning about this, over a year into the investigation, is completely unacceptable and now calls into question the credibility of the IRS’s response to congressional inquiries,” he said in a statement. "There needs to be an immediate investigation and forensic audit by Department of Justice as well as the Inspector General."
According to NRO, the agency informed Camp that a computer crash resulted in the loss of e-mails between January 2009 and April 2011 sent between Lerner and outside agencies such as the White House and the Department of Justice. "Those messages are particularly relevant given revelations earlier this week that the agency in 2010 transmitted a database to the FBI containing confidential taxpayer information, potentially in violation of federal law."
The IRS said in a separate statement that it has or will produce 24,000 e-mails from the period between 2009 and 2011 using the files of 82 individuals with whom Lerner corresponded, and that it has produced nearly all of the 67,000 e-mails sent and received by Lerner during her time at the agency.
Apparently lack of document (and email) retention is a crime for everyone, but not for the IRS. And furthermore, only when it comes to the IRS, can a single computer crash destroy the entire email path history, even as it crosses through countless servers across the world, and ultimately lands in somebody else's inbox.
It goes without saying that for the IRS to even assume someone would believe this particular, and quite spectacular, lie is beyond insulting to even the most gullible idiot among the US population.
So we won't say it.
What, however, was simply a bizarre, if idiotic, lie has just been taken to a whole new level of ridiculousness, when moments ago, representative Steve Stockman (R-Texas) announced he would request that the National Security Agency help in the hunt for missing emails to and from the IRS’s Lois Lerner, and recover two years worth of "lost" emails. From the Hill:
In a letter to NSA Director Michael Rogers on Friday, Stockman requested that the NSA turn over information it has about emails between Lerner and outside groups between January 2009 and April 2011.
Turns out all those jokes about people calling the NSA and asking for backups of lost emails and of course files (because remember, courtesy of complicit megacorporations, the NSA has full backdoor access to everything anyone does) - they weren't jokes at all.
And now the NSA is caught between a rock and a hard place: because if it refuses an officialcongressional demand, it shows once again that the spy agency is entirely separated from any concept of checks and balances and accountability; if it complies, it confirms that all the NSA is, considering it can't even tap into a bunch of Al Qaeda phones and figure out what the jihadists' strategy is in Iraq, is just a massive data repository of all US electronic information, to be abused at will by corrupt, criminal government workers, some of whom will likely have to resort to the "dog ate my emails" excuse in the immediate future.

@_subject: Tell a lie, 
Tell a lie, remove the gear: How the NSA covers up when cable taps are found
Get caught, remove the evidence, and come up with a plausible cover story.
by Nate Anderson - June 19 2014, 10:56am PDT23Der Spiegel via Edward Snowden via NSA
Sometimes, the spooks do get caught. German magazine Der Spiegel yesterday revealed a new slide (PDF) from the Edward Snowden document cache that offers a tantalizing glimpse of what it looks like when someone stumbles on an intelligence agency cable tap.
The NSA's Special Source Operations (SSO) branch isn't in the business of computer hacking but of cable tapping; its logo shows an eagle flying above the globe and clutching a string of wires in its talons. These taps, each obscured with a codename, are often made deep within the network of telecom providers and often with the cooperation of key executives. But sometimes non-cleared people start raising questions about just what might be going on, as was the case with AT&T whistleblower Mark Klein, who revealed an NSA "secret room" in San Francisco.
On March 14, 2013, an SSO weekly briefing included a note regarding such a discovery. The unit had been informed two days earlier that "the access point for WHARPDRIVE was discovered by commercial consortium personnel. Witting partner personnel have removed the evidence and a plausible cover story was provided. All collection has ceased."
According to Der Spiegel, Wharpdrive was a fiber-optic cable tap (underseas fiber is often laid by consortia of companies, so it's possible this took place at an onshore landing point for such a cable). Employees from one of the companies involved—though not the company that had a relationship with NSA and the German intelligence agency BND—apparently noticed some unusual gear and commented on it. In response, the company involved with the NSA ("witting partner personnel") removed the tap and made up a story to explain what the gear in question had been doing.
Though the NSA lost access to Wharpdrive, it wasn't for long. Der Spiegel cites additional documents in its possession and says that "a team was quietly put together to reinstall the program."

@_subject: Pirate Bay co-founder Peter Sunde arrested 
Pirate Bay co-founder Peter Sunde was arrested late Saturday after being on the lam for nearly two years. One of the minds behind the popular-yet-tantalizingly-illegal file-sharing service had been set to serve jail time for copyright violations when he bolted. 
Four men linked to Pirate Bay were originally sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of 32 million crowns ($4.8 million). An appeals court later reduced the prison sentences by varying amounts, but raised the fine to 46 million Swedish crowns ($6.9 million).
Sunde was arrested in southern Sweden, but he was thought to be living in Germany the past few years. The name of his site, Pirate Bay, has become shorthand for digital piracy and the accompanying conversations about how artists and big businesses are impacted by internet sharing.
Somewhat fittingly (if you're willing to indulge in some armchair psychology), the blurriness of boundaries and borders, the ones breached by Pirate Bay and users meeting and operating around the world, have echoes in Sunde's biography. In an interview with a Swedish journalist just a few weeks ago, Sunde offered this insight:
In Sweden I am considered the Finnish-Norwegian, in Norway Finnish-Swedish, and in Finland Swedish-Norwegian. I 've never really belonged anywhere."
Peter Althin, who defended Sunde during his trial, said this to a Swedish news site about Sunde and his work:
It's about being on the cutting edge if one is going to be successful... But if one is too far ahead it is not always about success. Peter fought for file-sharing and in 10 years I think it goes without saying that file-sharing for one's own needs will be allowed."
Nevertheless, as Sunde heads to jail for eight months, Pirate Bay continues to deliver music, movies, games, and other media to users who use the service, which is now based out of the Seychelles.

@_subject: Huge Snowden Leak 
On Tuesday, news site The Register published a story containing explosive "above top secret" information about Britain's surveillance programs, including details of a "clandestine British base tapping undersea cables in the Middle East." Reporter Duncan Campbell, who wrote the story, said it was based on documents "leaked by fugitive NSA sysadmin Edward Snowden" that other news outlets had declined to publish. 
However, it's not necessarily clear how Campbell got his hands on Snowden's document stash. 
Glenn Greenwald, who published the first stories based on Snowden's documents in The Guardian, told Business Insider on Tuesday that Snowden has "no source relationship" with Campbell.
"Snowden has no source relationship with Duncan (who is a great journalist), and never provided documents to him directly or indirectly, as Snowden has made clear," Greenwald said in an email. "I can engage in informed speculation about how Duncan got this document — it's certainly a document that several people in the Guardian UK possessed — but how he got it is something only he can answer."
For his part, Campbell is not interested in discussing how he got the documents used for his story.
"Journalists in the UK — just as in the US — do not reveal their sources, or respond to questions as to confidential sources. We protect them. That is our obligation and our duty," Campbell wrote in an email to Business Insider.
This isn't the first story Campbell has published allegedly based on Snowden documents. Last August, Campbell wrote a piece for The Independent about the secret British surveillance base. In that article, Campbell suggested The Guardian "agreed to the Government’s request not to publish any material contained in the Snowden documents that could damage national security," including the existence of the surveillance base.
Greenwald responded with a column that included a statement from Snowden saying he had not worked with Campbell and speculating the documents were actually by the British government as part of an attempt to make the case his leaks were "harmful."
In addition to Snowden's theory that Campbell may have obtained documents from a government source, it also seems possible he was leaked information by a Guardian staffer with access to the documents. Business Insider asked Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger about this possibility on Tuesday and received a response from a representative for the paper who said they have no idea how Campbell obtained any of Snowden's documents. 
"We don't know who Mr Campbell's source is. We have always been open and transparent about all of our reporting partners," the representative  said. 
So it seems someone out there is in possession of Snowden documents other newspapers have declined to publish and is eager to release them. In other words, the Snowden leaks have leaked.
[UPDATE 20:45 EDT] Duncan Campbell told Wired UK that he " was able to look at some of the material provided in Britain to the Guardian  by Edward Snowden last year."
Campbell, who has been reporting about Britain's signals intelligence agency (GCHQ) for more than 30 years,  would not answer a question about whether he has copies of the relevant documents.

@_subject: Cellphone Operator Reveals Scale of Government Snooping 
LONDON (AP) — Government snooping into phone networks is extensive worldwide, one of the world's largest cellphone companies revealed Friday, saying that several countries demand direct access to its networks without warrant or prior notice.
The most explosive revelation was that in six countries, authorities require immediate access to an operator's network — bypassing legal niceties like warrants. It did not name the countries for legal reasons and to safeguard employees working there.The detailed report from Vodafone, which covers the 29 countries in which it operates in Europe, Africa and Asia, provides the most comprehensive look to date at how governments monitor mobile phone communications. It amounts to a call for a debate on the issue as businesses increasingly worry about being seen as worthy of trust.
"In those countries, Vodafone will not receive any form of demand for lawful interception access as the relevant agencies and authorities already have permanent access to customer communications via their own direct link," the report said.
Vodafone's report comes one year after former NSA systems analyst Edward Snowden revealed that U.S. and other countries' intelligence agencies routinely gathered huge amounts of private data belonging to millions of innocent people in America and across the globe.
The revelations have focused particular attention on the role of Western technology and telecommunications firms, which stand accused of facilitating the mass surveillance by giving spies unrestricted access to their networks. Several Silicon Valley companies have since attempted to restore consumers' trust by publishing data on government surveillance.
By making its report public, together with a breakdown on requests for information, Vodafone took the unusual step of entering the international debate about balancing the rights of privacy against security. Rather than being stuck with responsibility and consumer backlash when consumers realize their data has been scooped up without their knowledge, companies like Vodafone have decided it is time to push for a debate.But telecoms companies found themselves in an even more uncomfortable position. Historically closer to governments since many were once state-owned, telecoms companies are much more heavily regulated and have employees on the ground — making them more sensitive to government demands for data.
"Companies are recognizing they have a responsibility to disclose government access," Daniel Castro, senior analyst for the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation in Washington, D.C. "This is new."
The study comes at a time when other businesses are also calling for a revamp of laws too outdated to stand up to the quickly changing telecommunications universe.
Executives in Silicon Valley, for example, have stepped up pressure on President Barack Obama to curb the U.S. government surveillance programs that collect information off the Internet.
"They want their customers to be able to trust them to store their data in a private and secure manner," Castro said.Twitter Inc., LinkedIn Corp., AOL Inc., Google Inc., Apple Inc., Yahoo Inc., Facebook Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are pushing for tighter controls over electronic espionage — fearing that eavesdropping threatens the technology industry's financial livelihood.
Vodafone's report is also seen by some as an effort to turn the page on the company's embarrassing role in the protests that toppled Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak in 2011. As the protests raged, Vodafone bombarded its Egyptian subscribers with pro-government text messages. At the time, the company said it had no choice but to comply, but was severely criticized for its actions. A change in culture followed.
"They took a hard lesson there," said Cynthia Wong, a senior internet researcher at Human Rights Watch. "Even if the government is the ultimate problem, they realized they needed to take steps to mitigate harm to their users."
Civil rights advocates applauded Vodafone for releasing the report, and cracking open the debate, even as they expressed alarm at the infringements into civil rights.
"For governments to access phone calls at the flick of a switch is unprecedented and terrifying," said Shami Chakrabarti, director of the human rights group Liberty, adding that the Snowden revelations showed the Internet was already being treated as "fair game."
"Bluster that all is well is wearing pretty thin - our analogue laws need a digital overhaul," she said.
Though some of the governments included in the report were able to block disclosure of any aspect of how interception was conducted, the report is unique in that it offers insight into how governments conduct surveillance.
Though some of the U.S. operators, such as AT&T and Verizon offered information amid the Snowden allegations, the level of detail is minuscule compared with Friday's report, Wong said.
Civil rights advocates weren't the only ones applauding Vodafone's actions. Norway's Telenor Group, which also has operations across Eastern Europe and Asia, offered support, noting governments have the ultimate responsibility to act.
The countries included in the report are: Albania, Australia, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Congo, Egypt, Fiji, France, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, Kenya, Lesotho, Malta, Mozambique, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, South Africa, Spain, Tanzania, Turkey and the U.K.

In a previous note on Cypherpunks, I believe I read that exposure to one of these Stingrays causes a cell phone to emit its signal at maximum power, causing a battery drain.  This suggests that a simple Stingray-detector could be built, using an old cell-phone, a power-supply with a current-limit-detector connected to an alarm.  If the cell phone emits maximum RF-signal, it will use a considerable DC power, which could be set to trigger the DC-current alarm.  (Am I correct in thinking that the old cell-phone doesn't even have to be 'active', meaning that it doesn't have to have a contracted service associated with it?)

Right now, we're gearing for MuckRock's biggest investigative project
yet, and we need your help. First, a little context.
Local police departments across America are increasingly tapping into
information from your cell phone: Your location, who you're with, who
you are calling. Using fake cell phone towers, often called Stingrays,
they generally don't even need a warrant, and have relatively few
restrictions on who, when, and what they collect. Or how they use it.
Since these programs are often funded by federal grants,  very few
people outside of law enforcement know how, or even if, they're being
used, with almost non-existent debate about if this information should
be collected, and what limits should be set for for how it's used or
how long it's kept.
This is where you come in. We're launching this project on Beacon
Reader, where a donation of just $5, about what it costs for us to
successfully file a request, can make a big difference. Just like with
the Drone Census, often times MuckRock is the *only* group asking for
this information, which otherwise would never be made public.
You can support the project at this link, and, again, even just $5 can
make a huge difference:
If you're not in a position to help financially, we would still really
appreciate your help — share what we're up to with your friends,
sending in news articles you see or tips regarding cell phone
tracking, and, in a few days, sending in information regarding which
departments you'd like us to file with through a special page on
Thanks for all your support in the past, and we're looking forward to
working with you to shine a light on this under-reported area.

@_subject: New vulnerability in OpenSSL 
BOSTON — Security researchers have uncovered new bugs in the Web encryption software that caused the pernicious “Heartbleed” Internet threat that surfaced in April.
Experts said the newly discovered vulnerabilities in OpenSSL, which could allow hackers to spy on communications, do not appear to be as serious a threat as Heartbleed.
The new bugs were disclosed on Thursday as the group responsible for developing that software released an OpenSSL update that contains seven security fixes.
Experts said that websites and technology firms that use OpenSSL technology should install the update on their systems as quickly as possible. Still, they said that could take several days or weeks because companies need to first test systems to make sure they are compatible with the update.
"They are going to have to patch. This will take some time," said Lee Weiner, senior vice president with cybersecurity software maker Rapid7.
OpenSSL technology is used on about two-thirds of all websites, including ones run by Amazon.com, Facebook, Google, and Yahoo. It is also incorporated into thousands of technology products from companies, including Cisco Systems, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel, and Oracle.
The widespread Heartbleed bug surfaced in April when it was disclosed that the flaw potentially exposed users of those websites and technologies to attack by hackers who could steal large quantities of data without leaving a trace. That prompted fear that attackers may have compromised large numbers of networks without their knowledge.
Security experts said Thursday that the newly discovered bugs are more difficult to exploit than Heartbleed, making those vulnerabilities less of a threat.
Still, until users of the technology update their systems, “there is a window of opportunity” for sophisticated hackers to launch attacks and exploit the newly uncovered vulnerabilities, said Tal Klein, vice president of strategy with cloud security firm Adallom.

@_subject: Internet Giants erect barriers to spy agencies 
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — Just down the road from Google’s main campus here, engineers for the company are accelerating what has become the newest arms race in modern technology: They are making it far more difficult — and far more expensive — for the National Security Agency and the intelligence arms of other governments around the world to pierce their systems.
As fast as it can, Google is sealing up cracks in its systems that Edward J. Snowden revealed the N.S.A. had brilliantly exploited. It is encrypting more data as it moves among its servers and helping customers encode their own emails. Facebook, Microsoft and Yahoo are taking similar steps.
After years of cooperating with the government, the immediate goal now is to thwart Washington — as well as Beijing and Moscow. The strategy is also intended to preserve business overseas in places like Brazil and Germany that have threatened to entrust data only to local providers.
Google, for example, is laying its own fiber optic cable under the world’s oceans, a project that began as an effort to cut costs and extend its influence, but now has an added purpose: to assure that the company will have more control over the movement of its customer data.
But governments are fighting back, harder than ever. The cellphone giant Vodafone reported on Friday that a “small number” of governments around the world have demanded the ability to tap directly into its communication networks, a level of surveillance that elicited outrage from privacy advocates.A year after Mr. Snowden’s revelations, the era of quiet cooperation is over. Telecommunications companies say they are denying requests to volunteer data not covered by existing law. A.T.&T., Verizon and others say that compared with a year ago, they are far more reluctant to cooperate with the United States government in “gray areas” where there is no explicit requirement for a legal warrant.
Vodafone refused to name the nations on Friday for fear of putting its business and employees at risk there. But in an accounting of the number of legal demands for information that it receives from 14 companies, it noted that some countries did not issue warrants to obtain phone, email or web-searching traffic, because “the relevant agencies and authorities already have permanent access to customer communications via their own direct link.”
The company also said it had to acquiesce to some governments’ requests for data to comply with national laws. Otherwise, it said, it faced losing its license to operate in certain countries.
Eric Grosse, Google’s security chief, suggested in an interview that the N.S.A.’s own behavior invited the new arms race.
“I am willing to help on the purely defensive side of things,” he said, referring to Washington’s efforts to enlist Silicon Valley in cybersecurity efforts. “But signals intercept is totally off the table,” he said, referring to national intelligence gathering.
“No hard feelings, but my job is to make their job hard,” he added.
In Washington, officials acknowledge that covert programs are now far harder to execute because American technology companies, fearful of losing international business, are hardening their networks and saying no to requests for the kind of help they once quietly provided.
Robert S. Litt, the general counsel of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees all 17 American spy agencies, said on Wednesday that it was “an unquestionable loss for our nation that companies are losing the willingness to cooperate legally and voluntarily” with American spy agencies.
“Just as there are technological gaps, there are legal gaps,” he said, speaking at the Wilson Center in Washington, “that leave a lot of gray area” governing what companies could turn over.
In the past, he said, “we have been very successful” in getting that data. But he acknowledged that for now, those days are over, and he predicted that “sooner or later there will be some intelligence failure and people will wonder why the intelligence agencies were not able to protect the nation.”
Companies respond that if that happens, it is the government’s own fault and that intelligence agencies, in their quest for broad data collection, have undermined web security for all.
Many point to an episode in 2012, when Russian security researchers uncovered a state espionage tool, Flame, on Iranian computers. Flame, like the Stuxnet worm, is believed to have been produced at least in part by American intelligence agencies. It was created by exploiting a previously unknown flaw in Microsoft’s operating systems. Companies argue that others could have later taken advantage of this defect.
Worried that such an episode undercuts confidence in its wares, Microsoft is now fully encrypting all its products, including Hotmail and Outlook.com, by the end of this year with 2,048-bit encryption, a stronger protection that would take a government far longer to crack. The software is protected by encryption both when it is in data centers and when data is being sent over the Internet, said Bradford L. Smith, the company’s general counsel.
Mr. Smith also said the company was setting up “transparency centers” abroad so that technical experts of foreign governments could come in and inspect Microsoft’s proprietary source code. That will allow foreign governments to check to make sure there are no “back doors” that would permit snooping by United States intelligence agencies. The first such center is being set up in Brussels.
Microsoft has also pushed back harder in court. In a Seattle case, the government issued a “national security letter” to compel Microsoft to turn over data about a customer, along with a gag order to prevent Microsoft from telling the customer it had been compelled to provide its communications to government officials. Microsoft challenged the gag order as violating the First Amendment. The government backed down.
Hardware firms like Cisco, which makes routers and switches, have found their products a frequent subject of Mr. Snowden’s disclosures, and theirbusiness has declined steadily in countries like Asia, Brazil and Europe over the last year. The company is still struggling to convince foreign customers that their networks are safe from hackers — and free of “back doors” installed by the N.S.A. The frustration, companies here say, is that it is nearly impossible to prove that their systems are N.S.A.-proof.
In one slide from the disclosures, N.S.A. analysts pointed to a sweet spot inside Google’s data centers, where they could catch traffic in unencrypted form. Next to a quickly drawn smiley face, an N.S.A. analyst, referring to an acronym for a common layer of protection, had noted, “SSL added and removed here!”Most American companies said they never knowingly let the N.S.A. weaken their systems, or install back doors. But Mr. Snowden’s documents showed how the agency found a way.
Google was already suspicious that its internal traffic could be read, and had started a program to encrypt the links among its internal data centers, “the last chink in our armor,” Mr. Grosse said. But the slide gave the company proof that it was a regular target of the N.S.A. “It was useful to have proof, in terms of accelerating a project already underway,” he said.
Facebook and Yahoo have also been encrypting traffic among their internal servers. And Facebook, Google and Microsoft have been moving to more strongly encrypt consumer traffic with so-called Perfect Forward Secrecy, specifically devised to make it more labor intensive for the N.S.A. or anyone to read stored encrypted communications.
One of the biggest indirect consequences from the Snowden revelations, technology executives say, has been the surge in demands from foreign governments that saw what kind of access to user information the N.S.A. received — voluntarily or surreptitiously. Now they want the same.
At Facebook, Joe Sullivan, the company’s chief security officer, said it had been fending off those demands and heightened expectations.
Until last year, technology companies were forbidden from acknowledging demands from the United States government under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. But in January, Google, Facebook, Yahoo and Microsoft brokered a deal with the Obama administration to disclose the number of such orders they receive in increments of 1,000.
As part of the agreement, the companies agreed to dismiss their lawsuits before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court
“We’re not running and hiding,” Mr. Sullivan said. “We think it should be a transparent process so that people can judge the appropriate ways to handle these kinds of things.”
The latest move in the war between intelligence agencies and technology companies arrived this week, in the form of a new Google encryption tool. The company released a user-friendly, email encryption method to replace the clunky and often mistake-prone encryption schemes the N.S.A. has readily exploited.
But the best part of the tool was buried in Google’s code, which included a jab at the N.S.A.’s smiley-face slide. The code included the phrase: “ssl-added-and-removed-here-; - )”

@_subject: Article on TLS, Transport Layer Security 
(Note:  I, Jim Bell, am cross posting this article from Yahoo, not because I  believe it to be 'accurate' (I have no opinion on that), but because I believe that we need to not merely hear 'The Truth', but also 'The Story', specifically the story (stories) that the Internet-based news media is telling the public.)
From its start in 1971, Internet-based email has not been known for its high security. As security researcher Bruce Schneier wrote in a 1995 essay for Macworld on the privacy perils of email: “It’s like a postcard that anyone can read along the way.” 
That unfortunate fact is finally fracturing. Email is getting safer for you — provided that your mail service and your correspondent’s both use a standard called “TLS,” short for Transport Layer Security. Finally, Google and other providers are starting to turn on TLS for the public.
Read more: 4 Ways Your Email Provider Can Encrypt Your Messages
TLS, then and now
The move to the use of TLS could have happened more than five years ago: A 1.0 version of the TLS specification emerged only four years after Schneier’s essay, and the current 1.2 version dates to 2008. But even as mail services secured people’s log-ins, they did not take the extra step of scrambling their messages while in transit.
Those who knew this would commonly comfort themselves with the lost-in-the-crowd theory of security: With some 183 billion messages a daysent back and forth, who would possibly have the time to look for one in particular? 
Then one year ago, Edward Snowden began giving a crash course in National Security Agency surveillance, which had the policy and, for the first time in history, the technology to collect everything first and index it later. 
After a few weeks of Snowden’s revelations, CNET’s Declan McCullagh made a simple observation: Gmail supported TLS, but other major email services did not, meaning that a huge chunk of the world’s email could be inspected by the NSA and its ilk, because for TLS to work, both sides of an email conversation have to support it.
To make it more difficult for the NSA to simply absorb the world’s email, more tech companies took an active interest in TLS, including Yahoo Tech’s publisher, Yahoo, which had lagged in its support for encryption, according to the Washington Post.
Progress and confusion
With the growing use of TLS, the odds are now lower that your email is going out on a postcard. In mid-May, a study by Facebook found that 58 percent of the social network’s email notifications to members were going out encrypted. And last week, Google posted similar numbers: 71 percent of messages from Gmail to elsewhere went out encrypted, while 50 percent of those received by Gmail also arrived locked.
There’s your good news: We’ve fixed a core defect in email and reduced the capability of well-meaning friends, family, and business partners to inadvertently risk your privacy by sending sensitive data about you in their own email. And with TLS, you don’t have to install any software or change any settings to get its advantage.
The bad news: It’s hard to figure out if your own provider has done its part. 
Google’s regularly updated transparency report now includes a section on “encryption in transit” that lets you check to see if other large mail services do TLS. But it can yield confusing results, and smaller systems (say, your employer’s) don’t show up. 
You can also check for TLS use on any site at STARTTLS.info.
Should you switch?
If you spend any time experimenting with STARTTLS.info, you’ll quickly see how badly many consumer Internet providers’ mail services lag behind webmail. Comcast is turning on TLS one provider at a time, and CenturyLink already supports it. But Time Warner Cable, Verizon, and Cox have not announced plans to enable TLS.
Among webmail companies, Yahoo followed Gmail by turning on TLS in the first quarter of this year, AOL has done the same, and Microsoft is “currently rolling out TLS,” a spokesperson said. 
Checks of Apple’s services show patchy support, and the company did not answer a request for clarification.
There are good reasons to separate your email from your ISP — starting with not having to worry about running out of online storage or having to send hundreds of change-of-address notices if you switch providers. But webmail has its own privacy issue: Most of these services are paid for by ads that target the words in your messages. 
The price to evade the NSA’s eyes doesn’t have to include subjecting your email to your provider’s advertising robots. Among the four big webmail services that now use TLS, Microsoft and Yahoo let you pay to clean the ads from your account  ( $19.95 a year at Microsoft, $49.99 a year at Yahoo), while Google will open a new, $50/year ad-free Google Apps account  for you at the domain name of your choice.
But how many of you have exercised any of those ad-free options?

@_subject: Amazing NSA excuse 
"One thing that makes reporting on the NSA so difficult is that you have to deconstruct their statements like Derrida to figure out what they're actually saying. (This is why all responsible people read Marcy Wheeler.)
"Luckily, here's an NSA issue anyone can sink their teeth into. It demonstrates the squirmy NSA legal technique, and how by its own logic the agency ought to be broken up or closed altogether.
"The background is that the NSA is being sued around the block by all manner of people over the Snowden revelations. Pertaining to a suit brought by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a previous court order had instructed the NSA to preserve data that it had collected under Section 702 of the Amendments Act to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
"That order has since been reversed, because the NSA has claimed (in addition to the usual business about how stopping this program will grievously harm American citizens) that it physically cannot store all the information it collects under Section 702. As Andrea Peterson atThe Washington Post reported, the NSA's deputy director, Richard Ledgett, wrote a rather astonishing court filing, in which he said that "a requirement to preserve all data acquired under Section 702 presents significant operational problems, only one of which is that the NSA may have to shut down all systems and databases that contain Section 702 information." (Emphasis added.) Ironically, Ledgett claims that previous privacy restrictions that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court placed on the program necessitate deleting the data the EFF wants preserved. You can practically see Ledgett sticking his finger in the eye of the EFF's legal director.
"In any case, as Peterson notes, this puts the EFF in a strange position, since it is now arguing to preserve evidence for legal purposes it would ultimately want destroyed as a policy.
"But aside from the legal arcana, this is an excellent example of the Kafkaesque logic that predominates when it it comes to our intelligence agencies. The NSA is almost saying, "We've got your privacy protections in here, honest, but unfortunately it just so happens that these protections mean we have to destroy all this evidence related to your lawsuit." Whatever the situation, it just so happens that the intelligence apparatus is regretfully excused from accountability. Marcy Wheeler is constantly uncovering various iterations of this stuff.
"I'm skeptical that the data preservation the EFF is asking for is impossible. But the really troubling possibility is that the NSA is actually right. It's anybody's guess precisely how much data the NSAis shifting around, but it's reportedly in the exabytes overall. So yes, it might be impossible for the agency to store more than a few weeks or so of the data it's collecting.
"The NSA's legal squirming is bad enough. But an agency writing itself a blank check to allegedly destroy evidence based on the sheer size and complexity of the possibly illegal program in questionis another thing entirely. There shouldn't be an "unless your dragnet surveillance program is reallybig" exception to the Fourth Amendment.

Note:  I wonder what kind of email system would be:   1.  Used by the Federal Government.  2.  NOT be regularly backed-up.   3.  Would lose up to two (2) years of emails in a crash.
         Jim Bell
[article follows]
WASHINGTON (AP) — Congressional investigators are fuming over revelations that the Internal Revenue Service has lost a trove of emails to and from a central figure in the agency's tea party controversy.
The IRS said Lois Lerner's computer crashed in 2011, wiping out an untold number of emails that were being sought by congressional investigators. The investigators want to see all of Lerner's emails from 2009 to 2013 as part of their probe into the way agents handled applications for tax-exempt status by tea party and other conservative groups.
Lerner headed the IRS division that processes applications for tax-exempt status. The IRS acknowledged last year that agents had improperly scrutinized applications by some conservative groups.
"Do they really expect the American people to believe that, after having withheld these emails for a year, they're just now realizing the most critical time period is missing?" said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the House Oversight Committee. "If there wasn't nefarious conduct that went much higher than Lois Lerner in the IRS targeting scandal, why are they playing these games?"
The Oversight Committee is one of three congressional committees investigating the IRS over its handling of tea party applications from 2010 to 2012. The Justice Department and the IRS inspector general are also investigating.
Congressional investigators have shown that IRS officials in Washington were closely involved in the handling of tea party applications, many of which languished for more than a year without action. But so far, they have not publicly produced evidence that anyone outside the agency directed the targeting or even knew about it.
If anyone in the Obama administration outside the agency was involved, investigators were hoping for clues in Lerner's emails.
"The fact that I am just learning about this, over a year into the investigation, is completely unacceptable and now calls into question the credibility of the IRS' response to congressional inquiries," said Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. "There needs to be an immediate investigation and forensic audit by Department of Justice as well as the inspector general."
The IRS said technicians went to great lengths trying to recover data from Lerner's computer in 2011. In emails provided by the IRS, technicians said they sent the computer to a forensic lab run by the agency's criminal investigations unit. But to no avail.
The IRS was able to generate 24,000 Lerner emails from the 2009 to 2011 because Lerner had copied in other IRS employees. The agency said it pieced together the emails from the computers of 82 other IRS employees.
But an untold number are gone. Camp's office said the missing emails are mainly ones to and from people outside the IRS, "such as the White House, Treasury, Department of Justice, FEC, or Democrat offices."
Anti-tax advocate Grover Norquist called the episode "the worst attempt to blame technology in service of a cover-up since the infamous 18-minute gap" in former President Richard Nixon's Watergate tapes.
The IRS said in a statement that more than 250 IRS employees have been working to assist congressional investigations, spending nearly $10 million to produce more than 750,000 documents.
Overall, the IRS said it is producing a total of 67,000 emails to and from Lerner, covering the period from 2009 to 2013.
"The IRS is committed to working with Congress," the IRS said in a statement. "The IRS has remained focused on being thorough and responding as quickly as possible to the wide-ranging requests from Congress while taking steps to protect underlying taxpayer information."
Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, called Friday's disclosure "an outrageous impediment" to the committee's investigation.
"Even more egregious is the fact we are learning about this a full year after our initial request to provide the committee with any and all documents relating to our investigation," Hatch said.
Lerner has emerged as a key figure in the tea party probe. In May 2013, she was the first IRS official to publicly acknowledge that agents had improperly scrutinized applications.
About two weeks later, Lerner was subpoenaed to testify at a congressional hearing. But after making a brief statement in which she said she had done nothing wrong, Lerner refused to answer questions, invoking her constitutional right against self-incrimination.
The IRS placed Lerner on administrative leave shortly after the congressional hearing. She retired last fall.
In May, the House voted to hold Lerner in contempt of Congress. Her case has been turned over to the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia.

Excellent point!  Although, that Utah operation might not have been functioning in 2011.  But presumably the NSA had a smaller operation somewhere else prior to that.
So, who wants to REMIND the prosecutors in IRS-gate that somebody else has these emails?
Maybe the future for the NSA will be as a type of "super-backwards-Carbonite" operation?  But instead of, "Pay us money and we'll back up your emails", it'll be, "Pay us money and we WON'T back up your emails"!!!

The Clever Way GOP Congressman Is Pushing Back After IRS Claims Lois Lerner Emails Were ‘Erased by a Glitch’
Jun. 13, 2014 5:56pm Jason Howerton
Rep. Steve Stockman (R-Texas) asked the National Security Agency on Friday to turn over all the metadata it has collected on the email accounts of former IRS official Lois Lerner from January 2009 to April 2011. Stockman’s clever move comes hours after the tax agency apparently claimed it had lost Lerner’s emails from that same time period due to a computer glitch.
“I have asked NSA Director Rogers to send me all metadata his agency has collected on Lois Lerner’s email accounts for the period which the House sought records,” Stockmansaid in a press release. “The metadata will establish who Lerner contacted and when, which helps investigators determine the extent of illegal activity by the IRS.”
“The claim incriminating communications were erased by a glitch conjures memories of Rose Mary Woods,” the congressman added.  “Barack Obama has brought us Jimmy Carter’s economy and Richard Nixon’s excuses.”
Congress requested all emails sent from Lerner to and from other IRS employees from early 2009 to April 2011. After promising to turn them over, the IRS said Friday it can’t find any of those emails.
Stockman isn’t the only member of Congress who isn’t buying the excuse. Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) asked, “If there wasn’t nefarious conduct that went much higher than Lois Lerner in the IRS targeting scandal, why are they playing these games?”
TheBlaze has reached out to Frederick R. Chang, a recognized national expert in cyber security and SMU professor, to see if there are ways the emails “lost” due to a glitch or crash could be recovered. We will update this story should he respond.

Congressman Asks NSA To Restore Two Years Of "Lost" Lois Lerner IRS Emails
Submitted by Tyler Durden on 06/14/2014 21:47 -0400
Yesterday, the republican campaign to get to the bottom of IRS' targeting of conservative groups was dealt an absolutely idiotic blow when the IRS, in all seriousness, announced that it had lost two years worth of emails to and from the chief subject of the investigation: former agency official Lois Lerner.
As House Ways and Means Commitee chairman Dave Camp said, "The fact that I am just learning about this, over a year into the investigation, is completely unacceptable and now calls into question the credibility of the IRS’s response to congressional inquiries,” he said in a statement. "There needs to be an immediate investigation and forensic audit by Department of Justice as well as the Inspector General."
According to NRO, the agency informed Camp that a computer crash resulted in the loss of e-mails between January 2009 and April 2011 sent between Lerner and outside agencies such as the White House and the Department of Justice. "Those messages are particularly relevant given revelations earlier this week that the agency in 2010 transmitted a database to the FBI containing confidential taxpayer information, potentially in violation of federal law."
The IRS said in a separate statement that it has or will produce 24,000 e-mails from the period between 2009 and 2011 using the files of 82 individuals with whom Lerner corresponded, and that it has produced nearly all of the 67,000 e-mails sent and received by Lerner during her time at the agency.
Apparently lack of document (and email) retention is a crime for everyone, but not for the IRS. And furthermore, only when it comes to the IRS, can a single computer crash destroy the entire email path history, even as it crosses through countless servers across the world, and ultimately lands in somebody else's inbox.
It goes without saying that for the IRS to even assume someone would believe this particular, and quite spectacular, lie is beyond insulting to even the most gullible idiot among the US population.
So we won't say it.
What, however, was simply a bizarre, if idiotic, lie has just been taken to a whole new level of ridiculousness, when moments ago, representative Steve Stockman (R-Texas) announced he would request that the National Security Agency help in the hunt for missing emails to and from the IRS’s Lois Lerner, and recover two years worth of "lost" emails. From the Hill:
In a letter to NSA Director Michael Rogers on Friday, Stockman requested that the NSA turn over information it has about emails between Lerner and outside groups between January 2009 and April 2011.
Turns out all those jokes about people calling the NSA and asking for backups of lost emails and of course files (because remember, courtesy of complicit megacorporations, the NSA has full backdoor access to everything anyone does) - they weren't jokes at all.
And now the NSA is caught between a rock and a hard place: because if it refuses an officialcongressional demand, it shows once again that the spy agency is entirely separated from any concept of checks and balances and accountability; if it complies, it confirms that all the NSA is, considering it can't even tap into a bunch of Al Qaeda phones and figure out what the jihadists' strategy is in Iraq, is just a massive data repository of all US electronic information, to be abused at will by corrupt, criminal government workers, some of whom will likely have to resort to the "dog ate my emails" excuse in the immediate future.

@_subject: Tell a lie, 
Tell a lie, remove the gear: How the NSA covers up when cable taps are found
Get caught, remove the evidence, and come up with a plausible cover story.
by Nate Anderson - June 19 2014, 10:56am PDT23Der Spiegel via Edward Snowden via NSA
Sometimes, the spooks do get caught. German magazine Der Spiegel yesterday revealed a new slide (PDF) from the Edward Snowden document cache that offers a tantalizing glimpse of what it looks like when someone stumbles on an intelligence agency cable tap.
The NSA's Special Source Operations (SSO) branch isn't in the business of computer hacking but of cable tapping; its logo shows an eagle flying above the globe and clutching a string of wires in its talons. These taps, each obscured with a codename, are often made deep within the network of telecom providers and often with the cooperation of key executives. But sometimes non-cleared people start raising questions about just what might be going on, as was the case with AT&T whistleblower Mark Klein, who revealed an NSA "secret room" in San Francisco.
On March 14, 2013, an SSO weekly briefing included a note regarding such a discovery. The unit had been informed two days earlier that "the access point for WHARPDRIVE was discovered by commercial consortium personnel. Witting partner personnel have removed the evidence and a plausible cover story was provided. All collection has ceased."
According to Der Spiegel, Wharpdrive was a fiber-optic cable tap (underseas fiber is often laid by consortia of companies, so it's possible this took place at an onshore landing point for such a cable). Employees from one of the companies involved—though not the company that had a relationship with NSA and the German intelligence agency BND—apparently noticed some unusual gear and commented on it. In response, the company involved with the NSA ("witting partner personnel") removed the tap and made up a story to explain what the gear in question had been doing.
Though the NSA lost access to Wharpdrive, it wasn't for long. Der Spiegel cites additional documents in its possession and says that "a team was quietly put together to reinstall the program."

@_subject: Pirate Bay co-founder Peter Sunde arrested 
Pirate Bay co-founder Peter Sunde was arrested late Saturday after being on the lam for nearly two years. One of the minds behind the popular-yet-tantalizingly-illegal file-sharing service had been set to serve jail time for copyright violations when he bolted. 
Four men linked to Pirate Bay were originally sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of 32 million crowns ($4.8 million). An appeals court later reduced the prison sentences by varying amounts, but raised the fine to 46 million Swedish crowns ($6.9 million).
Sunde was arrested in southern Sweden, but he was thought to be living in Germany the past few years. The name of his site, Pirate Bay, has become shorthand for digital piracy and the accompanying conversations about how artists and big businesses are impacted by internet sharing.
Somewhat fittingly (if you're willing to indulge in some armchair psychology), the blurriness of boundaries and borders, the ones breached by Pirate Bay and users meeting and operating around the world, have echoes in Sunde's biography. In an interview with a Swedish journalist just a few weeks ago, Sunde offered this insight:
In Sweden I am considered the Finnish-Norwegian, in Norway Finnish-Swedish, and in Finland Swedish-Norwegian. I 've never really belonged anywhere."
Peter Althin, who defended Sunde during his trial, said this to a Swedish news site about Sunde and his work:
It's about being on the cutting edge if one is going to be successful... But if one is too far ahead it is not always about success. Peter fought for file-sharing and in 10 years I think it goes without saying that file-sharing for one's own needs will be allowed."
Nevertheless, as Sunde heads to jail for eight months, Pirate Bay continues to deliver music, movies, games, and other media to users who use the service, which is now based out of the Seychelles.

@_subject: Huge Snowden Leak 
On Tuesday, news site The Register published a story containing explosive "above top secret" information about Britain's surveillance programs, including details of a "clandestine British base tapping undersea cables in the Middle East." Reporter Duncan Campbell, who wrote the story, said it was based on documents "leaked by fugitive NSA sysadmin Edward Snowden" that other news outlets had declined to publish. 
However, it's not necessarily clear how Campbell got his hands on Snowden's document stash. 
Glenn Greenwald, who published the first stories based on Snowden's documents in The Guardian, told Business Insider on Tuesday that Snowden has "no source relationship" with Campbell.
"Snowden has no source relationship with Duncan (who is a great journalist), and never provided documents to him directly or indirectly, as Snowden has made clear," Greenwald said in an email. "I can engage in informed speculation about how Duncan got this document — it's certainly a document that several people in the Guardian UK possessed — but how he got it is something only he can answer."
For his part, Campbell is not interested in discussing how he got the documents used for his story.
"Journalists in the UK — just as in the US — do not reveal their sources, or respond to questions as to confidential sources. We protect them. That is our obligation and our duty," Campbell wrote in an email to Business Insider.
This isn't the first story Campbell has published allegedly based on Snowden documents. Last August, Campbell wrote a piece for The Independent about the secret British surveillance base. In that article, Campbell suggested The Guardian "agreed to the Government’s request not to publish any material contained in the Snowden documents that could damage national security," including the existence of the surveillance base.
Greenwald responded with a column that included a statement from Snowden saying he had not worked with Campbell and speculating the documents were actually by the British government as part of an attempt to make the case his leaks were "harmful."
In addition to Snowden's theory that Campbell may have obtained documents from a government source, it also seems possible he was leaked information by a Guardian staffer with access to the documents. Business Insider asked Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger about this possibility on Tuesday and received a response from a representative for the paper who said they have no idea how Campbell obtained any of Snowden's documents. 
"We don't know who Mr Campbell's source is. We have always been open and transparent about all of our reporting partners," the representative  said. 
So it seems someone out there is in possession of Snowden documents other newspapers have declined to publish and is eager to release them. In other words, the Snowden leaks have leaked.
[UPDATE 20:45 EDT] Duncan Campbell told Wired UK that he " was able to look at some of the material provided in Britain to the Guardian  by Edward Snowden last year."
Campbell, who has been reporting about Britain's signals intelligence agency (GCHQ) for more than 30 years,  would not answer a question about whether he has copies of the relevant documents.

@_subject: Cellphone Operator Reveals Scale of Government Snooping 
LONDON (AP) — Government snooping into phone networks is extensive worldwide, one of the world's largest cellphone companies revealed Friday, saying that several countries demand direct access to its networks without warrant or prior notice.
The most explosive revelation was that in six countries, authorities require immediate access to an operator's network — bypassing legal niceties like warrants. It did not name the countries for legal reasons and to safeguard employees working there.The detailed report from Vodafone, which covers the 29 countries in which it operates in Europe, Africa and Asia, provides the most comprehensive look to date at how governments monitor mobile phone communications. It amounts to a call for a debate on the issue as businesses increasingly worry about being seen as worthy of trust.
"In those countries, Vodafone will not receive any form of demand for lawful interception access as the relevant agencies and authorities already have permanent access to customer communications via their own direct link," the report said.
Vodafone's report comes one year after former NSA systems analyst Edward Snowden revealed that U.S. and other countries' intelligence agencies routinely gathered huge amounts of private data belonging to millions of innocent people in America and across the globe.
The revelations have focused particular attention on the role of Western technology and telecommunications firms, which stand accused of facilitating the mass surveillance by giving spies unrestricted access to their networks. Several Silicon Valley companies have since attempted to restore consumers' trust by publishing data on government surveillance.
By making its report public, together with a breakdown on requests for information, Vodafone took the unusual step of entering the international debate about balancing the rights of privacy against security. Rather than being stuck with responsibility and consumer backlash when consumers realize their data has been scooped up without their knowledge, companies like Vodafone have decided it is time to push for a debate.But telecoms companies found themselves in an even more uncomfortable position. Historically closer to governments since many were once state-owned, telecoms companies are much more heavily regulated and have employees on the ground — making them more sensitive to government demands for data.
"Companies are recognizing they have a responsibility to disclose government access," Daniel Castro, senior analyst for the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation in Washington, D.C. "This is new."
The study comes at a time when other businesses are also calling for a revamp of laws too outdated to stand up to the quickly changing telecommunications universe.
Executives in Silicon Valley, for example, have stepped up pressure on President Barack Obama to curb the U.S. government surveillance programs that collect information off the Internet.
"They want their customers to be able to trust them to store their data in a private and secure manner," Castro said.Twitter Inc., LinkedIn Corp., AOL Inc., Google Inc., Apple Inc., Yahoo Inc., Facebook Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are pushing for tighter controls over electronic espionage — fearing that eavesdropping threatens the technology industry's financial livelihood.
Vodafone's report is also seen by some as an effort to turn the page on the company's embarrassing role in the protests that toppled Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak in 2011. As the protests raged, Vodafone bombarded its Egyptian subscribers with pro-government text messages. At the time, the company said it had no choice but to comply, but was severely criticized for its actions. A change in culture followed.
"They took a hard lesson there," said Cynthia Wong, a senior internet researcher at Human Rights Watch. "Even if the government is the ultimate problem, they realized they needed to take steps to mitigate harm to their users."
Civil rights advocates applauded Vodafone for releasing the report, and cracking open the debate, even as they expressed alarm at the infringements into civil rights.
"For governments to access phone calls at the flick of a switch is unprecedented and terrifying," said Shami Chakrabarti, director of the human rights group Liberty, adding that the Snowden revelations showed the Internet was already being treated as "fair game."
"Bluster that all is well is wearing pretty thin - our analogue laws need a digital overhaul," she said.
Though some of the governments included in the report were able to block disclosure of any aspect of how interception was conducted, the report is unique in that it offers insight into how governments conduct surveillance.
Though some of the U.S. operators, such as AT&T and Verizon offered information amid the Snowden allegations, the level of detail is minuscule compared with Friday's report, Wong said.
Civil rights advocates weren't the only ones applauding Vodafone's actions. Norway's Telenor Group, which also has operations across Eastern Europe and Asia, offered support, noting governments have the ultimate responsibility to act.
The countries included in the report are: Albania, Australia, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Congo, Egypt, Fiji, France, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, Kenya, Lesotho, Malta, Mozambique, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, South Africa, Spain, Tanzania, Turkey and the U.K.

In a previous note on Cypherpunks, I believe I read that exposure to one of these Stingrays causes a cell phone to emit its signal at maximum power, causing a battery drain.  This suggests that a simple Stingray-detector could be built, using an old cell-phone, a power-supply with a current-limit-detector connected to an alarm.  If the cell phone emits maximum RF-signal, it will use a considerable DC power, which could be set to trigger the DC-current alarm.  (Am I correct in thinking that the old cell-phone doesn't even have to be 'active', meaning that it doesn't have to have a contracted service associated with it?)

Right now, we're gearing for MuckRock's biggest investigative project
yet, and we need your help. First, a little context.
Local police departments across America are increasingly tapping into
information from your cell phone: Your location, who you're with, who
you are calling. Using fake cell phone towers, often called Stingrays,
they generally don't even need a warrant, and have relatively few
restrictions on who, when, and what they collect. Or how they use it.
Since these programs are often funded by federal grants,  very few
people outside of law enforcement know how, or even if, they're being
used, with almost non-existent debate about if this information should
be collected, and what limits should be set for for how it's used or
how long it's kept.
This is where you come in. We're launching this project on Beacon
Reader, where a donation of just $5, about what it costs for us to
successfully file a request, can make a big difference. Just like with
the Drone Census, often times MuckRock is the *only* group asking for
this information, which otherwise would never be made public.
You can support the project at this link, and, again, even just $5 can
make a huge difference:
If you're not in a position to help financially, we would still really
appreciate your help — share what we're up to with your friends,

@_subject: New vulnerability in OpenSSL 
BOSTON — Security researchers have uncovered new bugs in the Web encryption software that caused the pernicious “Heartbleed” Internet threat that surfaced in April.
Experts said the newly discovered vulnerabilities in OpenSSL, which could allow hackers to spy on communications, do not appear to be as serious a threat as Heartbleed.
The new bugs were disclosed on Thursday as the group responsible for developing that software released an OpenSSL update that contains seven security fixes.
Experts said that websites and technology firms that use OpenSSL technology should install the update on their systems as quickly as possible. Still, they said that could take several days or weeks because companies need to first test systems to make sure they are compatible with the update.
"They are going to have to patch. This will take some time," said Lee Weiner, senior vice president with cybersecurity software maker Rapid7.
OpenSSL technology is used on about two-thirds of all websites, including ones run by Amazon.com, Facebook, Google, and Yahoo. It is also incorporated into thousands of technology products from companies, including Cisco Systems, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel, and Oracle.
The widespread Heartbleed bug surfaced in April when it was disclosed that the flaw potentially exposed users of those websites and technologies to attack by hackers who could steal large quantities of data without leaving a trace. That prompted fear that attackers may have compromised large numbers of networks without their knowledge.
Security experts said Thursday that the newly discovered bugs are more difficult to exploit than Heartbleed, making those vulnerabilities less of a threat.
Still, until users of the technology update their systems, “there is a window of opportunity” for sophisticated hackers to launch attacks and exploit the newly uncovered vulnerabilities, said Tal Klein, vice president of strategy with cloud security firm Adallom.

@_subject: Internet Giants erect barriers to spy agencies 
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — Just down the road from Google’s main campus here, engineers for the company are accelerating what has become the newest arms race in modern technology: They are making it far more difficult — and far more expensive — for the National Security Agency and the intelligence arms of other governments around the world to pierce their systems.
As fast as it can, Google is sealing up cracks in its systems that Edward J. Snowden revealed the N.S.A. had brilliantly exploited. It is encrypting more data as it moves among its servers and helping customers encode their own emails. Facebook, Microsoft and Yahoo are taking similar steps.
After years of cooperating with the government, the immediate goal now is to thwart Washington — as well as Beijing and Moscow. The strategy is also intended to preserve business overseas in places like Brazil and Germany that have threatened to entrust data only to local providers.
Google, for example, is laying its own fiber optic cable under the world’s oceans, a project that began as an effort to cut costs and extend its influence, but now has an added purpose: to assure that the company will have more control over the movement of its customer data.
But governments are fighting back, harder than ever. The cellphone giant Vodafone reported on Friday that a “small number” of governments around the world have demanded the ability to tap directly into its communication networks, a level of surveillance that elicited outrage from privacy advocates.A year after Mr. Snowden’s revelations, the era of quiet cooperation is over. Telecommunications companies say they are denying requests to volunteer data not covered by existing law. A.T.&T., Verizon and others say that compared with a year ago, they are far more reluctant to cooperate with the United States government in “gray areas” where there is no explicit requirement for a legal warrant.
Vodafone refused to name the nations on Friday for fear of putting its business and employees at risk there. But in an accounting of the number of legal demands for information that it receives from 14 companies, it noted that some countries did not issue warrants to obtain phone, email or web-searching traffic, because “the relevant agencies and authorities already have permanent access to customer communications via their own direct link.”
The company also said it had to acquiesce to some governments’ requests for data to comply with national laws. Otherwise, it said, it faced losing its license to operate in certain countries.
Eric Grosse, Google’s security chief, suggested in an interview that the N.S.A.’s own behavior invited the new arms race.
“I am willing to help on the purely defensive side of things,” he said, referring to Washington’s efforts to enlist Silicon Valley in cybersecurity efforts. “But signals intercept is totally off the table,” he said, referring to national intelligence gathering.
“No hard feelings, but my job is to make their job hard,” he added.
In Washington, officials acknowledge that covert programs are now far harder to execute because American technology companies, fearful of losing international business, are hardening their networks and saying no to requests for the kind of help they once quietly provided.
Robert S. Litt, the general counsel of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees all 17 American spy agencies, said on Wednesday that it was “an unquestionable loss for our nation that companies are losing the willingness to cooperate legally and voluntarily” with American spy agencies.
“Just as there are technological gaps, there are legal gaps,” he said, speaking at the Wilson Center in Washington, “that leave a lot of gray area” governing what companies could turn over.
In the past, he said, “we have been very successful” in getting that data. But he acknowledged that for now, those days are over, and he predicted that “sooner or later there will be some intelligence failure and people will wonder why the intelligence agencies were not able to protect the nation.”
Companies respond that if that happens, it is the government’s own fault and that intelligence agencies, in their quest for broad data collection, have undermined web security for all.
Many point to an episode in 2012, when Russian security researchers uncovered a state espionage tool, Flame, on Iranian computers. Flame, like the Stuxnet worm, is believed to have been produced at least in part by American intelligence agencies. It was created by exploiting a previously unknown flaw in Microsoft’s operating systems. Companies argue that others could have later taken advantage of this defect.
Worried that such an episode undercuts confidence in its wares, Microsoft is now fully encrypting all its products, including Hotmail and Outlook.com, by the end of this year with 2,048-bit encryption, a stronger protection that would take a government far longer to crack. The software is protected by encryption both when it is in data centers and when data is being sent over the Internet, said Bradford L. Smith, the company’s general counsel.
Mr. Smith also said the company was setting up “transparency centers” abroad so that technical experts of foreign governments could come in and inspect Microsoft’s proprietary source code. That will allow foreign governments to check to make sure there are no “back doors” that would permit snooping by United States intelligence agencies. The first such center is being set up in Brussels.
Microsoft has also pushed back harder in court. In a Seattle case, the government issued a “national security letter” to compel Microsoft to turn over data about a customer, along with a gag order to prevent Microsoft from telling the customer it had been compelled to provide its communications to government officials. Microsoft challenged the gag order as violating the First Amendment. The government backed down.
Hardware firms like Cisco, which makes routers and switches, have found their products a frequent subject of Mr. Snowden’s disclosures, and theirbusiness has declined steadily in countries like Asia, Brazil and Europe over the last year. The company is still struggling to convince foreign customers that their networks are safe from hackers — and free of “back doors” installed by the N.S.A. The frustration, companies here say, is that it is nearly impossible to prove that their systems are N.S.A.-proof.
In one slide from the disclosures, N.S.A. analysts pointed to a sweet spot inside Google’s data centers, where they could catch traffic in unencrypted form. Next to a quickly drawn smiley face, an N.S.A. analyst, referring to an acronym for a common layer of protection, had noted, “SSL added and removed here!”Most American companies said they never knowingly let the N.S.A. weaken their systems, or install back doors. But Mr. Snowden’s documents showed how the agency found a way.
Google was already suspicious that its internal traffic could be read, and had started a program to encrypt the links among its internal data centers, “the last chink in our armor,” Mr. Grosse said. But the slide gave the company proof that it was a regular target of the N.S.A. “It was useful to have proof, in terms of accelerating a project already underway,” he said.
Facebook and Yahoo have also been encrypting traffic among their internal servers. And Facebook, Google and Microsoft have been moving to more strongly encrypt consumer traffic with so-called Perfect Forward Secrecy, specifically devised to make it more labor intensive for the N.S.A. or anyone to read stored encrypted communications.
One of the biggest indirect consequences from the Snowden revelations, technology executives say, has been the surge in demands from foreign governments that saw what kind of access to user information the N.S.A. received — voluntarily or surreptitiously. Now they want the same.
At Facebook, Joe Sullivan, the company’s chief security officer, said it had been fending off those demands and heightened expectations.
Until last year, technology companies were forbidden from acknowledging demands from the United States government under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. But in January, Google, Facebook, Yahoo and Microsoft brokered a deal with the Obama administration to disclose the number of such orders they receive in increments of 1,000.
As part of the agreement, the companies agreed to dismiss their lawsuits before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court
“We’re not running and hiding,” Mr. Sullivan said. “We think it should be a transparent process so that people can judge the appropriate ways to handle these kinds of things.”
The latest move in the war between intelligence agencies and technology companies arrived this week, in the form of a new Google encryption tool. The company released a user-friendly, email encryption method to replace the clunky and often mistake-prone encryption schemes the N.S.A. has readily exploited.
But the best part of the tool was buried in Google’s code, which included a jab at the N.S.A.’s smiley-face slide. The code included the phrase: “ssl-added-and-removed-here-; - )”

@_subject: Article on TLS, Transport Layer Security 
(Note:  I, Jim Bell, am cross posting this article from Yahoo, not because I  believe it to be 'accurate' (I have no opinion on that), but because I believe that we need to not merely hear 'The Truth', but also 'The Story', specifically the story (stories) that the Internet-based news media is telling the public.)
From its start in 1971, Internet-based email has not been known for its high security. As security researcher Bruce Schneier wrote in a 1995 essay for Macworld on the privacy perils of email: “It’s like a postcard that anyone can read along the way.” 
That unfortunate fact is finally fracturing. Email is getting safer for you — provided that your mail service and your correspondent’s both use a standard called “TLS,” short for Transport Layer Security. Finally, Google and other providers are starting to turn on TLS for the public.
Read more: 4 Ways Your Email Provider Can Encrypt Your Messages
TLS, then and now
The move to the use of TLS could have happened more than five years ago: A 1.0 version of the TLS specification emerged only four years after Schneier’s essay, and the current 1.2 version dates to 2008. But even as mail services secured people’s log-ins, they did not take the extra step of scrambling their messages while in transit.
Those who knew this would commonly comfort themselves with the lost-in-the-crowd theory of security: With some 183 billion messages a daysent back and forth, who would possibly have the time to look for one in particular? 
Then one year ago, Edward Snowden began giving a crash course in National Security Agency surveillance, which had the policy and, for the first time in history, the technology to collect everything first and index it later. 
After a few weeks of Snowden’s revelations, CNET’s Declan McCullagh made a simple observation: Gmail supported TLS, but other major email services did not, meaning that a huge chunk of the world’s email could be inspected by the NSA and its ilk, because for TLS to work, both sides of an email conversation have to support it.
To make it more difficult for the NSA to simply absorb the world’s email, more tech companies took an active interest in TLS, including Yahoo Tech’s publisher, Yahoo, which had lagged in its support for encryption, according to the Washington Post.
Progress and confusion
With the growing use of TLS, the odds are now lower that your email is going out on a postcard. In mid-May, a study by Facebook found that 58 percent of the social network’s email notifications to members were going out encrypted. And last week, Google posted similar numbers: 71 percent of messages from Gmail to elsewhere went out encrypted, while 50 percent of those received by Gmail also arrived locked.
There’s your good news: We’ve fixed a core defect in email and reduced the capability of well-meaning friends, family, and business partners to inadvertently risk your privacy by sending sensitive data about you in their own email. And with TLS, you don’t have to install any software or change any settings to get its advantage.
The bad news: It’s hard to figure out if your own provider has done its part. 
Google’s regularly updated transparency report now includes a section on “encryption in transit” that lets you check to see if other large mail services do TLS. But it can yield confusing results, and smaller systems (say, your employer’s) don’t show up. 
You can also check for TLS use on any site at STARTTLS.info.
Should you switch?
If you spend any time experimenting with STARTTLS.info, you’ll quickly see how badly many consumer Internet providers’ mail services lag behind webmail. Comcast is turning on TLS one provider at a time, and CenturyLink already supports it. But Time Warner Cable, Verizon, and Cox have not announced plans to enable TLS.
Among webmail companies, Yahoo followed Gmail by turning on TLS in the first quarter of this year, AOL has done the same, and Microsoft is “currently rolling out TLS,” a spokesperson said. 
Checks of Apple’s services show patchy support, and the company did not answer a request for clarification.
There are good reasons to separate your email from your ISP — starting with not having to worry about running out of online storage or having to send hundreds of change-of-address notices if you switch providers. But webmail has its own privacy issue: Most of these services are paid for by ads that target the words in your messages. 
The price to evade the NSA’s eyes doesn’t have to include subjecting your email to your provider’s advertising robots. Among the four big webmail services that now use TLS, Microsoft and Yahoo let you pay to clean the ads from your account  ( $19.95 a year at Microsoft, $49.99 a year at Yahoo), while Google will open a new, $50/year ad-free Google Apps account  for you at the domain name of your choice.
But how many of you have exercised any of those ad-free options?

@_subject: Amazing NSA excuse 
"One thing that makes reporting on the NSA so difficult is that you have to deconstruct their statements like Derrida to figure out what they're actually saying. (This is why all responsible people read Marcy Wheeler.)
"Luckily, here's an NSA issue anyone can sink their teeth into. It demonstrates the squirmy NSA legal technique, and how by its own logic the agency ought to be broken up or closed altogether.
"The background is that the NSA is being sued around the block by all manner of people over the Snowden revelations. Pertaining to a suit brought by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a previous court order had instructed the NSA to preserve data that it had collected under Section 702 of the Amendments Act to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
"That order has since been reversed, because the NSA has claimed (in addition to the usual business about how stopping this program will grievously harm American citizens) that it physically cannot store all the information it collects under Section 702. As Andrea Peterson atThe Washington Post reported, the NSA's deputy director, Richard Ledgett, wrote a rather astonishing court filing, in which he said that "a requirement to preserve all data acquired under Section 702 presents significant operational problems, only one of which is that the NSA may have to shut down all systems and databases that contain Section 702 information." (Emphasis added.) Ironically, Ledgett claims that previous privacy restrictions that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court placed on the program necessitate deleting the data the EFF wants preserved. You can practically see Ledgett sticking his finger in the eye of the EFF's legal director.
"In any case, as Peterson notes, this puts the EFF in a strange position, since it is now arguing to preserve evidence for legal purposes it would ultimately want destroyed as a policy.
"But aside from the legal arcana, this is an excellent example of the Kafkaesque logic that predominates when it it comes to our intelligence agencies. The NSA is almost saying, "We've got your privacy protections in here, honest, but unfortunately it just so happens that these protections mean we have to destroy all this evidence related to your lawsuit." Whatever the situation, it just so happens that the intelligence apparatus is regretfully excused from accountability. Marcy Wheeler is constantly uncovering various iterations of this stuff.
"I'm skeptical that the data preservation the EFF is asking for is impossible. But the really troubling possibility is that the NSA is actually right. It's anybody's guess precisely how much data the NSAis shifting around, but it's reportedly in the exabytes overall. So yes, it might be impossible for the agency to store more than a few weeks or so of the data it's collecting.
"The NSA's legal squirming is bad enough. But an agency writing itself a blank check to allegedly destroy evidence based on the sheer size and complexity of the possibly illegal program in questionis another thing entirely. There shouldn't be an "unless your dragnet surveillance program is reallybig" exception to the Fourth Amendment.

Note:  I wonder what kind of email system would be:   1.  Used by the Federal Government.  2.  NOT be regularly backed-up.   3.  Would lose up to two (2) years of emails in a crash.
         Jim Bell
[article follows]
WASHINGTON (AP) — Congressional investigators are fuming over revelations that the Internal Revenue Service has lost a trove of emails to and from a central figure in the agency's tea party controversy.
The IRS said Lois Lerner's computer crashed in 2011, wiping out an untold number of emails that were being sought by congressional investigators. The investigators want to see all of Lerner's emails from 2009 to 2013 as part of their probe into the way agents handled applications for tax-exempt status by tea party and other conservative groups.
Lerner headed the IRS division that processes applications for tax-exempt status. The IRS acknowledged last year that agents had improperly scrutinized applications by some conservative groups.
"Do they really expect the American people to believe that, after having withheld these emails for a year, they're just now realizing the most critical time period is missing?" said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the House Oversight Committee. "If there wasn't nefarious conduct that went much higher than Lois Lerner in the IRS targeting scandal, why are they playing these games?"
The Oversight Committee is one of three congressional committees investigating the IRS over its handling of tea party applications from 2010 to 2012. The Justice Department and the IRS inspector general are also investigating.
Congressional investigators have shown that IRS officials in Washington were closely involved in the handling of tea party applications, many of which languished for more than a year without action. But so far, they have not publicly produced evidence that anyone outside the agency directed the targeting or even knew about it.
If anyone in the Obama administration outside the agency was involved, investigators were hoping for clues in Lerner's emails.
"The fact that I am just learning about this, over a year into the investigation, is completely unacceptable and now calls into question the credibility of the IRS' response to congressional inquiries," said Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. "There needs to be an immediate investigation and forensic audit by Department of Justice as well as the inspector general."
The IRS said technicians went to great lengths trying to recover data from Lerner's computer in 2011. In emails provided by the IRS, technicians said they sent the computer to a forensic lab run by the agency's criminal investigations unit. But to no avail.
The IRS was able to generate 24,000 Lerner emails from the 2009 to 2011 because Lerner had copied in other IRS employees. The agency said it pieced together the emails from the computers of 82 other IRS employees.
But an untold number are gone. Camp's office said the missing emails are mainly ones to and from people outside the IRS, "such as the White House, Treasury, Department of Justice, FEC, or Democrat offices."
Anti-tax advocate Grover Norquist called the episode "the worst attempt to blame technology in service of a cover-up since the infamous 18-minute gap" in former President Richard Nixon's Watergate tapes.
The IRS said in a statement that more than 250 IRS employees have been working to assist congressional investigations, spending nearly $10 million to produce more than 750,000 documents.
Overall, the IRS said it is producing a total of 67,000 emails to and from Lerner, covering the period from 2009 to 2013.
"The IRS is committed to working with Congress," the IRS said in a statement. "The IRS has remained focused on being thorough and responding as quickly as possible to the wide-ranging requests from Congress while taking steps to protect underlying taxpayer information."
Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, called Friday's disclosure "an outrageous impediment" to the committee's investigation.
"Even more egregious is the fact we are learning about this a full year after our initial request to provide the committee with any and all documents relating to our investigation," Hatch said.
Lerner has emerged as a key figure in the tea party probe. In May 2013, she was the first IRS official to publicly acknowledge that agents had improperly scrutinized applications.
About two weeks later, Lerner was subpoenaed to testify at a congressional hearing. But after making a brief statement in which she said she had done nothing wrong, Lerner refused to answer questions, invoking her constitutional right against self-incrimination.
The IRS placed Lerner on administrative leave shortly after the congressional hearing. She retired last fall.
In May, the House voted to hold Lerner in contempt of Congress. Her case has been turned over to the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia.

Excellent point!  Although, that Utah operation might not have been functioning in 2011.  But presumably the NSA had a smaller operation somewhere else prior to that.
So, who wants to REMIND the prosecutors in IRS-gate that somebody else has these emails?
Maybe the future for the NSA will be as a type of "super-backwards-Carbonite" operation?  But instead of, "Pay us money and we'll back up your emails", it'll be, "Pay us money and we WON'T back up your emails"!!!

The Clever Way GOP Congressman Is Pushing Back After IRS Claims Lois Lerner Emails Were ‘Erased by a Glitch’
Jun. 13, 2014 5:56pm Jason Howerton
Rep. Steve Stockman (R-Texas) asked the National Security Agency on Friday to turn over all the metadata it has collected on the email accounts of former IRS official Lois Lerner from January 2009 to April 2011. Stockman’s clever move comes hours after the tax agency apparently claimed it had lost Lerner’s emails from that same time period due to a computer glitch.
“I have asked NSA Director Rogers to send me all metadata his agency has collected on Lois Lerner’s email accounts for the period which the House sought records,” Stockmansaid in a press release. “The metadata will establish who Lerner contacted and when, which helps investigators determine the extent of illegal activity by the IRS.”
“The claim incriminating communications were erased by a glitch conjures memories of Rose Mary Woods,” the congressman added.  “Barack Obama has brought us Jimmy Carter’s economy and Richard Nixon’s excuses.”
Congress requested all emails sent from Lerner to and from other IRS employees from early 2009 to April 2011. After promising to turn them over, the IRS said Friday it can’t find any of those emails.
Stockman isn’t the only member of Congress who isn’t buying the excuse. Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) asked, “If there wasn’t nefarious conduct that went much higher than Lois Lerner in the IRS targeting scandal, why are they playing these games?”
TheBlaze has reached out to Frederick R. Chang, a recognized national expert in cyber security and SMU professor, to see if there are ways the emails “lost” due to a glitch or crash could be recovered. We will update this story should he respond.

Congressman Asks NSA To Restore Two Years Of "Lost" Lois Lerner IRS Emails
Submitted by Tyler Durden on 06/14/2014 21:47 -0400
Yesterday, the republican campaign to get to the bottom of IRS' targeting of conservative groups was dealt an absolutely idiotic blow when the IRS, in all seriousness, announced that it had lost two years worth of emails to and from the chief subject of the investigation: former agency official Lois Lerner.
As House Ways and Means Commitee chairman Dave Camp said, "The fact that I am just learning about this, over a year into the investigation, is completely unacceptable and now calls into question the credibility of the IRS’s response to congressional inquiries,” he said in a statement. "There needs to be an immediate investigation and forensic audit by Department of Justice as well as the Inspector General."
According to NRO, the agency informed Camp that a computer crash resulted in the loss of e-mails between January 2009 and April 2011 sent between Lerner and outside agencies such as the White House and the Department of Justice. "Those messages are particularly relevant given revelations earlier this week that the agency in 2010 transmitted a database to the FBI containing confidential taxpayer information, potentially in violation of federal law."
The IRS said in a separate statement that it has or will produce 24,000 e-mails from the period between 2009 and 2011 using the files of 82 individuals with whom Lerner corresponded, and that it has produced nearly all of the 67,000 e-mails sent and received by Lerner during her time at the agency.
Apparently lack of document (and email) retention is a crime for everyone, but not for the IRS. And furthermore, only when it comes to the IRS, can a single computer crash destroy the entire email path history, even as it crosses through countless servers across the world, and ultimately lands in somebody else's inbox.
It goes without saying that for the IRS to even assume someone would believe this particular, and quite spectacular, lie is beyond insulting to even the most gullible idiot among the US population.
So we won't say it.
What, however, was simply a bizarre, if idiotic, lie has just been taken to a whole new level of ridiculousness, when moments ago, representative Steve Stockman (R-Texas) announced he would request that the National Security Agency help in the hunt for missing emails to and from the IRS’s Lois Lerner, and recover two years worth of "lost" emails. From the Hill:
In a letter to NSA Director Michael Rogers on Friday, Stockman requested that the NSA turn over information it has about emails between Lerner and outside groups between January 2009 and April 2011.
Turns out all those jokes about people calling the NSA and asking for backups of lost emails and of course files (because remember, courtesy of complicit megacorporations, the NSA has full backdoor access to everything anyone does) - they weren't jokes at all.
And now the NSA is caught between a rock and a hard place: because if it refuses an officialcongressional demand, it shows once again that the spy agency is entirely separated from any concept of checks and balances and accountability; if it complies, it confirms that all the NSA is, considering it can't even tap into a bunch of Al Qaeda phones and figure out what the jihadists' strategy is in Iraq, is just a massive data repository of all US electronic information, to be abused at will by corrupt, criminal government workers, some of whom will likely have to resort to the "dog ate my emails" excuse in the immediate future.

@_subject: Tell a lie, 
Tell a lie, remove the gear: How the NSA covers up when cable taps are found
Get caught, remove the evidence, and come up with a plausible cover story.
by Nate Anderson - June 19 2014, 10:56am PDT23Der Spiegel via Edward Snowden via NSA
Sometimes, the spooks do get caught. German magazine Der Spiegel yesterday revealed a new slide (PDF) from the Edward Snowden document cache that offers a tantalizing glimpse of what it looks like when someone stumbles on an intelligence agency cable tap.
The NSA's Special Source Operations (SSO) branch isn't in the business of computer hacking but of cable tapping; its logo shows an eagle flying above the globe and clutching a string of wires in its talons. These taps, each obscured with a codename, are often made deep within the network of telecom providers and often with the cooperation of key executives. But sometimes non-cleared people start raising questions about just what might be going on, as was the case with AT&T whistleblower Mark Klein, who revealed an NSA "secret room" in San Francisco.
On March 14, 2013, an SSO weekly briefing included a note regarding such a discovery. The unit had been informed two days earlier that "the access point for WHARPDRIVE was discovered by commercial consortium personnel. Witting partner personnel have removed the evidence and a plausible cover story was provided. All collection has ceased."
According to Der Spiegel, Wharpdrive was a fiber-optic cable tap (underseas fiber is often laid by consortia of companies, so it's possible this took place at an onshore landing point for such a cable). Employees from one of the companies involved—though not the company that had a relationship with NSA and the German intelligence agency BND—apparently noticed some unusual gear and commented on it. In response, the company involved with the NSA ("witting partner personnel") removed the tap and made up a story to explain what the gear in question had been doing.
Though the NSA lost access to Wharpdrive, it wasn't for long. Der Spiegel cites additional documents in its possession and says that "a team was quietly put together to reinstall the program."

Any reports of my demise are at least slightly in error. But, I have been laughing, a bit, about the Mt.

Clearly, this points to the need to expand the AP/AM implementations to include 'indefinite targets': AP targets whose names aren't known at the time the donation is made.  And, even targets who really don't even exist at the time the donation is made.  Presumably, Satoshi is still alive and well, thus nobody out there (yet) has harmed him.  Somebody might want to put money (BTC) on anyone who would do so.

"In a bit of news that's familiar to anyone who ever put on an old jacket and found $20 in the pocket, embattled Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has made a fortuitous discovery. The company announced (PDF) in Japan that it found 200,000 Bitcoin (worth nearly $116 million at the moment) in a wallet from 2011 that it no longer used. That's less than a quarter of the 850,000 Bitcoins CEO Mark Karpeles reported were missing, but at the moment, at least it's something. According to its statement, the coins were moved to online wallets on the 7th, and then to offline wallets on the 14th and 15th. The mystery of what happened to Mt. Gox's funds is still far from solved, but between this news and reports of updated balances for account holders, it seems possible that there's something to be recovered from the shuttered exchange. Next up, removing all of the cushions from the sofa and pulling it away from the wall."

For a single, tiny piece of "captcha", that might very well be true.  But suppose the telephone metadata information for a billion phone calls per day is turned into "captcha's".  How much CPU power would the NSA have to apply, each day, just to back-convert that metadata into computer-searchable form?  Admittedly, that's irrelevant:  The NSA would simply ask the court to order the company to stop being a wiseass, and to stop using the captcha technique.

"cypherpunks Secrets, lies and Snowden's email: why I was forced to shut down Lavabit
For the first time, the founder of an encrypted email startup that was supposed to insure privacy for all reveals how the FBI and the US legal system made sure we don't have the right to much privacy in the first place
By Ladar Levison
May 20 2014
My legal saga started last summer with a knock at the door, behind which stood two federal agents ready to to serve me with a court order requiring the installation of surveillance equipment on my company's network.
My company, Lavabit, provided email services to 410,000 people ­ including Edward Snowden, according to news reports ­ and thrived by offering features specifically
 designed to protect the privacy and security of its customers. I had no choice but to consent to the installation of their device, which would hand the US government access to all of the messages ­ to and from all of my customers ­ as they travelled between their email accounts other providers on the Internet.
But that wasn't enough. The federal agents then claimed that their court order required me to surrender my company's private encryption keys, and I balked. What they said they needed were customer passwords ­ which were sent securely ­ so that they could access the plain-text versions of messages from customers using my company's encrypted storage feature. (The government would later claim they only made this demand because of my "noncompliance".)
Bothered by what the agents were saying, I informed them that I would first need to read the order they had just
 delivered ­ and then consult with an attorney. The feds seemed surprised by my hesitation.
What ensued was a flurry of legal proceedings that would last 38 days, ending not only my startup but also destroying, bit by bit, the very principle upon which I founded it ­ that we all have a right to personal privacy.
In the first two weeks, I was served legal papers a total of seven times and was in contact with the FBI every other day. (This was the period a prosecutor would later characterize as my "period of silence".) It took a week for me to identify an attorney who could adequately represent me, given the complex technological and legal issues involved ­ and we were in contact for less than a day when agents served me with a summons ordering me to appear in a Virginia courtroom, over 1,000 miles from my home. Two days later, I was served the first subpoena for the
 encryption keys.
With such short notice, my first attorney was unable to appear alongside me in court. Because the whole case was under seal, I couldn't even admit to anyone who wasn't an attorney that I needed a lawyer, let alone why. In the days before my appearance, I would spend hours repeating the facts of the case to a dozen attorneys, as I sought someone else that was qualified to represent me. I also discovered that as a third party in a federal criminal indictment, I had no right to counsel. After all, only my property was in jeopardy ­ not my liberty. Finally, I was forced to choose between appearing alone or facing a bench warrant for my arrest.
In Virginia, the government replaced its encryption key subpoena with a search warrant and a new court date. I retained a small, local law firm before I went back to my home state, which was then forced to assemble a
 legal strategy and file briefs in just a few short days. The court barred them from consulting outside experts about either the statutes or the technology involved in the case. The court didn't even deliver transcripts of my first appearance to my own lawyers for two months, and forced them to proceed without access to the information they needed.
Then, a federal judge entered an order of contempt against me ­ without even so much as a hearing.
Jim Bell's stuff below:
I wonder if Ladar Levison could have done the following:
1.Written up all documents he had been served with (even if ostensibly "secret" ) as "exhibits" in a lawsuit,, perhaps in a State court.
2. Filed it in a State court.
2a. He might "serve" it on someone, not a party to any Federal action.
3. It would be then "Instantly" published in on the Internet, before the State court could have entered any sort of "under seal" order for those documents.  He would be publishing as-filed State Court filings; presumably he would be entitled to do so, even if they were copies of other documents.
Myself, I feel that no court can legitimately have any legal authority to order anyone to not speak about a legal proceeding.  It's easy to explain why:  The First Amendment, and the well-known prohibition against prior restraint, etc.  But the reality is that courts have developed the idea that "order" the "sealing" of documents.  I don't have an argument with an idea that a court can order an employee of government to not speak, precisely because he IS a government employee.  But Mr. Levison wasn't, and isn't a government employee.
Would the procedure I described above 'get around' the law?

Well, in this case, it doesn't really have anything to do with what the State court can _do_.  Everything would happen BEFORE the State court has an opportunity to realize what's going on.   ("May you be in Heaven 30 minutes before the Devil knows you're dead").   The purpose is to use the State court as a 'prop':  The document(s) filed with that State court will, presumably, _also_be orders in a Federal Court case which a Federal Court Judge orders some private individual to 'not disclose', as if that Federal judge had authority to do so.  But, there is also a strong presumption that people have a right to file civil cases in state courts, and such documents filed in those State courts (generally)  become public-domain documents.  (Unless somebody specifically requests that those documents be, themselves, 'sealed', and the State court judge approves this.)
If a person who is the target of a "sealed" Federal filing chooses to file the documents in a State court case, I presume he remains entitled to file those documents freely in the State court case.  And, once so file, those documents will automatically become public-domain documents (at least until they are, themselves, sealed) and they can be published on the Internet.  It would be a very tricky question whether any party in this whole mix can be 'punished' for arranging this kind of dance.  I think a lawyer would have a good-faith belief that this is a proper exercise of law.  The ultimate goal, though, is to 'legally' publish documents that some Federal judge doesn't want to see published.  Since the mere publication of those documents destroys their secrecy, I think some lawyer should look into this, for the future.

@_subject: House Passes Curbs on NSA Phone Surveillance 
WASHINGTON (AP) — In an overwhelming vote, the House moved the U.S. closer to ending the National Security Agency's bulk collection of Americans' phone records Thursday, the most significant demonstration to date of leaker Edward Snowden's impact on the debate over privacy versus security.
But the final version of the legislation, "watered down" in the words of one supporter, also showed the limits of that impact. The bill was severely weakened to mollify U.S. intelligence agencies, which insisted that the surveillance programs that shocked many Americans are a critical bulwark against terror plots.
The bill was approved 303-121, which means that most House members can now say they voted to end what many critics consider the most troubling practice Snowden disclosed — the collection and storage of U.S. calling data by the secretive intelligence agency. But almost no other major provision designed to restrict NSA surveillance, including limits on the secret court that grants warrants to search the data, survived the negotiations to get the bill to the House floor.
And even the prohibition on bulk collection of Americans' communications records has been called into question by some activists who say a last-minute change in wording diminished what was sold as a ban.
"People will say, 'We did something, and isn't something enough,'" said Steven Aftergood, who tracks intelligence issues for the Federation of American Scientists. "But this bill doesn't fundamentally resolve the uncertainties that generated the whole controversy."
Though some privacy activists continued to back the bill, others withdrew support, as did technology companies such as Google and Facebook.

Rep. Mike Rogers of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said, "I believe this is a workable compromise that protects the core function of a counterterrorism program we know has saved lives around the world."
The measure now heads to the Senate, where Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., told reporters Thursday that "we must do something."
The USA Freedom Act would codify a proposal made in January by President Barack Obama, who said he wanted to end the NSA's practice of collecting and storing the "to and from" records of nearly every American landline telephone call under a program that searched the data for connections to terrorist plots abroad.
The phone records program was revealed though the leaks last year by Snowden, who used his job as a computer network administrator to remove tens of thousands of secret documents from an NSA facility in Hawaii. Snowden fled first to China, then Russia where he is avoiding an extradition order to face criminal charges for revealing classified information.
The phone companies create and store those billing records, and the legislation still would give the NSA authority to request batches of data from the companies to search in terrorism investigations in response to a judicial order. Law enforcement agents routinely obtain such records in criminal investigations.
HOUSE VOTES TO CURB NSA DATA COLLECTION
The USA Freedom Act started its life as the idea of those who wanted to clamp down on NSA surveillance, but it was "watered down," as Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., acknowledged, shedding a series of provisions favored by civil liberties activists. Some activists continued to back the bill, including the American Civil Liberties Union, whose Washington legislative director, Laura Murphy, called it an imperfect but "unambiguous statement of congressional intent to rein in the out-of-control NSA."
Technology companies such as Google and Facebook said they were most concerned with a last-minute definition change that they fear will allow the government to collect huge volumes of records — including, for example, records of all the phone calls made from a particular U.S. city during a certain period, or all the internet data associated with a particular commercial router.
The bill's original text limited the government's data requests to those associated with specific people, entities or accounts. The approved version says the government may use any "specific selection term" to set the parameters of its search, including a type of device or an address. The new language appears to allow much broader data requests.
"The new version deliberately contains ambiguity in a very critical area," said Harley Geiger, senior counsel for the Center for Democracy and Technology. "We've learned about the government track record of exploiting ambiguity in the law to broaden its surveillance activity."
Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said the vagueness was designed to protect the government's surveillance methods, not to facilitate secret bulk collection.
Other provisions that were dropped from the bill included requirements to estimate the number of Americans whose records were captured under the program, and the creation of a public advocate to challenge the government's legal arguments before the secret surveillance court.
NSA officials were pleased with the bill for another reason: The new arrangement will give them access to mobile calling records they did not have under the old program.

It would be a very interesting test case.  I would say it shouldn't happen, but a lot of outrages occur.
  Another version might be where an American company informs its foreign law firm of the status of the court order; the foreign law firm has a long-standing practice (contracted by the American company) of publishing the status of the NSL-status remotely.  The (American) judge would not have any jurisdiction over the foreign law firm to order it to (falsely) claim that no NSL order had arrived at the American company.  At that point, the question will be, "Can a judge order an American company to not inform its foreign law firm of relevant information (an NSL order), solely because if it did, the foreign law firm will adjust its publication of an announcement?"

Generally, legally agents of a corporation cannot conspire with each other.   (Google:  'corporation cannot conspire with itself'       )    Therefore, one possible tactic for a corporation that receives an NSL is to deliver a copy of that  NSL letter to each of its employees, including employees of all subsidiaries, naturally with a stern letter that they not disclose that to anyone else!   Obviously, that news will leak.  The government will 'know' that somebody, probably within the corporation, did the leak.  But given the size of the typical telecommunications company (thousands of employees), the actual source(s) of the leak(s) will be unknown.  Prosecution of any specific corporate employee will be difficult without very detailed evidence.
       The issue will arise:  Can a corporation legally deliver a copy of that NSL to each employee?  Well, each employee would probably be 'imputed' (legally assumed) to know of such an order, even if they did not actually know of it.  Since they are legally obliged to comply with that order, it would be grotesque to not allow them to become actually aware of that specific order.  I think in the end the courts would have to agree that a corporation is entitled to inform each of their employees of the existence and content of the NSL.

For a single, tiny piece of "captcha", that might very well be true.  But suppose the telephone metadata information for a billion phone calls per day is turned into "captcha's".  How much CPU power would the NSA have to apply, each day, just to back-convert that metadata into computer-searchable form?  Admittedly, that's irrelevant:  The NSA would simply ask the court to order the company to stop being a wiseass, and to stop using the captcha technique.

"cypherpunks Secrets, lies and Snowden's email: why I was forced to shut down Lavabit
For the first time, the founder of an encrypted email startup that was supposed to insure privacy for all reveals how the FBI and the US legal system made sure we don't have the right to much privacy in the first place
By Ladar Levison
May 20 2014
My legal saga started last summer with a knock at the door, behind which stood two federal agents ready to to serve me with a court order requiring the installation of surveillance equipment on my company's network.
My company, Lavabit, provided email services to 410,000 people ­ including Edward Snowden, according to news reports ­ and thrived by offering features specifically
 designed to protect the privacy and security of its customers. I had no choice but to consent to the installation of their device, which would hand the US government access to all of the messages ­ to and from all of my customers ­ as they travelled between their email accounts other providers on the Internet.
But that wasn't enough. The federal agents then claimed that their court order required me to surrender my company's private encryption keys, and I balked. What they said they needed were customer passwords ­ which were sent securely ­ so that they could access the plain-text versions of messages from customers using my company's encrypted storage feature. (The government would later claim they only made this demand because of my "noncompliance".)
Bothered by what the agents were saying, I informed them that I would first need to read the order they had just
 delivered ­ and then consult with an attorney. The feds seemed surprised by my hesitation.
What ensued was a flurry of legal proceedings that would last 38 days, ending not only my startup but also destroying, bit by bit, the very principle upon which I founded it ­ that we all have a right to personal privacy.
In the first two weeks, I was served legal papers a total of seven times and was in contact with the FBI every other day. (This was the period a prosecutor would later characterize as my "period of silence".) It took a week for me to identify an attorney who could adequately represent me, given the complex technological and legal issues involved ­ and we were in contact for less than a day when agents served me with a summons ordering me to appear in a Virginia courtroom, over 1,000 miles from my home. Two days later, I was served the first subpoena for the
 encryption keys.
With such short notice, my first attorney was unable to appear alongside me in court. Because the whole case was under seal, I couldn't even admit to anyone who wasn't an attorney that I needed a lawyer, let alone why. In the days before my appearance, I would spend hours repeating the facts of the case to a dozen attorneys, as I sought someone else that was qualified to represent me. I also discovered that as a third party in a federal criminal indictment, I had no right to counsel. After all, only my property was in jeopardy ­ not my liberty. Finally, I was forced to choose between appearing alone or facing a bench warrant for my arrest.
In Virginia, the government replaced its encryption key subpoena with a search warrant and a new court date. I retained a small, local law firm before I went back to my home state, which was then forced to assemble a
 legal strategy and file briefs in just a few short days. The court barred them from consulting outside experts about either the statutes or the technology involved in the case. The court didn't even deliver transcripts of my first appearance to my own lawyers for two months, and forced them to proceed without access to the information they needed.
Then, a federal judge entered an order of contempt against me ­ without even so much as a hearing.
Jim Bell's stuff below:
I wonder if Ladar Levison could have done the following:
1.Written up all documents he had been served with (even if ostensibly "secret" ) as "exhibits" in a lawsuit,, perhaps in a State court.
2. Filed it in a State court.
2a. He might "serve" it on someone, not a party to any Federal action.
3. It would be then "Instantly" published in on the Internet, before the State court could have entered any sort of "under seal" order for those documents.  He would be publishing as-filed State Court filings; presumably he would be entitled to do so, even if they were copies of other documents.
Myself, I feel that no court can legitimately have any legal authority to order anyone to not speak about a legal proceeding.  It's easy to explain why:  The First Amendment, and the well-known prohibition against prior restraint, etc.  But the reality is that courts have developed the idea that "order" the "sealing" of documents.  I don't have an argument with an idea that a court can order an employee of government to not speak, precisely because he IS a government employee.  But Mr. Levison wasn't, and isn't a government employee.
Would the procedure I described above 'get around' the law?

Well, in this case, it doesn't really have anything to do with what the State court can _do_.  Everything would happen BEFORE the State court has an opportunity to realize what's going on.   ("May you be in Heaven 30 minutes before the Devil knows you're dead").   The purpose is to use the State court as a 'prop':  The document(s) filed with that State court will, presumably, _also_be orders in a Federal Court case which a Federal Court Judge orders some private individual to 'not disclose', as if that Federal judge had authority to do so.  But, there is also a strong presumption that people have a right to file civil cases in state courts, and such documents filed in those State courts (generally)  become public-domain documents.  (Unless somebody specifically requests that those documents be, themselves, 'sealed', and the State court judge approves this.)
If a person who is the target of a "sealed" Federal filing chooses to file the documents in a State court case, I presume he remains entitled to file those documents freely in the State court case.  And, once so file, those documents will automatically become public-domain documents (at least until they are, themselves, sealed) and they can be published on the Internet.  It would be a very tricky question whether any party in this whole mix can be 'punished' for arranging this kind of dance.  I think a lawyer would have a good-faith belief that this is a proper exercise of law.  The ultimate goal, though, is to 'legally' publish documents that some Federal judge doesn't want to see published.  Since the mere publication of those documents destroys their secrecy, I think some lawyer should look into this, for the future.

@_subject: House Passes Curbs on NSA Phone Surveillance 
WASHINGTON (AP) — In an overwhelming vote, the House moved the U.S. closer to ending the National Security Agency's bulk collection of Americans' phone records Thursday, the most significant demonstration to date of leaker Edward Snowden's impact on the debate over privacy versus security.
But the final version of the legislation, "watered down" in the words of one supporter, also showed the limits of that impact. The bill was severely weakened to mollify U.S. intelligence agencies, which insisted that the surveillance programs that shocked many Americans are a critical bulwark against terror plots.
The bill was approved 303-121, which means that most House members can now say they voted to end what many critics consider the most troubling practice Snowden disclosed — the collection and storage of U.S. calling data by the secretive intelligence agency. But almost no other major provision designed to restrict NSA surveillance, including limits on the secret court that grants warrants to search the data, survived the negotiations to get the bill to the House floor.
And even the prohibition on bulk collection of Americans' communications records has been called into question by some activists who say a last-minute change in wording diminished what was sold as a ban.
"People will say, 'We did something, and isn't something enough,'" said Steven Aftergood, who tracks intelligence issues for the Federation of American Scientists. "But this bill doesn't fundamentally resolve the uncertainties that generated the whole controversy."
Though some privacy activists continued to back the bill, others withdrew support, as did technology companies such as Google and Facebook.

Rep. Mike Rogers of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said, "I believe this is a workable compromise that protects the core function of a counterterrorism program we know has saved lives around the world."
The measure now heads to the Senate, where Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., told reporters Thursday that "we must do something."
The USA Freedom Act would codify a proposal made in January by President Barack Obama, who said he wanted to end the NSA's practice of collecting and storing the "to and from" records of nearly every American landline telephone call under a program that searched the data for connections to terrorist plots abroad.
The phone records program was revealed though the leaks last year by Snowden, who used his job as a computer network administrator to remove tens of thousands of secret documents from an NSA facility in Hawaii. Snowden fled first to China, then Russia where he is avoiding an extradition order to face criminal charges for revealing classified information.
The phone companies create and store those billing records, and the legislation still would give the NSA authority to request batches of data from the companies to search in terrorism investigations in response to a judicial order. Law enforcement agents routinely obtain such records in criminal investigations.
HOUSE VOTES TO CURB NSA DATA COLLECTION
The USA Freedom Act started its life as the idea of those who wanted to clamp down on NSA surveillance, but it was "watered down," as Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., acknowledged, shedding a series of provisions favored by civil liberties activists. Some activists continued to back the bill, including the American Civil Liberties Union, whose Washington legislative director, Laura Murphy, called it an imperfect but "unambiguous statement of congressional intent to rein in the out-of-control NSA."
Technology companies such as Google and Facebook said they were most concerned with a last-minute definition change that they fear will allow the government to collect huge volumes of records — including, for example, records of all the phone calls made from a particular U.S. city during a certain period, or all the internet data associated with a particular commercial router.
The bill's original text limited the government's data requests to those associated with specific people, entities or accounts. The approved version says the government may use any "specific selection term" to set the parameters of its search, including a type of device or an address. The new language appears to allow much broader data requests.
"The new version deliberately contains ambiguity in a very critical area," said Harley Geiger, senior counsel for the Center for Democracy and Technology. "We've learned about the government track record of exploiting ambiguity in the law to broaden its surveillance activity."
Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said the vagueness was designed to protect the government's surveillance methods, not to facilitate secret bulk collection.
Other provisions that were dropped from the bill included requirements to estimate the number of Americans whose records were captured under the program, and the creation of a public advocate to challenge the government's legal arguments before the secret surveillance court.
NSA officials were pleased with the bill for another reason: The new arrangement will give them access to mobile calling records they did not have under the old program.

It would be a very interesting test case.  I would say it shouldn't happen, but a lot of outrages occur.
  Another version might be where an American company informs its foreign law firm of the status of the court order; the foreign law firm has a long-standing practice (contracted by the American company) of publishing the status of the NSL-status remotely.  The (American) judge would not have any jurisdiction over the foreign law firm to order it to (falsely) claim that no NSL order had arrived at the American company.  At that point, the question will be, "Can a judge order an American company to not inform its foreign law firm of relevant information (an NSL order), solely because if it did, the foreign law firm will adjust its publication of an announcement?"

Generally, legally agents of a corporation cannot conspire with each other.   (Google:  'corporation cannot conspire with itself'       )    Therefore, one possible tactic for a corporation that receives an NSL is to deliver a copy of that  NSL letter to each of its employees, including employees of all subsidiaries, naturally with a stern letter that they not disclose that to anyone else!   Obviously, that news will leak.  The government will 'know' that somebody, probably within the corporation, did the leak.  But given the size of the typical telecommunications company (thousands of employees), the actual source(s) of the leak(s) will be unknown.  Prosecution of any specific corporate employee will be difficult without very detailed evidence.
       The issue will arise:  Can a corporation legally deliver a copy of that NSL to each employee?  Well, each employee would probably be 'imputed' (legally assumed) to know of such an order, even if they did not actually know of it.  Since they are legally obliged to comply with that order, it would be grotesque to not allow them to become actually aware of that specific order.  I think in the end the courts would have to agree that a corporation is entitled to inform each of their employees of the existence and content of the NSL.

To repeat what ought to be well-known, in order to be patentable, an invention must be:
1.   New
2.   Useful
3.   Unobvious to those skilled in the art.
Those two primes were clearly not 'new'.  (The knowledge by humans that those primes WERE primes may have been new, however.  But I don't think that qualifies.)
Arguably, these primes are 'useful'.
However, these numbers (to the extent they are primes) are indeed 'obvious' to those skilled in the art.
Also, I believe there is a rule that says that laws of nature aren't patentable.  To the extent that primality is a law of nature, it shouldn't be patentable.  
The good news is that patents last 20 years these days.  If the patent was granted in 1994, it either has run out or shortly will do so.

There is a long (and interesting, though I don't consider myself a mathematician) debate on whether "mathematics" was "invented" or "discovered".  I tend to think of it as being "discovered", if for no other reason than I don't believe mathematicians have much choice about what the mathematics will do.  (They have the same choice that all archeologists do, deciding where to dig, but they can't choose what to find once they start digging at some specific location.)

My understanding is that they are part of nature.  If you think about it, to hunter-gatherer-level societies, negative numbers could be called "imaginary":  There is no such thing as "negative-3 sheep", for instance.  Nor is there a third of a (living) sheep.  It was easy enough for people to divorce themselves from the idea of integers, or positive numbers.  It was much more difficult to deal with "irrational numbers" (numbers which could not be expressed as the ratio of two integers).  
Square roots were comparatively easy...as long as you were talking a positive number.  Computing imaginary roots seems terribly difficult, until you express the number in terms of a real/imaginary graph, and voila, it's trivial again.  I think that (e (to the power of (2 times pi times I)) -1) =0   was discovered at least a couple hundred years ago.   It's been attributed to Euler, nearly 300 years ago.
And the various string theories proposed in the last 20 years require the universe to contain 10 or 11 dimensions, with 6 (or 7) of them wound up tightly, perhaps near a Planck length.  (10e(-33)cm).

I guess I'm still not being clear.  It would be my way of objecting to a court's ordering the telecom company that I might work for (or, one day, that I might own?!?) to present an "electronically-readable" form of the telephone metadata of millions of telephones.  The judge ordered that; my sneaky response would be to generate an "electronically-readable" file, basically a pdf file or a series of same, itself with an image that looks like "captcha" information:  relatively easy for a human to read, but rather difficult for any computer to turn into easily-useable (searchable) information.  In other words, the information would be presented to the NSA, but it would be essentially unuseable without being (first) human-decoded.

Secrets, lies and Snowden's email: why I was forced to shut down Lavabit
For the first time, the founder of an encrypted email startup that was supposed to insure privacy for all reveals how the FBI and the US legal system made sure we don't have the right to much privacy in the first place
By Ladar Levison
May 20 2014
My legal saga started last summer with a knock at the door, behind which stood two federal agents ready to to serve me with a court order requiring the installation of surveillance equipment on my company's network.
My company, Lavabit, provided email services to 410,000 people ­ including Edward Snowden, according to news reports ­ and thrived by offering features specifically
 designed to protect the privacy and security of its customers. I had no choice but to consent to the installation of their device, which would hand the US government access to all of the messages ­ to and from all of my customers ­ as they travelled between their email accounts other providers on the Internet.
But that wasn't enough. The federal agents then claimed that their court order required me to surrender my company's private encryption keys, and I balked. What they said they needed were customer passwords ­ which were sent securely ­ so that they could access the plain-text versions of messages from customers using my company's encrypted storage feature. (The government would later claim they only made this demand because of my "noncompliance".)
Bothered by what the agents were saying, I informed them that I would first need to read the order they had just

(This was the period a prosecutor would later characterize as my "period of silence".) It took a week for me to identify an attorney who could adequately represent me, given the complex technological and legal issues involved ­ and we were in contact for less than a day when agents served me with a summons ordering me to appear in a Virginia courtroom, over 1,000 miles from my home. Two days later, I was served the first subpoena for the

2a. He might "serve" it on someone, not a party to any Federal action.
3. It would be then "Instantly" published in on the Internet, before the State court could have entered any sort of "under seal" order for those documents.  He would be publishing as-filed State Court filings; presumably he would be entitled to do so, even if they were copies of other documents.

And even the prohibition on bulk collection of Americans' communications records has been called into question by some activists who say a last-minute change in wording diminished what was sold as a ban.
"People will say, 'We did something, and isn't something enough,'" said Steven Aftergood, who tracks intelligence issues for the Federation of American Scientists. "But this bill doesn't fundamentally resolve the uncertainties that generated the whole controversy."
Though some privacy activists continued to back the bill, others withdrew support, as did technology companies such as Google and Facebook.

Rep. Mike Rogers of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said, "I believe this is a workable compromise that protects the core function of a counterterrorism program we know has saved lives around the world."
The measure now heads to the Senate, where Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., told reporters Thursday that "we must do something."
The USA Freedom Act would codify a proposal made in January by President Barack Obama, who said he wanted to end the NSA's practice of collecting and storing the "to and from" records of nearly every American landline telephone call under a program that searched the data for connections to terrorist plots abroad.
The phone records program was revealed though the leaks last year by Snowden, who used his job as a computer network administrator to remove tens of thousands of secret documents from an NSA facility in Hawaii. Snowden fled first to China, then Russia where he is avoiding an extradition order to face criminal charges for revealing classified information.
The phone companies create and store those billing records, and the legislation still would give the NSA authority to request batches of data from the companies to search in terrorism investigations in response to a judicial order. Law enforcement agents routinely obtain such records in criminal investigations.
HOUSE VOTES TO CURB NSA DATA COLLECTION
The USA Freedom Act started its life as the idea of those who wanted to clamp down on NSA surveillance, but it was "watered down," as Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., acknowledged, shedding a series of provisions favored by civil liberties activists. Some activists continued to back the bill, including the American Civil Liberties Union, whose Washington legislative director, Laura Murphy, called it an imperfect but "unambiguous statement of congressional intent to rein in the out-of-control NSA."
Technology companies such as Google and Facebook said they were most concerned with a last-minute definition change that they fear will allow the government to collect huge volumes of records — including, for example, records of all the phone calls made from a particular U.S. city during a certain period, or all the internet data associated with a particular commercial router.
The bill's original text limited the government's data requests to those associated with specific people, entities or accounts. The approved version says the government may use any "specific selection term" to set the parameters of its search, including a type of device or an address. The new language appears to allow much broader data requests.
"The new version deliberately contains ambiguity in a very critical area," said Harley Geiger, senior counsel for the Center for Democracy and Technology. "We've learned about the government track record of exploiting ambiguity in the law to broaden its surveillance activity."
Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said the vagueness was designed to protect the government's surveillance methods, not to facilitate secret bulk collection.
Other provisions that were dropped from the bill included requirements to estimate the number of Americans whose records were captured under the program, and the creation of a public advocate to challenge the government's legal arguments before the secret surveillance court.
NSA officials were pleased with the bill for another reason: The new arrangement will give them access to mobile calling records they did not have under the old program.

It would be a very interesting test case.  I would say it shouldn't happen, but a lot of outrages occur.
  Another version might be where an American company informs its foreign law firm of the status of the court order; the foreign law firm has a long-standing practice (contracted by the American company) of publishing the status of the NSL-status remotely.  The (American) judge would not have any jurisdiction over the foreign law firm to order it to (falsely) claim that no NSL order had arrived at the American company.  At that point, the question will be, "Can a judge order an American company to not inform its foreign law firm of relevant information (an NSL order), solely because if it did, the foreign law firm will adjust its publication of an announcement?"

Generally, legally agents of a corporation cannot conspire with each other.   (Google:  'corporation cannot conspire with itself'       )    Therefore, one possible tactic for a corporation that receives an NSL is to deliver a copy of that  NSL letter to each of its employees, including employees of all subsidiaries, naturally with a stern letter that they not disclose that to anyone else!   Obviously, that news will leak.  The government will 'know' that somebody, probably within the corporation, did the leak.  But given the size of the typical telecommunications company (thousands of employees), the actual source(s) of the leak(s) will be unknown.  Prosecution of any specific corporate employee will be difficult without very detailed evidence.
       The issue will arise:  Can a corporation legally deliver a copy of that NSL to each employee?  Well, each employee would probably be 'imputed' (legally assumed) to know of such an order, even if they did not actually know of it.  Since they are legally obliged to comply with that order, it would be grotesque to not allow them to become actually aware of that specific order.  I think in the end the courts would have to agree that a corporation is entitled to inform each of their employees of the existence and content of the NSL.
