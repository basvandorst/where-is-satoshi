Hopefully Moore's Law will save us, but I actually expect that, should
Bitcoin continue to grow, most payments will be made through payment
services of some kind, with the actual transactions only used to deposit
money in your account with the payment service. This is analogous to how
gold was used once banking became popular.
Should these payment services become full-fledged banks, they could help
with the deflation problem as well by engaging in fractional reserve
banking, the same way banks did with gold. Many people have a negative
impression of fractional reserve banking, but in fact most of the
instability experienced in the US was actually caused by restrictions on
branching and requirements that banks invest in the debt of states that
kept defaulting. Bank failures were much rarer in countries without
these requirements. For example, Canada had *zero* bank failures during
the Great Depression and only created a central bank for the purpose of
facilitating international payments, so that Canadian banks and
businesses didn't need accounts in London.

I am less concerned about this waste than most people seem to
be. People don't complain about the wasted effort of all the runners or
politicians who didn't win the race, and that's basically what it is.
But if we do want to replace Bitcoin's mining function, we need to come
up with something that can be verified in a distributed fashion, is not
likely to suddenly be made trivial by a major breakthrough, and whose
difficulty can be easily adjusted according to some difficulty
algorithm. Primecoin is the best candidate I've seen so far, though
admittedly I haven't been looking that closely at altcoins, because like
I said I don't consider the electricity "wasted" on the mining race to
be a big deal.
A closer analogy might be trading algorithms.

I just remembered, there is in fact prior art, though it's state of the
art, as in "nearly practical." They're called SNARKs: Succinct
Non-interactive ARguments of Knowledge. You can take any computation and
annotate it sufficiently that whoever runs the computation can generate
a (constant size) proof that they did it correctly in (nearly) constant
time. Andrew Miller posted about it on the Tahoe-LAFS mailing list. See
 for one implementation.
I'm not sure if you could use this for a Bitcoin-style problem, though,
since I have no idea if the difficulty can be adjusted smoothly. It's
interesting that we can now take ALL computations problems and turn
them into the "easy to verify" variety, however.

This doesn't particularly concern me, because a) you have to get enough
people (or people with enough money) who are willing to fund murder to
actually fund it, and b) someone has to actually do the act. Making a
liquid market for murder means you can overcome the risk only for high
profile targets with a lot of enemies. That means primarily politicians,
asshole celebrities, CEOs of widely hated companies, etc. And on the
other side, you can also crowdsource defense, as has already been
happening with the various legal defense funds.
I fear the interventions governments are likely to engage in far more

Either way, this is not equivalent to introducing trust into the system

I was proposing using coin days destroyed as part of the "difficulty"
computation, which would mean they actually DO have value, since you cannot
use the same coin days more than once, and they would reduce the number of
CPU cycles you need to burn in order to produce a block. The idea is to
reduce the cost of mining in terms of pure CPU cycles by giving value to
something that currently has no value: coin days. So you actually CAN do
such math still.
This is not a pure proof-of-stake system, though. I am as skeptical of pure
proof of stake as you are.

There are a couple of problems people are trying to solve with
proof-of-stake. The first is that the value of mining will eventually go
down, meaning people will be willing to devote less computing power to it,
reducing the cost of an attack. The second is that, even if it didn't go
down, we don't necessarily want a huge fraction of the world's computing
power devoted to mining. The goal is to take some limited resource that
doesn't depend on a trusted third party and that is difficult to corner and
use that to distribute voting authority. In addition, we'd like the people
doing the voting to have an economic incentive to vote correctly. Bitcoin
does that by paying them to vote and revoking the payment if their block
doesn't end up in the main chain. Proof-of-stake does it by hoping that the
voters care about the integrity of the system, similar to only allowing
landowners to vote, only (hopefully) without the ability to prevent others
from becoming stakeholders, which I think is your main worry about it.
Incidentally, the coin days are from ALL of the transactions in the block,
not just your own. I'm not sure if I was clear about that before. You could
maybe override a transaction that had fewer coin days, but you'd have to
burn a similar amount (though less) of CPU time in addition.
Speaking of which, is there any reason peers couldn't watch for forks and
incorporate any still-valid transactions into new blocks and permanently
blacklist any outputs that get double-spent? You could create a special
"blacklist" transaction that just incorporates the two separate spends into
the main chain, so that everyone could validate that the account holder
attempted to double spend.

Well, in Google's case, the list is curated by those doing the linking, but
Google is trading richness of metadata for coverage.
No, but they cover far more of the Web than a manually curated index ever
could. They can answer questions like "what was that article I read last
week on this topic?" and "what other pictures exist of this person?"
Nobody's going to be writing written summaries of every single news article
and blog post.
I think this is a good idea. Spam can be handled by just signing all the
pages and having signed white and blacklists to create a web of
trust/distrust. Proof-of-work could be used when creating new signing
identities in order to make the blacklists useful.
I imagine something as simple as StumbleUpon, just "I like/dislike this",
perhaps with tags. One could add a signed inverted index as well to
facilitate searching by phrase.

Worst case, can't you just compute pairwise keys for each pair of

it's easy to understand and implement, and most multi-party conversations
don't end up with that many participants anyway.
I think the biggest problem with trying to do anything clever here is that
keeping everyone in sync while simultaneously preventing DoS by one
participant would be pretty difficult. You'd need something like Paxos to
ensure everybody got the messages in the same order, and you'd have to keep
around old keys and messages until everyone acknowledged them, otherwise
participants could easily get "lost."

Given that a V2V system can only warn of an impending collision with
another V2V-equipped vehicle, this seems ludicrous to me. Passive systems
like radar and lidar will be cheap enough to be in nearly every new car
soon enough.
However, even if V2V ends up being mandated, whether it's abusable is very
implementation-dependent, and there are already plenty of ways to track
vehicles: license plate scanners, toll transponder readers, even just plain
old image processing on existing surveillance cameras to track vehicles
probabilistically. Oh, and then there's that cellphone you're probably
carrying with you.
Some of these are easier to avoid than others, and a V2V system could
probably be disabled easily. But we're already being tracked, and I doubt
there's much incentive for a politician to go out on a limb to make it even
easier. If we really want to avoid tracking, it's the efforts to network
and database security cameras and ALPRs that we need to go after. Those are
much harder to avoid, even if you don't own a cellphone and ride a bicycle
or walk everywhere.

It works far less, though, since most people expect others to rely on

Here's a thought: browser extension that stores your "personal" web index,
and gives you a typeahead menu when you write about concepts in your index,
prompting you to convert phrases to links. Like the way Facebook always
wants to convert the names of people and pages to tags. Even if it were

to improve the utility of the AwesomeBar interesting.
An even simpler proposal: assuming the AwesomeBar doesn't already include
live bookmarks in its autocomplete functionality, add it. Then anyone can
simply publish their bookmarks via RSS and anyone else can import them.
Then someone can just add functionality to create live bookmarks that pull
signed and possibly encrypted (with Ed25519/Curve25519 of course) RSS feeds

perhaps with tags. One could add a signed inverted index as well to

Given that a V2V system can only warn of an impending collision with

However, even if V2V ends up being mandated, whether it's abusable is very

vehicles: license plate scanners, toll transponder readers, even just plain
old image processing on existing surveillance cameras to track vehicles
probabilistically. Oh, and then there's that cellphone you're probably

Some of these are easier to avoid than others, and a V2V system could
probably be disabled easily. But we're already being tracked, and I doubt
there's much incentive for a politician to go out on a limb to make it even
easier. If we really want to avoid tracking, it's the efforts to network

Way back in the beginning I said an ever growing block chain would cause

Of course, restraining the block chain to manageable growth without
losing other good characteristics is inherently hard, and it was a lot
easier for me to point at the problem than to fix it.
 I had been hoping that we would see more stuff happening off-blockchain by
now, with Bitcoin acting more as a clearing house between smaller payment
providers, but all the regulations protecting the big banks from
competition make it really hard to do anything off-blockchain that looks
even remotely like a payments service. Side chains of some kind seem like a
reasonable approach, and I'm guessing that it will be the difficulty of
dealing with the "central" block chain that will finally force people "over
the hump" into using some kind of sidechain payments system. I really want
to see micropayments, for example, and those seem to be too unwieldy and
expensive to do the main chain.

Transparency is also useful, and privacy can be built on top of it through
the use of, say, Chaumian e-cash backed by a blockchain-based

that it has a certain amount of Bitcoin than a certain amount of gold.
E-gold and even one of the gold ETFs have been accused of double-counting.
And if you're using Tor to connect to the network and break up your

ZeroCoin just fixes the whole problem.

Really? What rich person has gotten richer through Bitcoin so far?
Remittances seem like the biggest use of Bitcoin at the moment. Sure,
there's plenty of speculation, but your claim that Bitcoin's purpose is to
make the rich richer is also speculation. And FUD.
I can't imagine you've read a single thing written by the people who
influenced the creation of Bitcoin if you think that the collapse of fiat
currencies is an unintended consequence. Any fiat currency that is so bad
that its users prefer to use Bitcoin deserves to collapse. Of course, so
far, while Bitcoin has become popular in places like Argentina and
Venezuela, the US dollar remains by far the more popular alternative
currency in those places. And if Greece exits the Euro and starts printing
Drachmas there, they will have to worry about people trading their Drachmas
for Euros, not for Bitcoin.
 By what evidence do you estimate that this is a "likely" scenario? You may
be right that many nation-states and banks will be loathe to accept an
untraceable and uncontrollable crypto-currency, but that's the whole point;
they're not going to have a choice. Cryptocurrencies don't have to be legal
to be disruptive. The main problem that they've run up against before now
is the lack of healthy underground markets to take advantage of them. Given
time, governments' and banks' opinions and policies about cryptocurrencies
will become irrelevant.

This is not what most people mean when they say "rich get richer." They're
talking about 1%ers or whatever. In any case, you still seem to be making
unfounded claims about the intent behind Bitcoin, when we have statements
of intent in the creator's own words. Many believe Satoshi is also rich,
Bitcoin-wise, but we don't even know for sure that they have the key to the
account or that they will ever spend that Bitcoin. Personally, I hope they
do. The creator of Bitcoin deserves to be rewarded.
No real way of knowing. I only have anecdotal evidence.
Probably a lot. But that's true of cash as well.
My apologies. I was confused by your use of the phrase "government cash."
Government cash is fiat, but not all fiat is cash. But the cashless
societies already being proposed and implemented are fully centralized and
much easier to trace than Bitcoin, because they require bank accounts with
their concomitant "know your customer" regulations. Bitcoin doesn't make
this situation worse, and by enabling other applications on top of it,
including untraceable e-cash, will only make it better.
Can you elaborate? Does your use of quotes around the word "popular"
indicate sarcasm? My understanding was that a number of merchants had
started using a payment system that used dollars from foreign credit cards
to buy Bitcoin so that they did not have to accept the government-imposed
exchange rate. I'm definitely interested in your insights on this, since
I've never visited a country that was experiencing rampant inflation,
unless you count the US in the late '70s, about the time I was entering
grade school.
I think you overestimate the government's ability to exert control,
something many of the participants in this list have devoted their lives to
reducing. It's the whole point of Bitcoin, so it seems like you're
basically just saying "Bitcoin will fail at its mission and instead just
get coopted by the powers that be." Or maybe you think that Bitcoin is just
a reckless toy created by greedy first worlders?
It depends on what you mean by "exist." The people on this list have
created several. It seems like a major reason that none of them has taken
off has been the need for trusted third parties, something that can be
reduced or eliminated through the use of the blockchain, if not Bitcoin
itself. Bitcoin could, for example, be used as a clearing currency between
various Chaumian e-cash issuers, the same way gold used to be used as the
international clearing currency until Bretton Woods.
Indeed, something I have repeatedly ranted against. So far the regulation
has not had much impact on Bitcoin itself. No legally "tainted" or
"whitelisted" coins yet.
I'm not even sure what form outlawing Bitcoin would take in the US. I
suppose they could try to define mining or even running a full client as
operating a payment service. But that would take some backtracking after
all the regulatory efforts. Which may be a reason I should not be ranting
against regulation; it hamstring's government's ability to completely
outlaw it later.
Perhaps, but that actually seems to be the crux of what we're arguing about
here, and of many arguments on this list. What are the actual capabilities
of the adversary? You don't want to underestimate, but at the same time, if
you overestimate, you may miss a potential solution. Some are probably
living as hermits because they think they're being monitored and/or given
cancer by the smart meter mesh network. Personally, I tend to doubt that
the government's capabilities significantly exceed what's available to the
general public, except in terms of the money they're able to bring to bear,
which is blunted somewhat by the extreme inefficiency of government
A "litmus test" issue might be whether you think the NSA's expressed
surprise over Snowden's leaks was genuine. I tend to think it was, and that
his documents are genuine. I see no reason for the NSA to be substantially
more competent than, say, the OPM. They're each large organizations with no
bottom line that attract people of flexible moral character who are
attracted to power and/or job security. I don't think those traits tend to
lead to effective organizations, as much as a number of Hollywood movies
would like us to believe.
A kind of fun book on the OTHER side of the spectrum from what I believe
about government's capabilities is Daniel Suarez's book Influx, about a
government agency tasked with keeping technologies out of the hands of the
public. I think you'd need a pretty substantial head start before
technological advantages can overcome organizational and general human
disadvantages, though. I.e. leaks, infiltration, etc.

If you're willing to sacrifice some performance and power efficiency, you
can always use an FPGA. The tools aren't open, but it seems like it would
be a lot harder to make an FPGA or FPGA tools to backdoor arbitrary
circuits. You could potentially do the "reflections on trusting trust"
thing and detect and backdoor each of the major open source processor
cores, but it seems pretty unlikely that such a thing wouldn't leak.
On the other hand, I also seriously doubt Intel CPUs are backdoored, so
maybe my paranoia isn't properly calibrated. Even if you generally trust
Intel, though, FPGAs could still potentially protect you from all the
investment the NSA has undoubtedly put into finding bugs and side channels
in the widely used CPUs, though. And being much simpler, something like
OpenRisc or J1 or SPARC v8 probably has far fewer places for such
flaws/side channels to hide.
On the gripping hand, none of those processors gives you an equivalent of
Intel's TXT mode, and I'm not sure but it's probably much easier to dump
internal state from an FPGA, so you could be more vulnerable to cold boot
and evil maid attacks.

Really? What rich person has gotten richer through Bitcoin so far?
Remittances seem like the biggest use of Bitcoin at the moment. Sure,
there's plenty of speculation, but your claim that Bitcoin's purpose is to
make the rich richer is also speculation. And FUD.
I can't imagine you've read a single thing written by the people who
influenced the creation of Bitcoin if you think that the collapse of fiat
currencies is an unintended consequence. Any fiat currency that is so bad
that its users prefer to use Bitcoin deserves to collapse. Of course, so
far, while Bitcoin has become popular in places like Argentina and
Venezuela, the US dollar remains by far the more popular alternative
currency in those places. And if Greece exits the Euro and starts printing
Drachmas there, they will have to worry about people trading their Drachmas
for Euros, not for Bitcoin.
 By what evidence do you estimate that this is a "likely" scenario? You may
be right that many nation-states and banks will be loathe to accept an
untraceable and uncontrollable crypto-currency, but that's the whole point;
they're not going to have a choice. Cryptocurrencies don't have to be legal
to be disruptive. The main problem that they've run up against before now
is the lack of healthy underground markets to take advantage of them. Given
time, governments' and banks' opinions and policies about cryptocurrencies
will become irrelevant.

This is not what most people mean when they say "rich get richer." They're
talking about 1%ers or whatever. In any case, you still seem to be making
unfounded claims about the intent behind Bitcoin, when we have statements
of intent in the creator's own words. Many believe Satoshi is also rich,
Bitcoin-wise, but we don't even know for sure that they have the key to the
account or that they will ever spend that Bitcoin. Personally, I hope they
do. The creator of Bitcoin deserves to be rewarded.
No real way of knowing. I only have anecdotal evidence.
Probably a lot. But that's true of cash as well.
My apologies. I was confused by your use of the phrase "government cash."
Government cash is fiat, but not all fiat is cash. But the cashless
societies already being proposed and implemented are fully centralized and
much easier to trace than Bitcoin, because they require bank accounts with
their concomitant "know your customer" regulations. Bitcoin doesn't make
this situation worse, and by enabling other applications on top of it,
including untraceable e-cash, will only make it better.
Can you elaborate? Does your use of quotes around the word "popular"
indicate sarcasm? My understanding was that a number of merchants had
started using a payment system that used dollars from foreign credit cards
to buy Bitcoin so that they did not have to accept the government-imposed
exchange rate. I'm definitely interested in your insights on this, since
I've never visited a country that was experiencing rampant inflation,
unless you count the US in the late '70s, about the time I was entering
grade school.
I think you overestimate the government's ability to exert control,
something many of the participants in this list have devoted their lives to
reducing. It's the whole point of Bitcoin, so it seems like you're
basically just saying "Bitcoin will fail at its mission and instead just
get coopted by the powers that be." Or maybe you think that Bitcoin is just
a reckless toy created by greedy first worlders?
It depends on what you mean by "exist." The people on this list have
created several. It seems like a major reason that none of them has taken
off has been the need for trusted third parties, something that can be
reduced or eliminated through the use of the blockchain, if not Bitcoin
itself. Bitcoin could, for example, be used as a clearing currency between
various Chaumian e-cash issuers, the same way gold used to be used as the
international clearing currency until Bretton Woods.
Indeed, something I have repeatedly ranted against. So far the regulation
has not had much impact on Bitcoin itself. No legally "tainted" or
"whitelisted" coins yet.
I'm not even sure what form outlawing Bitcoin would take in the US. I
suppose they could try to define mining or even running a full client as
operating a payment service. But that would take some backtracking after
all the regulatory efforts. Which may be a reason I should not be ranting
against regulation; it hamstring's government's ability to completely
outlaw it later.
Perhaps, but that actually seems to be the crux of what we're arguing about
here, and of many arguments on this list. What are the actual capabilities
of the adversary? You don't want to underestimate, but at the same time, if
you overestimate, you may miss a potential solution. Some are probably
living as hermits because they think they're being monitored and/or given
cancer by the smart meter mesh network. Personally, I tend to doubt that
the government's capabilities significantly exceed what's available to the
general public, except in terms of the money they're able to bring to bear,
which is blunted somewhat by the extreme inefficiency of government
A "litmus test" issue might be whether you think the NSA's expressed
surprise over Snowden's leaks was genuine. I tend to think it was, and that
his documents are genuine. I see no reason for the NSA to be substantially
more competent than, say, the OPM. They're each large organizations with no
bottom line that attract people of flexible moral character who are
attracted to power and/or job security. I don't think those traits tend to
lead to effective organizations, as much as a number of Hollywood movies
would like us to believe.
A kind of fun book on the OTHER side of the spectrum from what I believe
about government's capabilities is Daniel Suarez's book Influx, about a
government agency tasked with keeping technologies out of the hands of the
public. I think you'd need a pretty substantial head start before
technological advantages can overcome organizational and general human
disadvantages, though. I.e. leaks, infiltration, etc.

If you're willing to sacrifice some performance and power efficiency, you
can always use an FPGA. The tools aren't open, but it seems like it would
be a lot harder to make an FPGA or FPGA tools to backdoor arbitrary
circuits. You could potentially do the "reflections on trusting trust"
thing and detect and backdoor each of the major open source processor
cores, but it seems pretty unlikely that such a thing wouldn't leak.
On the other hand, I also seriously doubt Intel CPUs are backdoored, so
maybe my paranoia isn't properly calibrated. Even if you generally trust
Intel, though, FPGAs could still potentially protect you from all the
investment the NSA has undoubtedly put into finding bugs and side channels
in the widely used CPUs, though. And being much simpler, something like
OpenRisc or J1 or SPARC v8 probably has far fewer places for such
flaws/side channels to hide.
On the gripping hand, none of those processors gives you an equivalent of

Way back in the beginning I said an ever growing block chain would cause
unacceptable costs and inconvenience, and lo and behold, it is causing
substantial and ever growing costs and inconvenience.
Of course, restraining the block chain to manageable growth without
losing other good characteristics is inherently hard, and it was a lot
easier for me to point at the problem than to fix it.
 I had been hoping that we would see more stuff happening off-blockchain by
now, with Bitcoin acting more as a clearing house between smaller payment
providers, but all the regulations protecting the big banks from
competition make it really hard to do anything off-blockchain that looks
even remotely like a payments service. Side chains of some kind seem like a
reasonable approach, and I'm guessing that it will be the difficulty of
dealing with the "central" block chain that will finally force people "over
the hump" into using some kind of sidechain payments system. I really want
to see micropayments, for example, and those seem to be too unwieldy and
expensive to do the main chain.

Lots of words, very few details. Fonts getting a "bit pixellated"? Are you
kidding me? Packages "piggybacking on other packages"? This is all very
imprecise language for someone who is attempting to convince us that
something very grave is going on. And as usual, not a single hex dump of a
single packet. Not of any of the packets supposedly spewing out of their
supposedly disabled Ethernet port, not out of their supposedly disabled
wifi card, not of one of these supposedly piggybacked packages.
I can imagine why the writing of someone who was up against something like
this might sound like the ravings of a lunatic. That's why I read the whole
thing. But as I read, I kept wondering where the "there" was. But this
feels far more like the sudden significance everything takes on when you
take a hit of acid or are about to have a temporal lobe seizure than a
genuine realization.
 I'm not saying these capabilities don't exist; I'm sure they do. I'm not
even saying the author is lying or stupid. But most of us who are attracted
to security research are a bit "on the edge" to begin with, and it seems
like Snowden's revelations and the like have created all-powerful bogeymen
in some of our minds and pushed us over the edge. We have people making
claims like the NSA can break any encryption, that computers are
communicating by sound (yes, BadBIOS is another of these), and that they've
been "painted" by a network with all sorts of vague capabilities.
I've been reading these stories with an open mind. Maybe some people in
this field just talk that way. Maybe they're vague because they want to
keep their research proprietary. But if that were the case, why not say so?
Why not say what work you have yet to do and give an approximate date for a
full announcement?
Even assuming some of these claims are true, not asking for more evidence
robs us of the ability to defend ourselves. Running off to build f2f
networks is fun and all, but it's not going to do a lick of good if we have
no idea what we're up against beyond some vague descriptions, especially
when you consider that the capabilities of our adversaries go well beyond
the technological. There is such a thing as technological security that's
"too good", when you've spent all your time defending against technological
attacks only to succomb to, as others on this thread have pointed out, a
rubber hose.
I love that this group is open minded. I love that anyone can make a claim
and it will get seriously considered by many without requiring special
credentials. But I also feel like a lot of people here are very easily
ratholed by extraordinary claims that lack not just extraordinary evidence,
but any evidence whatsoever other than someone we may or may not know well

It seems to me the real problem would be the community making a big deal
about the fork, not the fork itself. Maybe the fork will take off, in which
case anyone who has a position in Bitcoin now will have a position in the
forked currency, or it won't, in which case who cares? Sure, Bitcoin might
be less valuable for a while while people wait and see how the fork does,
but anyone who thinks a hard fork is a large risk to Bitcoin compared to
all the other risks it faces is deluding themselves.
I think we would all be better off if the community said, "Fine, fork if
you want. May the best fork win," than to sing doom and gloom every time
someone decides not to follow the community process. Besides, a bunch of
different people being involved does not a decentralized system make. Not
if they all have to follow the same process and forks without consensus are
not allowed. That can actually be worse in many ways than a benevolent
dictatorship, because it will quickly ossify as the community grows larger
and more diverse.
If Bitcoin itself had to get community consensus before it was tried, we'd
have no Bitcoin. I have no problem at all with someone deciding to fork it.
In fact, I *prefer* it, because I think in the long run it makes my own
position *more* valuable to have different forks trying different things.
Anyone who holds Bitcoin before the fork gets the sum of the values of
their account on each fork. Over the long run, the value on most forks will
go to zero, but then it's at worst a max function.
Claiming that forks make Bitcoin less valuable sounds to me a lot like
Bernie Sanders saying we don't need so many choices of deodorant.

It seems to me that people are terrified by a hard fork because they have a
huge stake in Bitcoin. To me that's the best argument there could possibly
be to fork now and get it out of the way. Bitcoin can't survive if it
ossifies due to the fears of morons who can't be bothered to diversify
their investment, and who have such low morals that they'd stoop to making
death threats.
If we're going to argue based on the merits then let's do that, and leave

beyond Bitcoin to the future of cryptocurrencies on general, and a healthy
cryptocurrencies ecosystem cannot survive as an ossified monoculture.

By the way, "consensus" is a red herring thrown out by those who never want
there to be a fork. There can never be consensus for a fork, because
otherwise it wouldn't be a fork. Claiming there needs to be consensus is
just a way to try to make it look like any fork is somehow unilateral and
undemocratic. But to succeed, any fork by definition needs broad support.
In fact, it's about the most democratic you can get: people put their money
and their mining power on the fork they want. It's those opposing any fork
who are the authoritarians. Obviously, when you consider who's making the

Which means that those with a stake in Bitcoin are better off if a fork
becomes popular than if an altcoin does, because if a fork becomes popular
they will already have a stake in the fork, whereas if the altcoin becomes
popular at the expense of Bitcoin they will have nothing. Of course, if a
fork undermines faith in Bitcoin without becoming popular, everyone will be
screwed. But I don't think this is likely; either it will become popular
and we'll all be better off, or it will flop and nobody will care.
The worst case scenario is that some fatal flaw eventually emerges in
Bitcoin, one that would not have affected a proposed fork or altcoin but
that instead wipes out Bitcoin holders and undermines faith in all

Yes. And a failure to accept responsibility for one's own decisions. Anyone
gambling everything on Bitcoin right now is an idiot, in my view. Their
opinions should be discounted as they have proven their own judgement
lacking. Perhaps they will be vindicated, but the fact that you happen to
win a poker hand you played badly doesn't retroactively mean you played the
hand well. It means you got lucky.

i don't care how you describe that messing, consensus or not, it's
poking in sensitive places all the same...
 A fact that makes Satoshi's decision to remain anonymous seem even wiser

I'm not proposing anyone gambling anything. The gambling is being done by
those holding Bitcoin. Holding Bitcoin places no obligation on anyone else.
It's not a stock or bond or other instrument with an associated contract.
you can see why many are so reluctant - the due diligence is lacking
and the demeanor more experiment than careful transition...
I doubt there is anything the larger stakeholders (as fraction of their net
worth) would accept as due diligence. Nor is any required to start a fork.
Any due diligence is the responsibility of those choosing to operate on the
fork. Those involved should do it to maintain their reputations, but if
they don't, and people get burned, their reputations will suffer. Death

this is not about poor user decisions,
 this is about violation of the contract "a bitcoin is forever (and in
the blockchain)"
With a hard fork, the Bitcoins exist in both forks. If one dies, they live
on in the remaining one. If Bitcoin itself is never forked and dies, the
contract is violated. But I have to ask, contract with whom? This is part
of the specification of the protocol, but people are only bound by it
insofar as they choose to implement the protocol. And probably as far as
they choose to participate in the network. But a fork need not require any
interaction with the original network aside from fetching the block chain
prior to the block it forks from.
 you see expediency, and no excuses for those lacking judgment.

Nobody can deprecate old coins unilaterally. It's up to each individual to
decide what they're worth and whether to participate. As I said, as I
understand your use of the term "consensus", a hard fork is by definition
non-consensus, because if there were consensus everyone would just switch
to the new protocol. Sure, people could consent to allow others to work on
another protocol, but there will always be plenty of people who only want
there to be one chain, so consensus of that form is impossible.
sure; these are very different from a "non-consensus hard-fork"
 [deprecate old, force to new]
intentionally trying to divert and betray the contract inherent since
the start - a bitcoin is forever - is more than "just a fork", it's
also a stab in the back.
I am sympathetic to the view that "law" = people's reasonable expectations,
but whether those expectations are reasonable is really what we're
discussing here. I think Bitcoin is both too immature and too decentralized
to be able to say yes. Maturity will eventually trump decentralization for
this purpose.
 i don't know how to solve a transition like this, but i know a forced
hard fork is near the worst way to handle it.
I think "forced" is too strong a word here. Against whom is force being
used? Who is having to do something against their will? Or who was
defrauded and by whom? From a consent standpoint, this is no different than
forking any other open source project.

Lots of words, very few details. Fonts getting a "bit pixellated"? Are you
kidding me? Packages "piggybacking on other packages"? This is all very
imprecise language for someone who is attempting to convince us that
something very grave is going on. And as usual, not a single hex dump of a
single packet. Not of any of the packets supposedly spewing out of their
supposedly disabled Ethernet port, not out of their supposedly disabled
wifi card, not of one of these supposedly piggybacked packages.
I can imagine why the writing of someone who was up against something like
this might sound like the ravings of a lunatic. That's why I read the whole
thing. But as I read, I kept wondering where the "there" was. But this
feels far more like the sudden significance everything takes on when you
take a hit of acid or are about to have a temporal lobe seizure than a
genuine realization.
 I'm not saying these capabilities don't exist; I'm sure they do. I'm not
even saying the author is lying or stupid. But most of us who are attracted
to security research are a bit "on the edge" to begin with, and it seems
like Snowden's revelations and the like have created all-powerful bogeymen
in some of our minds and pushed us over the edge. We have people making
claims like the NSA can break any encryption, that computers are
communicating by sound (yes, BadBIOS is another of these), and that they've
been "painted" by a network with all sorts of vague capabilities.
I've been reading these stories with an open mind. Maybe some people in
this field just talk that way. Maybe they're vague because they want to
keep their research proprietary. But if that were the case, why not say so?
Why not say what work you have yet to do and give an approximate date for a
full announcement?
Even assuming some of these claims are true, not asking for more evidence
robs us of the ability to defend ourselves. Running off to build f2f
networks is fun and all, but it's not going to do a lick of good if we have
no idea what we're up against beyond some vague descriptions, especially
when you consider that the capabilities of our adversaries go well beyond
the technological. There is such a thing as technological security that's
"too good", when you've spent all your time defending against technological
attacks only to succomb to, as others on this thread have pointed out, a
rubber hose.
I love that this group is open minded. I love that anyone can make a claim
and it will get seriously considered by many without requiring special
credentials. But I also feel like a lot of people here are very easily
ratholed by extraordinary claims that lack not just extraordinary evidence,
but any evidence whatsoever other than someone we may or may not know well
saying it's so.

It seems to me the real problem would be the community making a big deal
about the fork, not the fork itself. Maybe the fork will take off, in which
case anyone who has a position in Bitcoin now will have a position in the
forked currency, or it won't, in which case who cares? Sure, Bitcoin might
be less valuable for a while while people wait and see how the fork does,
but anyone who thinks a hard fork is a large risk to Bitcoin compared to
all the other risks it faces is deluding themselves.
I think we would all be better off if the community said, "Fine, fork if
you want. May the best fork win," than to sing doom and gloom every time
someone decides not to follow the community process. Besides, a bunch of
different people being involved does not a decentralized system make. Not
if they all have to follow the same process and forks without consensus are
not allowed. That can actually be worse in many ways than a benevolent
dictatorship, because it will quickly ossify as the community grows larger
and more diverse.
If Bitcoin itself had to get community consensus before it was tried, we'd
have no Bitcoin. I have no problem at all with someone deciding to fork it.
In fact, I *prefer* it, because I think in the long run it makes my own
position *more* valuable to have different forks trying different things.
Anyone who holds Bitcoin before the fork gets the sum of the values of
their account on each fork. Over the long run, the value on most forks will
go to zero, but then it's at worst a max function.
Claiming that forks make Bitcoin less valuable sounds to me a lot like
Bernie Sanders saying we don't need so many choices of deodorant.

It seems to me that people are terrified by a hard fork because they have a
huge stake in Bitcoin. To me that's the best argument there could possibly
be to fork now and get it out of the way. Bitcoin can't survive if it
ossifies due to the fears of morons who can't be bothered to diversify
their investment, and who have such low morals that they'd stoop to making
death threats.
If we're going to argue based on the merits then let's do that, and leave
the death threats and doom and gloom out of it. We need to be thinking
beyond Bitcoin to the future of cryptocurrencies on general, and a healthy
cryptocurrencies ecosystem cannot survive as an ossified monoculture.

By the way, "consensus" is a red herring thrown out by those who never want
there to be a fork. There can never be consensus for a fork, because
otherwise it wouldn't be a fork. Claiming there needs to be consensus is
just a way to try to make it look like any fork is somehow unilateral and
undemocratic. But to succeed, any fork by definition needs broad support.
In fact, it's about the most democratic you can get: people put their money
and their mining power on the fork they want. It's those opposing any fork
who are the authoritarians. Obviously, when you consider who's making the
death threats.

Which means that those with a stake in Bitcoin are better off if a fork
becomes popular than if an altcoin does, because if a fork becomes popular
they will already have a stake in the fork, whereas if the altcoin becomes
popular at the expense of Bitcoin they will have nothing. Of course, if a
fork undermines faith in Bitcoin without becoming popular, everyone will be
screwed. But I don't think this is likely; either it will become popular
and we'll all be better off, or it will flop and nobody will care.
The worst case scenario is that some fatal flaw eventually emerges in
Bitcoin, one that would not have affected a proposed fork or altcoin but
that instead wipes out Bitcoin holders and undermines faith in all

Yes. And a failure to accept responsibility for one's own decisions. Anyone
gambling everything on Bitcoin right now is an idiot, in my view. Their
opinions should be discounted as they have proven their own judgement
lacking. Perhaps they will be vindicated, but the fact that you happen to
win a poker hand you played badly doesn't retroactively mean you played the
hand well. It means you got lucky.
and by no means am i threating anyone with harm!  i am explaining that
when someone puts  the last half decade of their life and fortune into
a thing, messing with it will always generate inflamed arguments.
regardless of if you're ultimately right or not.
Never said you were the one making threats, and I agree this sort of thing
will create inflamed passions. All the more reason to try to filter out the
opinions of  those with a large stake.
i don't care how you describe that messing, consensus or not, it's
poking in sensitive places all the same...
 A fact that makes Satoshi's decision to remain anonymous seem even wiser
in retrospect. Perhaps this will be required of any such system in the
"not likely" - you're going to gamble livelihoods on a hunch that it's

I'm not proposing anyone gambling anything. The gambling is being done by
those holding Bitcoin. Holding Bitcoin places no obligation on anyone else.
It's not a stock or bond or other instrument with an associated contract.
you can see why many are so reluctant - the due diligence is lacking
and the demeanor more experiment than careful transition...
I doubt there is anything the larger stakeholders (as fraction of their net
worth) would accept as due diligence. Nor is any required to start a fork.
Any due diligence is the responsibility of those choosing to operate on the
fork. Those involved should do it to maintain their reputations, but if

this is not about poor user decisions,
 this is about violation of the contract "a bitcoin is forever (and in

With a hard fork, the Bitcoins exist in both forks. If one dies, they live
on in the remaining one. If Bitcoin itself is never forked and dies, the
contract is violated. But I have to ask, contract with whom? This is part
of the specification of the protocol, but people are only bound by it
insofar as they choose to implement the protocol. And probably as far as
they choose to participate in the network. But a fork need not require any
interaction with the original network aside from fetching the block chain

that all the other human beings are also using up resources, so if we did
not coordinate our use of resources (via the market) we would exhaust them
and perish.

Even without a government, I think an anarchic society will still need
institutions to function, even if those institutions are entirely
voluntary. I can imagine sets of institutions that would allow corporations
in a similar sense to how they exist now, i.e. limited liability and some
form of "personhood." The most likely such institution would be some kind
of court system where, in order to have access to the court as a means of
seeking restitution, you must agree not to go outside it to go after any
other participant, and must not have done so before.
This is a question I think about all the time.
I see revolutions as a symptom of a broken society. Reform, or evolution,
is certainly preferable.
The French and English revolutions both resulted, after a while, in better
societies than they started in, as far as I can tell. The Haitian
revolution ended slavery there. I don't consider the American revolution,
on the other hand, to be a counter example, though it clearly inspired the
French revolution. Not to say that the French revolution and other reforms
of European monarchies wouldn't have happened anyway.
Same here.
While I think agorism's approach ("grow the counter-economy and the state
will eventually whither away") is provably ineffective, I do think it has a
lot to teach us here. Its main problem is that government is always "just
good enough" that people will continue to resort to it, and people are
forced to pay for it whether or not they make use of it, and they may not
opt out of its jurisdiction. One must not only create alternatives to
government services, they must be alternatives people actually use.
One of the pieces of evidence used against Ross Ulbricht was a post of his
in which he stated, "I am creating an economic simulation to give people a
first-hand experience of what it would be like to live in a world without
the systemic use of force." Whether or not Silk Road was that "simulation",
the general statement is exactly what we need to do, in my opinion. Create
systems of "law" and "governance" that do not require the use of force.
These systems do not have to be all-encompassing; they can be small and
narrow in scope. They just have to make it so people don't feel like they
have to resort to government (i.e. force) to achieve their ends.
Just like they do with the "wild west", I think people drastically
underestimate the amount of spontaneous order in black markets. Hollywood
certainly feeds of it with post-apocalyptic movies & TV shows that depict
everything going straight to "anarchy" the moment there's a hiccup in
government. But history demonstrates that in fact the exact opposite is
true. The only time things descend into "anarchy" when the government falls
is when the collapse of the government was caused by violence in the first
place, or where the government's failure had left society "hollowed out."
Somalia is probably the best known example of this happening. I think
Russia after the collapse of the USSR is probably a more typical example of
what I believe to be the common case.
Security of property and computer systems is an area that's pretty ripe for
non-government solutions. I doubt most readers of this list assume that
they can just rely on police to prevent their car from getting stolen or
house from getting broken into, or think the police will come along and
investigate after the fact, then catch the thief and get their stuff back.
No, we all have insurance, locks, good passwords with two-factor and/or
public key authentication, probably cameras, safes, crypto, etc. A lot of
that is pretty hard to use, though, so maybe we should be focusing on
making the solutions we use available to the masses.
Thanks for this post, by the way. One of my favorites on cpunks to date.

Agreed. I'm just saying that such an arrangement is not inconceivable in an
anarchic/voluntary society. And without the state to force it on everyone,
assuming no single "court" system comes to dominate and abuse its monopoly
position, I doubt it could be nearly as harmful. And even if some court
does become a monopoly, since opting out of even a monopoly voluntary court
system is far easier than opting out of a state.
Agreed. Though even under the status quo there are situations where
corporations lose their limited liability, such as in certain criminal
scenarios. Limited liability can only apply in a voluntary society where a
transaction has taken place. Third parties can always sue in some court
that does not recognize the limited liability, and it may well be that even
within the same court system, they decided to drastically limit the scope
of limited liability, for example only to situations where a transaction
has taken place. Not sure what that would mean to, say, product liability
where a third party is injured, though. But unlimited product liability
could result in a far smaller number of products. Who'd make a car, for
example? Or an airliner? Sure, the airline could require passengers to
agree not to sue, but they can't do that for people on the ground. Under
the status quo there's blanket indemnification for airlines and aircraft
manufacturers. That is probably not the best solution, but I also don't
know what is or how one would implement it in a purely voluntary society.
Intuitively I think (hope) it must be possible, but I am by no means
Or maybe unlimited liability is just no big deal and limited liability has
always just been a way for some people to gain advantage over others.
Perhaps without a system like the US's that encourages frivolous lawsuits,
there would be no need.
I think by the time revolution happens, people HAVE done these things, and
the government's response has been to crack down rather than reforming.
Exactly what is happening in the US right now with police brutality.
Perhaps if more people got involved, the government could have been
convinced to reform rather than cracking down further, but it is a central
tenet of governing that you need to have a reasonably large and productive
class that is happy with its modicum of control, i.e. the "middle" class.
Keep them happy and protected from the lower class, and you can keep
society under control.
I suppose it depends on how you're counting. Reform happens all the time.
Not often reforms the size of what you get from revolutions, but I'd say
far more positive change happens through gradual reform than directly from
revolution. But perhaps I'm setting the bar too low by qualifying it with
"If only enough people would resist". But keeping people from resisting en
masse is government's specialty. This is classic prisoners' dilemma. As
Mike explains in The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, sometimes you have to make
things worse before they get better. I.e. convince people to revolt by
making it so they are no longer comfortable.
I think Uruguay is actually on the forefront of drug legalization. Colorado
is ahead of Amsterdam, even, because drugs have never really been legal
there. Buying and using is legal, but a bunch of other necessary parts like
growing & transporting are not. The authorities just look the other way,
but can change their minds at any time and have cracked down in the past.
Indeed, and even if/when it succeeds, Google will just become another
vertically-integrated telecomms giant.
Research can never prove something is secure, only that it's insecure. Low
latency onion routing is about as crappy as you can get when it comes to
anonymity, just a step above a chain of proxies. I see no reason a high
latency mix net couldn't be made sufficiently secure with, say, operators
in mutually antagonistic countries.
Maybe. Definitely if you assume that government will eventually outlaw all
anonymous use of the Internet. Of course, then they could always phrase the
legislation in such a way that an N2N mesh network is also covered. Are you

I haven't yet been able to convince myself that "large and dominant
syndicates" are even necessary. Do we really need large scale coordination
separated into different cliques like that, or is it possible to have a
single large network (in the abstract sense) of distributed transactions?
If transaction costs get close enough to zero, the optimal firm size goes
to one. So the question becomes how much we can reduce transaction costs.
This feels right to me. Which is to say I think it's right but don't know
enough to make a good argument for it.
I don't know if I understand the point well enough to debate it, but I'm
interested to know what your definition of "public" is. Does such a thing
exist with respect to government? Aren't they really government roads?
Please forgive me if that's the exact kind of discussion you want to go
onto another thread.
Yes. Which will be the trigger for the next financial crisis or the one
after (since I think real estate is still fucked).
Or just lobby the government to require the use of your products.
Obvious to me, perhaps not some others.
I've been slowly slogging my way through Robert K. Massie's _Dreadnought_,
and it struck me how openly the government of the British Empire considered
themselves primarily protectors of the commercial interests of British
companies. I suspect future historians will think us terribly naive to
think that capitalism and mercantilism are different things. Capitalism,
for the most part, seems to be just mercantilism with less transparency and
the more competition for the government's favor. "Competition" being
competition to see who can give the most political donations to the right
people, etc.
I think most of the time it's not even fear of being shot,  though. It's
fear of losing privileges. Anyone can be blackballed in any industry at any
time. Just associate them with kiddie porn or name them as a "person of
interest" in some investigation.
I think it's both, really. You qualify it with "political" here, and I
think that's right. Unfortunately it's a pretty "charged" term, though, so
it will only convey your meaning in particular circles.
I haven't yet been able to figure out how much of a collectivist or
individualist you are, but "democracy" strikes me as a fairly collectivist
term. It's rule by the people over all the other people. I prefer rule of
oneself by oneself. To the extent possible, at least.
Perhaps "opt-in direct democracy" would be a better way to define
I'm a fan of "polycentric order" or "polycentric law" myself. Though that
may assume certain factors that you don't think are warranted.
How about families or even just individuals?
The temptation to design is a very hard one to avoid. It took me a long
time to break myself of it. In fact, it was an individualist anarchist who
finally broke me of the habit.
Despite probably being the "wrong" kind of anarchist according to many
here, Hans-Hermann Hoppe does a pretty good job of obliterating the notion
that voluntary societies cannot defend themselves from traditional
nation-states in _The Myth of National Defense_.
In any case, though, Zen (and I) expect such a society to evolve alongside
and among traditional nation-states, so it has to be able to protect itself
or it could not exist in the first place. So there's no need to "site" the
society anywhere.
If we do get access to our own planet, though, it might help things along a
bit. Of course, then you run into the problem that all
intentional/constructed communities run into, which is that they have an
extremely low probability of success. This is one of the reasons I've
mostly gotten over the idea of seasteading as the answer to our problems.
Of course, while an *individual* seastead might have very low probability
of success, tens of thousands might produce a couple of interesting ideas.
 ...
And a "transition" or "emergency" government that's really just a
dictatorship and lasts a very long time.
And often this is "literally" true - the old servants become the masters
and the masters become worm food. And then the old servants are just as
brutal of masters, if not moreso, than their old masters. Especially if the
new masters really did comes from the lowest echelons of society where they
have no experience at all with leadership. At least internal coups don't
tend to have this problem quite so badly. But they also don't tend to
change much.
Personally, I don't plan to go to war at all, ever, if I can avoid it. And
by "avoiding" I mean "can physically escape with my loved ones," not "I've
tried everything else to effect change and now must take up arms." I care
enough about my home to kill an individual or small band who try to invade
it, and even to band together with my neighborhood to do so, but not to go
to war. I'm not sure I could tell you what the crossover would be in terms
of level of organization, but I'd guess it's at the level where we need to
resort to any kind of abstraction.
They are not on the bottom, though. They are the bourgeoisie. They
typically form alliances with those on the bottom by promising to make
their situation better, though never better than their own. Go with us to
war and we'll share the spoils (unequally) with you.
Historically, it's been very hard for small syndicates to grow into large
ones without winning favor from the existing players. Today we have Ubers
that can grow without having a revolution. It used to be much harder.
I don't consider this a likely contingency. The trend has been toward LESS
violence, and there is no particular reason to believe that there's a
simple inverse relationship between income and fertility rate. Doesn't mean
I am not hedging against such a possibility, but I'm certainly not betting
on it, just making it more likely my family and I could survive it if it
The economies of developed countries are too intertwined for USD to "go
down hard" without taking a lot of other economies with it. What do you
think will happen to the Chinese economy if, for example, the US suddenly
stops buying their products? They'd have a bunch of saved dollars to spend,
and the best way to spend them would be on American goods. More likely it
would be gradual and we'd see a shift in the US back toward manufacturing.
The US government actually *wants* the dollar to decline in value. It makes
US products more competitive both domestically and abroad. It causes
inflation and thus reduces real incomes and debt. It would put a bunch of
people back to work. Sure, skyrocketing oil prices would hurt the US
economy, but look how much US investment there is in electric cars, solar,
etc. And nobody in the US is going to be buying Chinese solar panels when
they're no longer cheap. They'll be buying American ones.
Yeah, I don't see history as a series of disasters either. Just paradigm
shifts. But I guess I'm fundamentally a "progressive" and not a
neoreactionary. But then again, I don't see how anyone who understands
evolution can think it can't apply to human knowledge & culture as much as
it does to genomes. Unless they're predisposed to believing there's nothing
they can do anyway, because they would otherwise feel back about NOT doing
anything. Most of us do seek meaning, after all, and it can be hard to
accept that your life thus far has had none. Or maybe I'm just more
sanguine about it because I have my backup strategy: kids. And I want to
believe they're not destined to live in a world that's shittier than the
one I grew up in.
I'm not opposed to "radical decentralization of industry and agriculture,"
provided there is not a significant reduction in productivity, which with
improvements in technology there doesn't have to be, especially when you
account for the increase in resilience & the reduction in the (presently
hidden/subsidized) cost of transporting food/goods over long distances.
I suspect this is the direction technology is already leading us, though.
Take steel mills as an example: they reached peak scale in the 1950s or so
and then got outcompeted by smaller, more flexible mini-mills with smaller
machines with less up-front investment. Farming equipment is getting
smaller and smaller, and I suspect a lot of the current scale of farming is
a result of artificial barriers to competition, *not* the technology or
genuine economies of scale. Get rid of those barriers, and the scale will
naturally fall as smaller, more flexible firms and individuals jump into
the market.
I think the only thing I'd add here is that it's important not to lump all
genetic modifications together. While some of them may be "gratuitous" and
dangerous, others may turn out to be vital, like salt tolerant crops, more
nutritious grain varieties, etc. I suspect patent reform would go a long
way toward reducing the problems with genetic modification.
I would submit that progress toward a more voluntary society would ALSO
produce greater resiliency. How do you propose to convince a large fraction
of the population to move away from cities, farm, and make their own stuff?
How do you propose to get them to stop using computers, or to decentralize
the manufacture of computers? I'm not saying this is not doable. In fact, I
think it IS doable, but it's going to take the development of new
technologies. I'd love a chip fab that I could own as an individual or in a
partnership with a few friends. I'd love a robot gardener that could turn
my back yard into a farm without my needing to spend a significant fraction
of my time doing it (which is also known as "subsistence.")
And without a global market for food, how do you propose we deal with local
disasters? Shall we force societies to rely on charity in cases where under
the present system they would have just increased their imports slightly?
"Eat local" doesn't work when there's a "local" drought.

Apple has created a MUCH higher value target than an individual iPhone, and
I doubt they've made it enough more expensive to crack than an individual
iPhone that they won't eventually be forced to break it. Of course, forcing
them to break it is tantamount to outlawing such a system anyway, so it
doesn't actually have to be impossible to break, just hard enough that the
law has to change in a significant way before they can be force to break
it. In which case they'd just switch to key escrow anyway and we'd all feel
sorry for them because well at least they tried.
Perhaps it's my lack of imagination, but this doesn't seem to move the bar
much on the "reckless, dangerous, or impossible" thing. They were able to
build the vault because its functionality is essentially identical to the
Secure Enclave chip. Its construction, AFAICT, does not prove that one can
build a similarly secure system that could allow selective access, because
the immutability of the system means you would still need some kind of
master key to authenticate to it to get it to decrypt individual secrets.
You still need physical access, of course, but then it's just a plain ol'
HSM, is it not?
The other property that lets this approach work is that even if the device
fails, that just invalidates people's keychain backups. It doesn't destroy
their original keychains. I'm guessing that Apple scales the service and
avoids the possibility of the loss of a single device invalidating all
backups by having a way to add new master keys over time. Such a mechanism
couldn't be used to decrypt any existing backup, but it could be used to
force Apple to add an escrowed key and get every iPhone to reencrypt its
backup with the new key.

+1 for Homebrew on Macs, but then you're using a Mac ;-)
There's also Nix and its GNU NIH copy Guix, which can be installed in your
homedir or /usr/local on most Unix-like systems. They both have the added
advantage of having any number of separate "profiles" (i.e. symlink farms)
for building packages, doing day-to-day stuff, etc. And since they modify
the system monotonically, you can always roll back packages (but not any
non-versioned state) semi-atomically, take snapshots (which you could do
with ZFS anyway), etc.
"Docker for everything" is not a totally off the wall idea. Not
specifically docker but namespaces & cgroups for making software that's
used to Unix-like discretionary access controls and make it act more like
object-capability software. You'd need a UI or shell or something for
expressing what capabilities to pass along, for example something that
interprets annotated filenames, converts them to filenames in the process's
own namespace, and handles mounting the files into the process's namespace.

Now there's one I hadn't heard before. Usually you hear about the "NWO"

conspiracy theorists who think Obama is the antichrist trying to create the

It seems to me the most likely explanation is that we all love a good
conspiracy theory and there in fact is no NWO. The stability of any
conspiracy is inversely proportional to its vastness because of the
prisoners' dilemma. That doesn't mean powerful individuals or small groups
can't apply just the right pressure at just the right time to take
advantage of opportunities, and it certainly doesn't mean that there aren't
vast alignments of incentives that make people act as if they are involved
in a conspiracy (military industrial complex, prison industrial complex,

I think I may not have been clear. I was referring to the crap on the "

the concept of the "New World Order" is inextricably linked with conspiracy
theories, so it's probably best to avoid using the phrase if you want to be
taken seriously. Of course, Zenaan was addressing someone who uses that
terminology anyway, but I wasn't intending to criticize him.
Did I say that? They obviously exist. I just don't think it's particularly
meaningful to talk about them collectively as part of a "New World Order".
It's a charged term that means different things to different people and
implies a vast conspiracy that doesn't really exist.
The only military contracts I'm aware of were inherited from Boston
Dynamics. AFAIK no new ones were negotiated while Google has owned them,
and Google is selling them.
But this is clearly just a dig at me rather than being intended to add

call the "NWO" from his line accusing redefininggod.com and Belle of being
"intentionally or unintentially, puppets of the NWO itself." But now I see

Well "normal" in this case is being in a relatioship where you're on equal
terms with your partner (hence the term "partner") and thus aren't
concerned about accusations of being subservient. Some people prefer
different arrangements, which is fine, and as long as they feel seucre
about the arrangement they have, they also wouldn't be insulted by such
accusations. Hence "normal." "Abnormal" would be defining one's self-worth
based on their ability to exercise power over some other group and never
being subservient to a member of that group.
Of course, for most of humanity's existence the latter was actually
"normal." but for 99.999% of that period we'd be facing off in person over
such a claim and one of us would beat down the other, thus "proving" who
was in fact more masculine and thus capable of violence. Which made sense
in a world where what mainly mattered, at least for men, was how much
violence you could produce. Seems to me that cypherpunks is not really
about maintaining a world where might makes right, though.
The "mob" is just whoever's on the side you disagree with. You want to
portray them as unthinking, just going with the crowd. But what are you
doing? Jake is a hero to you, and a fellow man, and you already believed
Tor wasn't to be trusted, so no thought is even necessary. He's "obviously"
innocent and the victim of a smear campaign.
But name a public rape accusation that hasn't instantly had multiple smear
campaigns spin up against the *accusers*. That's happening here, not just
against his direct accusers, but against the people who believe his
accusers, and the people who believe the people who believe his accusers.
People who had barely even heard of Shari Steele before are saying the
nastiest things about her. I'm getting accused of "licking my wife's boots."
There are clear and obvious smear campaigns going on here, and not a lot of
rational thought. I'm inclined to just discount "the usual suspects" whom
the MRA label fits like a glove, and to believe people who had to write
public announcements that were clearly very difficult for them and put
their reputations on the line and shake up an important project.
You talk about not needing enemies with "libertarians like me", but you
obviously "need" enemies because you see them around every single corner.
You have considered Tor an enemy from the start, and now you're ready to
write off the CDC, CCC, Debian, Shari Steele and probably the EFF in one
fell swoop.
Which would be easier, orchestrating a smear campaign with multiple false
accusations of rape and sexual misconduct against a well-respected member
of a major software project, or to take advantage of such an opportunity
when it arose to cause a bunch of people to distrust a bunch of critical
freedom-oriented organizations?
But really, I suspect the only thing the TLAs need for this particular
battle is a large supply of popcorn. But given that I expect a lot more
projects and organizations will be starting to purge their own Appelbaums
and/or encouraging them to start treating women and everyone else like
human beings.
Speaking of "everyone else", I note you call Chelsea Manning "he",
presumably because doing the opposite of what the "PC crowd" wants you to

people who have suffered from discrimination all their lives.
WIth "libertarians" like you, it's no surprise that few people who care in
the slightest about anyone who's not exactly like them is willing to
identify themselves as "libertarian." Because your "liiberty" is not "free
to be you and me," it's just "free to be me." You want the freedom but not
the responsibility to think about the consequences of your actions for

type on the command line, and to the inodes of any of the files therein.
And then only read access. I suspect that wouldn't be too hard to add as
annotations to the arguments themselves, similar to how we have wildcards
that are interpreted by the shell now. Automatic named pipes are probably a
better analogy.
Now I feel like I need to go code up a prototype...

@_subject: FBI says foreign hackers have penetrated US state election 
And even if it were a Russian hacker, it's a long trip from there to its
being a hacker working under orders from the Russian government for the
purpose of swaying the US election. Arizona kinda makes sense since it
looks like the vote will be close there and it's winner-take all. But why
Illinois? There's no way to swing Illinois toward Trump and not get caught.
Of course, that assumes that the supposed hack was targeted only at those
states, when it's more likely every state was targeted and either only
those states had vulnerabilities the hackers could find, or only those
states had enough auditing in place to even know they'd been hit. Given the
general state of computer security in government, especially state
government, databases, my money's on the last one. And the most likely
motives are money, embarrassing the government, and lulz. Probably all
three. Maybe they were Russian, maybe they were Ukranians pretending to be
coming from Russia, or maybe the NSA is pulling a fast one on the FBI.
It's also possible the FBI is simply lying, but then we're back to the
problem of why Illinois? If you were going to make up a Russian hack for
the purpose of swaying the election, wouldn't you pick likely swing states?

Even without a government, I think an anarchic society will still need
institutions to function, even if those institutions are entirely
voluntary. I can imagine sets of institutions that would allow corporations
in a similar sense to how they exist now, i.e. limited liability and some
form of "personhood." The most likely such institution would be some kind
of court system where, in order to have access to the court as a means of
seeking restitution, you must agree not to go outside it to go after any
other participant, and must not have done so before.
This is a question I think about all the time.
I see revolutions as a symptom of a broken society. Reform, or evolution,
is certainly preferable.
The French and English revolutions both resulted, after a while, in better
societies than they started in, as far as I can tell. The Haitian
revolution ended slavery there. I don't consider the American revolution,
on the other hand, to be a counter example, though it clearly inspired the
French revolution. Not to say that the French revolution and other reforms
of European monarchies wouldn't have happened anyway.
Same here.
While I think agorism's approach ("grow the counter-economy and the state
will eventually whither away") is provably ineffective, I do think it has a
lot to teach us here. Its main problem is that government is always "just
good enough" that people will continue to resort to it, and people are
forced to pay for it whether or not they make use of it, and they may not
opt out of its jurisdiction. One must not only create alternatives to
government services, they must be alternatives people actually use.
One of the pieces of evidence used against Ross Ulbricht was a post of his
in which he stated, "I am creating an economic simulation to give people a
first-hand experience of what it would be like to live in a world without
the systemic use of force." Whether or not Silk Road was that "simulation",
the general statement is exactly what we need to do, in my opinion. Create
systems of "law" and "governance" that do not require the use of force.
These systems do not have to be all-encompassing; they can be small and
narrow in scope. They just have to make it so people don't feel like they
have to resort to government (i.e. force) to achieve their ends.
Just like they do with the "wild west", I think people drastically
underestimate the amount of spontaneous order in black markets. Hollywood
certainly feeds of it with post-apocalyptic movies & TV shows that depict
everything going straight to "anarchy" the moment there's a hiccup in
government. But history demonstrates that in fact the exact opposite is
true. The only time things descend into "anarchy" when the government falls
is when the collapse of the government was caused by violence in the first
place, or where the government's failure had left society "hollowed out."
Somalia is probably the best known example of this happening. I think
Russia after the collapse of the USSR is probably a more typical example of
what I believe to be the common case.
Security of property and computer systems is an area that's pretty ripe for
non-government solutions. I doubt most readers of this list assume that
they can just rely on police to prevent their car from getting stolen or
house from getting broken into, or think the police will come along and
investigate after the fact, then catch the thief and get their stuff back.
No, we all have insurance, locks, good passwords with two-factor and/or
public key authentication, probably cameras, safes, crypto, etc. A lot of
that is pretty hard to use, though, so maybe we should be focusing on
making the solutions we use available to the masses.
Thanks for this post, by the way. One of my favorites on cpunks to date.

Agreed. I'm just saying that such an arrangement is not inconceivable in an
anarchic/voluntary society. And without the state to force it on everyone,
assuming no single "court" system comes to dominate and abuse its monopoly
position, I doubt it could be nearly as harmful. And even if some court
does become a monopoly, since opting out of even a monopoly voluntary court
system is far easier than opting out of a state.
Agreed. Though even under the status quo there are situations where
corporations lose their limited liability, such as in certain criminal
scenarios. Limited liability can only apply in a voluntary society where a
transaction has taken place. Third parties can always sue in some court
that does not recognize the limited liability, and it may well be that even
within the same court system, they decided to drastically limit the scope
of limited liability, for example only to situations where a transaction
has taken place. Not sure what that would mean to, say, product liability
where a third party is injured, though. But unlimited product liability
could result in a far smaller number of products. Who'd make a car, for
example? Or an airliner? Sure, the airline could require passengers to
agree not to sue, but they can't do that for people on the ground. Under
the status quo there's blanket indemnification for airlines and aircraft
manufacturers. That is probably not the best solution, but I also don't
know what is or how one would implement it in a purely voluntary society.
Intuitively I think (hope) it must be possible, but I am by no means
Or maybe unlimited liability is just no big deal and limited liability has
always just been a way for some people to gain advantage over others.
Perhaps without a system like the US's that encourages frivolous lawsuits,
there would be no need.
I think by the time revolution happens, people HAVE done these things, and
the government's response has been to crack down rather than reforming.
Exactly what is happening in the US right now with police brutality.
Perhaps if more people got involved, the government could have been
convinced to reform rather than cracking down further, but it is a central
tenet of governing that you need to have a reasonably large and productive
class that is happy with its modicum of control, i.e. the "middle" class.
Keep them happy and protected from the lower class, and you can keep
society under control.
I suppose it depends on how you're counting. Reform happens all the time.
Not often reforms the size of what you get from revolutions, but I'd say
far more positive change happens through gradual reform than directly from
revolution. But perhaps I'm setting the bar too low by qualifying it with
"If only enough people would resist". But keeping people from resisting en
masse is government's specialty. This is classic prisoners' dilemma. As
Mike explains in The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, sometimes you have to make
things worse before they get better. I.e. convince people to revolt by
making it so they are no longer comfortable.
I think Uruguay is actually on the forefront of drug legalization. Colorado
is ahead of Amsterdam, even, because drugs have never really been legal
there. Buying and using is legal, but a bunch of other necessary parts like
growing & transporting are not. The authorities just look the other way,
but can change their minds at any time and have cracked down in the past.
Indeed, and even if/when it succeeds, Google will just become another
vertically-integrated telecomms giant.
Research can never prove something is secure, only that it's insecure. Low
latency onion routing is about as crappy as you can get when it comes to
anonymity, just a step above a chain of proxies. I see no reason a high
latency mix net couldn't be made sufficiently secure with, say, operators
in mutually antagonistic countries.
Maybe. Definitely if you assume that government will eventually outlaw all
anonymous use of the Internet. Of course, then they could always phrase the
legislation in such a way that an N2N mesh network is also covered. Are you
forwarding packets from your neighbor to a different neighbor? Well, you're
"providing a public communications service" or some such bullshit.

I haven't yet been able to convince myself that "large and dominant
syndicates" are even necessary. Do we really need large scale coordination
separated into different cliques like that, or is it possible to have a
single large network (in the abstract sense) of distributed transactions?
If transaction costs get close enough to zero, the optimal firm size goes
to one. So the question becomes how much we can reduce transaction costs.
This feels right to me. Which is to say I think it's right but don't know
enough to make a good argument for it.
I don't know if I understand the point well enough to debate it, but I'm
interested to know what your definition of "public" is. Does such a thing
exist with respect to government? Aren't they really government roads?
Please forgive me if that's the exact kind of discussion you want to go
onto another thread.
Yes. Which will be the trigger for the next financial crisis or the one
after (since I think real estate is still fucked).
Or just lobby the government to require the use of your products.
Obvious to me, perhaps not some others.
I've been slowly slogging my way through Robert K. Massie's _Dreadnought_,
and it struck me how openly the government of the British Empire considered
themselves primarily protectors of the commercial interests of British
companies. I suspect future historians will think us terribly naive to
think that capitalism and mercantilism are different things. Capitalism,
for the most part, seems to be just mercantilism with less transparency and
the more competition for the government's favor. "Competition" being
competition to see who can give the most political donations to the right
people, etc.
I think most of the time it's not even fear of being shot,  though. It's
fear of losing privileges. Anyone can be blackballed in any industry at any
time. Just associate them with kiddie porn or name them as a "person of
interest" in some investigation.
I think it's both, really. You qualify it with "political" here, and I
think that's right. Unfortunately it's a pretty "charged" term, though, so
it will only convey your meaning in particular circles.
I haven't yet been able to figure out how much of a collectivist or
individualist you are, but "democracy" strikes me as a fairly collectivist
term. It's rule by the people over all the other people. I prefer rule of
oneself by oneself. To the extent possible, at least.
Perhaps "opt-in direct democracy" would be a better way to define
I'm a fan of "polycentric order" or "polycentric law" myself. Though that
may assume certain factors that you don't think are warranted.
How about families or even just individuals?
The temptation to design is a very hard one to avoid. It took me a long
time to break myself of it. In fact, it was an individualist anarchist who
finally broke me of the habit.
Despite probably being the "wrong" kind of anarchist according to many
here, Hans-Hermann Hoppe does a pretty good job of obliterating the notion
that voluntary societies cannot defend themselves from traditional
nation-states in _The Myth of National Defense_.
In any case, though, Zen (and I) expect such a society to evolve alongside
and among traditional nation-states, so it has to be able to protect itself
or it could not exist in the first place. So there's no need to "site" the
society anywhere.
If we do get access to our own planet, though, it might help things along a
bit. Of course, then you run into the problem that all
intentional/constructed communities run into, which is that they have an
extremely low probability of success. This is one of the reasons I've
mostly gotten over the idea of seasteading as the answer to our problems.
Of course, while an *individual* seastead might have very low probability
of success, tens of thousands might produce a couple of interesting ideas.
 ...
And a "transition" or "emergency" government that's really just a
dictatorship and lasts a very long time.
And often this is "literally" true - the old servants become the masters
and the masters become worm food. And then the old servants are just as
brutal of masters, if not moreso, than their old masters. Especially if the
new masters really did comes from the lowest echelons of society where they
have no experience at all with leadership. At least internal coups don't
tend to have this problem quite so badly. But they also don't tend to
change much.
Personally, I don't plan to go to war at all, ever, if I can avoid it. And
by "avoiding" I mean "can physically escape with my loved ones," not "I've
tried everything else to effect change and now must take up arms." I care
enough about my home to kill an individual or small band who try to invade
it, and even to band together with my neighborhood to do so, but not to go
to war. I'm not sure I could tell you what the crossover would be in terms
of level of organization, but I'd guess it's at the level where we need to
resort to any kind of abstraction.
They are not on the bottom, though. They are the bourgeoisie. They
typically form alliances with those on the bottom by promising to make
their situation better, though never better than their own. Go with us to
war and we'll share the spoils (unequally) with you.
Historically, it's been very hard for small syndicates to grow into large
ones without winning favor from the existing players. Today we have Ubers
that can grow without having a revolution. It used to be much harder.
I don't consider this a likely contingency. The trend has been toward LESS
violence, and there is no particular reason to believe that there's a
simple inverse relationship between income and fertility rate. Doesn't mean
I am not hedging against such a possibility, but I'm certainly not betting
on it, just making it more likely my family and I could survive it if it
The economies of developed countries are too intertwined for USD to "go
down hard" without taking a lot of other economies with it. What do you
think will happen to the Chinese economy if, for example, the US suddenly
stops buying their products? They'd have a bunch of saved dollars to spend,
and the best way to spend them would be on American goods. More likely it
would be gradual and we'd see a shift in the US back toward manufacturing.
The US government actually *wants* the dollar to decline in value. It makes
US products more competitive both domestically and abroad. It causes
inflation and thus reduces real incomes and debt. It would put a bunch of
people back to work. Sure, skyrocketing oil prices would hurt the US
economy, but look how much US investment there is in electric cars, solar,
etc. And nobody in the US is going to be buying Chinese solar panels when
they're no longer cheap. They'll be buying American ones.
Yeah, I don't see history as a series of disasters either. Just paradigm
shifts. But I guess I'm fundamentally a "progressive" and not a
neoreactionary. But then again, I don't see how anyone who understands
evolution can think it can't apply to human knowledge & culture as much as
it does to genomes. Unless they're predisposed to believing there's nothing
they can do anyway, because they would otherwise feel back about NOT doing
anything. Most of us do seek meaning, after all, and it can be hard to
accept that your life thus far has had none. Or maybe I'm just more
sanguine about it because I have my backup strategy: kids. And I want to
believe they're not destined to live in a world that's shittier than the
one I grew up in.
I'm not opposed to "radical decentralization of industry and agriculture,"
provided there is not a significant reduction in productivity, which with
improvements in technology there doesn't have to be, especially when you
account for the increase in resilience & the reduction in the (presently
hidden/subsidized) cost of transporting food/goods over long distances.
I suspect this is the direction technology is already leading us, though.
Take steel mills as an example: they reached peak scale in the 1950s or so
and then got outcompeted by smaller, more flexible mini-mills with smaller
machines with less up-front investment. Farming equipment is getting
smaller and smaller, and I suspect a lot of the current scale of farming is
a result of artificial barriers to competition, *not* the technology or
genuine economies of scale. Get rid of those barriers, and the scale will
naturally fall as smaller, more flexible firms and individuals jump into
the market.
I think the only thing I'd add here is that it's important not to lump all
genetic modifications together. While some of them may be "gratuitous" and
dangerous, others may turn out to be vital, like salt tolerant crops, more
nutritious grain varieties, etc. I suspect patent reform would go a long
way toward reducing the problems with genetic modification.
I would submit that progress toward a more voluntary society would ALSO
produce greater resiliency. How do you propose to convince a large fraction
of the population to move away from cities, farm, and make their own stuff?
How do you propose to get them to stop using computers, or to decentralize
the manufacture of computers? I'm not saying this is not doable. In fact, I
think it IS doable, but it's going to take the development of new
technologies. I'd love a chip fab that I could own as an individual or in a
partnership with a few friends. I'd love a robot gardener that could turn
my back yard into a farm without my needing to spend a significant fraction
of my time doing it (which is also known as "subsistence.")
And without a global market for food, how do you propose we deal with local
disasters? Shall we force societies to rely on charity in cases where under
the present system they would have just increased their imports slightly?
"Eat local" doesn't work when there's a "local" drought.

Apple has created a MUCH higher value target than an individual iPhone, and
I doubt they've made it enough more expensive to crack than an individual
iPhone that they won't eventually be forced to break it. Of course, forcing
them to break it is tantamount to outlawing such a system anyway, so it
doesn't actually have to be impossible to break, just hard enough that the
law has to change in a significant way before they can be force to break
it. In which case they'd just switch to key escrow anyway and we'd all feel
sorry for them because well at least they tried.
Perhaps it's my lack of imagination, but this doesn't seem to move the bar
much on the "reckless, dangerous, or impossible" thing. They were able to
build the vault because its functionality is essentially identical to the
Secure Enclave chip. Its construction, AFAICT, does not prove that one can
build a similarly secure system that could allow selective access, because
the immutability of the system means you would still need some kind of
master key to authenticate to it to get it to decrypt individual secrets.
You still need physical access, of course, but then it's just a plain ol'
HSM, is it not?
The other property that lets this approach work is that even if the device
fails, that just invalidates people's keychain backups. It doesn't destroy
their original keychains. I'm guessing that Apple scales the service and
avoids the possibility of the loss of a single device invalidating all
backups by having a way to add new master keys over time. Such a mechanism
couldn't be used to decrypt any existing backup, but it could be used to
force Apple to add an escrowed key and get every iPhone to reencrypt its
backup with the new key.

advantage of having any number of separate "profiles" (i.e. symlink farms)

can't apply just the right pressure at just the right time to take

the concept of the "New World Order" is inextricably linked with conspiracy

terminology anyway, but I wasn't intending to criticize him.
Did I say that? They obviously exist. I just don't think it's particularly
meaningful to talk about them collectively as part of a "New World Order".
It's a charged term that means different things to different people and
implies a vast conspiracy that doesn't really exist.

Whoops, this got buried among other cpunks threads because your mail client
apparently supports "list reply" (of which I'm a fan, don't get me wrong),
and Inbox apparently isn't smart enough to pop out threads I've replied to
if they don't have me in the recipients list.
While I've been considering going back to running my own server for some
time, I'm afraid I am currently using Gmail via the now
deprecated/grandfathered free tier of "Google apps for your domain," which
makes me feel like something of a second class citizen because it tends to
get various products last, for example it does not work with Google Fi, and
you can't set up a Google Play family account. Which seems idiotic since
families seem like a pretty major use case for Apps for your Domain... but
again, the free tier is deprecated :-/
Of course, I can't complain too much about it; it's already a huge problem
in SIlicon Valley that we tend to build solutions that work well for us and
far less well for the other 99.999% of the population. But it would be nice
if we could figure out how to make something as important as an email
address more portable for regular people by making it super easy to have a
custom domain that you use for just yourself or your family or whatever.

Data mining and throwing people in jail for "precrimes" using parallel

commonplace. It's more than a little silly that it's "feminazis" that juan

Well "normal" in this case is being in a relatioship where you're on equal
terms with your partner (hence the term "partner") and thus aren't
concerned about accusations of being subservient. Some people prefer
different arrangements, which is fine, and as long as they feel seucre
about the arrangement they have, they also wouldn't be insulted by such
accusations. Hence "normal." "Abnormal" would be defining one's self-worth
based on their ability to exercise power over some other group and never
being subservient to a member of that group.
Of course, for most of humanity's existence the latter was actually
"normal." but for 99.999% of that period we'd be facing off in person over
such a claim and one of us would beat down the other, thus "proving" who
was in fact more masculine and thus capable of violence. Which made sense
in a world where what mainly mattered, at least for men, was how much
violence you could produce. Seems to me that cypherpunks is not really
about maintaining a world where might makes right, though.
The "mob" is just whoever's on the side you disagree with. You want to
portray them as unthinking, just going with the crowd. But what are you
doing? Jake is a hero to you, and a fellow man, and you already believed
Tor wasn't to be trusted, so no thought is even necessary. He's "obviously"
innocent and the victim of a smear campaign.
But name a public rape accusation that hasn't instantly had multiple smear
campaigns spin up against the *accusers*. That's happening here, not just
against his direct accusers, but against the people who believe his
accusers, and the people who believe the people who believe his accusers.
People who had barely even heard of Shari Steele before are saying the
nastiest things about her. I'm getting accused of "licking my wife's boots."
There are clear and obvious smear campaigns going on here, and not a lot of
rational thought. I'm inclined to just discount "the usual suspects" whom
the MRA label fits like a glove, and to believe people who had to write
public announcements that were clearly very difficult for them and put
their reputations on the line and shake up an important project.
You talk about not needing enemies with "libertarians like me", but you
obviously "need" enemies because you see them around every single corner.
You have considered Tor an enemy from the start, and now you're ready to
write off the CDC, CCC, Debian, Shari Steele and probably the EFF in one
fell swoop.
Which would be easier, orchestrating a smear campaign with multiple false
accusations of rape and sexual misconduct against a well-respected member
of a major software project, or to take advantage of such an opportunity
when it arose to cause a bunch of people to distrust a bunch of critical
freedom-oriented organizations?
But really, I suspect the only thing the TLAs need for this particular
battle is a large supply of popcorn. But given that I expect a lot more
projects and organizations will be starting to purge their own Appelbaums
and/or encouraging them to start treating women and everyone else like
human beings.
Speaking of "everyone else", I note you call Chelsea Manning "he",
presumably because doing the opposite of what the "PC crowd" wants you to
do is more important to you than civility, even (perhaps especially) to
people who have suffered from discrimination all their lives.
WIth "libertarians" like you, it's no surprise that few people who care in
the slightest about anyone who's not exactly like them is willing to
identify themselves as "libertarian." Because your "liiberty" is not "free
to be you and me," it's just "free to be me." You want the freedom but not
the responsibility to think about the consequences of your actions for
others. No wonder you're such an Appelbaum fan: he's exactly what you
aspire to be.

I had much better luck with Spamassassin than I do with Gmail's spam

IMO is unforgiveable because it forces people to go through their spam

of the false positives are messages sent to mailing lists that some idiot
probably marked as spam, which IMO is the fundamental problem with

And even if it were a Russian hacker, it's a long trip from there to its

looks like the vote will be close there and it's winner-take all. But why
Illinois? There's no way to swing Illinois toward Trump and not get caught.
Of course, that assumes that the supposed hack was targeted only at those
states, when it's more likely every state was targeted and either only
those states had vulnerabilities the hackers could find, or only those
states had enough auditing in place to even know they'd been hit. Given the
general state of computer security in government, especially state
government, databases, my money's on the last one. And the most likely
motives are money, embarrassing the government, and lulz. Probably all
three. Maybe they were Russian, maybe they were Ukranians pretending to be
coming from Russia, or maybe the NSA is pulling a fast one on the FBI.
It's also possible the FBI is simply lying, but then we're back to the

Even without a government, I think an anarchic society will still need
institutions to function, even if those institutions are entirely
voluntary. I can imagine sets of institutions that would allow corporations
in a similar sense to how they exist now, i.e. limited liability and some
form of "personhood." The most likely such institution would be some kind
of court system where, in order to have access to the court as a means of
seeking restitution, you must agree not to go outside it to go after any
other participant, and must not have done so before.
This is a question I think about all the time.
I see revolutions as a symptom of a broken society. Reform, or evolution,
is certainly preferable.
The French and English revolutions both resulted, after a while, in better
societies than they started in, as far as I can tell. The Haitian
revolution ended slavery there. I don't consider the American revolution,
on the other hand, to be a counter example, though it clearly inspired the
French revolution. Not to say that the French revolution and other reforms
of European monarchies wouldn't have happened anyway.
Same here.
While I think agorism's approach ("grow the counter-economy and the state
will eventually whither away") is provably ineffective, I do think it has a
lot to teach us here. Its main problem is that government is always "just
good enough" that people will continue to resort to it, and people are
forced to pay for it whether or not they make use of it, and they may not
opt out of its jurisdiction. One must not only create alternatives to
government services, they must be alternatives people actually use.
One of the pieces of evidence used against Ross Ulbricht was a post of his
in which he stated, "I am creating an economic simulation to give people a
first-hand experience of what it would be like to live in a world without
the systemic use of force." Whether or not Silk Road was that "simulation",
the general statement is exactly what we need to do, in my opinion. Create
systems of "law" and "governance" that do not require the use of force.
These systems do not have to be all-encompassing; they can be small and
narrow in scope. They just have to make it so people don't feel like they
have to resort to government (i.e. force) to achieve their ends.
Just like they do with the "wild west", I think people drastically
underestimate the amount of spontaneous order in black markets. Hollywood
certainly feeds of it with post-apocalyptic movies & TV shows that depict
everything going straight to "anarchy" the moment there's a hiccup in
government. But history demonstrates that in fact the exact opposite is
true. The only time things descend into "anarchy" when the government falls
is when the collapse of the government was caused by violence in the first
place, or where the government's failure had left society "hollowed out."
Somalia is probably the best known example of this happening. I think
Russia after the collapse of the USSR is probably a more typical example of
what I believe to be the common case.
Security of property and computer systems is an area that's pretty ripe for
non-government solutions. I doubt most readers of this list assume that
they can just rely on police to prevent their car from getting stolen or
house from getting broken into, or think the police will come along and
investigate after the fact, then catch the thief and get their stuff back.
No, we all have insurance, locks, good passwords with two-factor and/or
public key authentication, probably cameras, safes, crypto, etc. A lot of
that is pretty hard to use, though, so maybe we should be focusing on
making the solutions we use available to the masses.

Agreed. I'm just saying that such an arrangement is not inconceivable in an
anarchic/voluntary society. And without the state to force it on everyone,
assuming no single "court" system comes to dominate and abuse its monopoly
position, I doubt it could be nearly as harmful. And even if some court
does become a monopoly, since opting out of even a monopoly voluntary court
system is far easier than opting out of a state.
Agreed. Though even under the status quo there are situations where
corporations lose their limited liability, such as in certain criminal
scenarios. Limited liability can only apply in a voluntary society where a
transaction has taken place. Third parties can always sue in some court
that does not recognize the limited liability, and it may well be that even
within the same court system, they decided to drastically limit the scope
of limited liability, for example only to situations where a transaction
has taken place. Not sure what that would mean to, say, product liability
where a third party is injured, though. But unlimited product liability
could result in a far smaller number of products. Who'd make a car, for
example? Or an airliner? Sure, the airline could require passengers to
agree not to sue, but they can't do that for people on the ground. Under
the status quo there's blanket indemnification for airlines and aircraft
manufacturers. That is probably not the best solution, but I also don't
know what is or how one would implement it in a purely voluntary society.
Intuitively I think (hope) it must be possible, but I am by no means
Or maybe unlimited liability is just no big deal and limited liability has
always just been a way for some people to gain advantage over others.
Perhaps without a system like the US's that encourages frivolous lawsuits,
there would be no need.
I think by the time revolution happens, people HAVE done these things, and
the government's response has been to crack down rather than reforming.
Exactly what is happening in the US right now with police brutality.
Perhaps if more people got involved, the government could have been
convinced to reform rather than cracking down further, but it is a central
tenet of governing that you need to have a reasonably large and productive
class that is happy with its modicum of control, i.e. the "middle" class.
Keep them happy and protected from the lower class, and you can keep
society under control.
I suppose it depends on how you're counting. Reform happens all the time.
Not often reforms the size of what you get from revolutions, but I'd say
far more positive change happens through gradual reform than directly from
revolution. But perhaps I'm setting the bar too low by qualifying it with
"If only enough people would resist". But keeping people from resisting en
masse is government's specialty. This is classic prisoners' dilemma. As
Mike explains in The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, sometimes you have to make
things worse before they get better. I.e. convince people to revolt by
making it so they are no longer comfortable.
I think Uruguay is actually on the forefront of drug legalization. Colorado
is ahead of Amsterdam, even, because drugs have never really been legal
there. Buying and using is legal, but a bunch of other necessary parts like
growing & transporting are not. The authorities just look the other way,
but can change their minds at any time and have cracked down in the past.
Indeed, and even if/when it succeeds, Google will just become another
vertically-integrated telecomms giant.
Research can never prove something is secure, only that it's insecure. Low
latency onion routing is about as crappy as you can get when it comes to
anonymity, just a step above a chain of proxies. I see no reason a high
latency mix net couldn't be made sufficiently secure with, say, operators
in mutually antagonistic countries.
Maybe. Definitely if you assume that government will eventually outlaw all
anonymous use of the Internet. Of course, then they could always phrase the
legislation in such a way that an N2N mesh network is also covered. Are you
forwarding packets from your neighbor to a different neighbor? Well, you're
"providing a public communications service" or some such bullshit.

I haven't yet been able to convince myself that "large and dominant
syndicates" are even necessary. Do we really need large scale coordination
separated into different cliques like that, or is it possible to have a
single large network (in the abstract sense) of distributed transactions?
If transaction costs get close enough to zero, the optimal firm size goes
to one. So the question becomes how much we can reduce transaction costs.
This feels right to me. Which is to say I think it's right but don't know
enough to make a good argument for it.
I don't know if I understand the point well enough to debate it, but I'm
interested to know what your definition of "public" is. Does such a thing
exist with respect to government? Aren't they really government roads?
Please forgive me if that's the exact kind of discussion you want to go
onto another thread.
Yes. Which will be the trigger for the next financial crisis or the one
after (since I think real estate is still fucked).
Or just lobby the government to require the use of your products.
Obvious to me, perhaps not some others.
I've been slowly slogging my way through Robert K. Massie's _Dreadnought_,
and it struck me how openly the government of the British Empire considered
themselves primarily protectors of the commercial interests of British
companies. I suspect future historians will think us terribly naive to
think that capitalism and mercantilism are different things. Capitalism,
for the most part, seems to be just mercantilism with less transparency and
the more competition for the government's favor. "Competition" being
competition to see who can give the most political donations to the right
people, etc.
I think most of the time it's not even fear of being shot,  though. It's
fear of losing privileges. Anyone can be blackballed in any industry at any
time. Just associate them with kiddie porn or name them as a "person of
interest" in some investigation.
I think it's both, really. You qualify it with "political" here, and I
think that's right. Unfortunately it's a pretty "charged" term, though, so
it will only convey your meaning in particular circles.
I haven't yet been able to figure out how much of a collectivist or
individualist you are, but "democracy" strikes me as a fairly collectivist
term. It's rule by the people over all the other people. I prefer rule of
oneself by oneself. To the extent possible, at least.
Perhaps "opt-in direct democracy" would be a better way to define
I'm a fan of "polycentric order" or "polycentric law" myself. Though that
may assume certain factors that you don't think are warranted.
How about families or even just individuals?
The temptation to design is a very hard one to avoid. It took me a long
time to break myself of it. In fact, it was an individualist anarchist who
finally broke me of the habit.
Despite probably being the "wrong" kind of anarchist according to many
here, Hans-Hermann Hoppe does a pretty good job of obliterating the notion
that voluntary societies cannot defend themselves from traditional
nation-states in _The Myth of National Defense_.
In any case, though, Zen (and I) expect such a society to evolve alongside
and among traditional nation-states, so it has to be able to protect itself
or it could not exist in the first place. So there's no need to "site" the
society anywhere.
If we do get access to our own planet, though, it might help things along a
bit. Of course, then you run into the problem that all
intentional/constructed communities run into, which is that they have an
extremely low probability of success. This is one of the reasons I've
mostly gotten over the idea of seasteading as the answer to our problems.
Of course, while an *individual* seastead might have very low probability
of success, tens of thousands might produce a couple of interesting ideas.
 ...
And a "transition" or "emergency" government that's really just a
dictatorship and lasts a very long time.
And often this is "literally" true - the old servants become the masters
and the masters become worm food. And then the old servants are just as
brutal of masters, if not moreso, than their old masters. Especially if the
new masters really did comes from the lowest echelons of society where they
have no experience at all with leadership. At least internal coups don't
tend to have this problem quite so badly. But they also don't tend to
change much.
Personally, I don't plan to go to war at all, ever, if I can avoid it. And
by "avoiding" I mean "can physically escape with my loved ones," not "I've
tried everything else to effect change and now must take up arms." I care
enough about my home to kill an individual or small band who try to invade
it, and even to band together with my neighborhood to do so, but not to go
to war. I'm not sure I could tell you what the crossover would be in terms
of level of organization, but I'd guess it's at the level where we need to
resort to any kind of abstraction.
They are not on the bottom, though. They are the bourgeoisie. They
typically form alliances with those on the bottom by promising to make
their situation better, though never better than their own. Go with us to
war and we'll share the spoils (unequally) with you.
Historically, it's been very hard for small syndicates to grow into large
ones without winning favor from the existing players. Today we have Ubers
that can grow without having a revolution. It used to be much harder.
I don't consider this a likely contingency. The trend has been toward LESS
violence, and there is no particular reason to believe that there's a
simple inverse relationship between income and fertility rate. Doesn't mean
I am not hedging against such a possibility, but I'm certainly not betting
on it, just making it more likely my family and I could survive it if it
The economies of developed countries are too intertwined for USD to "go
down hard" without taking a lot of other economies with it. What do you
think will happen to the Chinese economy if, for example, the US suddenly
stops buying their products? They'd have a bunch of saved dollars to spend,
and the best way to spend them would be on American goods. More likely it
would be gradual and we'd see a shift in the US back toward manufacturing.
The US government actually *wants* the dollar to decline in value. It makes
US products more competitive both domestically and abroad. It causes
inflation and thus reduces real incomes and debt. It would put a bunch of
people back to work. Sure, skyrocketing oil prices would hurt the US
economy, but look how much US investment there is in electric cars, solar,
etc. And nobody in the US is going to be buying Chinese solar panels when
they're no longer cheap. They'll be buying American ones.
Yeah, I don't see history as a series of disasters either. Just paradigm
shifts. But I guess I'm fundamentally a "progressive" and not a
neoreactionary. But then again, I don't see how anyone who understands
evolution can think it can't apply to human knowledge & culture as much as
it does to genomes. Unless they're predisposed to believing there's nothing
they can do anyway, because they would otherwise feel back about NOT doing
anything. Most of us do seek meaning, after all, and it can be hard to
accept that your life thus far has had none. Or maybe I'm just more
sanguine about it because I have my backup strategy: kids. And I want to
believe they're not destined to live in a world that's shittier than the
one I grew up in.
I'm not opposed to "radical decentralization of industry and agriculture,"
provided there is not a significant reduction in productivity, which with
improvements in technology there doesn't have to be, especially when you
account for the increase in resilience & the reduction in the (presently
hidden/subsidized) cost of transporting food/goods over long distances.
I suspect this is the direction technology is already leading us, though.
Take steel mills as an example: they reached peak scale in the 1950s or so
and then got outcompeted by smaller, more flexible mini-mills with smaller
machines with less up-front investment. Farming equipment is getting
smaller and smaller, and I suspect a lot of the current scale of farming is
a result of artificial barriers to competition, *not* the technology or
genuine economies of scale. Get rid of those barriers, and the scale will
naturally fall as smaller, more flexible firms and individuals jump into
the market.
I think the only thing I'd add here is that it's important not to lump all
genetic modifications together. While some of them may be "gratuitous" and
dangerous, others may turn out to be vital, like salt tolerant crops, more
nutritious grain varieties, etc. I suspect patent reform would go a long
way toward reducing the problems with genetic modification.
I would submit that progress toward a more voluntary society would ALSO
produce greater resiliency. How do you propose to convince a large fraction
of the population to move away from cities, farm, and make their own stuff?
How do you propose to get them to stop using computers, or to decentralize
the manufacture of computers? I'm not saying this is not doable. In fact, I
think it IS doable, but it's going to take the development of new
technologies. I'd love a chip fab that I could own as an individual or in a
partnership with a few friends. I'd love a robot gardener that could turn
my back yard into a farm without my needing to spend a significant fraction
of my time doing it (which is also known as "subsistence.")
And without a global market for food, how do you propose we deal with local
disasters? Shall we force societies to rely on charity in cases where under
the present system they would have just increased their imports slightly?
"Eat local" doesn't work when there's a "local" drought.

build the vault because its functionality is essentially identical to the
Secure Enclave chip. Its construction, AFAICT, does not prove that one can
build a similarly secure system that could allow selective access, because
the immutability of the system means you would still need some kind of
master key to authenticate to it to get it to decrypt individual secrets.
You still need physical access, of course, but then it's just a plain ol'
HSM, is it not?
The other property that lets this approach work is that even if the device
fails, that just invalidates people's keychain backups. It doesn't destroy
their original keychains. I'm guessing that Apple scales the service and
avoids the possibility of the loss of a single device invalidating all
backups by having a way to add new master keys over time. Such a mechanism
couldn't be used to decrypt any existing backup, but it could be used to
force Apple to add an escrowed key and get every iPhone to reencrypt its
backup with the new key.

+1 for Homebrew on Macs, but then you're using a Mac ;-)
There's also Nix and its GNU NIH copy Guix, which can be installed in your
homedir or /usr/local on most Unix-like systems. They both have the added
advantage of having any number of separate "profiles" (i.e. symlink farms)
for building packages, doing day-to-day stuff, etc. And since they modify
the system monotonically, you can always roll back packages (but not any
non-versioned state) semi-atomically, take snapshots (which you could do
with ZFS anyway), etc.
"Docker for everything" is not a totally off the wall idea. Not
specifically docker but namespaces & cgroups for making software that's
used to Unix-like discretionary access controls and make it act more like
object-capability software. You'd need a UI or shell or something for
expressing what capabilities to pass along, for example something that
interprets annotated filenames, converts them to filenames in the process's
own namespace, and handles mounting the files into the process's namespace.
Of course, then you're probably just reinventing SELinux or something,
though I do think there's potential there to make the user interface a
little less obtuse than SELinux policies.

Now there's one I hadn't heard before. Usually you hear about the "NWO"
from people pushing UFO theories and new age bullshit, or from Christian
conspiracy theorists who think Obama is the antichrist trying to create the
NWO or some such crap. Now here's someone who thinks the NWO is a Christian
conspiracy to bring about the end of the world or something.
It seems to me the most likely explanation is that we all love a good
conspiracy theory and there in fact is no NWO. The stability of any
conspiracy is inversely proportional to its vastness because of the
prisoners' dilemma. That doesn't mean powerful individuals or small groups
can't apply just the right pressure at just the right time to take
advantage of opportunities, and it certainly doesn't mean that there aren't
vast alignments of incentives that make people act as if they are involved
in a conspiracy (military industrial complex, prison industrial complex,

I think I may not have been clear. I was referring to the crap on the "
redefininggod.com" web site more than Zenaan's reply. And like it or not,
the concept of the "New World Order" is inextricably linked with conspiracy
theories, so it's probably best to avoid using the phrase if you want to be
taken seriously. Of course, Zenaan was addressing someone who uses that
terminology anyway, but I wasn't intending to criticize him.
Did I say that? They obviously exist. I just don't think it's particularly
meaningful to talk about them collectively as part of a "New World Order".
It's a charged term that means different things to different people and
implies a vast conspiracy that doesn't really exist.
The only military contracts I'm aware of were inherited from Boston
Dynamics. AFAIK no new ones were negotiated while Google has owned them,
and Google is selling them.
But this is clearly just a dig at me rather than being intended to add
anything to the discussion anyway, so whatever.

This is a strangely vehement response to my message. Who, exactly, am I
trying to "smear" here? I have often written agreeing with Zenaan's
accusations against the US government. Mostly I've disagreed with him on
the "goodness" of Russia and Putin. Literally the only thing I was
disagreeing with him on was the existence of something it makes sense to
call the "NWO" from his line accusing redefininggod.com and Belle of being
"intentionally or unintentially, puppets of the NWO itself." But now I see
he was probably just being somewhat tongue-in-cheek anyway.

Well "normal" in this case is being in a relatioship where you're on equal
terms with your partner (hence the term "partner") and thus aren't
concerned about accusations of being subservient. Some people prefer
different arrangements, which is fine, and as long as they feel seucre
about the arrangement they have, they also wouldn't be insulted by such
accusations. Hence "normal." "Abnormal" would be defining one's self-worth
based on their ability to exercise power over some other group and never
being subservient to a member of that group.
Of course, for most of humanity's existence the latter was actually
"normal." but for 99.999% of that period we'd be facing off in person over
such a claim and one of us would beat down the other, thus "proving" who
was in fact more masculine and thus capable of violence. Which made sense
in a world where what mainly mattered, at least for men, was how much
violence you could produce. Seems to me that cypherpunks is not really
about maintaining a world where might makes right, though.
The "mob" is just whoever's on the side you disagree with. You want to
portray them as unthinking, just going with the crowd. But what are you
doing? Jake is a hero to you, and a fellow man, and you already believed
Tor wasn't to be trusted, so no thought is even necessary. He's "obviously"
innocent and the victim of a smear campaign.
But name a public rape accusation that hasn't instantly had multiple smear
campaigns spin up against the *accusers*. That's happening here, not just
against his direct accusers, but against the people who believe his
accusers, and the people who believe the people who believe his accusers.
People who had barely even heard of Shari Steele before are saying the
nastiest things about her. I'm getting accused of "licking my wife's boots."
There are clear and obvious smear campaigns going on here, and not a lot of
rational thought. I'm inclined to just discount "the usual suspects" whom
the MRA label fits like a glove, and to believe people who had to write
public announcements that were clearly very difficult for them and put
their reputations on the line and shake up an important project.
You talk about not needing enemies with "libertarians like me", but you
obviously "need" enemies because you see them around every single corner.
You have considered Tor an enemy from the start, and now you're ready to
write off the CDC, CCC, Debian, Shari Steele and probably the EFF in one
fell swoop.
Which would be easier, orchestrating a smear campaign with multiple false
accusations of rape and sexual misconduct against a well-respected member
of a major software project, or to take advantage of such an opportunity
when it arose to cause a bunch of people to distrust a bunch of critical
freedom-oriented organizations?
But really, I suspect the only thing the TLAs need for this particular
battle is a large supply of popcorn. But given that I expect a lot more
projects and organizations will be starting to purge their own Appelbaums
and/or encouraging them to start treating women and everyone else like
human beings.
Speaking of "everyone else", I note you call Chelsea Manning "he",
presumably because doing the opposite of what the "PC crowd" wants you to
do is more important to you than civility, even (perhaps especially) to
people who have suffered from discrimination all their lives.
WIth "libertarians" like you, it's no surprise that few people who care in
the slightest about anyone who's not exactly like them is willing to
identify themselves as "libertarian." Because your "liiberty" is not "free
to be you and me," it's just "free to be me." You want the freedom but not
the responsibility to think about the consequences of your actions for

Sure, the base utilities are *probably* secure, but only because they're

delete all your files, DoS the whole machine. Not too hard to avoid some of

Illinois? There's no way to swing Illinois toward Trump and not get caught.
Of course, that assumes that the supposed hack was targeted only at those

those states had vulnerabilities the hackers could find, or only those
states had enough auditing in place to even know they'd been hit. Given the

better way to deal with "anti-social communication" would be to ignore it

Yep. Trolling is a problem in any public community. The best way to make
trolls go away if there is no active moderation is to ignore them, but that
requires encouraging those who respond to them to avoid doing so in the
future. IOW, you need leadership regardless of whether you have moderation

Perhaps, but I'm not about to suggest that anyone break the law.
How do you train out of band? By modelling the environment? That's an
interesting thought, and I suspect Google Earth has enough data to be able
to do it in a lot of places. Are you aware of free or inexpensive software
packages for doing this?
Aren't you just talking phased array for something like this though? Or do
you mean using phase information from the receive antennas to reconstruct
the environment rather than using phasing at the transmit side to steer
your beam? That's a very interesting idea since it can give you a 360
degree view with no need to steer your beam, in the same way that some

That movement is lasting echos of the closing of the frontier, at least
according to Dan Carlin (and his explanation seems compelling). You can
blame Teddy Roosevelt.
But this is a question I often think about myself. At least in Germany's
case, there was certainly a major trait that was visible from the outside:
crushing debt and economic malaise the country had no way of digging itself
out of. Massive national humiliation. Greece is in a similar situation
today, and Russia seems not far behind. An American political colloquialism
comes to mind: "It's the economy, stupid!"
Which brings us back around to the paragraph you quoted: there was a
revolution because people's needs were not being met. There is no guarantee
that a revolution will wind up with something better than the thing that
caused it. Especially since revolutions are typically driven by a tiny
minority, with the majority being incited by whatever it takes to motivate
them, typically lots of bogus conspiracy theories. Even the American
Revolution was this way, with a large fraction of the populace believing
there was a conspiracy in England to "enslave" the colonies.
I think you will always hear this from authority. It is "blame the victim"
plain and simple. And if you consider the authority legitimate and "just
doing their job," is it not true? The insidious thing about it is that it
presupposes that legitimacy.

that for corruption to spread that far, it must be pervasive throughout
society, not through some separate thing called "the State." Which means if
the State is really that corrupt, revolution may well be impossible, and
the only solution may be war by other states. Instead, revolution will
happen not because the State is extremely corrupt, since that would require
a corrupt society, but because it is weak and the people perceive it as
can the tools of technology and manufactured consent provide the state
Hmm. I think the notion that the State and the public are not truly
separate applies here as well. So it's not so much that it wouldn't be
detected as that the corruption would encompass all of society.
This is kind of my worst nightmare; that my optimism has been misguided all
this time. I wrote a post on liberty.me about how to deal with an
invincible adversary that may be relevant here:
In the foreward of an obscure book I've started reading, The Omega Seed by
Paolo Soleri, the foreward author talks about how the Christians, instead
of continually trying to fight ineffectual revolts against the Romans as
their Jewish forebears had, instead focused on building communities. I
think we need to focus not only on building communities where we're
connected to one another, but where we're strongly connected to people
around us who may not share our exact beliefs. However you might feel about
cops, for example, if you're friendly with the cops in your community,
they're much less likely to be willing to lock you up and throw away the
key on false pretenses. Even if they know your general beliefs about cops.
Being connected to people makes it much harder for them to believe bullshit
about you. For that reason I doubt I'll be remaining on liberty.me much
longer. I don't want to live in an echo chamber.

your carrier needs to be structured enough to recover some large counter.
GPS qualifies, as probably does WWV and its non-US brethren.
Sure, if you don't care about MIMO, there are lots of ways to steer your

@_subject: [Fwd: Multiple Internets] 
Interesting. I would have thought wired for longer distance communication,
with local mesh networks for the "last mile."
Do you have some thoughts on how to set up a local wired freenet? Back in
the days of modems over content-oblivious phone lines, freenets were easy
because phone lines in bulk were pretty cheap per line, and pretty much
everyone had a land line. In this day and age of video and high-resolution
images, that no longer seems like an option.
Whenever I think of "mesh" I think "mobile mesh," which is just part of the
picture. The mesh networks I've actually seen in action are static
"meshes", which are only really called that because the ISP puts
omnidirectional antennas on some of their customers' roofs to daisy-chain
other customers off of, not because they use any kind of dynamic mesh
routing protocol. This approach might actually work for setting up a
freenet: negotiate directly with local businesses (particularly public
places like coffee shops) and residents to set up local hotspots, then put
up high-gain directional and omnidirectional antennas on a different band
or at least channel to handle the longer distance links.
Of course, the businesses/residents involved are probably going to be
primarily interested in access to the "regular" Internet, but that doesn't
stop you from using strong encryption on the links themselves, tunnelling
onion/mixnet networks, offering local services in private IP space, etc.
Over time, you can replace tunnels over the government-controlled Internet
with wireless links or leased lines with strong crypto. It won't stop the
network from getting shut down if the links are specifically cataloged and
targeted, but it seems like current "internet kill switch" proposals
primarily focus on the layer 3 infrastructure, not on the link or physical
layers. And certainly not on RF.
But even if you do that, if you are offering a "public" service, and you
actually get a lot of users, it seems likely you'd end up being a victim of
your own success, noticed by regulators and then forced to comply with the
same regulations that cover the Internet, including any retention and "kill
switch" requirements. You might be able to mitigate some of that by
encouraging mac address spoofing and end-to-end encryption, but that
doesn't stop a government from taking over one of the local services and
putting a gag order on the operator, then tracking someone to a specific
coffee shop and sneaking up behind them and pinning their arms to their
sides so they can't wipe their machine. Having a dead man switch/"panic
button" on any local servers, routers, etc might help with that,
particularly if there's plausible deniability there. "Sorry, can't comply
with your retention order because our hard disk just died and it's going to
take us months to get the server back online." It works for the Chicago PD
with their constantly "malfunctioning" dashcams, so why not for us?
One side benefit of bringing back freenets in a big way might be the
ability to push back against regulations that have compliance costs. If a
bunch of people voters care about are dependent for their Internet access
on freenets that would have to shut down if they are required to retain
logs for years and set up systems for easy law enforcement access,
politicians might think twice about pushing for such things. Provided they
can't get away with characterizing freenets as dens of "hackers", drug
dealers, terrorists, and child pornographers of course. Which is why it's
important to remain connected with society and not become hermits hiding
out in Internet backwaters.
There's always more social/community-oriented solutions ala Max Hernandez's
Thieves Emporium where you have secret access points and people need to be
vouched in, but that is incredibly hard and would likely remain quite
small, because the probability of infiltration approaches 100% once you get
into the thousands of participants. And of course, if it's small and
secret, nobody will notice when it and its operators/users quietly get
Obviously these approaches are orthogonal to one another, and you can use
any combination of them.

I laughed out loud when I read on the Invisible Things Labs' Blog that Xen
is "only" a "few hundreds of thousands of lines of code."[1] Sure, this is
small compared to most modern monolithic desktop OSes, but it's not
particularly small compared to a stripped down Linux kernel build, and it's
absolutely gigantic compared to a modern microkernel. The Nova
Microhypervisor and seL4 are each about 9000 SLOC.
But when I shared this disbelief with a couple of friends who at least have
a passing understanding of computer security, each of them just shrugged.
And of course both Nova and seL4 have had a lot of trouble gaining any kind
of foothold in the market.
Am I completely off base in thinking that it should be self-evident that
one should start building any secure system by minimizing the size of their
trusted computing base? Or is the issue that applications are still the
source of most vulnerabilities, so it's premature to try to make the kernel
super secure? Or that there are too many ways to violate isolation in a
microkernel by compromising shared server processes?
I ask because I am wondering if I should "learn to stop worrying and love
the bomb" and (re-)embrace Xen and/or Linux, or if I should continue
pursuing some approach along the lines of seL4/Nova/Genode for building
secure systems?

Thanks for your reply.
On Wed, Feb 10, 2016 at 7:00 PM Peter Gutmann This is my general experience with programming, yes, though it is somewhat
orthogonal to security.
It makes it someone else's problem *in userspace*. Linux supports all that
stuff, but it does so *in kernel space*. And while seL4 and Nova don't
address device drivers, Genode does, by reimplementing the Linux (and
NetBSD, and OpenBSD, and FreeBSD) kernel interfaces (yes, I know in the
Linux case this is a moving target, but Linux has a LOT of drivers, so even
if you're stuck to a narrow range of versions, you can still get a lot of
mileage out of this approach) and then running each driver as a separate
server process.
I'm not talking about raw size or complexity here; obviously having lots of
features and support for lots of devices means high complexity, but it
doesn't require that all that complexity run with full system privileges.

way the fictitious principal in this speech does. When people stand along
the street at Cinco de Mayo celebrations and wave American flags, as they
did this year in a small town near where I live, what they're saying is "My
own sense of identity is so weak that I can't handle other people
expressing identities that are significantly different from mine." Those

I think the answer is that they're difficult subjects to address. People
generally prefer to address issues they think they understand. Not to
excuse it; it's something everyone needs to work on, but it's going to take
some time. There's also the self-selection effect where most of those who
"roast you in words, with glee" differ from trolls only that they seek out
some form of legitimacy for their trolling. It seems to me that a far
better way to deal with "anti-social communication" would be to ignore it
and encourage others to do so if it's trolling, or to privately reach out
to the person to try to help them understand why their method of
communication is counterproductive, if it seems like they can be gotten
through to.
To be fair, none of us is going to kidnap you and throw you in a cage, nor
shoot you, nor blow you up with a nuclear weapon. There are degrees of
bully. Though I think it would be more appropriate to describe government
as "a home for kidnappers, murderers, and thieves masquerading as a
collective defense."
Yep. Trolling is a problem in any public community. The best way to make
trolls go away if there is no active moderation is to ignore them, but that
requires encouraging those who respond to them to avoid doing so in the
future. IOW, you need leadership regardless of whether you have moderation
for a community to thrive. Moreso, in the absense of moderation.
In crypto-anarchy generally, yes. In this particular community, well, like
in any community it's going to take hard work.
Indeed. I thought this was a crypto-anarchist community, not a space for
social inepts to come where they don't have to take responsibility for

Indeed. Having a spotter there is probably the best solution.
This is why you use an attenuator. I wouldn't think law enforcement DF
equipment would be fooled by such a thing, since for example FCC will often
be looking for people who are outputting too much power, which on the ham
bands is going to be multiple kilowatts (I think they've mostly given up on
CB except when it starts interfering with licensed users).
Perhaps, but I'm not about to suggest that anyone break the law.
How do you train out of band? By modelling the environment? That's an
interesting thought, and I suspect Google Earth has enough data to be able
to do it in a lot of places. Are you aware of free or inexpensive software
packages for doing this?
Aren't you just talking phased array for something like this though? Or do
you mean using phase information from the receive antennas to reconstruct
the environment rather than using phasing at the transmit side to steer
your beam? That's a very interesting idea since it can give you a 360
degree view with no need to steer your beam, in the same way that some
blind humans can use clicks to get a picture of their entire environment.
(I use humans and not bats because I think bat sonar is pretty directional,
whereas human ears can localize sound quite precisely without any need to
turn one's head.)

I used to feel like things were getting worse and worse, but then I
remember the world wars and the alien & sedition acts and Jim Crow. Well,
not directly, but you know what I mean. During WWII it was not permissible
to speak out against the war; you'd be considered to be aiding the enemy. I
think it was worse in Europe than in the US, but still. There was a time
when a majority of American men in a certain age range were veterans. Now
they're a tiny minority. It allows a much greater diversity of thought.

That movement is lasting echos of the closing of the frontier, at least
according to Dan Carlin (and his explanation seems compelling). You can
blame Teddy Roosevelt.
But this is a question I often think about myself. At least in Germany's
case, there was certainly a major trait that was visible from the outside:
crushing debt and economic malaise the country had no way of digging itself
out of. Massive national humiliation. Greece is in a similar situation
today, and Russia seems not far behind. An American political colloquialism
comes to mind: "It's the economy, stupid!"
Which brings us back around to the paragraph you quoted: there was a
revolution because people's needs were not being met. There is no guarantee
that a revolution will wind up with something better than the thing that
caused it. Especially since revolutions are typically driven by a tiny
minority, with the majority being incited by whatever it takes to motivate
them, typically lots of bogus conspiracy theories. Even the American
Revolution was this way, with a large fraction of the populace believing
there was a conspiracy in England to "enslave" the colonies.
I think you will always hear this from authority. It is "blame the victim"
plain and simple. And if you consider the authority legitimate and "just
doing their job," is it not true? The insidious thing about it is that it
presupposes that legitimacy.
how far must this corruption spread before it cannot be stopped
Good question. I was just talking about a related topic recently with some
coworkers: revolutions seem to happen when they are closest to being
unnecessary, otherwise they wouldn't be possible. So I think the answer is
that for corruption to spread that far, it must be pervasive throughout
society, not through some separate thing called "the State." Which means if
the State is really that corrupt, revolution may well be impossible, and
the only solution may be war by other states. Instead, revolution will
happen not because the State is extremely corrupt, since that would require
a corrupt society, but because it is weak and the people perceive it as
can the tools of technology and manufactured consent provide the state
Hmm. I think the notion that the State and the public are not truly
separate applies here as well. So it's not so much that it wouldn't be
detected as that the corruption would encompass all of society.

Yep, a dead-man switch of some kind is a good idea regardless of what other
techniques you're using.
Sure, but if you have a very long (or effectively infinite) PN sequence,
your carrier needs to be structured enough to recover some large counter.
GPS qualifies, as probably does WWV and its non-US brethren.
Sure, if you don't care about MIMO, there are lots of ways to steer your
beam using relatively cheap circuitry. You can have multiple
transmit/receive antennas and just adjust their relative phase. AIUI this
is how the LoJack locators operate. Switching reflectors on and off
independently as you suggest here would allow multiple beams, though their
relative phase would not be adjustable. It all goes toward the goal of
minimizing the amount of energy you emit that isn't directed toward the
receiver, though.

@_subject: [Fwd: Multiple Internets] 
Interesting. I would have thought wired for longer distance communication,
with local mesh networks for the "last mile."
Do you have some thoughts on how to set up a local wired freenet? Back in
the days of modems over content-oblivious phone lines, freenets were easy
because phone lines in bulk were pretty cheap per line, and pretty much
everyone had a land line. In this day and age of video and high-resolution
images, that no longer seems like an option.
Whenever I think of "mesh" I think "mobile mesh," which is just part of the
picture. The mesh networks I've actually seen in action are static
"meshes", which are only really called that because the ISP puts
omnidirectional antennas on some of their customers' roofs to daisy-chain
other customers off of, not because they use any kind of dynamic mesh
routing protocol. This approach might actually work for setting up a
freenet: negotiate directly with local businesses (particularly public
places like coffee shops) and residents to set up local hotspots, then put
up high-gain directional and omnidirectional antennas on a different band
or at least channel to handle the longer distance links.
Of course, the businesses/residents involved are probably going to be
primarily interested in access to the "regular" Internet, but that doesn't
stop you from using strong encryption on the links themselves, tunnelling
onion/mixnet networks, offering local services in private IP space, etc.
Over time, you can replace tunnels over the government-controlled Internet
with wireless links or leased lines with strong crypto. It won't stop the
network from getting shut down if the links are specifically cataloged and
targeted, but it seems like current "internet kill switch" proposals
primarily focus on the layer 3 infrastructure, not on the link or physical
layers. And certainly not on RF.
But even if you do that, if you are offering a "public" service, and you
actually get a lot of users, it seems likely you'd end up being a victim of
your own success, noticed by regulators and then forced to comply with the
same regulations that cover the Internet, including any retention and "kill
switch" requirements. You might be able to mitigate some of that by
encouraging mac address spoofing and end-to-end encryption, but that
doesn't stop a government from taking over one of the local services and
putting a gag order on the operator, then tracking someone to a specific
coffee shop and sneaking up behind them and pinning their arms to their
sides so they can't wipe their machine. Having a dead man switch/"panic
button" on any local servers, routers, etc might help with that,
particularly if there's plausible deniability there. "Sorry, can't comply
with your retention order because our hard disk just died and it's going to
take us months to get the server back online." It works for the Chicago PD
with their constantly "malfunctioning" dashcams, so why not for us?
One side benefit of bringing back freenets in a big way might be the
ability to push back against regulations that have compliance costs. If a
bunch of people voters care about are dependent for their Internet access
on freenets that would have to shut down if they are required to retain
logs for years and set up systems for easy law enforcement access,
politicians might think twice about pushing for such things. Provided they
can't get away with characterizing freenets as dens of "hackers", drug
dealers, terrorists, and child pornographers of course. Which is why it's
important to remain connected with society and not become hermits hiding
out in Internet backwaters.
There's always more social/community-oriented solutions ala Max Hernandez's
Thieves Emporium where you have secret access points and people need to be
vouched in, but that is incredibly hard and would likely remain quite
small, because the probability of infiltration approaches 100% once you get
into the thousands of participants. And of course, if it's small and
secret, nobody will notice when it and its operators/users quietly get
Obviously these approaches are orthogonal to one another, and you can use
any combination of them.

I laughed out loud when I read on the Invisible Things Labs' Blog that Xen
is "only" a "few hundreds of thousands of lines of code."[1] Sure, this is
small compared to most modern monolithic desktop OSes, but it's not
particularly small compared to a stripped down Linux kernel build, and it's
absolutely gigantic compared to a modern microkernel. The Nova
Microhypervisor and seL4 are each about 9000 SLOC.
But when I shared this disbelief with a couple of friends who at least have
a passing understanding of computer security, each of them just shrugged.
And of course both Nova and seL4 have had a lot of trouble gaining any kind
of foothold in the market.
Am I completely off base in thinking that it should be self-evident that
one should start building any secure system by minimizing the size of their
trusted computing base? Or is the issue that applications are still the
source of most vulnerabilities, so it's premature to try to make the kernel
super secure? Or that there are too many ways to violate isolation in a
microkernel by compromising shared server processes?
I ask because I am wondering if I should "learn to stop worrying and love
the bomb" and (re-)embrace Xen and/or Linux, or if I should continue
pursuing some approach along the lines of seL4/Nova/Genode for building
secure systems?

Thanks for your reply.
On Wed, Feb 10, 2016 at 7:00 PM Peter Gutmann This is my general experience with programming, yes, though it is somewhat
orthogonal to security.
It makes it someone else's problem *in userspace*. Linux supports all that
stuff, but it does so *in kernel space*. And while seL4 and Nova don't
address device drivers, Genode does, by reimplementing the Linux (and
NetBSD, and OpenBSD, and FreeBSD) kernel interfaces (yes, I know in the
Linux case this is a moving target, but Linux has a LOT of drivers, so even
if you're stuck to a narrow range of versions, you can still get a lot of
mileage out of this approach) and then running each driver as a separate
server process.
I'm not talking about raw size or complexity here; obviously having lots of
features and support for lots of devices means high complexity, but it
doesn't require that all that complexity run with full system privileges.

way the fictitious principal in this speech does. When people stand along
the street at Cinco de Mayo celebrations and wave American flags, as they
did this year in a small town near where I live, what they're saying is "My
own sense of identity is so weak that I can't handle other people
expressing identities that are significantly different from mine." Those

I think the answer is that they're difficult subjects to address. People
generally prefer to address issues they think they understand. Not to
excuse it; it's something everyone needs to work on, but it's going to take
some time. There's also the self-selection effect where most of those who
"roast you in words, with glee" differ from trolls only that they seek out
some form of legitimacy for their trolling. It seems to me that a far
better way to deal with "anti-social communication" would be to ignore it
and encourage others to do so if it's trolling, or to privately reach out
to the person to try to help them understand why their method of
communication is counterproductive, if it seems like they can be gotten
through to.
To be fair, none of us is going to kidnap you and throw you in a cage, nor
shoot you, nor blow you up with a nuclear weapon. There are degrees of
bully. Though I think it would be more appropriate to describe government
as "a home for kidnappers, murderers, and thieves masquerading as a
collective defense."
Yep. Trolling is a problem in any public community. The best way to make
trolls go away if there is no active moderation is to ignore them, but that
requires encouraging those who respond to them to avoid doing so in the
future. IOW, you need leadership regardless of whether you have moderation
for a community to thrive. Moreso, in the absense of moderation.
In crypto-anarchy generally, yes. In this particular community, well, like
in any community it's going to take hard work.
Indeed. I thought this was a crypto-anarchist community, not a space for
social inepts to come where they don't have to take responsibility for
their complete lack of empathy or even basic consideration for others. But
that's probably an unrealistic expectation given the general state of

Indeed. Having a spotter there is probably the best solution.
This is why you use an attenuator. I wouldn't think law enforcement DF
equipment would be fooled by such a thing, since for example FCC will often
be looking for people who are outputting too much power, which on the ham
bands is going to be multiple kilowatts (I think they've mostly given up on
CB except when it starts interfering with licensed users).
Perhaps, but I'm not about to suggest that anyone break the law.
How do you train out of band? By modelling the environment? That's an
interesting thought, and I suspect Google Earth has enough data to be able
to do it in a lot of places. Are you aware of free or inexpensive software
packages for doing this?
Aren't you just talking phased array for something like this though? Or do
you mean using phase information from the receive antennas to reconstruct
the environment rather than using phasing at the transmit side to steer
your beam? That's a very interesting idea since it can give you a 360
degree view with no need to steer your beam, in the same way that some
blind humans can use clicks to get a picture of their entire environment.
(I use humans and not bats because I think bat sonar is pretty directional,
whereas human ears can localize sound quite precisely without any need to
turn one's head.)

I used to feel like things were getting worse and worse, but then I
remember the world wars and the alien & sedition acts and Jim Crow. Well,
not directly, but you know what I mean. During WWII it was not permissible
to speak out against the war; you'd be considered to be aiding the enemy. I
think it was worse in Europe than in the US, but still. There was a time
when a majority of American men in a certain age range were veterans. Now
they're a tiny minority. It allows a much greater diversity of thought.
Indeed, though I think one should be wary of relativism. Just because
there's worse doesn't make our own system just.

That movement is lasting echos of the closing of the frontier, at least
according to Dan Carlin (and his explanation seems compelling). You can
blame Teddy Roosevelt.
But this is a question I often think about myself. At least in Germany's
case, there was certainly a major trait that was visible from the outside:
crushing debt and economic malaise the country had no way of digging itself
out of. Massive national humiliation. Greece is in a similar situation
today, and Russia seems not far behind. An American political colloquialism
comes to mind: "It's the economy, stupid!"
Which brings us back around to the paragraph you quoted: there was a
revolution because people's needs were not being met. There is no guarantee
that a revolution will wind up with something better than the thing that
caused it. Especially since revolutions are typically driven by a tiny
minority, with the majority being incited by whatever it takes to motivate
them, typically lots of bogus conspiracy theories. Even the American
Revolution was this way, with a large fraction of the populace believing
there was a conspiracy in England to "enslave" the colonies.
I think you will always hear this from authority. It is "blame the victim"
plain and simple. And if you consider the authority legitimate and "just
doing their job," is it not true? The insidious thing about it is that it
presupposes that legitimacy.
how far must this corruption spread before it cannot be stopped
Good question. I was just talking about a related topic recently with some
coworkers: revolutions seem to happen when they are closest to being
unnecessary, otherwise they wouldn't be possible. So I think the answer is
that for corruption to spread that far, it must be pervasive throughout
society, not through some separate thing called "the State." Which means if
the State is really that corrupt, revolution may well be impossible, and
the only solution may be war by other states. Instead, revolution will
happen not because the State is extremely corrupt, since that would require
a corrupt society, but because it is weak and the people perceive it as
can the tools of technology and manufactured consent provide the state
Hmm. I think the notion that the State and the public are not truly
separate applies here as well. So it's not so much that it wouldn't be
detected as that the corruption would encompass all of society.
This is kind of my worst nightmare; that my optimism has been misguided all
this time. I wrote a post on liberty.me about how to deal with an
invincible adversary that may be relevant here:
In the foreward of an obscure book I've started reading, The Omega Seed by
Paolo Soleri, the foreward author talks about how the Christians, instead
of continually trying to fight ineffectual revolts against the Romans as
their Jewish forebears had, instead focused on building communities. I
think we need to focus not only on building communities where we're
connected to one another, but where we're strongly connected to people
around us who may not share our exact beliefs. However you might feel about
cops, for example, if you're friendly with the cops in your community,
they're much less likely to be willing to lock you up and throw away the
key on false pretenses. Even if they know your general beliefs about cops.
Being connected to people makes it much harder for them to believe bullshit
about you. For that reason I doubt I'll be remaining on liberty.me much
longer. I don't want to live in an echo chamber.

Yep, a dead-man switch of some kind is a good idea regardless of what other
techniques you're using.
Sure, but if you have a very long (or effectively infinite) PN sequence,
your carrier needs to be structured enough to recover some large counter.
GPS qualifies, as probably does WWV and its non-US brethren.
Sure, if you don't care about MIMO, there are lots of ways to steer your
beam using relatively cheap circuitry. You can have multiple
transmit/receive antennas and just adjust their relative phase. AIUI this
is how the LoJack locators operate. Switching reflectors on and off
independently as you suggest here would allow multiple beams, though their
relative phase would not be adjustable. It all goes toward the goal of
minimizing the amount of energy you emit that isn't directed toward the
receiver, though.

Interesting. I would have thought wired for longer distance communication,
with local mesh networks for the "last mile."
Do you have some thoughts on how to set up a local wired freenet? Back in
the days of modems over content-oblivious phone lines, freenets were easy
because phone lines in bulk were pretty cheap per line, and pretty much
everyone had a land line. In this day and age of video and high-resolution
images, that no longer seems like an option.
Whenever I think of "mesh" I think "mobile mesh," which is just part of the
picture. The mesh networks I've actually seen in action are static
"meshes", which are only really called that because the ISP puts
omnidirectional antennas on some of their customers' roofs to daisy-chain
other customers off of, not because they use any kind of dynamic mesh
routing protocol. This approach might actually work for setting up a
freenet: negotiate directly with local businesses (particularly public
places like coffee shops) and residents to set up local hotspots, then put
up high-gain directional and omnidirectional antennas on a different band
or at least channel to handle the longer distance links.
Of course, the businesses/residents involved are probably going to be
primarily interested in access to the "regular" Internet, but that doesn't
stop you from using strong encryption on the links themselves, tunnelling
onion/mixnet networks, offering local services in private IP space, etc.
Over time, you can replace tunnels over the government-controlled Internet
with wireless links or leased lines with strong crypto. It won't stop the
network from getting shut down if the links are specifically cataloged and
targeted, but it seems like current "internet kill switch" proposals
primarily focus on the layer 3 infrastructure, not on the link or physical
layers. And certainly not on RF.
But even if you do that, if you are offering a "public" service, and you
actually get a lot of users, it seems likely you'd end up being a victim of
your own success, noticed by regulators and then forced to comply with the
same regulations that cover the Internet, including any retention and "kill
switch" requirements. You might be able to mitigate some of that by
encouraging mac address spoofing and end-to-end encryption, but that
doesn't stop a government from taking over one of the local services and
putting a gag order on the operator, then tracking someone to a specific
coffee shop and sneaking up behind them and pinning their arms to their
sides so they can't wipe their machine. Having a dead man switch/"panic
button" on any local servers, routers, etc might help with that,
particularly if there's plausible deniability there. "Sorry, can't comply
with your retention order because our hard disk just died and it's going to
take us months to get the server back online." It works for the Chicago PD
with their constantly "malfunctioning" dashcams, so why not for us?
One side benefit of bringing back freenets in a big way might be the
ability to push back against regulations that have compliance costs. If a
bunch of people voters care about are dependent for their Internet access
on freenets that would have to shut down if they are required to retain
logs for years and set up systems for easy law enforcement access,
politicians might think twice about pushing for such things. Provided they
can't get away with characterizing freenets as dens of "hackers", drug
dealers, terrorists, and child pornographers of course. Which is why it's
important to remain connected with society and not become hermits hiding
out in Internet backwaters.
There's always more social/community-oriented solutions ala Max Hernandez's
Thieves Emporium where you have secret access points and people need to be
vouched in, but that is incredibly hard and would likely remain quite
small, because the probability of infiltration approaches 100% once you get
into the thousands of participants. And of course, if it's small and
secret, nobody will notice when it and its operators/users quietly get
Obviously these approaches are orthogonal to one another, and you can use
any combination of them.

There are villages in Africa that send and receive email using a similar

I laughed out loud when I read on the Invisible Things Labs' Blog that Xen
is "only" a "few hundreds of thousands of lines of code."[1] Sure, this is
small compared to most modern monolithic desktop OSes, but it's not
particularly small compared to a stripped down Linux kernel build, and it's
absolutely gigantic compared to a modern microkernel. The Nova
Microhypervisor and seL4 are each about 9000 SLOC.
But when I shared this disbelief with a couple of friends who at least have
a passing understanding of computer security, each of them just shrugged.
And of course both Nova and seL4 have had a lot of trouble gaining any kind
of foothold in the market.
Am I completely off base in thinking that it should be self-evident that
one should start building any secure system by minimizing the size of their
trusted computing base? Or is the issue that applications are still the
source of most vulnerabilities, so it's premature to try to make the kernel
super secure? Or that there are too many ways to violate isolation in a
microkernel by compromising shared server processes?
I ask because I am wondering if I should "learn to stop worrying and love
the bomb" and (re-)embrace Xen and/or Linux, or if I should continue
pursuing some approach along the lines of seL4/Nova/Genode for building
secure systems?

Thanks for your reply.
On Wed, Feb 10, 2016 at 7:00 PM Peter Gutmann This is my general experience with programming, yes, though it is somewhat
orthogonal to security.
It makes it someone else's problem *in userspace*. Linux supports all that
stuff, but it does so *in kernel space*. And while seL4 and Nova don't
address device drivers, Genode does, by reimplementing the Linux (and
NetBSD, and OpenBSD, and FreeBSD) kernel interfaces (yes, I know in the
Linux case this is a moving target, but Linux has a LOT of drivers, so even
if you're stuck to a narrow range of versions, you can still get a lot of
mileage out of this approach) and then running each driver as a separate
server process.
I'm not talking about raw size or complexity here; obviously having lots of
features and support for lots of devices means high complexity, but it
doesn't require that all that complexity run with full system privileges.

@_subject: frustrated with the MSM lately? 
My frustration is primarily with people who think that the US media are
somehow "independent" just because they're not directly funded by the
government. But at least government funded media sources have to work hard
to *appear* independent, because they don't get the presumption of
independence. The result is that you hear BBC asking much harder questions
of MPs than you see asked to, say, the President by US media.
The only real solution is to find sources that truly *are* independent,
because they have no special access, don't embed with military units, don't
get invited to White House press conferences, etc. Find the outfits the
politicians refuse to talk to.
In any case, though, I'm not sure I'd choose Putin as a spokesperson
against sycophantic media. He's just missing the good ol' days when the
government mostly controlled what reached Russians' ears.
There are two sides to every story, but usually both sides are wrong. And
the midpoint between them is wrong too. The real story is off on some axis
perpendicular to the line between the two sides. To paraphrase Chomsky
since I've so far failed to find a quote that concisely sums up the point,
if you want to control what the public thinks, narrowly define the
parameters of the debate and then ensure that there's vigorous debate
within those parameters. This is what the Western MSM vs Russian media
sounds like to me. It's all just nationalistic nonsense.

Agree with the need for decentralized architectures, though ZeroNet is only
part of the way there. It's fine for small, static sites, blogs, and small

individual, and all their data are flooded to all users. We really need a
platform on which to build decentralized apps, more like Freenet or Gnunet.
As for centralization in Tor, it wasn't clear to me from the article that
the related sites were actually legit as opposed to, say, clones. Since
they found sites that only linked among themselves, they must have just
been mass scanning onion addresses. But what we really care about are the
sites a lot of people actually use. For such a purpose, finding and ranking
the sites by spidering from a few well-known seed sites would be more
useful than enumerating all the hidden sites. They talked about a bunch of
sites being hosted by the same hosting provider, but given that they had
identical SSH host keys I'd guess they were all actually the same machine,
since it would be criminally negligent for a hosting provider to use the
same key across all its machines.

@_subject: Litvinenko - Russian demonisation continues to crumble 
I like a lot of what you say, and it's great to read the perspective of
someone who is completely outside the western propaganda-sphere, but I find
your devotion to Putin to be both baffling and concerning. There is simply
no way a former intelligence agent and director of an intelligence agency,
ANY intelligence agency, who then somehow rose all the way to be President
of a large, powerful country is "unimpeachable." The rest of the things you
say about him may well be true, except perhaps for the "better world" part.
Nobody can unilaterally stand for the rest of the world unless they are
willing to collaborate and compromise with a lot of other people.
This is not to say that Putin is any worse than any US leader, of course.
But substantially better? I seriously doubt it. I'd be equally concerned
about any US or European leader who inspired a level of devotion similar to
what Putin inspires in his followers. Of course, it is in large part the
West's fault that Russians look to someone like Putin in the first place.
We failed to dissolve NATO after the USSR collapsed, which is part of a
pattern of the US acting like it "won" the cold war (the same way it thinks
it "won" WWII) and thus now owns the planet.
Agreed, though I am not sure about the "nationalistic" part. Multipolar, as
an acknowledgement that not everyone wants the same thing, but I'd prefer
we were all skeptical of our own nation and accepting of others.
"Major war" in the sense that this may be when the world finally realizes
it is not, in fact, unipolar. Once nations start realising the US cannot
keep its promises to protect them, they will start looking elsewhere and
taking more responsibility for their own defense. I feel like the US's
turning to Iran for help with Daesh, along with asking countries to
continue to invest more in their own militaries, is a pretty strong
indication that the US realizes this is happening and that many here are
actually willing to accept that fact. But this is by no means a popular
view here, with both Trump and Clinton promising in their own ways to "make
America great again". I'd prefer "Make America part of the world for the
first time."
I imagine there are those in the US who would welcome a new cold war. They
are obviously trying to create (have created) a new one. It seems like
there's a pretty big risk of taking us back to a bipolar world rather than
a unipolar one.
Not sure I buy this particular theory, considering how strongly GWB pushed
for the invasion from his first day of office. I think it comes down to
simple revenge for the plot to assassinate his father.
Oil is obviously strategic, but I think you overestimate the US's belief in
the risk of the decline of the petrodollar. I think the US convinced Saudi
Arabia to keep pumping despite declining oil prices in order to weaken
Russia economically while propping up its own flagging, net-oil-importing
economy. This plan only works in the short term, though, and it will end up
making Russia stronger in the long term, since Russians aren't idiots and
will diversify. I think Putin's decision to ditch tech and focus
exclusively on energy was a huge mistake that made it more vulnerable to
this strategy than it would have been otherwise, but there is still time to
reverse that mistake.
I don't have a strong opinion on this, other than that it is a matter of
opinion. You request facts, and you state a couple, but you actually need
references. And even with references, accepting bribes is not the only form
of corruption. I consider benefiting from bad things done on your behalf,
even when you did not order them, to also be a form of corruption if you do
not denounce them, investigate them, prosecute them, etc.
It is always true of politicians and cops that it's very hard to point to a
specific evil thing they did. After all, if you could prove it, they would
have been impeached, no?
Well, if it passes, you can always hope the various western countries pass
similar laws. I don't think the US is likely to succeed, but you never
know. The FBI keeps hammering on this "going dark" bullshit.
I don't think the USG has a single intention. But at best, they have
seriously underestimated Russia and been incredibly disrespectful toward
them. But it does seem plausible to me that there are elements in the US
government who wish to pull all of Russia's old partners away to isolate
them. Which seems idiotic to me.
I certainly won't attempt to dispute it. Just the part about Russia's or
Putin's ambitions being particularly pure.
Politicians are never "really fine humans." But I have no doubt that Putin
loves Russia and wants to make it great again. But I have similarly little
doubt that Donald Trump loves America and wants to make it great again. The
devil is in the details.
Perhaps their current leader is pretty damn great, by any and all
Maybe, compared to other politicians.

The Chinese are pro-China, but they recognize that the US is a very large
market for Chinese goods, and for now their economy is built on exports.
Whatever they may think of the US or Europe, our fortunes are tied together
by trade unless/until they decide to become "self-sufficient," which works
both ways. When this starts to happen, war may not be too far behind.
Exactly. But yeah, 7%. They may be the largest FOREIGN debt holder, which
I'm pretty sure is what Trump actually means.
Yep, just bookkeeping tricks. But yeah, didn't protect the banks back in
the days (1990s) when they weren't allowed to branch across state lines,
were required to hold a large fraction of their debt in their own state's
bonds, and states kept defaulting. And it means a US government "default"
will have interesting consequences.
Not even really stealing. The Chinese people already paid for it by keeping
their goods cheap for us 'muricans. They're basically American taxpayers
for all intents and purposes.
It's hard to blame Trump for believing that the problem with the national
debt is that the US owes a bunch of people money, and therefore the
solution is to negotiate some sort of settlement whereby the US pays less
than face value on its debt. But not blaming him and thinking he's
qualified to be President with such a view are completely separate things.
The problem is not that the US has too much debt. The problem is that the
US is running out of credit. And by "credit" I mean generically *trust.* No
negotiated settlement can recover lost credit. Quite the contrary; if the
US is going to saber-rattle in order to avoid paying what it's promised to
pay despite having its debts denominated in its own currency, that can only
hurt the US's credit with other countries.
Debt is also not the only promise the US federal government, to say nothing
of state and local governments, have made that they are going to have
trouble keeping. There's a bunch of other mandatory spending that's growing
every year faster than GDP with no plan to reduce it: pension obligations,
social security, medicare, welfare. 2/3 of the Federal budget is mandatory
spending. Half of discretionary spending would have to be cut in order to
balance the budget. Half of discretionary spending goes to the military.
And of course, huge cuts like that will also cut into revenue, at least in
the short term, while doing nothing to actually reduce the governments'
unfunded liabilities.
That said, the US is actually in fantastic shape compared to most of the
"developed" world. So interest rates remain low for the US because it's the
nicest house in a really shitty neighborhood. Dark times are ahead for the
entire developed world unless economic growth rates come up quite a bit.

agencies have privileged standing in US law; many entities, in particular
government pension plans, are only allowed to invest in "investment grade"

set of corporations. Given that they're paid by the people selling the

I am pretty sure I understand your position, and I'm sympathetic to it, but
as an unpatriotic (in the sense that I do not support the government and I
feel physically ill when I see people waving flags) American, I'm afraid
that swapping America for Russia helps me see it better.
I think this points out a fundamental flaw in the Olympics, and in fact in
the entire international system: Individuals do not exist as entities in
the international system. There is absolutely nothing democratic about the
Olympics. The games exist to glorify states over individuals. The Western
media do highlight superstars, but for the most part only American athletes
get highlighted in the US.
I gave up on the Olympics years ago. It is a fundamentally corrupt and
hypocritical institution. And as you can see, it's being used as a tool of
the West to try to punish Russia.
So I totally agree with you, that's not the way a democratic world should
work. But I'd add that the Olympics are not the way a democratic world
should work. In a democratic system, states exist to serve the people. They
should be at the bottom, not at the top.
I agree, though I think most people have always just followed the herd.
Most people have always thought "rule of law" has meant "order", and that a
powerful government unconstrained itself by law, as long as it was tying to
do "the right thing" was the way to maintain "rule of law." Never mind that
precisely the opposite is true.
Which means the line has been being held by... what, exactly? Inertia,
probably. The West has been essentially coasting on the inertia of WWII and
then on the Cold War, which kept lots of people employed in a system that
is unsuited to anything but mass construction for mass destruction. The old
corporate/crony capitalist system is breaking down because the only thing
it's good for is war. The "war on terror" is the wrong kind of war to keep
it going, because high tech weapons are for the most part useless.
Terrorism requires political, policy, *human* solutions. But the system is
not evolved to put the kind of people in power who are capable of creating
those kinds of solutions.
Ironically, as undemocratic as it was, the system that existed in Europe
prior to WWI was probably better suited to small scale conflicts than our
current system. The French Revolution introduced the concept of "total war"
to Europe, and the old system was not adapted to that.
Now "total war" would likely destroy us all, but we're also pretty shitty
at small scale wars. As you've said before, we need to have a multipolar
system again. Such a system would reward diplomacy over saber-rattling.
Doesn't matter so much if there's still a lot of tension, as long as it
doesn't escalate to war. As long as individuals don't get too caught up in
the tension, because the only reason to have states in the first place is
to let individuals conduct their lives in relative stability and peace.

In '93 when WfWG 3.11 came out and even in '98, Linux was basically a
hobbyist OS. Nowadays the problem isn't the OS but the applications. If
you're just using a web browser, it's not a problem, but that's essentially
what ChromeOS is from the perspective of the average user, and Android is
rapidly filling that space and has plenty of applications.
Which brings up an interesting point more relevant to the original topic,
which is that to have any amount of security you really need to know what
you're doing. I'm not holding my breath for the government to do anything
about that besides exploit it to increase its own power and spy on us.
The first thing that should come to one's mind when thinking of
government's relationship to private industry and cybersecurity is AT&T's
(and others) cooperation with the NSA and the government's subsequent
shielding of them from any liability for it. That which is permitted
rapidly becomes mandatory when government has all kinds of extra laws it

It's not entirely clear that it's even legal in the US to force
backdoors/key escrow/etc. And even if it is, the USG seems to prefer more
subtle means of control. Forcing key escrow or backdoors is something of a
sledgehammer, and it gets a LOT of attention from civil libertarians.
Also, I think Apple has had a hand in keeping it from happening. They have
a lot of influence (read: money to pay for lobbyists and donate to
political campaigns), and their whole business model is built on not having
access to your data, to distinguish themselves from Google, which gets a
large fraction of its income from serving targeted ads. Facebook and Google
are starting to do end-to-end, but both companies seem a bit more hesitant
about it. I suspect WhatsApp did it in part to hold Facebook to their word
that they would never scan private messages for ad targeting purposes, and
FB Messenger end-to-end is opt-in AIUI. But even if a ban on end-to-end
might slightly benefit each company by giving them an excuse for retaining
access, the USG seems to prefer key escrow, which doesn't benefit them at
all while creating an additional cost.
Personally I'm a bit conflicted over the whole thing. Pragmatically, not
morally. A ban on end-to-end or even forced key escrow would push the more
idealistic people to start working on and using better open source
solutions. One should not trust any crypto that can be turned off silently

My frustration is primarily with people who think that the US media are
somehow "independent" just because they're not directly funded by the
government. But at least government funded media sources have to work hard
to *appear* independent, because they don't get the presumption of
independence. The result is that you hear BBC asking much harder questions
of MPs than you see asked to, say, the President by US media.
The only real solution is to find sources that truly *are* independent,
because they have no special access, don't embed with military units, don't
get invited to White House press conferences, etc. Find the outfits the
politicians refuse to talk to.
In any case, though, I'm not sure I'd choose Putin as a spokesperson
against sycophantic media. He's just missing the good ol' days when the
government mostly controlled what reached Russians' ears.
There are two sides to every story, but usually both sides are wrong. And
the midpoint between them is wrong too. The real story is off on some axis
perpendicular to the line between the two sides. To paraphrase Chomsky
since I've so far failed to find a quote that concisely sums up the point,
if you want to control what the public thinks, narrowly define the
parameters of the debate and then ensure that there's vigorous debate
within those parameters. This is what the Western MSM vs Russian media
sounds like to me. It's all just nationalistic nonsense.

Agree with the need for decentralized architectures, though ZeroNet is only

individual, and all their data are flooded to all users. We really need a
platform on which to build decentralized apps, more like Freenet or Gnunet.
As for centralization in Tor, it wasn't clear to me from the article that
the related sites were actually legit as opposed to, say, clones. Since
they found sites that only linked among themselves, they must have just
been mass scanning onion addresses. But what we really care about are the
sites a lot of people actually use. For such a purpose, finding and ranking
the sites by spidering from a few well-known seed sites would be more
useful than enumerating all the hidden sites. They talked about a bunch of
sites being hosted by the same hosting provider, but given that they had
identical SSH host keys I'd guess they were all actually the same machine,
since it would be criminally negligent for a hosting provider to use the
same key across all its machines.

I like a lot of what you say, and it's great to read the perspective of
someone who is completely outside the western propaganda-sphere, but I find
your devotion to Putin to be both baffling and concerning. There is simply
no way a former intelligence agent and director of an intelligence agency,
ANY intelligence agency, who then somehow rose all the way to be President
of a large, powerful country is "unimpeachable." The rest of the things you
say about him may well be true, except perhaps for the "better world" part.
Nobody can unilaterally stand for the rest of the world unless they are
willing to collaborate and compromise with a lot of other people.
This is not to say that Putin is any worse than any US leader, of course.
But substantially better? I seriously doubt it. I'd be equally concerned
about any US or European leader who inspired a level of devotion similar to
what Putin inspires in his followers. Of course, it is in large part the
West's fault that Russians look to someone like Putin in the first place.
We failed to dissolve NATO after the USSR collapsed, which is part of a
pattern of the US acting like it "won" the cold war (the same way it thinks
it "won" WWII) and thus now owns the planet.
Agreed, though I am not sure about the "nationalistic" part. Multipolar, as
an acknowledgement that not everyone wants the same thing, but I'd prefer
we were all skeptical of our own nation and accepting of others.
"Major war" in the sense that this may be when the world finally realizes
it is not, in fact, unipolar. Once nations start realising the US cannot
keep its promises to protect them, they will start looking elsewhere and
taking more responsibility for their own defense. I feel like the US's
turning to Iran for help with Daesh, along with asking countries to
continue to invest more in their own militaries, is a pretty strong
indication that the US realizes this is happening and that many here are
actually willing to accept that fact. But this is by no means a popular
view here, with both Trump and Clinton promising in their own ways to "make
America great again". I'd prefer "Make America part of the world for the
first time."
I imagine there are those in the US who would welcome a new cold war. They
are obviously trying to create (have created) a new one. It seems like
there's a pretty big risk of taking us back to a bipolar world rather than
a unipolar one.
Not sure I buy this particular theory, considering how strongly GWB pushed
for the invasion from his first day of office. I think it comes down to
simple revenge for the plot to assassinate his father.
Oil is obviously strategic, but I think you overestimate the US's belief in
the risk of the decline of the petrodollar. I think the US convinced Saudi
Arabia to keep pumping despite declining oil prices in order to weaken
Russia economically while propping up its own flagging, net-oil-importing
economy. This plan only works in the short term, though, and it will end up
making Russia stronger in the long term, since Russians aren't idiots and
will diversify. I think Putin's decision to ditch tech and focus
exclusively on energy was a huge mistake that made it more vulnerable to
this strategy than it would have been otherwise, but there is still time to
reverse that mistake.
I don't have a strong opinion on this, other than that it is a matter of
opinion. You request facts, and you state a couple, but you actually need
references. And even with references, accepting bribes is not the only form
of corruption. I consider benefiting from bad things done on your behalf,
even when you did not order them, to also be a form of corruption if you do
not denounce them, investigate them, prosecute them, etc.
It is always true of politicians and cops that it's very hard to point to a
specific evil thing they did. After all, if you could prove it, they would
have been impeached, no?
Well, if it passes, you can always hope the various western countries pass
similar laws. I don't think the US is likely to succeed, but you never
know. The FBI keeps hammering on this "going dark" bullshit.
I don't think the USG has a single intention. But at best, they have
seriously underestimated Russia and been incredibly disrespectful toward
them. But it does seem plausible to me that there are elements in the US
government who wish to pull all of Russia's old partners away to isolate
them. Which seems idiotic to me.
I certainly won't attempt to dispute it. Just the part about Russia's or
Putin's ambitions being particularly pure.
Politicians are never "really fine humans." But I have no doubt that Putin
loves Russia and wants to make it great again. But I have similarly little
doubt that Donald Trump loves America and wants to make it great again. The
devil is in the details.

The Chinese are pro-China, but they recognize that the US is a very large

Whatever they may think of the US or Europe, our fortunes are tied together
by trade unless/until they decide to become "self-sufficient," which works
both ways. When this starts to happen, war may not be too far behind.
Exactly. But yeah, 7%. They may be the largest FOREIGN debt holder, which
I'm pretty sure is what Trump actually means.
Yep, just bookkeeping tricks. But yeah, didn't protect the banks back in
the days (1990s) when they weren't allowed to branch across state lines,
were required to hold a large fraction of their debt in their own state's
bonds, and states kept defaulting. And it means a US government "default"
will have interesting consequences.
Not even really stealing. The Chinese people already paid for it by keeping
their goods cheap for us 'muricans. They're basically American taxpayers
for all intents and purposes.
It's hard to blame Trump for believing that the problem with the national
debt is that the US owes a bunch of people money, and therefore the
solution is to negotiate some sort of settlement whereby the US pays less
than face value on its debt. But not blaming him and thinking he's
qualified to be President with such a view are completely separate things.
The problem is not that the US has too much debt. The problem is that the
US is running out of credit. And by "credit" I mean generically *trust.* No
negotiated settlement can recover lost credit. Quite the contrary; if the
US is going to saber-rattle in order to avoid paying what it's promised to
pay despite having its debts denominated in its own currency, that can only
hurt the US's credit with other countries.
Debt is also not the only promise the US federal government, to say nothing
of state and local governments, have made that they are going to have
trouble keeping. There's a bunch of other mandatory spending that's growing
every year faster than GDP with no plan to reduce it: pension obligations,
social security, medicare, welfare. 2/3 of the Federal budget is mandatory
spending. Half of discretionary spending would have to be cut in order to
balance the budget. Half of discretionary spending goes to the military.
And of course, huge cuts like that will also cut into revenue, at least in
the short term, while doing nothing to actually reduce the governments'
unfunded liabilities.
That said, the US is actually in fantastic shape compared to most of the
"developed" world. So interest rates remain low for the US because it's the
nicest house in a really shitty neighborhood. Dark times are ahead for the
entire developed world unless economic growth rates come up quite a bit.

Most people have always thought "rule of law" has meant "order", and that a
powerful government unconstrained itself by law, as long as it was tying to
do "the right thing" was the way to maintain "rule of law." Never mind that
precisely the opposite is true.
Which means the line has been being held by... what, exactly? Inertia,
probably. The West has been essentially coasting on the inertia of WWII and
then on the Cold War, which kept lots of people employed in a system that
is unsuited to anything but mass construction for mass destruction. The old
corporate/crony capitalist system is breaking down because the only thing
it's good for is war. The "war on terror" is the wrong kind of war to keep
it going, because high tech weapons are for the most part useless.
Terrorism requires political, policy, *human* solutions. But the system is
not evolved to put the kind of people in power who are capable of creating
those kinds of solutions.
Ironically, as undemocratic as it was, the system that existed in Europe
prior to WWI was probably better suited to small scale conflicts than our
current system. The French Revolution introduced the concept of "total war"
to Europe, and the old system was not adapted to that.
Now "total war" would likely destroy us all, but we're also pretty shitty
at small scale wars. As you've said before, we need to have a multipolar
system again. Such a system would reward diplomacy over saber-rattling.
Doesn't matter so much if there's still a lot of tension, as long as it
doesn't escalate to war. As long as individuals don't get too caught up in
the tension, because the only reason to have states in the first place is
to let individuals conduct their lives in relative stability and peace.

In '93 when WfWG 3.11 came out and even in '98, Linux was basically a
hobbyist OS. Nowadays the problem isn't the OS but the applications. If
you're just using a web browser, it's not a problem, but that's essentially
what ChromeOS is from the perspective of the average user, and Android is
rapidly filling that space and has plenty of applications.
Which brings up an interesting point more relevant to the original topic,
which is that to have any amount of security you really need to know what
you're doing. I'm not holding my breath for the government to do anything
about that besides exploit it to increase its own power and spy on us.
The first thing that should come to one's mind when thinking of
government's relationship to private industry and cybersecurity is AT&T's
(and others) cooperation with the NSA and the government's subsequent
shielding of them from any liability for it. That which is permitted
rapidly becomes mandatory when government has all kinds of extra laws it

it can extend or withdraw as it likes.

It's not entirely clear that it's even legal in the US to force
backdoors/key escrow/etc. And even if it is, the USG seems to prefer more
subtle means of control. Forcing key escrow or backdoors is something of a
sledgehammer, and it gets a LOT of attention from civil libertarians.
Also, I think Apple has had a hand in keeping it from happening. They have
a lot of influence (read: money to pay for lobbyists and donate to
political campaigns), and their whole business model is built on not having
access to your data, to distinguish themselves from Google, which gets a
large fraction of its income from serving targeted ads. Facebook and Google
are starting to do end-to-end, but both companies seem a bit more hesitant
about it. I suspect WhatsApp did it in part to hold Facebook to their word
that they would never scan private messages for ad targeting purposes, and
FB Messenger end-to-end is opt-in AIUI. But even if a ban on end-to-end
might slightly benefit each company by giving them an excuse for retaining
access, the USG seems to prefer key escrow, which doesn't benefit them at
all while creating an additional cost.
Personally I'm a bit conflicted over the whole thing. Pragmatically, not
morally. A ban on end-to-end or even forced key escrow would push the more
idealistic people to start working on and using better open source
solutions. One should not trust any crypto that can be turned off silently

My frustration is primarily with people who think that the US media are
somehow "independent" just because they're not directly funded by the
government. But at least government funded media sources have to work hard
to *appear* independent, because they don't get the presumption of
independence. The result is that you hear BBC asking much harder questions
of MPs than you see asked to, say, the President by US media.
The only real solution is to find sources that truly *are* independent,
because they have no special access, don't embed with military units, don't
get invited to White House press conferences, etc. Find the outfits the
politicians refuse to talk to.
In any case, though, I'm not sure I'd choose Putin as a spokesperson
against sycophantic media. He's just missing the good ol' days when the
government mostly controlled what reached Russians' ears.
There are two sides to every story, but usually both sides are wrong. And
the midpoint between them is wrong too. The real story is off on some axis
perpendicular to the line between the two sides. To paraphrase Chomsky
since I've so far failed to find a quote that concisely sums up the point,
if you want to control what the public thinks, narrowly define the
parameters of the debate and then ensure that there's vigorous debate
within those parameters. This is what the Western MSM vs Russian media
sounds like to me. It's all just nationalistic nonsense.

Agree with the need for decentralized architectures, though ZeroNet is only

individual, and all their data are flooded to all users. We really need a
platform on which to build decentralized apps, more like Freenet or Gnunet.
As for centralization in Tor, it wasn't clear to me from the article that
the related sites were actually legit as opposed to, say, clones. Since
they found sites that only linked among themselves, they must have just
been mass scanning onion addresses. But what we really care about are the
sites a lot of people actually use. For such a purpose, finding and ranking
the sites by spidering from a few well-known seed sites would be more
useful than enumerating all the hidden sites. They talked about a bunch of
sites being hosted by the same hosting provider, but given that they had
identical SSH host keys I'd guess they were all actually the same machine,

I like a lot of what you say, and it's great to read the perspective of
someone who is completely outside the western propaganda-sphere, but I find
your devotion to Putin to be both baffling and concerning. There is simply
no way a former intelligence agent and director of an intelligence agency,
ANY intelligence agency, who then somehow rose all the way to be President
of a large, powerful country is "unimpeachable." The rest of the things you
say about him may well be true, except perhaps for the "better world" part.
Nobody can unilaterally stand for the rest of the world unless they are
willing to collaborate and compromise with a lot of other people.
This is not to say that Putin is any worse than any US leader, of course.
But substantially better? I seriously doubt it. I'd be equally concerned
about any US or European leader who inspired a level of devotion similar to
what Putin inspires in his followers. Of course, it is in large part the
West's fault that Russians look to someone like Putin in the first place.
We failed to dissolve NATO after the USSR collapsed, which is part of a
pattern of the US acting like it "won" the cold war (the same way it thinks
it "won" WWII) and thus now owns the planet.
Agreed, though I am not sure about the "nationalistic" part. Multipolar, as
an acknowledgement that not everyone wants the same thing, but I'd prefer
we were all skeptical of our own nation and accepting of others.
"Major war" in the sense that this may be when the world finally realizes
it is not, in fact, unipolar. Once nations start realising the US cannot
keep its promises to protect them, they will start looking elsewhere and
taking more responsibility for their own defense. I feel like the US's
turning to Iran for help with Daesh, along with asking countries to
continue to invest more in their own militaries, is a pretty strong
indication that the US realizes this is happening and that many here are
actually willing to accept that fact. But this is by no means a popular
view here, with both Trump and Clinton promising in their own ways to "make
America great again". I'd prefer "Make America part of the world for the
first time."
I imagine there are those in the US who would welcome a new cold war. They
are obviously trying to create (have created) a new one. It seems like
there's a pretty big risk of taking us back to a bipolar world rather than
a unipolar one.
Not sure I buy this particular theory, considering how strongly GWB pushed
for the invasion from his first day of office. I think it comes down to
simple revenge for the plot to assassinate his father.
Oil is obviously strategic, but I think you overestimate the US's belief in
the risk of the decline of the petrodollar. I think the US convinced Saudi
Arabia to keep pumping despite declining oil prices in order to weaken
Russia economically while propping up its own flagging, net-oil-importing
economy. This plan only works in the short term, though, and it will end up
making Russia stronger in the long term, since Russians aren't idiots and
will diversify. I think Putin's decision to ditch tech and focus
exclusively on energy was a huge mistake that made it more vulnerable to
this strategy than it would have been otherwise, but there is still time to
reverse that mistake.
I don't have a strong opinion on this, other than that it is a matter of
opinion. You request facts, and you state a couple, but you actually need
references. And even with references, accepting bribes is not the only form
of corruption. I consider benefiting from bad things done on your behalf,
even when you did not order them, to also be a form of corruption if you do
not denounce them, investigate them, prosecute them, etc.
It is always true of politicians and cops that it's very hard to point to a
specific evil thing they did. After all, if you could prove it, they would
have been impeached, no?
Well, if it passes, you can always hope the various western countries pass
similar laws. I don't think the US is likely to succeed, but you never
know. The FBI keeps hammering on this "going dark" bullshit.
I don't think the USG has a single intention. But at best, they have
seriously underestimated Russia and been incredibly disrespectful toward
them. But it does seem plausible to me that there are elements in the US
government who wish to pull all of Russia's old partners away to isolate
them. Which seems idiotic to me.
I certainly won't attempt to dispute it. Just the part about Russia's or
Putin's ambitions being particularly pure.
Politicians are never "really fine humans." But I have no doubt that Putin
loves Russia and wants to make it great again. But I have similarly little
doubt that Donald Trump loves America and wants to make it great again. The
devil is in the details.
Perhaps their current leader is pretty damn great, by any and all

Go read up on the election of 1872. The roles of the parties were basically

throwing their support to the nominee of the Liberal Republicans because
they hated Grant so much. Grant himself was surrounded by scandal but still
managed to get the Republican nomination uncontested and then win by a
landslide. I imagine he was more popular than Clinton, but then again
Greeley was undoubtedly far more popular than Trump. As were the two guys

The Chinese are pro-China, but they recognize that the US is a very large
market for Chinese goods, and for now their economy is built on exports.
Whatever they may think of the US or Europe, our fortunes are tied together
by trade unless/until they decide to become "self-sufficient," which works
both ways. When this starts to happen, war may not be too far behind.
Exactly. But yeah, 7%. They may be the largest FOREIGN debt holder, which
I'm pretty sure is what Trump actually means.
Yep, just bookkeeping tricks. But yeah, didn't protect the banks back in
the days (1990s) when they weren't allowed to branch across state lines,
were required to hold a large fraction of their debt in their own state's
bonds, and states kept defaulting. And it means a US government "default"
will have interesting consequences.
Not even really stealing. The Chinese people already paid for it by keeping
their goods cheap for us 'muricans. They're basically American taxpayers
for all intents and purposes.
It's hard to blame Trump for believing that the problem with the national
debt is that the US owes a bunch of people money, and therefore the
solution is to negotiate some sort of settlement whereby the US pays less
than face value on its debt. But not blaming him and thinking he's
qualified to be President with such a view are completely separate things.
The problem is not that the US has too much debt. The problem is that the
US is running out of credit. And by "credit" I mean generically *trust.* No
negotiated settlement can recover lost credit. Quite the contrary; if the
US is going to saber-rattle in order to avoid paying what it's promised to
pay despite having its debts denominated in its own currency, that can only
hurt the US's credit with other countries.
Debt is also not the only promise the US federal government, to say nothing
of state and local governments, have made that they are going to have
trouble keeping. There's a bunch of other mandatory spending that's growing
every year faster than GDP with no plan to reduce it: pension obligations,
social security, medicare, welfare. 2/3 of the Federal budget is mandatory
spending. Half of discretionary spending would have to be cut in order to
balance the budget. Half of discretionary spending goes to the military.
And of course, huge cuts like that will also cut into revenue, at least in
the short term, while doing nothing to actually reduce the governments'
unfunded liabilities.
That said, the US is actually in fantastic shape compared to most of the
"developed" world. So interest rates remain low for the US because it's the
nicest house in a really shitty neighborhood. Dark times are ahead for the
entire developed world unless economic growth rates come up quite a bit.

as an unpatriotic (in the sense that I do not support the government and I
feel physically ill when I see people waving flags) American, I'm afraid
that swapping America for Russia helps me see it better.
I think this points out a fundamental flaw in the Olympics, and in fact in
the entire international system: Individuals do not exist as entities in
the international system. There is absolutely nothing democratic about the
Olympics. The games exist to glorify states over individuals. The Western
media do highlight superstars, but for the most part only American athletes
get highlighted in the US.
I gave up on the Olympics years ago. It is a fundamentally corrupt and
hypocritical institution. And as you can see, it's being used as a tool of
the West to try to punish Russia.
So I totally agree with you, that's not the way a democratic world should
work. But I'd add that the Olympics are not the way a democratic world
should work. In a democratic system, states exist to serve the people. They
should be at the bottom, not at the top.
I agree, though I think most people have always just followed the herd.
Most people have always thought "rule of law" has meant "order", and that a
powerful government unconstrained itself by law, as long as it was tying to
do "the right thing" was the way to maintain "rule of law." Never mind that
precisely the opposite is true.
Which means the line has been being held by... what, exactly? Inertia,
probably. The West has been essentially coasting on the inertia of WWII and
then on the Cold War, which kept lots of people employed in a system that
is unsuited to anything but mass construction for mass destruction. The old
corporate/crony capitalist system is breaking down because the only thing
it's good for is war. The "war on terror" is the wrong kind of war to keep
it going, because high tech weapons are for the most part useless.
Terrorism requires political, policy, *human* solutions. But the system is
not evolved to put the kind of people in power who are capable of creating
those kinds of solutions.
Ironically, as undemocratic as it was, the system that existed in Europe
prior to WWI was probably better suited to small scale conflicts than our
current system. The French Revolution introduced the concept of "total war"
to Europe, and the old system was not adapted to that.
Now "total war" would likely destroy us all, but we're also pretty shitty
at small scale wars. As you've said before, we need to have a multipolar
system again. Such a system would reward diplomacy over saber-rattling.
Doesn't matter so much if there's still a lot of tension, as long as it
doesn't escalate to war. As long as individuals don't get too caught up in
the tension, because the only reason to have states in the first place is
to let individuals conduct their lives in relative stability and peace.

reasonable doubt" is not necessary for "we don't want this person
associated with our project/company/etc". No standard whatsoever is
required for an individual deciding with whom to do business, who to trust
to watch their kids or housesit, etc.

In '93 when WfWG 3.11 came out and even in '98, Linux was basically a
hobbyist OS. Nowadays the problem isn't the OS but the applications. If
you're just using a web browser, it's not a problem, but that's essentially
what ChromeOS is from the perspective of the average user, and Android is
rapidly filling that space and has plenty of applications.
Which brings up an interesting point more relevant to the original topic,
which is that to have any amount of security you really need to know what
you're doing. I'm not holding my breath for the government to do anything
about that besides exploit it to increase its own power and spy on us.
The first thing that should come to one's mind when thinking of
government's relationship to private industry and cybersecurity is AT&T's
(and others) cooperation with the NSA and the government's subsequent
shielding of them from any liability for it. That which is permitted
rapidly becomes mandatory when government has all kinds of extra laws it
can enforce at its own discretion, and privileges like indemnification that
it can extend or withdraw as it likes.

The idea that there "is no Europe" as far as the US is concerned got me
thinking: what does the USG think about Brexit? Despite being an

It's not entirely clear that it's even legal in the US to force
backdoors/key escrow/etc. And even if it is, the USG seems to prefer more
subtle means of control. Forcing key escrow or backdoors is something of a
sledgehammer, and it gets a LOT of attention from civil libertarians.
Also, I think Apple has had a hand in keeping it from happening. They have
a lot of influence (read: money to pay for lobbyists and donate to
political campaigns), and their whole business model is built on not having
access to your data, to distinguish themselves from Google, which gets a
large fraction of its income from serving targeted ads. Facebook and Google
are starting to do end-to-end, but both companies seem a bit more hesitant
about it. I suspect WhatsApp did it in part to hold Facebook to their word
that they would never scan private messages for ad targeting purposes, and
FB Messenger end-to-end is opt-in AIUI. But even if a ban on end-to-end
might slightly benefit each company by giving them an excuse for retaining
access, the USG seems to prefer key escrow, which doesn't benefit them at
all while creating an additional cost.
Personally I'm a bit conflicted over the whole thing. Pragmatically, not
morally. A ban on end-to-end or even forced key escrow would push the more
idealistic people to start working on and using better open source
solutions. One should not trust any crypto that can be turned off silently
with a remote flag flip.

People renting out entire houses as investments on Airbnb are just a

organizations take power away from the rent-seekers and by proxy the
government. Yes they are still centralized and self-interested, but the
real bad guys here are the corrupt city and state governments that are in

Neat! It does seem like you're trading "pollution" of the band for power
consumption, though. Even ignoring the tone generated by the "plugged in
device", which is carrying energy but no information and much of which is
wasted, their modulation technique results in significantly more energy
outside of the passband of the receiver than inside. So overall power
consumption goes way up, even though it's not from the battery-powered
device. And then if a bunch of people start using these, the total amount
of energy you need to pump out will keep getting higher and higher due to
the added interference, which will cause battery powered devices to have to
use more power. Possibly surmountable, but still interesting. I suspect
(and I think you may have had this in mind as well) that backscatter
modulation will end up being more interesting for covert applications,
where you use a tiny device with a tiny (or no) battery that transmits by
reflecting some signal that is already in the environment, like an FM radio
station, and you use a receiver that is designed for receiving the
reflected signal including the "mirror image" and a couple of the extra
harmonics. You could see that as a kind of "free" spread spectrum.

Of course AP can be turned against "honest people." It's a system for
turning money into death without knowing where the money came from. Rich
people make out like bandits in such a system, because they can hire
bodyguards non-anonymously and pay to have their enemies killed anonymously.
Ironically, AP would work best in a society with a high level of wealth
equality. If there's high inequality, it just makes that worse.
And clearly from juan's reply he supports chaos, as long as it's not the

from the status quo to ensure that it keeps enough people happy enough that

The question is always "support" relative to what? I would have to be
convinced that any shift I was to help bring about would be likely to
eventually lead to something better, preferably within our lifetimes.
Making things worse is easy. Making them worse in such a way that they
eventually get better is harder.
Sorry. That's what happens when I try to write out a complicated thought
without going back and reediting multiple times. What I mean is that having
enough people eventually decide that "anything is better than this" serves
as a useful check on those in power. Can't make things too bad or people
band together to bring it down without regard to what follows. No different
from an election where a bunch of people vote for "the other guy" even
though the other guy is totally unqualified, just because they're so
dissatisfied with you, and your own supporters stay home.
Yes. And Brave New World. We're basically in the world depicted by Huxley
already. The thing that struck me most about Brave New World is that none
of the Powers That Be worried about bringing an outsider into the world --
because it was stable! People for the most part liked things the way they
were. That scares me a hell of a lot more than 1984.
I believe the system will bring itself down because the financial system of
the "developed world" is a house of cards. There are hungrier nations that
are far less vulnerable to the "seizing up" the system will experience when
people stop trusting the prices in the market. In order for people to
transact in the marketplace, they have to trust that the prices in the
marketplace are at least somewhat reflective of value. This is why you saw
banks sitting on repossessed houses or holding off on foreclosing on
non-performing mortgages; they believed the government would intervene to
raise prices, so they were waiting for a better deal. But things have only
gotten worse since 2008, and every subsequent intervention will only become
more costly and create ever more perverse incentives.

Well, I meant that I do not support the status quo in the sense of helping
resist any change regardless of the direction. I would only resist change
toward something I felt was worse. And try to help bring about change
toward something I think would be better.
I agree with that. I've been intentionally vague about what "worse" or
"better" means, because frankly I don't really know.
I only meant in the sense that the incumbent usually sees it as a bad thing
when they are thrown out. And it applies to everything, not just democracy.
Even in an absolute dictatorship, it's generally cheaper to control a
population that's reasonably happy than one that's angry.
I think Huxley showed pretty effectively that surveillance is unnecessary
for creating a totalitarian society. In fact, too much of it can rob the
government of the appearance of legitimacy. "Why do you need to spy on your
own citizens?" The US mainly gets away with it in the name of terrorism and
the drug war, and that only goes so far. People will not support
surveillance to enforce laws they don't agree with. Instead, we get
propaganda, bread, and circuses courtesy of capitalism or mercantilism or
whatever you want to call it. The "independent" media still want to get
called on in white house press conferences and invited to embed journalists
with military units. The film industry gets heavy subsidies from various
governments in order to film there, so naturally they're not going to
release anything that embarrasses the government. Just watch the end
credits of a movie sometime and notice how many government entities they
I suspect the surveillance is really about maintaining sufficient fear
among would-be whistleblowers so they don't do things that result in
inconvenient rearrangements of the deck chairs on the Titanic. It's also
about money and keeping the law enforcement/prison industrial complex
well-fed. But I don't think it's about trying to maintain total control as
depicted in 1984. Even without it the system would be doing just fine.
Heck, it *was* doing just fine before mass surveillance was practical.
We'll see how stable it ends up being in reality. Despite the amount of
power the US exercises, it's still possible to escape, particularly for
individuals who aren't already on the government's radar.
True, but it might make it so the US won't be able to spend more money on
its military than the rest of the world combined.
I don't think it says much to have the stock market going up when interest
rates are close to zero or even negative depending on how you look at it.
When there's no money to be made on low-risk investments, naturally
investors are going to invest more in higher risk stuff like stocks. And
whenever the market is going up, the idiot "momentum investors" come out in
force, betting that stocks will do the same thing tomorrow that they did
today. Which causes the stock market to have momentum because people
believe it has momentum, even though there's no other reason for that to be
the case. So you can always assume it will overshoot, and history has shown
it can overshoot by arbitrary amounts and for arbitrary periods of time.
If you haven't watched "The Big Short" I highly recommend it. The huge
amount of time it took between when pretty much everyone knew the housing
market was fucked and when the mortgage-backed securities actually fell in
price is a really good demonstration of how disconnected the financial
markets can be from reality. Pretty much all paper wealth has this problem.
Or you could just watch Wile E Coyote run off cliffs in Road Runner
cartoons. But if he were the stock market he could run halfway to orbit
before realizing he wasn't standing on anything.

I don't think "killing off complainers" really matters that much. You only
have to go after leaders and highly visible figures like Snowden.
More bullets, more bodyguards, better alarm systems, better security
But they don't die as readily as the rest of us. They all get CCWs and
bodyguards and armored cars and on-staff medics to treat bullet wounds
quickly. And they get massive investigations by their local law enforcement
agency of any attack for "free".
This doesn't mean that I object to the current patent system.  In her book
I think she was wrong about it. And even if you support patents generally,
they are heavily abused in their current form and in at least some
industries it's not at all clear whether they are a net benefit. There are
other funding models for research that don't require granting a temporary
monopoly to whoever happens to write down an idea and pay the fee first.
Appeals to authority are perfectly fine in informal discussions. And I can
imagine, at least fuzzily, intellectual property systems that don't rely on
an organization with a monopoly on violence. I suspect that in trying to
set one up the market would demonstrate that it's more expensive than it's
worth, though.
Let me propose an outline of a solution which could square the circle:  At
 Other manufacturers may make products that are made
The voluntary systems I imagine work similarly, though mostly focused
around whether or not one has recourse in particular private court systems.
I am hard pressed to think of any previous system where people all agreed
not to sell that didn't require violence or eventually break down. OPEC has
only worked because it's an extraction industry and its members have mostly
been dictatorships where the dictator or their descendant would likely be
in charge when the oil finally runs out. And it's starting to break down as
Iran starts thinking about being more democratic.
I agree with the last sentence, but a temporary monopoly granted by the
government is not the only way to reward inventors, and people are
constantly inventing things which can easily be copied, which I think goes
to show that you don't have to do *anything* to ensure that inventors are
I think patents may have made more sense when it was much harder for
individuals and small groups to get funding to develop an idea, and the
only people with the resources to develop them were the guilds and
state-sponsored corporations like the East India Company. Patents were a
way to protect the "little guy." Now it's much easier to get your hands on
funding than it was then, whether it's a small business loan, SBIR, venture
or angel capital, or crowdfunding. It makes the "first mover advantage"
much more significant when you can move as fast or even faster than a large
company that has the same idea, and those larger organizations tend to be
risk-averse anyway.
It's quite possible I'm biased from working in Silicon Valley, where most
patents get applied for not for protection from having your idea "stolen,"
but for protection from other patentholders. Or because they're seen as
valuable by potential investors/buyers, but that mostly matters before you
have a customer base and infrastructure.

I think you're reading this in a different way than I intended it. What I
meant was this is why patents got support and why they may have made things
incrementally better, not that there wasn't a better solution possible.
Getting rid of the guilds and government-sponsored corporations for example.
I think I'd need to read examples of small businesses getting financed in
1700. Knowing a number of people who have started small businesses now, it
seems obvious to me that the situation for financing is better now than it
was then. Which is not to say it doesn't still need a lot of improvement

My comments:
I was wondering why you wouldn't simply liquidate a bank for something this
heinous, but then I realized what was probably already obvious to many on
this list: aside from the power of the execs and major shareholders, the
regulators know damn well this practice is rampant. If Wells Fargo got
anywhere near what it deserved for this massive scandal, the regulators
would be risking having to wipe out the entire banking system of the United

Badly formatted paste follows:
*Holy Crap: Wells Fargo Has To Fire 5,300 Employees For *
by Mike Masnick / Sep 9, 2016
This story is crazy. Late yesterday it was revealed that banking giant
Wells Fargo had to fire 5,300 employees over a massive
which those employees created over 2 million fake accounts to stuff with
fees in order to meet their quarterly numbers. The Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau also fined the company $185 million
million to the CFPB, $35 million to the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency and another $50 million to Los Angeles). Oh and it needs to pay
back around $5 million to the customers it screwed over. The CFPB provides
some crazy details:
*Opening deposit accounts and transferring funds without
authorization:* *According
to the bank’s own analysis, employees opened roughly 1.5 million deposit
accounts that may not have been authorized by consumers. Employees then
transferred funds from consumers’ authorized accounts to temporarily fund
the new, unauthorized accounts. This widespread practice gave the employees
credit for opening the new accounts, allowing them to earn additional
compensation and to meet the bank’s sales goals. Consumers, in turn, were
sometimes **harmed** because the bank charged them for **insufficient**
funds or overdraft fees because the money was not in their original
*Applying for credit card accounts without authorization: **According to
the bank’s own analysis, Wells Fargo employees applied for roughly 565,000
credit card accounts that may not have been authorized by consumers. On
those unauthorized credit cards, many consumers incurred annual fees, as
well as associated finance or interest charges and other fees.*
*Issuing and activating debit cards without authorization:* *Wells Fargo
employees requested and issued debit cards without consumers’ knowledge or
consent, going so far as to create PINs without telling consumers.*
*Creating phony email addresses to enroll consumers in online-banking
services:* *Wells Fargo employees created phony email addresses not
belonging to consumers to enroll them in online-banking services without
their knowledge or consent.*
*The thing is, if 5,300 employees were a part of this, this was not some
random **scam**. This was a bank-approved plan to goose their numbers. It
seems like among the 5,300 employees, management should be in serious *
*trouble** as well. What's really astounding about all of this is that it
took this long for the practice to come to light. As the **CFPB** notes,
end users were impacted by this, and you'd think that **complaints** would
have made it clear that this was a problem much sooner. Or is that people
are just so used to getting screwed by their bank that they let it slide?
The CNN report notes that Los Angeles had sued Wells Fargo over this
practice last year (hence LA being a part of the settlement fines), but
having such a widespread **scam** going on is somewhat astounding. *
*And, of course, it raises questions about what other banks are doing
similar things as well. We've seen this kind of activity in the telco space
at times **with**cramming
but that was generally third party scammers, where the **telcos** just
looked the other way. This was full-time Wells Fargo employees doing the *
*scam** itself, and the bank apparently either encouraging it or just
looking the other way from upper management.*

Having used both Gmail and SpamAssassin for filtering mail to this address,
which I've had since 1996, I've found SpamAssassin to be vastly superior in
terms of false positives. Gmail doesn't seem to be that much better in
terms of false negatives even. Pretty disappointing.
I used to have a filter that prevented Gmail from marking cpunks mail as
spam, but I have intentionally avoided fixing that since the list address
changed in hopes of training it not to suck so bad. So far I don't seem to
have had much luck.
One thing I did notice is that by default when you block a sender on Gmail
it sends their messages to the spam folder instead of deleting them, which
could mean its training the spam filter on them as well. If a lot of people
do that, it could cause the spam filter to think other cpunks messages are
also spam instead of just, say, Cypher Piggie's.
The solution for me is going to be to stop using Gmail once I find the time
to set up my scandalous basement server. The easier solution is just to set
up a filter with "never mark as spam" as someone else suggested whom I
would credit by name were I not typing this on my phone in the bathroom.

I'm not sure how manually blocking based on mailing list headers makes any

used to be how cpunks worked when it was distributed, as has been discussed
here recently. The end user was expected to run a spam filter against the
list, subscribe to a filtered mirror, or just put up with it.
Well, the "retards" probably aren't going to care much about a few mailing
list messages being sent to their spam folder erroneously. I can't say I've
actually cared about any of the messages that got sent to spam, I'm just
pedantic about such things. Today, though, the only "false positive" was
someone I would have blocked anyway. So is it really a false positive?

One step closer to everyone ceasing to pretend the Internet is in any way
free or democratic. It was a nice fantasy while it lasted. Even where ISPs
are nominally private, you can't be a licensed user of the airwaves or have
fiber along government right-of-ways and expect not to have the government
impose its own interests on you. I wonder how long it'll be before they
outlaw any kind of overlay network they can't snoop on? I guess that's what
the attempts to outlaw useful crypto are all about. I bet we'll eventually
see warrants to decrypt legal, escrowed crypto envelopes entirely on
suspicion that the user is using a layer of unescrowed crypto inside. Which
will accomplish exactly what the content cartels want by forcing those who
care about privacy into low-bandwidth covert channels while doing nothing
to make it more difficult for genuine criminals to communicate privately.
Maybe it'll be harder to share kiddie porn. But at a huge cost to the

@_subject: Even spookier entangled particles. 
I'm by no means an expert in quantum physics, which makes my lack of
surprise at this fairly uninteresting, but it seems to me these results are
completely compatible with the time-symmetric interpretation of quantum
mechanics. If I understand it correctly, according to TSQM the particle
already "knows" about its future interactions to the extent that quantum
information is preserved through any intervening interactions. So in the
case of photon-splitting, the photons leave their source with polarizations
that are aligned with (or opposite) the axis on which they will be
measured. You could say the information "propagates" in both temporal
directions, but I think it makes more sense to think of the particle's
entire timeline as a single entity.
According to the papers I've read on TSQM, it makes (or made) no
predictions that are different from the Copenhagen interpretation. This
experiment seems like it may be the first to show a difference. Not
necessarily because of any predictions, but because of the additional
mental contortions required to hang on to the Copenhagen interpretation.
There's still no ability to send "real" information faster than light or
backward in time, though. I say this only because of the purported
equivalence between TSQM and Copenhagen, not because I have any idea why it
should be the case. Intuitively, it seems like it could be related to the
(quantum) information-theoretic version of entropy that you get with
reversible computations. Or maybe even just real entropy, since TSQM still
"behaves" as if it's nondeterministic from our perspective, since we can
never know enough about a system to know its "true" internal state. So
somehow everything conspires to prevent us from setting up a system that
would carry some piece of information back in time that we care about.
I guess another way to look at it is that the universe is a solution to
some kind of differential equation. Possible solutions that contain
paradoxes aren't valid, so they don't happen. Not via some shift in some
"unified" timeline ala Star Trek, but through colossal numbers of tiny
shifts that disperse any information that we're trying to send back in time
that would cause any kind of paradox at any scale. The result is a universe
that appears to have an arrow of time at any scale we can actually measure,
appears to mostly follow General Relativity, etc. Until you get to scales,
large and small, where the exact underlying geometry starts to matter.
Come to think of it, if paradoxes are what's important, the ability to send
information back in your own timeline (i.e. within your own past light
cone) is all that matters. If there is no privileged reference frame, this
also means you can't send information into spacelike regions of your own
light cone, because if two entities do that then you can arrange things to
send information into your own past light cone. But if there IS a
privileged reference frame, say, the reference frame of the CMB, where you
can't send information into *its* past light cone, then you can send
information faster than light but still not into your own past. Recall that
the Lorentz transformations were initially introduced to (successfully)
explain how light could appear to always be moving the same speed even with
a luminiferous ether, but then Einstein discarded the luminiferous ether
because he realized it wasn't necessary, not because there was any evidence
that contradicted it.
I may well be misinterpreting what TSQM says, so please don't discard it on
the basis of my uninformed interpretation! Go read up on it and THEN
discard it ;-)

Morally, in my view, one can never be a traitor to the State, because to

incarnate, therefore no truly voluntary agreement with it can exist. If
anything, it is those who act as an instrument of the State who are
traitors against the people they dominate. Which means Trump and Clinton

So what you're saying is that, if you get mugged on the street and the
mugger has a gun to your head, then any attempt to resist the mugger means
you are suicidal, and anyone who tries to help you is dead set on your
destruction? Great logic, there.
One could just as easily turn this around and say that Putin is dead set on
Ukraine's destruction because he won't allow the Ukrainians to determine
their own destiny. Even if you were to assume that all his lies about not
sending in Russian troops and equipment (almost certainly engineered to be
precisely accurate under a very narrow definition of same and only if you
squint in the right way) were true, he is certainly encouraging the Russian
thugs living there to engage in as much violence as possible.
No, this is Putin's baby. He's set it up so that if he can't have Ukraine,
nobody will. And the poor Ukrainians are caught in the middle, just as they
always have been because of their unfortunate geographic situation next to
a violent, ultranationalist neighbor. Violent and ultranationalist
according to Zenaan himself, by the way, who just told us that Putin is the
most moderate person the Russians could have elected.
The US is helping Ukraine because the UKRAINIANS HAVE ASKED FOR HELP. If
the situation is truly as you claim it is, then why isn't it just "better
to die on our feet than live on our knees?" Perhaps the Ukrainians are
simply tired of living in Russia's shadow and are terrified of the
strongman the Russians have elected?
As you know, I'm no fan of US foreign policy, but Russia is no better. As
far as I can tell, you only like them because you hate the US so much, and
the Russians are the only reasonable counterbalance you can think of. I

not because I think the Russians are any better than the US. They're just

The solution in both cases, by the way, is TRADE. When goods cross borders
in sufficient quantities, ICBMs won't. But the Russians seem to want the US

The US is not innocent here, but attempting to play Russia off as "the good

that they're not the US and can form a counterbalance. Which is not exactly

My main objection is that Brin is basically throwing up his hands with
respect to any kind of pushback against surveillance, saying it's
inevitable. I'm not just assuming this from what he's written there,
either; he's commented on my Facebook threads about surveillance by
actually saying we should ignore that stuff and focus on his sousveillance
instead. Though he seems to do a lot of self-promotion on Facebook
generally, so perhaps he's just overdoing it.
But it's not actually true that surveillance is a "done deal" or that we
have no control over the form it takes. We don't have to allow the State to
contract out to private companies for red light cameras and ALPRs and then
let them sell the data to whomever they want. We can force the
implementation of retention & sharing policies. What you don't have can't
be exfiltrated or abused. We may not be able to prevent its being collected
in the first place, but we can sure as hell stop the construction of the
databases, at least where we know about them. And we'll never know about
them if we don't keep paying attention.
The problem is that Brin seems to view this as a fight against the
technology. But it's really a fight against blindly deploying technology
with no thought as to how it's used. We may not be able to stop
surveillance, but there are lots of different ways to bring it into the
light and regulate it where it's deployed by government, and citizen
sousveillance is only a small part of that.

I don't disagree with this, but I will say that I think there are other
equally valid interpretations that don't involve words like "annex", which
I think applies far more to Russia with Crimea than it does to the US
w.r.t. the rest of Ukraine. On the other hand, the main innovation of the

achieves its ends, thus ensuring that one can easily interpret it as not

This is by no means unique or even more prevalent in the United States than
elsewhere. The way for any government to retain its power is by convincing

It's a good question. So far it's been low-hanging fruit: devices people
have intentionally or unintentionally opened to the Internet in order to
make use of them. In this case, webcams, which people open to the Internet
in order to be able to watch their dogs/fish/stepdaughter from the office.
People think their IP is unguessable, or that because there's a password,
it's "secure" even though it's the same password everyone else uses. I
don't know what the vulnerability is in this case, but IoT vulnerabilities
have often been generic vulnerabilities in a widely used piece of open
source software.
Of course, IoT devices (really, any consumer device, versus application
software) are "special" in that the code is often written by outside
contracting houses and security just isn't on the list of requirements. I
recall seeing right in the HTML of a bunch of different consumer wireless
routers a comment saying "Reference code. Do not use in production." It's
quite possible the code HAD been fixed and the Chinese developers just
hadn't realized they should strip out the comment, but with that little
attention to detail, it's not much of a stretch to imagine there were
probably plenty of security holes there.
An APT can certainly MITM update checks. We've already seen it happen with
Windows Update, and it's likely most IoT devices use a far less secure
update mechanism. SSL at best, probably with a default set of trusted
certificates. No bank robbery attack even needed; just find one of the
dumber CAs and convince them to issue you a certificate. Then it's just a
DNS spoofing problem.

The "long tail" of old versions of Android in the wild is indeed a HUGE
problem. Kind of ironic given the amount of effort Google puts into finding
and fixing bugs in Android. What good is a bug fix if the fix never gets
applied on devices in the wild? This is one reason I typically stick to
Nexus devices, even though they tend to be pretty mediocre overall. Google
should tell vendors that they can't call their phone an "Android phone"
unless they get updates out in a timely manner. Or maybe we already do that.
Brillo is the IoT version of Android. I *think* it has some kind of
requirement around sending out updates, or it just updates the Android core
separately. At any rate, my impression was that it aims to try to avoid a
repeat of the low-end smartphone situation.
Note that IOS is no counterexample unless you really want all comsumer

Assuming you're trying to build a large, effective organization, how do
you do it without some level of internal competition? I've worked for some
relatively touchy-feely companies (*cough* Linden Lab) that prided
themselves on being "flat", but eventually I realized they were just
keeping all the politics quiet and subtle. Meanwhile, people worked on
"fun" stuff and added neat but unimportant features to Second Life while
neglecting its stability and maintainability, with the ultimate result that
instead of trying to improve it, New Improved Corporate Linden Lab has
decided (probably correctly) to do a complete rewrite in the form of

Making things worse is easy. Making them worse in such a way that they
eventually get better is harder.
Sorry. That's what happens when I try to write out a complicated thought
without going back and reediting multiple times. What I mean is that having
enough people eventually decide that "anything is better than this" serves
as a useful check on those in power. Can't make things too bad or people
band together to bring it down without regard to what follows. No different
from an election where a bunch of people vote for "the other guy" even
though the other guy is totally unqualified, just because they're so
dissatisfied with you, and your own supporters stay home.
Yes. And Brave New World. We're basically in the world depicted by Huxley
already. The thing that struck me most about Brave New World is that none
of the Powers That Be worried about bringing an outsider into the world --
because it was stable! People for the most part liked things the way they
were. That scares me a hell of a lot more than 1984.
I believe the system will bring itself down because the financial system of
the "developed world" is a house of cards. There are hungrier nations that
are far less vulnerable to the "seizing up" the system will experience when
people stop trusting the prices in the market. In order for people to
transact in the marketplace, they have to trust that the prices in the
marketplace are at least somewhat reflective of value. This is why you saw
banks sitting on repossessed houses or holding off on foreclosing on
non-performing mortgages; they believed the government would intervene to
raise prices, so they were waiting for a better deal. But things have only
gotten worse since 2008, and every subsequent intervention will only become
more costly and create ever more perverse incentives.

Well, I meant that I do not support the status quo in the sense of helping
resist any change regardless of the direction. I would only resist change
toward something I felt was worse. And try to help bring about change
toward something I think would be better.
I agree with that. I've been intentionally vague about what "worse" or
"better" means, because frankly I don't really know.
I only meant in the sense that the incumbent usually sees it as a bad thing
when they are thrown out. And it applies to everything, not just democracy.
Even in an absolute dictatorship, it's generally cheaper to control a
population that's reasonably happy than one that's angry.
I think Huxley showed pretty effectively that surveillance is unnecessary
for creating a totalitarian society. In fact, too much of it can rob the
government of the appearance of legitimacy. "Why do you need to spy on your
own citizens?" The US mainly gets away with it in the name of terrorism and
the drug war, and that only goes so far. People will not support
surveillance to enforce laws they don't agree with. Instead, we get
propaganda, bread, and circuses courtesy of capitalism or mercantilism or
whatever you want to call it. The "independent" media still want to get
called on in white house press conferences and invited to embed journalists
with military units. The film industry gets heavy subsidies from various
governments in order to film there, so naturally they're not going to
release anything that embarrasses the government. Just watch the end
credits of a movie sometime and notice how many government entities they
I suspect the surveillance is really about maintaining sufficient fear
among would-be whistleblowers so they don't do things that result in
inconvenient rearrangements of the deck chairs on the Titanic. It's also
about money and keeping the law enforcement/prison industrial complex
well-fed. But I don't think it's about trying to maintain total control as
depicted in 1984. Even without it the system would be doing just fine.
Heck, it *was* doing just fine before mass surveillance was practical.
We'll see how stable it ends up being in reality. Despite the amount of
power the US exercises, it's still possible to escape, particularly for
individuals who aren't already on the government's radar.
True, but it might make it so the US won't be able to spend more money on
its military than the rest of the world combined.
I don't think it says much to have the stock market going up when interest
rates are close to zero or even negative depending on how you look at it.
When there's no money to be made on low-risk investments, naturally
investors are going to invest more in higher risk stuff like stocks. And
whenever the market is going up, the idiot "momentum investors" come out in
force, betting that stocks will do the same thing tomorrow that they did
today. Which causes the stock market to have momentum because people
believe it has momentum, even though there's no other reason for that to be
the case. So you can always assume it will overshoot, and history has shown
it can overshoot by arbitrary amounts and for arbitrary periods of time.
If you haven't watched "The Big Short" I highly recommend it. The huge
amount of time it took between when pretty much everyone knew the housing
market was fucked and when the mortgage-backed securities actually fell in
price is a really good demonstration of how disconnected the financial
markets can be from reality. Pretty much all paper wealth has this problem.
Or you could just watch Wile E Coyote run off cliffs in Road Runner
cartoons. But if he were the stock market he could run halfway to orbit
before realizing he wasn't standing on anything.

This doesn't mean that I object to the current patent system.  In her book
I think she was wrong about it. And even if you support patents generally,
they are heavily abused in their current form and in at least some
industries it's not at all clear whether they are a net benefit. There are
other funding models for research that don't require granting a temporary
monopoly to whoever happens to write down an idea and pay the fee first.
Appeals to authority are perfectly fine in informal discussions. And I can
imagine, at least fuzzily, intellectual property systems that don't rely on
an organization with a monopoly on violence. I suspect that in trying to
set one up the market would demonstrate that it's more expensive than it's
worth, though.
Let me propose an outline of a solution which could square the circle:  At
 Other manufacturers may make products that are made
The voluntary systems I imagine work similarly, though mostly focused
around whether or not one has recourse in particular private court systems.
I am hard pressed to think of any previous system where people all agreed
not to sell that didn't require violence or eventually break down. OPEC has
only worked because it's an extraction industry and its members have mostly
been dictatorships where the dictator or their descendant would likely be
in charge when the oil finally runs out. And it's starting to break down as
Iran starts thinking about being more democratic.
I agree with the last sentence, but a temporary monopoly granted by the
government is not the only way to reward inventors, and people are
constantly inventing things which can easily be copied, which I think goes
to show that you don't have to do *anything* to ensure that inventors are
I think patents may have made more sense when it was much harder for
individuals and small groups to get funding to develop an idea, and the
only people with the resources to develop them were the guilds and
state-sponsored corporations like the East India Company. Patents were a
way to protect the "little guy." Now it's much easier to get your hands on
funding than it was then, whether it's a small business loan, SBIR, venture
or angel capital, or crowdfunding. It makes the "first mover advantage"
much more significant when you can move as fast or even faster than a large
company that has the same idea, and those larger organizations tend to be
risk-averse anyway.
It's quite possible I'm biased from working in Silicon Valley, where most
patents get applied for not for protection from having your idea "stolen,"
but for protection from other patentholders. Or because they're seen as
valuable by potential investors/buyers, but that mostly matters before you
have a customer base and infrastructure.

Badly formatted paste follows:
*Holy Crap: Wells Fargo Has To Fire 5,300 Employees For *
by Mike Masnick / Sep 9, 2016
This story is crazy. Late yesterday it was revealed that banking giant
Wells Fargo had to fire 5,300 employees over a massive
which those employees created over 2 million fake accounts to stuff with
fees in order to meet their quarterly numbers. The Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau also fined the company $185 million
million to the CFPB, $35 million to the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency and another $50 million to Los Angeles). Oh and it needs to pay
back around $5 million to the customers it screwed over. The CFPB provides
some crazy details:
*Opening deposit accounts and transferring funds without
authorization:* *According
to the bank’s own analysis, employees opened roughly 1.5 million deposit
accounts that may not have been authorized by consumers. Employees then
transferred funds from consumers’ authorized accounts to temporarily fund
the new, unauthorized accounts. This widespread practice gave the employees
credit for opening the new accounts, allowing them to earn additional
compensation and to meet the bank’s sales goals. Consumers, in turn, were
sometimes **harmed** because the bank charged them for **insufficient**
funds or overdraft fees because the money was not in their original
*Applying for credit card accounts without authorization: **According to
the bank’s own analysis, Wells Fargo employees applied for roughly 565,000
credit card accounts that may not have been authorized by consumers. On
those unauthorized credit cards, many consumers incurred annual fees, as
well as associated finance or interest charges and other fees.*
*Issuing and activating debit cards without authorization:* *Wells Fargo
employees requested and issued debit cards without consumers’ knowledge or
consent, going so far as to create PINs without telling consumers.*
*Creating phony email addresses to enroll consumers in online-banking
services:* *Wells Fargo employees created phony email addresses not
belonging to consumers to enroll them in online-banking services without
their knowledge or consent.*
*The thing is, if 5,300 employees were a part of this, this was not some
random **scam**. This was a bank-approved plan to goose their numbers. It
seems like among the 5,300 employees, management should be in serious *
*trouble** as well. What's really astounding about all of this is that it
took this long for the practice to come to light. As the **CFPB** notes,
end users were impacted by this, and you'd think that **complaints** would
have made it clear that this was a problem much sooner. Or is that people
are just so used to getting screwed by their bank that they let it slide?
The CNN report notes that Los Angeles had sued Wells Fargo over this
practice last year (hence LA being a part of the settlement fines), but
having such a widespread **scam** going on is somewhat astounding. *
*And, of course, it raises questions about what other banks are doing
similar things as well. We've seen this kind of activity in the telco space
at times **with**cramming
but that was generally third party scammers, where the **telcos** just
looked the other way. This was full-time Wells Fargo employees doing the *
*scam** itself, and the bank apparently either encouraging it or just
looking the other way from upper management.*

Having used both Gmail and SpamAssassin for filtering mail to this address,
which I've had since 1996, I've found SpamAssassin to be vastly superior in
terms of false positives. Gmail doesn't seem to be that much better in
terms of false negatives even. Pretty disappointing.
I used to have a filter that prevented Gmail from marking cpunks mail as
spam, but I have intentionally avoided fixing that since the list address
changed in hopes of training it not to suck so bad. So far I don't seem to
have had much luck.
One thing I did notice is that by default when you block a sender on Gmail
it sends their messages to the spam folder instead of deleting them, which
could mean its training the spam filter on them as well. If a lot of people
do that, it could cause the spam filter to think other cpunks messages are
also spam instead of just, say, Cypher Piggie's.
The solution for me is going to be to stop using Gmail once I find the time
to set up my scandalous basement server. The easier solution is just to set
up a filter with "never mark as spam" as someone else suggested whom I
would credit by name were I not typing this on my phone in the bathroom.

here recently. The end user was expected to run a spam filter against the

Well, the "retards" probably aren't going to care much about a few mailing
list messages being sent to their spam folder erroneously. I can't say I've
actually cared about any of the messages that got sent to spam, I'm just
pedantic about such things. Today, though, the only "false positive" was

where would-be whistleblowers don't at least strongly suspect is connected

@_subject: Even spookier entangled particles. 
I'm by no means an expert in quantum physics, which makes my lack of
surprise at this fairly uninteresting, but it seems to me these results are
completely compatible with the time-symmetric interpretation of quantum
mechanics. If I understand it correctly, according to TSQM the particle
already "knows" about its future interactions to the extent that quantum
information is preserved through any intervening interactions. So in the
case of photon-splitting, the photons leave their source with polarizations
that are aligned with (or opposite) the axis on which they will be
measured. You could say the information "propagates" in both temporal
directions, but I think it makes more sense to think of the particle's
entire timeline as a single entity.
According to the papers I've read on TSQM, it makes (or made) no
predictions that are different from the Copenhagen interpretation. This
experiment seems like it may be the first to show a difference. Not
necessarily because of any predictions, but because of the additional
mental contortions required to hang on to the Copenhagen interpretation.
There's still no ability to send "real" information faster than light or
backward in time, though. I say this only because of the purported
equivalence between TSQM and Copenhagen, not because I have any idea why it
should be the case. Intuitively, it seems like it could be related to the
(quantum) information-theoretic version of entropy that you get with
reversible computations. Or maybe even just real entropy, since TSQM still
"behaves" as if it's nondeterministic from our perspective, since we can
never know enough about a system to know its "true" internal state. So
somehow everything conspires to prevent us from setting up a system that
would carry some piece of information back in time that we care about.
I guess another way to look at it is that the universe is a solution to
some kind of differential equation. Possible solutions that contain
paradoxes aren't valid, so they don't happen. Not via some shift in some
"unified" timeline ala Star Trek, but through colossal numbers of tiny
shifts that disperse any information that we're trying to send back in time
that would cause any kind of paradox at any scale. The result is a universe
that appears to have an arrow of time at any scale we can actually measure,
appears to mostly follow General Relativity, etc. Until you get to scales,
large and small, where the exact underlying geometry starts to matter.
Come to think of it, if paradoxes are what's important, the ability to send
information back in your own timeline (i.e. within your own past light
cone) is all that matters. If there is no privileged reference frame, this
also means you can't send information into spacelike regions of your own
light cone, because if two entities do that then you can arrange things to
send information into your own past light cone. But if there IS a
privileged reference frame, say, the reference frame of the CMB, where you
can't send information into *its* past light cone, then you can send
information faster than light but still not into your own past. Recall that
the Lorentz transformations were initially introduced to (successfully)
explain how light could appear to always be moving the same speed even with
a luminiferous ether, but then Einstein discarded the luminiferous ether
because he realized it wasn't necessary, not because there was any evidence
that contradicted it.
I may well be misinterpreting what TSQM says, so please don't discard it on
the basis of my uninformed interpretation! Go read up on it and THEN
discard it ;-)

Morally, in my view, one can never be a traitor to the State, because to
betray the State, you have to have entered into some agreement with the
State voluntarily, i.e. not under duress. The State is force and violence
incarnate, therefore no truly voluntary agreement with it can exist. If
anything, it is those who act as an instrument of the State who are
traitors against the people they dominate. Which means Trump and Clinton

So what you're saying is that, if you get mugged on the street and the
mugger has a gun to your head, then any attempt to resist the mugger means
you are suicidal, and anyone who tries to help you is dead set on your
destruction? Great logic, there.
One could just as easily turn this around and say that Putin is dead set on
Ukraine's destruction because he won't allow the Ukrainians to determine
their own destiny. Even if you were to assume that all his lies about not
sending in Russian troops and equipment (almost certainly engineered to be
precisely accurate under a very narrow definition of same and only if you
squint in the right way) were true, he is certainly encouraging the Russian
thugs living there to engage in as much violence as possible.
No, this is Putin's baby. He's set it up so that if he can't have Ukraine,
nobody will. And the poor Ukrainians are caught in the middle, just as they
always have been because of their unfortunate geographic situation next to
a violent, ultranationalist neighbor. Violent and ultranationalist
according to Zenaan himself, by the way, who just told us that Putin is the
most moderate person the Russians could have elected.
The US is helping Ukraine because the UKRAINIANS HAVE ASKED FOR HELP. If
the situation is truly as you claim it is, then why isn't it just "better
to die on our feet than live on our knees?" Perhaps the Ukrainians are
simply tired of living in Russia's shadow and are terrified of the
strongman the Russians have elected?
As you know, I'm no fan of US foreign policy, but Russia is no better. As
far as I can tell, you only like them because you hate the US so much, and
the Russians are the only reasonable counterbalance you can think of. I
totally agree with you on the need to return to a multi-polar world, just

The solution in both cases, by the way, is TRADE. When goods cross borders
in sufficient quantities, ICBMs won't. But the Russians seem to want the US

This, by the way, is why our legislation is so complex. You cannot tell the

The US is not innocent here, but attempting to play Russia off as "the good

that they're not the US and can form a counterbalance. Which is not exactly

My main objection is that Brin is basically throwing up his hands with
respect to any kind of pushback against surveillance, saying it's
inevitable. I'm not just assuming this from what he's written there,
either; he's commented on my Facebook threads about surveillance by
actually saying we should ignore that stuff and focus on his sousveillance
instead. Though he seems to do a lot of self-promotion on Facebook
generally, so perhaps he's just overdoing it.
But it's not actually true that surveillance is a "done deal" or that we
have no control over the form it takes. We don't have to allow the State to
contract out to private companies for red light cameras and ALPRs and then
let them sell the data to whomever they want. We can force the
implementation of retention & sharing policies. What you don't have can't
be exfiltrated or abused. We may not be able to prevent its being collected
in the first place, but we can sure as hell stop the construction of the
databases, at least where we know about them. And we'll never know about
them if we don't keep paying attention.
The problem is that Brin seems to view this as a fight against the
technology. But it's really a fight against blindly deploying technology
with no thought as to how it's used. We may not be able to stop
surveillance, but there are lots of different ways to bring it into the
light and regulate it where it's deployed by government, and citizen
sousveillance is only a small part of that.

I don't disagree with this, but I will say that I think there are other
equally valid interpretations that don't involve words like "annex", which
I think applies far more to Russia with Crimea than it does to the US
w.r.t. the rest of Ukraine. On the other hand, the main innovation of the
US flavor of imperialism is the more subtle/opaque means by which it
achieves its ends, thus ensuring that one can easily interpret it as not
imperialism. Not that the Russians are above subterfuge; they're just not
in a position to as easily use it in this situation.
This is by no means unique or even more prevalent in the United States than
elsewhere. The way for any government to retain its power is by convincing
a large enough segment of the population that it's better off than it would

It's a good question. So far it's been low-hanging fruit: devices people
have intentionally or unintentionally opened to the Internet in order to
make use of them. In this case, webcams, which people open to the Internet
in order to be able to watch their dogs/fish/stepdaughter from the office.
People think their IP is unguessable, or that because there's a password,
it's "secure" even though it's the same password everyone else uses. I
don't know what the vulnerability is in this case, but IoT vulnerabilities
have often been generic vulnerabilities in a widely used piece of open
source software.
Of course, IoT devices (really, any consumer device, versus application
software) are "special" in that the code is often written by outside
contracting houses and security just isn't on the list of requirements. I
recall seeing right in the HTML of a bunch of different consumer wireless
routers a comment saying "Reference code. Do not use in production." It's
quite possible the code HAD been fixed and the Chinese developers just
hadn't realized they should strip out the comment, but with that little
attention to detail, it's not much of a stretch to imagine there were
probably plenty of security holes there.
An APT can certainly MITM update checks. We've already seen it happen with
Windows Update, and it's likely most IoT devices use a far less secure
update mechanism. SSL at best, probably with a default set of trusted
certificates. No bank robbery attack even needed; just find one of the
dumber CAs and convince them to issue you a certificate. Then it's just a
