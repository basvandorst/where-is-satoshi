why the fuck are you still here then? :)
do you wake up first thing in the morning, struggling to breathe due to the effects of the attacks on your freedom?
are you hoping to find some way forward from the fucking fucked up state we're in and have been for years?
looking to this list in the hope that a revolutionary will step forward and lead you to the freedom you desire?
being constantly dissappointed by the mostly ordinary people on the list who are looking for the same in a nice safe way that doesn't threaten their comfortable life?
shi, ain't it lol
Wouldn't it be nice if anyone on here actually believed we were making a difference and actually were capable of making a difference?
