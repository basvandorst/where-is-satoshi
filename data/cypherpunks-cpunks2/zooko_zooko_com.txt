@_subject: how to use Tor securely (Re: Silk Road founder arrested ...) 
Thanks for mentioning Tahoe-LAFS, Adam. I think combining Tahoe-LAFS with Tor
is a good idea. It is already almost there. It is usable, but it doesn't
yet protect your anonymity correctly. There is a recent burst of work to
improve usability, security, and performance, and we need help.
Also, below, I'll talk about the different, but complementary idea of
"decentralized web apps" (i.e. Javascript apps hosted on Tahoe-LAFS).
But before we get into decentralized web apps, here's the status of
Tahoe-LAFS+Tor: it is currently working, by using a socks proxy that routes
through Tor and configuring your Tahoe-LAFS instance to use it.  Here are some
open issue tickets about tweaks to the Tahoe-LAFS software or documentation
which are needed:
 use only 127.0.0.1 as local address
 Improve docs about Tahoe-LAFS+Tor
 make tahoe Tor- and I2P-friendly
Note that some of these tickets refer to I2P, which is another re-routing
network sort of like Tor, but the ones I mentioned above are just as applicable
to Tor as to I2P. The tickets mention I2P because I2P developers, in addition
to Tor developers, are contributing bug reports and patches.
There is a recent move to a better approach which doesn't require the user to
configure a socks proxy. That approach is to switch Tahoe-LAFS to using a new
network abstraction provided by the "Twisted" library which Tahoe-LAFS uses.
That abstraction is named "Endpoints". The idea is to switch Tahoe-LAFS from
IPv4 to "Endpoints", and then implement Tor and I2P routing as implementations
of the "Endpoints" abstraction. This approach would also probably work with a
cjdns transport, too. (Also it would help Tahoe-LAFS work over IPv6.)
This approach would also allow other Twisted-based applications (besides
Tahoe-LAFS) to use those interesting new transport layers.
We could use help! If you know Python, please do code-review of these patches:
 switch to using Endpoints
How to review patches:
By the way, we LAFS hackers are well aware that anonymity is very hard. In
fact, low-latency anonymity against a modern "global surveillance" threat model
may be impossible. But even the anonymity properties that *are* possible, and
the ones that are currently provided by Tor, might get ruined by some mistake
that Tahoe-LAFS makes, so I wouldn't rely on the Tahoe-LAFS+Tor for anonymity
until it has had a lot more study and testing. (Which we need help with!)
I don't quite follow this sentence. You can write code that uses Tahoe-LAFS
from Javascript if you want. I think that is a *great* idea, and I think that
it is inevitable that in the future "decentralized web apps" will be written in
either Javascript + LAFS, or else Javascript + some-other-decentralized-
However, if you are not ready to accept the inevitable and start running
Javascript in your web browser, you can also poke at Tahoe-LAFS from plain old
HTML forms, or use Tahoe-LAFS from code (written in any programming language)
running on your local machine.
Here's a live demo of a "decentralized web app" in which all storage in an
encrypted, decentralized, fault-tolerant storage network, and all computation
is in the client -- in fact in the web browser. The demo is my blog:
That link gives you read-only access to my blog. If you interact with it, for
example by clicking on "Tags" or using the search box, then you're interacting
with Javascript running in your web browser. When *I* interact with it (I have
read-write access to my blog), for example by creating new entries or editing
existing entries, then I too am interacting Javascript running in my browser.
There is no server anywhere that has code for the functionality of my blog. All
code that implements functionalit is in the client. The storage server does
nothing but store ciphertext to which it doesn't have the decryption key.
Now, there's a subtlety here that will probably confuse some people. To be
truly *decentralized*, the URL you put into your browser has to start with
" rather than with "
right? So when you look at the URL above, you aren't actually *using* a
decentralized web app, you're looking at a demo of a decentralized web app.
To put it another way, when *I* use  I'm using a
decentralized web app, because I control my own node in the network. When I
allow *you* to use  then you are not controlling your own
node in the network -- you are relying on me and on my node.
But if you install Tahoe-LAFS yourself and connect to the Public Test Grid,
then you can join us in playing with true decentralized web apps. :-)
Start with the newest version of TiddlyWiki, which comes with a Tahoe-LAFS
(The demo above -- my blog -- is a much older and more kludgey combination of
TiddlyWiki and Tahoe-LAFS.)
