It's TempleOS for you:
- - TempleOS is a free, public domain, open source, x86_64,
non-preemptive multi-tasking, multi-cored, ring-0-only,
single-address-map (identity-mapped), non-networked, PC operating
TempleOS is simpler than Linux and you can have hours of fun tinkering
because all memory and ports are accessible.  Memory is
identity-mapped at all times, so you can modify any task's memory from
any other task.  You can access all disk blocks, too.  I had a blast
using a C64 disk block editor to modify directories to un-delete
files, when I was a kid.  Maybe, you want to play with a raw-block
database, or make your own file system?""

RiseUp is in Seattle, Tor is in Seattle, and both are CIA/Mossad
properties.   I wonder what's going on in Seattle ?

A gnu site that need JS to function.  Gnu are a fucking faggot.  And
so is mirimir for thinking it's "cool".
Theft, snitching, and now shilling...
rayzer-war,juan+honesty,jamesdonald-degeneracy are the only moral
sentiments remaining this list.
